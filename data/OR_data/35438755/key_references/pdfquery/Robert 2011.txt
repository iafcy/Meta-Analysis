Background 
Ipilimumab monotherapy (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight), as com- 
pared with glycoprotein 100, improved overall survival in a phase 3 study involving 
patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. We conducted a phase 3 study 
of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in patients with previously 
untreated metastatic melanoma. 
Methods 
We randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma, 
in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) plus 
placebo, given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks 
through week 22. Patients with stable disease or an objective response and no dose- 
limiting toxic effects received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as 
maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival. 
Results 
Overall survival was significantly longer in the group receiving ipilimumab plus da- 
carbazine than in the group receiving dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 
months, with higher survival rates in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group at 1 year 
(47.3% vs. 36.3%), 2 years (28.5% vs. 17.9%), and 3 years (20.8% vs. 12.2%) (hazard 
ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3% of 
patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5% treated 
with dacarbazine and placebo (P<0.001). No drug-related deaths or gastrointestinal 
perforations occurred in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group. 
Conclusions 
Ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram) in combination with dacarbazine, as 
compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, improved overall survival in patients with 
previously untreated metastatic melanoma. The types of adverse events were con- 
sistent with those seen in prior studies of ipilimumab; however, the rates of elevat- 
ed liver-function values were higher and the rates of gastrointestinal events were 
lower than expected on the basis of prior studies. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb;

metastatic melanoma is low, with an ex- 
pected 2-year survival rate of 10 to 20%.1-3 
Although dacarbazine has never been shown to 
improve survival in randomized, controlled stud- 
ies, it has been the drug most frequently com- 
pared with new agents or combination therapies 
in randomized trials involving patients with mel- 
anoma.4,5 High-dose interleukin-2 is associated 
with durable, complete responses, with a survival 
benefit, in a small subgroup of patients with 
metastatic melanoma.6,7 Ipilimumab, a fully hu- 
man, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, blocks cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a 
negative regulator of T cells, and thereby augments 
T-cell activation and proliferation.8-12 
Two separate phase 2 studies support the ratio- 
nale for the current study. The first phase 2 study, 
involving 217 patients with previously treated 
metastatic melanoma, showed a dose-dependent 
response rate, with the highest rate of response 
seen in the group receiving ipilimumab at a dose 
of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight (11.1% in 
the group receiving 10 mg per kilogram vs. 4.2% 
and 0% in the groups receiving 3 mg per kilogram 
and 0.3 mg per kilogram, respectively; P = 0.002).13 
In the second, small, randomized, phase 2 study, 
involving 72 patients, treatment with a combina- 
tion of dacarbazine (250 mg per square meter of 
body-surface area per day for 5 days every 3 weeks) 
and ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks 
for 4 doses) was associated with durable objective 
responses, with no new adverse events; the ratio- 
nale for such combinations has been reviewed 
previously.14-16 We conducted a phase 3 study to 
determine whether ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg 
per kilogram) plus dacarbazine, as compared with 
dacarbazine and placebo, improves overall survival 
in patients with previously untreated metastatic 
melanoma. 

Patients 
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and 
had previously untreated stage III (unresectable) or 
stage IV melanoma with measurable lesions, an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per- 
formance status of 0 or 1 (with 0 indicating that 
the patient is fully active and able to carry on all 
predisease activities without restriction, and 1 in- 
dicating that the patient is restricted in physically 
strenuous activity but is ambulatory and able to 
carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, such 
as light housework or office work),17 and a life 
expectancy of 16 weeks or more. The baseline se- 
rum lactate dehydrogenase level did not affect 
eligibility. Patients were ineligible if they had re- 
ceived any prior treatment for metastatic disease. 
Patients who received prior adjuvant therapy were 
not excluded. Concomitant treatment with immu- 
nosuppressive agents or long-term use of systemic 
glucocorticoids (except for the management of ad- 
verse events during the course of the study) was 
not allowed. Patients were also ineligible if they 
had evidence of brain metastasis (as confirmed on 
imaging), primary ocular or mucosal melanoma, 
or autoimmune disease. 
Study Oversight 
The protocol was approved by the appropriate in- 
stitutional review boards or independent ethics 
committees. The study was conducted in accor- 
dance with the ethical principles originating from 
the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clini- 
cal Practice as defined by the International Confer- 
ence on Harmonization. All participating patients 
gave written informed consent. 
The trial was designed jointly by the senior 
academic authors and the sponsor, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb. Data were collected by the sponsor and 
analyzed in collaboration with the senior academic 
authors, who vouch for the completeness and ac- 
curacy of the data and analyses. An initial draft 
of the manuscript was prepared jointly by a writ- 
ing committee that included five academic authors, 
the sponsor, and a professional medical writer em- 
ployed by the sponsor. All the authors contrib- 
uted to subsequent drafts and made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. All the 
authors signed a confidentiality disclosure agree- 
ment with the sponsor. The protocol, including the 
statistical analysis plan, is available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org. 
Study Design and Treatment 
In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, 
phase 3 study, patients (stratified according to me- 
tastasis stage, study site, and ECOG performance 
status) were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 
receive either ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per 
kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square 
meter) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) 
plus placebo at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by 
dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks through week 22 
(induction phase). Treatment was discontinued if 







toxic effects associated with the drug or progressive 
disease was noted during weeks 12 to 24. At week 
24, patients with stable disease or an objective re- 
sponse during the induction phase who did not 
have a dose-limiting adverse event were eligible to 
enter a maintenance phase in which they received 
placebo or ipilimumab every 12 weeks until pro- 
gression of the disease, development of toxic ef- 
fects, or the end of the study. 
In the initial design of the study, 500 patients 
were to undergo randomization, and progression- 
free survival was to be the primary end point. 
Emerging data from other ipilimumab trials sug- 
gested that conventional definitions of disease 
progression and response incompletely reflect 
overall survival among patients who appear to 
have a long-term benefit,18,19 and in an amend- 
ment approved by the Food and Drug Adminis- 
tration on October 9, 2008, the primary end point 
was changed from progression-free survival to 
overall survival before the treatment assignments 
were revealed. No change in the size of the study 
was required, since it was already fully powered 
to assess overall survival. No interim analysis was 
conducted. Secondary end points included progres- 
sion-free survival, the rate of best overall response 
(defined as the proportion of all randomly as- 
signed patients who had a complete or partial re- 
sponse), the rate of disease control (defined as a 
complete response, a partial response, or stable 
disease), the time to a response, the duration of 
the response, and safety. Responses were defined 
according to the modified World Health Organi- 
zation criteria as the sum of the products of bi- 
dimensional measurements of target lesions; a 
complete response is defined by the disappearance 
of all known lesions, a partial response by a de- 
crease of at least 50% from baseline in the sum 
of the products of the diameters of index lesions, 
stable disease by failure to meet the criteria for 
either partial response or progressive disease, and 
progressive disease by a 25% increase in an ex- 
isting lesion or the development of a new lesion. 
Tumor assessments were performed by the local 
investigator and by a central independent review 
committee. 
Assessments 
Radiologic and photographic tumor assessments 
were performed in all patients at baseline and at 
week 12, and in patients in whom the disease 
had not progressed, at weeks 16, 20, and 24 and 
every 6 weeks through week 48. For patients in 
whom the disease had not progressed and who 
remained in the study beyond week 48, tumor as- 
sessments were performed every 12 weeks. Pa- 
tients with progressive disease who entered the 
follow-up phase were recommended to receive two 
additional tumor assessments as part of the stan- 
dard of care. All efficacy end points (except sur- 
vival) were based on assessments performed by 
the independent review committee, whose mem- 
bers were not aware of the treatment assignments. 
Adverse events were graded with the use of the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (http://ctep 
.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_ 
applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Adverse events were 
reported from the date of the first dose up to and 
including 70 days after the final dose. The study 
included two additional safety analyses. One was 
an analysis of immune-related adverse events (de- 
scribed previously12), which were defined as ad- 
verse events that were, according to the judgment 
of the investigator, associated with inflammation. 
The list of potential inflammation-associated 
adverse events was defined prospectively, in the 
protocol, before the database was locked. The 
other additional safety analysis was an explor- 
atory analysis performed to determine whether 
specific adverse events were likely to be immune- 
mediated and associated with ipilimumab treat- 
ment. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, identi- 
fied through retrospective review of the data, were 
adjudicated by a physician employed by the spon- 
sor, in order to exclude noninflammatory causes 
of the event, such as infection or tumor progres- 
sion. The immune-mediated adverse reactions in- 
cluded specific events of clinical interest, such as 
enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies, 
or endocrinopathies, including hypophysitis. 
Statistical Analysis 
All analyses of efficacy were performed as pre- 
specified in the protocol except for the 3-year sur- 
vival rate, which was analyzed post hoc. The target 
number of events for the primary analysis was 416 
deaths, which we estimated would give the study 
approximately 90% power to detect a 37% increase 
in median overall survival to 11 months with ipi- 
limumab plus dacarbazine, with a corresponding 
hazard ratio for death of 0.727, assuming a total 
sample of 500 patients (250 randomly assigned 
to each group) and a median survival of 8 months 
for the patients receiving dacarbazine plus pla- 
cebo. For the analysis of overall survival, a log- 







rank test was performed, at a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.05, stratified according to metastasis 
stage (M0, M1a, M1b, or M1c) and ECOG perfor- 
mance status (0 or 1), as classified at the time of 
randomization. The final analysis of progression- 
free survival was conducted on a database that was 
locked after 416 events had been documented, as 
originally planned. The hazard ratios for overall 
survival and progression-free survival with ipili- 
mumab plus dacarbazine as compared with da- 
carbazine plus placebo, and the associated two- 
sided 95% confidence intervals, were estimated 
with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-haz- 
ards model. Survival functions were estimated with 
the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. A hierar- 
chical testing procedure was implemented for a 
comparison of the treatment groups in the order 
of the following end points: overall survival, pro- 
gression-free survival, rate of disease control, 
and rate of best overall response. Additional details 
of the methods are provided in the Supplemen- 
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. 

Patients and Treatment 
Between August 8, 2006, and January 22, 2008, a 
total of 250 patients were randomly assigned to 
receive ipilimumab plus dacarbazine (ipilimumab– 
dacarbazine group) and 252 were randomly as- 
signed to receive dacarbazine plus placebo (da- 
carbazine group). The baseline characteristics 
of the patients were balanced between the two 
groups (Table 1). A total of 92 patients in the ipi- 
limumab–dacarbazine group (36.8%) and 165 pa- 
tients in the dacarbazine group (65.5%) received 
all four doses of ipilimumab or placebo. At least 
one maintenance dose was administered in 43 pa- 
tients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group (17.2%) 
and 53 in the dacarbazine group (21.0%). The 
follow-up time between the start of the study (the 
first visit of the first enrolled patient) and the end 
of the study (the last visit of the last enrolled pa- 
tient) was 54 months, and the follow-up time be- 
tween the time the last patient underwent random- 
ization (the first visit of the last patient) and the 
end of the study was 36.6 months. 
The most frequent reason for discontinuation 
of the study drug across the entire study was 
disease progression (in 46.2% of patients in the 
ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 77.3% in the 
dacarbazine group). Discontinuation due to a 
drug-related adverse event was reported in 89 of 
the 247 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine 
group who received at least one dose of the study 
drug (36.0%) and 10 of the 251 patients in the 
dacarbazine group who received at least one dose 
of the study drug (4.0%): 85 of the 247 patients 
(34.4%) and 10 of the 251 patients (4.0%) in the 
two groups, respectively, discontinued the study 
drug because of a drug-related adverse event after 
receiving treatment in the induction phase; 4 of 
the 43 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine 
group who received at least one maintenance dose 
(9.3%) and none of the 53 patients in the dacar- 
bazine group who received at least one mainte- 
nance dose discontinued the therapy after receiv- 
ing treatment in the maintenance phase. 
Therapy after disease progression was balanced 
between the two groups; 54.7% of the patients in 
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 59.0% in 
the dacarbazine group received subsequent thera- 
py. In the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, 37.7% of 
the patients received chemotherapy, and 2% im- 
munotherapy; in the dacarbazine group, 34.7% 
received chemotherapy, and 2% immunotherapy. 
One patient in the dacarbazine group received the 
BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, at the time of dis- 
ease progression, but tumors were not routinely 
assessed for the presence of the BRAF V600E 
mutation. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the inten- 
tion-to-treat population. A survival analysis was 
performed after 414 deaths occurred, 37 months 
after the last patient was enrolled. The median 
overall survival in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine 
group was 11.2 months (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 9.4 to 13.6), as compared with 9.1 months 
(95% CI, 7.8 to 10.5) in the dacarbazine group, with 
estimated survival rates in the two groups, respec- 
tively, of 47.3% and 36.3% at 1 year, 28.5% and 
17.9% at 2 years, and 20.8% and 12.2% at 3 years 
(hazard ratio for death with ipilimumab–dacarba- 
zine, 0.72; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). Ipilimumab was 
associated with improved overall survival across 
patient subgroups, including those defined accord- 
ing to age, sex, ECOG performance status, baseline 
serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and substage 
of metastatic disease (Fig. 2). 
There was a 24% reduction in the risk of pro- 
gression in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group as 
compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ra- 
tio for progression, 0.76; P = 0.006). The median 
values for progression-free survival were similar 







in the two groups because the first assessment 
of progression occurred at week 12 after the true 
median. After the first tumor assessment, the 
Kaplan–Meier curves separated (Fig. 1B). 
The rate of disease control (i.e., a complete or 
partial response or stable disease) did not differ 
significantly between the two groups: 33.2% in the 
ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 30.2% in the 
dacarbazine group (P = 0.41). The rate of best over- 
all response (i.e., a complete or partial response) 
was 15.2% in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group 
and 10.3% in the dacarbazine group (P = 0.09) 
(Table 2). The median duration of response among 
all randomly assigned patients with a complete 
or partial response was 19.3 months (95% CI, 
12.1 to 26.1) in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group 
and 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.19 to 19.8) in the da- 
carbazine group (P = 0.03) (Fig. 1C). Some patients 
in the study who were receiving ipilimumab had 
an improvement from partial response to complete 
response after 6 months (data not shown). Re- 
sponses in the presence of new lesions were also 
observed, although these were not captured as part 
of the best overall response. 
Safety 
The safety analysis included all patients who un- 
derwent randomization and received at least one 
dose of the assigned study drug (498 patients). 
The adverse events reported in the safety popula- 
tion are listed in Table 3. Adverse events (all 
grades) for which there was a higher incidence in 
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group than in the 
dacarbazine group included elevation of alanine 
aminotransferase levels (in 33.2% of patients vs. 
5.6%), elevation of aspartate aminotransferase lev- 
els (29.1% vs. 5.6%), diarrhea (36.4% vs. 24.7%), 
pruritus (29.6% vs. 8.8%), and rash (24.7% vs. 
6.8%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 
56.3% of patients receiving ipilimumab plus da- 
carbazine and in 27.5% of patients receiving pla- 
cebo plus dacarbazine (P<0.001). 
No gastrointestinal perforations were reported. 
No cases of hypophysitis were noted in the ipilimu- 
mab–dacarbazine group except for a single case 
in a patient receiving maintenance therapy that 
was reported on day 364 (which was outside the 
protocol-specified reporting window of <70 days 
after the last dose — a period representing 5 times 
the half-life of ipilimumab — and was therefore 
not categorized as an “on-study” event). No drug- 
related deaths were reported in the ipilimumab– 
dacarbazine group; one fatal gastrointestinal

hemorrhage was reported in the dacarbazine 
group. Nausea and vomiting (see the table in the 
Supplementary Appendix) as well as myelosup- 
pression (data not shown), which are common 
side effects of dacarbazine, were not increased in 
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group as compared 
with the dacarbazine group. 
The most common study-drug–related adverse 
events were those classified as immune-related 
adverse events, which were seen in 77.7% of the 
patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine 
and 38.2% of the patients treated with dacarbazine 
and placebo (Table 3). The most common immune- 
related adverse events in the ipilimumab–dacarba- 
zine group were elevated liver-function values, with 
grade 3 or 4 elevations in liver-function values 
noted in 17.4 to 20.7% of the patients. 
An alternative characterization of inflammatory 
events was performed in which noninflammatory 
causes of the event (e.g., tumor progression or in-

mediated enterocolitis was seen in 12 patients in 
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group (4.9%) and no 
patients in the dacarbazine group. Hepatic im- 
mune-mediated adverse reactions were generally 
reversible with treatment according to established 
guidelines specified in the research protocol. The 
proportion of patients who received glucocorti- 
coids or other immunosuppressant agents after 
the emergence of high-grade immune-mediated 
hepatitis was 80.8% (63 of 78 patients, including 
5 patients who received mycophenolate mofetil) 
in the ipilimu mab–dacarbazine group and 33.3% 
(2 of 6 patients) in the dacarbazine group. High- 
grade elevations in liver-function values were 
normalized in 67.9% of patients in the ipilim- 
umab–dacarbazine group, with a median time to 
normalization of 9.9 weeks (range, 1.0 to 56.1;

as a result of complications of immune-mediat- 
ed hepatitis or enterocolitis during the course of 
the study. 
Among the 43 patients who received ipilim- 
umab and the 53 patients who received placebo 
during the maintenance phase, the most common 
adverse events (all grades, occurring in >5% of 
patients in the ipilimumab group) were rash 
(25.6% vs. 5.7%), pruritus (16.3% vs. 3.8%), diar- 
rhea (14.0% vs. 5.7%), nausea (7.0% vs. 5.7%), 
and fatigue (9.3% vs. 3.8%). Low-grade increases 
in liver-function values were noted in 2 patients 
receiving ipilimumab during the maintenance 
phase. No high-grade elevations in liver-function 
values were noted among the patients receiving 
ipilimu mab during the maintenance phase. High- 
grade adverse events during the maintenance 
phase were infrequent; among the grade 3 or 4 
adverse events noted were colitis and diarrhea (in 
1 patient) and rash or pruritus (in 3 patients). No 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in patients 
receiving placebo during the maintenance phase. 

In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab (at a dose of 
10 mg per kilogram), in combination with dacar- 
bazine (at a dose of 850 mg per square meter), as 
compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, was as- 
sociated with a significant improvement in over- 
all survival among patients with previously un- 
treated metastatic melanoma. More than 50% of 
the patients had M1c disease (indicating the 
presence of visceral metastases, elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase levels, or both), and more than 
35% had baseline elevations in lactate dehydro- 
genase levels — both of which are associated 
with poor survival.20,21 Durable objective respons- 
es were observed (median duration of best overall 
response, 19.3 months in the ipilimumab–dacar- 
bazine group, vs. 8.1 months in the dacarbazine 
group). Prolonged survival was noted among some 
patients who were followed for up to 4 years. In 
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, an estimated 
28.5% of the patients were alive at 2 years, and an 
estimated 20.8% at 3 years, as compared with an 
estimated 17.9% and 12.2%, respectively, in the 
dacarbazine group. 
The rates of some high-grade adverse events 
in the current study differ from those in previ- 
ous phase 2 studies of ipilimumab monotherapy 
(at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram).13,22-24 The

* The safety analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of study drug (498 patients). Adverse 
events and immune-related adverse events were prospectively defined: the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 
13.0, was used for the reporting of adverse events, and a list of events prespecified in the protocol was used to capture immune-related ad- 
verse events, which were a subgroup of the reported adverse events. The categories are not mutually exclusive (i.e., one patient could have 
events in multiple categories). 
† A complete list of adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of patients is available in the Supplementary Appendix. 
‡ Terms used in the category of hepatic immune-related adverse events are MedDRA preferred terms, as listed by the investigator in case- 

events are in contrast to the results of phase 2 
studies involving 325 patients (rate of diarrhea, 
4% in this study vs. 11% in the previous studies; 
rate of colitis, 2% vs. 5%). No cases of hypophy- 
sitis were observed during the course of this 
study, whereas 2% of the patients in the previous 
studies had high-grade endocrinopathy. The rate 
of grade 3 or 4 rash was similar (1% in the cur- 
rent study and 2% in the previous studies). How- 
ever, the rates of high-grade hepatic adverse events 
in the current study were higher than those in the 
previous studies (elevated alanine aminotransfer- 
ase level, 21% vs. 8%; elevated aspartate amino- 
transferase level, 17% vs. 7%). The apparent shift 
in the rates of adverse events associated with ipi- 
limumab may be due to its combination with da- 
carbazine, which is known to cause hepatotoxic 
effects when it is used as monotherapy.25-27 The 
role of systemic glucocorticoids (which were ad- 
ministered to manage hepatic events) in the appar- 

















































































ent reduction in gastrointestinal and endocrine 
events is undefined. 
In summary, this trial showed that there was a 
significant improvement in overall survival among 
patients with previously untreated metastatic mela- 
noma who received ipilimumab plus dacarbazine 
as compared with dacarbazine plus placebo. Ad- 
verse events other than those typically seen with 
dacarbazine or ipilimumab therapy were not iden- 
tified. An increase in liver-function values is an 
important side effect that was observed more fre- 
quently than expected with the combination ther- 
apy. Other ipilimumab-associated adverse events 
(enterocolitis and endocrinopathy) were observed, 
albeit at a rate that was lower than expected. 
The key side effects of ipilimumab were managed 
through adherence to treatment according to well- 
established guidelines, including the administra- 
tion of systemic glucocorticoids or other immu- 
nosuppressant agents.
