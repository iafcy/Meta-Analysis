Purpose 
Patients with extensive-stage disease small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have poor survival outcomes 
despite ﬁrst-line chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum. This randomized, double-blind phase III 
study evaluated the efﬁcacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in 
patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. 
Patients and Methods 
Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide 
and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total 
of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab 
or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance 
every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one 
dose of blinded study therapy. 
Results 
Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemo- 
therapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was 
11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo 
(hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = .3775). Median progression-free survival was 
4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo 
(hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events 
were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with 
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with che- 
motherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related 
deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo. 
Conclusion 
Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients 
with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were 
observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in 
combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC. 

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts 
for 10% to 15% of lung cancer cases,1 is an ex- 
tremely aggressive tumor type; 70% of pa- 
tients present with extensive-stage disease (ED- 
SCLC).2,3 The current ﬁrst-line standard of care is 
platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles 
of etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin) 
in the United States and Europe4-7 and irinotecan 
plus a platinum agent in Japan.8 Despite high 
initial response rates, nearly all patients with 
ED-SCLC experience disease recurrence or rapid 
progression after ﬁrst-line chemotherapy. The 
median progression-free survival [PFS] is approxi- 
mately 2 to 3 months,9 and long-term sur- 
vival remains poor (2-year overall survival [OS] 
is , 5%).3,10 Multiple trials evaluating other

agents or the addition of a third drug have failed to show a signiﬁcant 
improvement in median OS over etoposide and platinum.3,10,11 
Thus, there is a signiﬁcant need for effective therapy. 
Several lines of evidence provide a rationale for the use of 
immunotherapy in SCLC. The high frequency of somatic muta- 
tions in SCLC,3,12 along with the presence of autoimmune para- 
neoplastic syndromes,13,14 suggests that SCLC is an immunogenic 
tumor type. Preliminary studies have shown activity of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC.15-17 
Ipilimumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal 
antibody that abrogates binding of the checkpoint protein cytotoxic 
T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) with its ligands, signiﬁcantly 
improved OS in patients with advanced melanoma in two phase III 
trials.18-20 Ipilimumab has also been evaluated in combination with 
chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies of different tumor 
types.17,19,21-23 In a phase II trial, ipilimumab administered in 
a phased regimen with carboplatin and paclitaxel signiﬁcantly 
improved immune-related PFS over carboplatin and paclitaxel alone 
and showed a numeric though not statistically signiﬁcant increase in 
median OS over carboplatin and paclitaxel (12.9 v 9.9 months) in 
patients with previously untreated ED-SCLC.17 The phased ipili- 
mumab regimen also signiﬁcantly improved immune-related PFS 
and PFS over carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in patients with 
previously untreated non-SCLC (NSCLC).23 The phase II results17 
and preclinical data22 led to the initiation of this multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind phase III trial evaluating ipilimumab or 
placebo in combination with etoposide and platinum therapy in 
patients with newly diagnosed ED-SCLC (CA184-156 study [clinical 
trial information: NCT01450761]). 

Patients with documented ED-SCLC were eligible. Inclusion criteria 
included age 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and no prior systemic therapy for 
ED-SCLC. Exclusion criteria included brain metastasis requiring treat- 
ment, uncontrolled pleural effusion, autoimmune disease, systemic im- 
munosuppression, and any cancer immunotherapy. 
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board or 
ethics committee at each participating center as appropriate and was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and In- 
ternational Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical 
Practice. All patients provided written informed consent before enroll- 
ment. An independent data and safety monitoring committee provided 
oversight of safety and efﬁcacy. 

The study consisted of induction followed by a maintenance phase 
(Data Supplement). Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to 
one to receive ipilimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo using an 
interactive voice response system with a stratiﬁed, permuted, block- 
randomization method. Research staff was blinded to treatment assign- 
ment. Ipilimumab or placebo was administered in a phased dosing 
regimen. During cycles one to four of induction (3-week cycles), patients 
in both arms received etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of each 
cycle and investigator’s choice of platinum agent on day 1 of each cycle 
(cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV or carboplatin area under the concentration-time 
curve 5 IV). During cycles three and four of induction, patients re- 
ceived ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo (3-week cycles) in addition to 
chemotherapy; during cycles ﬁve and six of induction, patients received 
only ipilimumab or placebo (Data Supplement). Patients who achieved 
a complete or partial response per modiﬁed WHO criteria24 during in- 
duction could undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; investigator’s 
choice) before the start of the maintenance phase. The maintenance 
phase began 9 to 12 weeks after the last induction cycle (depending on the 
timing of and recovery from PCI, if administered). Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg 
or placebo was administered every 12 weeks until progression, un- 
acceptable toxicity, or death, for a maximum of 3 years from the ﬁrst 
ipilimumab or placebo dose. The rationale for this dose schedule of 
ipilimumab was based on prior phase II/III melanoma and phase II lung 
cancer trials.17,19,23,25-27 
Random assignment was stratiﬁed by ECOG PS (0 v 1), lactate 
dehydrogenase level (# upper limit of normal v . upper limit of normal), 
choice of platinum agent during induction (cisplatin v carboplatin), and 
region (North America or Western Europe v other). Criteria for treatment 
delay and discontinuation because of treatment-related adverse events 
(AEs) are detailed in the Data Supplement. No dose reductions were 
permitted for ipilimumab or placebo. Results are provided for patients who 
were treated with at least one dose of blinded study drug. 

Tumor assessment (including bone or brain imaging) performed at 
screening was used as baseline for efﬁcacy assessments. Tumor response 
was investigator assessed per modiﬁed WHO criteria at weeks 7, 13, 19, and 
25 and then every 12 weeks thereafter until progression or end of treat- 
ment. Safety was assessed by evaluating the incidence of AEs and laboratory 
parameters and graded using National Cancer Institute Common Ter- 
minology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). AEs of interest were 
deﬁned as those with potential immunologic etiologies and grouped into 
predeﬁned categories: enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, 
and neuropathies. AEs of interest considered drug related by the investigator 
were referred to as immune-related AEs. 

The primary end point was OS among patients who received at least 
one dose of study therapy. Patients were observed continuously for sur- 
vival while receiving treatment and then every 3 months after treatment 
discontinuation. 
The trial was originally designed with a primary end point of OS in all 
randomly assigned patients. During the study, it was determined that the effect 
of ipilimumab on OS could not be accurately measured in this population of all 
those randomly assigned. To avoid attenuation of the potential treatment effect, 
the end points were modiﬁed by a protocol amendment. 
Secondary end points included OS in all randomly assigned patients 
and PFS per modiﬁed WHO criteria among patients who received at least 
one dose of study therapy. Exploratory end points included best overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of response, survival rate, and safety. 

Estimation of sample size was based on the results of a phase II study 
in ED-SCLC and NSCLC.17,23 Approximately 1,100 patients were to be 
randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one; assuming a dropout rate of 15% 
during the ﬁrst two cycles of chemotherapy, it was estimated 935 patients 
would receive study drug. The primary analysis was not conducted until 
a total of 618 events had occurred in 935 randomly assigned patients who 
received study therapy, which was estimated to ensure 90% power to detect 
a statistically signiﬁcant difference in OS, with a type I error rate of 5% 
based on a two-sided log-rank test. For this power computation, an ex- 
ponential distribution and a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.77 in the 
post-chemotherapy alone period was assumed. The expected smallest 
statistically signiﬁcant treatment effect corresponded to an HR of 0.85. 
For OS and PFS, treatment arms were compared using an un- 
stratiﬁed, two-sided log-rank test. HRs and corresponding 95% CIs were 
estimated using an unstratiﬁed Cox model with treatment arm as the only

covariate. Survival curves and rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Best ORR per modiﬁed WHO criteria was calculated in evaluable 
patients, and corresponding 95% exact CI was calculated using the Clopper- 
Pearson method. Statistical considerations in all randomly assigned patients 
are presented in the Data Supplement. 

From January 2012 to September 2014, 1,414 patients were 
enrolled at 224 study sites in 34 countries, with 1,132 patients 
randomly assigned to receive etoposide and platinum plus ipili- 
mumab (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab) or etoposide and plat- 
inum plus placebo (chemotherapy plus placebo; n = 566 in each 
arm). A total of 1,123 patients received treatment (one or more 
cycle of platinum and etoposide); the most common reason for not 
receiving treatment was that the patient no longer met eligibility 
criteria. Of those treated, 15% of patients (n = 169) discontinued 
during cycles one to two, before administration of study drug, and 
85% (n = 954) received at least one dose of blinded study therapy 
(chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, [n = 478]; chemotherapy plus 
placebo, [n = 476]; Fig 1; Data Supplement). This report focuses 
on efﬁcacy and safety analyses performed in randomly assigned 
patients who received at least one dose of blinded study drug. 
Analyses in the population of all those randomly assigned are 
presented in the Data Supplement. 
Median age of the treated patient population was 62 years; 
most patients were male (67%) and white (76%), with an ECOG

patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung 
cancer in study CA184-156 as of September 
2015. Patients were randomly assigned to 
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (etoposide 
plus investigator’s choice of cisplatin or car- 
boplatin in cycles one to four and ipilimumab 
in cycles three to six) or chemotherapy plus 
placebo (etoposide plus investigator’s choice 
of cisplatin or carboplatin in cycles one to four 
and placebo in cycles three to six). Patients 
who achieved complete or partial response 
per modiﬁed WHO criteria24 during induction 
could undergo prophylactic cranial irradi- 
ation (PCI), investigator’s choice, before 
start of maintenance phase. Maintenance 
phase began 9 to 12 weeks after last in- 
duction cycle (depending on timing of and 
recovery from PCI, if administered), in 
which ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo 
was administered intravenously every 12 
weeks until progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or death, for a maximum period 
of 3 years from ﬁrst ipilimumab or placebo 
dose. Reasons for patients discontinuing 
during induction phase are indicated. AE,

PS of 1 (70%). Demographic and baseline characteristics were 
balanced between the two arms (Table 1). 
The median number of doses of blinded study drug received 
was four (ipilimumab, range one to 14; placebo, range one to 12); 
59% received at least four doses of ipilimumab, and 69% received 
at least four doses of placebo. The number of patients who received 
carboplatin or cisplatin as backbone chemotherapy was similar 
between treatment arms (Data Supplement). Across arms, 15% of 
patients (n = 146) received at least one dose of maintenance 
therapy (ipilimumab, 13% [n = 64]; placebo, 17% [n = 82]; Fig 1).

in the maintenance phase (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, [n = 14]; 
chemotherapy plus placebo, [n = 10]); the most common reason 
for discontinuation was disease progression (Fig 1; Data Sup- 
plement). PCI was administered to 11% and 14% of patients in 
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus 
placebo arms, respectively. Subsequent chemotherapy was ad- 
ministered to 48% and 52% of patients in the chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively 
(Data Supplement). 

At database lock, 74% of patients (n = 707) who received 
blinded study therapy had died. Median follow-up for OS was 10.5 
and 10.2 months in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively. 
Chemotherapy plus ipilimumab treatment did not result in 
a statistically signiﬁcant 
in OS compared with 
improvement 
chemotherapy plus placebo among patients who received at least 
one dose of blinded study therapy (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; 
unstratiﬁed log-rank P = .3775). Median OS was 11.0 months 
(95% CI, 10.45 to 11.33) in patients treated with chemotherapy 
plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 10.02 to 11.50) in 
those treated with chemotherapy plus placebo, with 1-year OS rates 
of 40% in both arms (Fig 2A). At the time of analysis, 350 patients 
(73%) in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm had died, 
compared with 357 (75%) in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm. 
Across most prespeciﬁed patient subgroups, HRs for OS did not 
seem to favor one treatment arm (Fig 2B). Results for OS in the 
population of all randomly assigned patients were consistent with 
the primary analysis results (Data Supplement). 
Median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.50 to 4.99) in patients 
treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months 
(95% CI, 4.37 to 4.63) in those treated with chemotherapy plus 
placebo; HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; unstratiﬁed log-rank 
P = .0161) between arms (Fig 3). At the time of analysis, 443 (93%) 
and 457 patients (96%) in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively, had experienced 
disease progression. Furthermore, because the primary end point 
of the study was not met, the P values of all secondary end points, 
including PFS, are provided for descriptive purposes only and 
should not be considered statistically signiﬁcant. 
Best ORRs were similar in the two arms. In the chemotherapy 
plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively, 
62% (in each arm) experienced partial responses, 26% and 27% 
experienced stable disease, and 6% and 9% experienced progressive 
disease. One patient treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab 
experienced a complete response; none were observed in patients 
treated with chemotherapy plus placebo. Median duration of re- 
sponse was 4.01 (95% CI, 3.32 to 4.17) and 3.45 months (95% CI, 
3.25 to 4.07) with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemo- 
therapy plus placebo, respectively (Table 2). 

Rate of treatment-related AEs occurring on or after blinded 
study drug dosing was 82% (48% for grade 3 to 4 events) with 
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 76% (44% for grade 3 to 4 
events) with chemotherapy plus placebo (Table 3). The most

frequently reported grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs occurring in 5% 
of patients or more in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm were 
neutropenia (14%), anemia (8%), diarrhea (7%), and decreased 
neutrophil count (7%). In the chemotherapy plus placebo arm, they 
were neutropenia (24%), anemia (11%), and decreased neutrophil 
count (6%). Frequency of treatment-related serious AEs was nu- 
merically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (any grade, 
27%; grade 3 to 5, 22%) versus chemotherapy plus placebo (any grade, 
13%; grade 3 to 5, 11%; Data Supplement). A majority of treatment- 
related serious AEs occurred in less than 1% of patients; incidence was 
similar between arms, with the exception of diarrhea (any grade, 8% v 
1%) and colitis (any grade, 5% v , 1%), which occurred more 
frequently with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (Data Supplement). 
Treatment-related AEs led to discontinuation in 18% of pa- 
tients treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 2% of those 
treated with chemotherapy plus placebo (Data Supplement). The 
most frequent treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation 
were diarrhea (5%) and colitis (4%) with chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab. In the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, there were 
ﬁve treatment-related deaths, two resulting from colitis, two from 
sepsis, and one from liver toxicity. The two deaths resulting from 
sepsis were assessed by investigators as being related to chemo- 
therapy but not ipilimumab. In the chemotherapy plus placebo 
arm, there were two treatment-related deaths, one resulting from 
sepsis and one from bone marrow suppression (Data Supplement). 
GI and skin-related AEs were the most common immune- 
related AEs with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (in 34% and 29% 
of patients, respectively). The most frequently reported immune- 
related AEs in 5% or more of patients treated with chemotherapy 
plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy plus placebo were diarrhea 
(25% v 10%), rash (19% v 3%), pruritus (12% v 2%), colitis (6% 
v , 1%), and alopecia (5% v 7%). Endocrine immune-related AEs 
occurred in 10% of patients in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab 
arm versus 2% in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm; the most 
frequently reported events in 1% or more of patients were hy- 
pothyroidism (3%), hyperthyroidism (2%), hypophysitis (1%), 
and adrenal insufﬁciency (1%), as shown in the Data Supplement. 
In the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, median times to 
onset of grade 2 to 5 immune-related AEs ranged from 4.7 weeks in 
the skin category to 9.0 weeks in the hepatic category (Data 
Supplement). Immune-related AEs were managed using estab- 
lished safety guidelines. At database lock, a majority (76%; 184 of 
243) of grade 2 to 4 immune-related AEs completely resolved, with 
median times to resolution ranging from 2.0 weeks for hepatic 
events to 28.9 weeks for neurologic events (Data Supplement). 
To our knowledge, study CA184-156 is the largest phase III 
randomized trial conducted to date in a population of patients with 
ED-SCLC. The addition of ipilimumab to etoposide and platinum 
did not result in a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS versus 
etoposide and platinum. Although exploratory in nature, che- 
motherapy plus ipilimumab did not demonstrate signiﬁcant im- 
provement in other end points, and no subgroups demonstrated 
greater beneﬁt versus chemotherapy alone. Baseline characteristics 
were well balanced between arms; treatment delivery was com- 
parable, and the frequency and reasons for patients discontinuing 
during cycles one and two (before start of blinded study drug) and 
in patients who went on to receive at least one dose of blinded 
study drug were consistent with prior observations.17,23 Post-study

systemic therapy was received by a similar percentage of patients in 
both arms of the study. The safety proﬁle of chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab was consistent with that in prior chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab combination studies,17,19,23 and no new safety signals 
were identiﬁed. Immune-related toxicities were managed with 
established safety guidelines, and a majority of grade 2 to 4 
immune-related events resolved. 
The performance of etoposide and platinum in this trial 
was consistent with that in previous studies in this patient 
population (ORR, approximately 60%; median OS, approxi- 
mately 9.4 months).3,11 The rationale for this phase III trial was 
supported by preclinical studies showing synergistic effects of 
ipilimumab with platinum and etoposide21,22 and results from 
the phase II trial of phased ipilimumab in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel in ED-SCLC.17 It is unclear why 
ipilimumab did not confer additional beneﬁt over etoposide 
and platinum. One possible explanation is that without cor- 
responding T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment, 
ipilimumab monotherapy, which stimulates peripheral T-cell 
activation, may not be effective in mounting a sufﬁciently 
strong antitumor response in ED-SCLC. In addition, con- 
comitant chemotherapy may increase immunosuppression, 
which may be associated with limited T-cell activation and 
proliferation. 
Results from previous efforts to identify prognostic and 
predictive biomarkers for anti-CTLA4 antibodies have been in- 
conclusive. In melanoma, exploratory studies have suggested that 
low baseline levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells, low lactate dehydrogenase levels, low absolute monocyte 
counts, high levels of circulating regulatory T cells, and high 
relative lymphocyte counts may be associated with favorable 
outcomes with ipilimumab.28-30 However, validation is required in 
larger patient populations, and not all markers were consistent 
across tumor types.31 An in vitro study in SCLC demonstrated that 
the number and frequency of CD14+ HLA–antigen D related/low 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells could be associated with poor 
prognosis.32 A retrospective study of patients with SCLC reported 
that the ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin could be an in- 
dependent predictor of OS.33 Both studies provide early evidence, 
but further research is required.

A recent report showed that programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
is expressed in tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells in the SCLC stroma, 
although not in tumor cells,34 indicating that patients with SCLC 
with stromal PD-L1 expression may potentially respond to inhibitors 
of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway. 
PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and PD-L1 in- 
hibitors durvalumab and atezolizumab have demonstrated antitu- 
mor activity and manageable safety in various tumor types.35-47 PD-1 
inhibitors, which target tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes, comple- 
ment the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 inhibitors by acting through 
nonredundant pathways.20 The combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab has demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity in 
multiple tumor types, including melanoma and NSCLC.16,38,48-50 
In patients with PD-L1–positive ED-SCLC who did not respond 
to ﬁrst-line therapy, pembrolizumab yielded a 29% ORR, with 
durable responses (phase I KEYNOTE-028 study; clinical trial in- 
formation: NCT02054806).16 Nivolumab alone and in combination 
with ipilimumab yielded durable objective responses (ORRs of 13% 
and 31%, respectively), encouraging survival (median OS, 3.6 and 
7.8 months, respectively), and manageable safety proﬁles in heavily 
pretreated patients with advanced SCLC (phase I/II CheckMate 032 
study; clinical trial information: NCT01928394).15 Other immu- 
notherapeutic agents, including tumor vaccines (eg, polysialic acid, 
p53-expressing dendritic cells, and Bec2), have had limited success in 
clinical trials in SCLC.51 
In conclusion, the addition of ipilimumab to etoposide and 
platinum did not improve OS compared with etoposide and 
platinum in chemotherapy-naive patients with ED-SCLC. To 
date, PD-1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with CTLA-4 
inhibitors, show the most promise in SCLC.15,16 Ongoing ap- 
proaches include exploring these agents as maintenance after 
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy (CheckMate 451 [clinical trial information: 
NCT02538666], STIMULI [Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Trial With 
Nivolumab and IpiliMUmab in LImited Disease; clinical trial in- 
formation: NCT02046733], and a phase II trial of pembrolizumab 
[clinical trial information: NCT02359019]) or in second-line settings 
in SCLC (CheckMate 331 [clinical trial information: NCT02481830], 
information: NCT02628067], and 
KEYNOTE-158 [clinical trial 
a phase II study of paclitaxel and pembrolizumab [clinical trial in- 
formation: NCT02551432]).
