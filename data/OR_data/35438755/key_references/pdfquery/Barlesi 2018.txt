Summary 
Background Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 or PD-L1 have demonstrated clinical 
efficacy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this trial we investigated the efficacy and 
safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with NSCLC who had already received platinum-based therapy. 
Methods JAVELIN Lung 200 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 173 hospitals and cancer 
treatment centres in 31 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB or IV or recurrent 
NSCLC and disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing doublet, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status score of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, and adequate 
haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice-response 
system with a stratified permuted block method with variable block length, to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg every 
2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs <1% of 
tumour cells), which was measured with the 73–10 assay, and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). The primary 
endpoint was overall survival, analysed when roughly 337 events (deaths) had occurred in the PD-L1-positive population. 
Efficacy was analysed in all PD-L1-positive patients (ie, PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) randomly assigned to 
study treatment (the primary analysis population) and then in all randomly assigned patients through a hierarchical 
testing procedure. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02395172. Enrolment is complete, but the trial is ongoing. 
Findings Between March 24, 2015, and Jan 23, 2017, 792 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 
avelumab (n=396) or docetaxel (n=396). 264 participants in the avelumab group and 265 in the docetaxel group had 
PD-L1-positive tumours. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, median overall survival did not differ significantly 
between the avelumab and docetaxel groups (11·4 months [95% CI 9·4–13·9] vs 10·3 months [8·5–13·0]; hazard ratio 
0·90 [96% CI 0·72–1·12]; one-sided p=0·16). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 251 (64%) of 393 avelumab- 
treated patients and 313 (86%) of 365 docetaxel-treated patients, including grade 3–5 events in 39 (10%) and 180 (49%) 
patients, respectively. The most common grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events were infusion-related reaction 
(six patients [2%]) and increased lipase (four [1%]) in the avelumab group and neutropenia (51 [14%]), febrile 
neutropenia (37 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil counts (36 [10%]) in the docetaxel group. Serious treatment-related 
adverse events occurred in 34 (9%) patients in the avelumab group and 75 (21%) in the docetaxel group. Treatment- 
related deaths occurred in four (1%) participants in the avelumab group, two due to interstitial lung disease, one due 
to acute kidney injury, and one due to a combination of autoimmune myocarditis, acute cardiac failure, and respiratory 
failure. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 (4%) patients in the docetaxel group, three due to pneumonia, and 
one each due to febrile neutropenia, septic shock, febrile neutropenia with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, 
cardiovascular insufficiency, renal impairment, leucopenia with mucosal inflammation and pyrexia, infection, 
neutropenic infection, dehydration, and unknown causes. 
Interpretation Compared with docetaxel, avelumab did not improve overall survival in patients with platinum-treated 
PD-L1-positive NSCLC, but had a favourable safety profile. 


Introduction 
Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules 
PD-1 or PD-L1 improve overall survival compared with 
standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and several of these 
drugs have received regulatory approvals.1–3 Nivolumab 
and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibodies) were first 
approved in 2015 on the basis of data from randomised

trials—two trials4,5 of nivolumab in patients unselected for 
PD-L1 expression, and a trial6 of pembrolizumab in 
patients with PD-L1-positive disease (defined as PD-L1 
expression in ≥1% of tumour cells based on the PD-L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay; Dako, Carpinteria,CA, USA)— 
showing significantly longer overall survival with each 
drug than with docetaxel in patients with advanced 
squamous or non-squamous NSCLC and disease pro- 
gression after platinum treatment. In 2016, atezolizumab 
became the first anti-PD-L1 antibody approved for 
treatment of metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy on 
the basis of the results of the phase 3 OAK trial,7 in which 
overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab 
than with docetaxel in patients with squamous or non- 
squamous tumours, irrespective of PD-L1 status. In the 
trials4–6 of nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the relative 
treatment benefit of each drug compared with docetaxel 
was greater in patients with squamous tumours than in 
those with non-squamous disease. However, across all 
trials,4–7 median overall survival in patients with non- 
squamous tumours was still significantly longer in the 
experimental groups than in the docetaxel groups. Since 
these trials, positive outcomes from phase 3 trials of 
anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in the context of 
earlier NSCLC have led to additional regulatory approvals, 
further changing the treatment landscape in NSCLC and 
improving patient outcomes.8,9 
Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 antibody that 
has durable antitumour activity and a tolerable safety 
profile in a range of solid tumours.10–13 In a large 
phase 1 study of avelumab in patients with various solid 
tumours (n=1758), a cohort of patients with NSCLC who 
had already received platinum-based therapy (n=184) 
received avelumab as second-line or later treatment.14 In 
this cohort, the proportion of patients who achieved an 
objective response was 14%, which increased with 
increasing levels of PD-L1 expression. Here, we report the 
results of a phase 3 trial of avelumab versus docetaxel in 
patients with advanced NSCLC and disease progression 
after platinum-based chemotherapy. To our knowledge, 
ours is the second randomised trial of an anti-PD-L1 
antibody in this setting. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
JAVELIN Lung 200 (EMR 100070-004) is an open-label, 
multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial at 173 hosptials and 
cancer treatment centres in 31 countries (Argentina, 
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, 
Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, 
Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, 
Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, 
Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and USA). 
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had 




Evidence before this study 
Before the approval of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immune 
checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, docetaxel was the mainstay 
of treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and disease progression after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. We searched PubMed with the terms 
(“non-small cell lung cancer” OR “NSCLC”) AND (“PD-1” 
OR “PD-L1” OR “checkpoint inhibitor”) for clinical trials of 
checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC published in English from 
database inception up to May 11, 2018. We identiﬁed 29 trials 
in patients with NSCLC, 11 of which exclusively enrolled or 
enrolled a speciﬁed cohort of patients who had received 
previous platinum treatment—including trials of atezolizumab, 
avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. Of 
these trials, ﬁve were randomised trials of anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy compared with docetaxel (one 
phase 2 trial, one phase 2–3 trial, and three phase 3 trials); all 
were international and open label. In all randomised phase 3 
trials, overall survival with anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab 
and pembrolizumab) and an anti-PD-L1 antibody 
(atezolizumab) was signiﬁcantly longer than that with 
docetaxel, including in trials speciﬁcally done in patients with 
squamous tumours, non-squamous tumours, or 
PD-L1-positive tumours, or all subpopulations. All reports of 
randomised trials identiﬁed were published after enrolment 
had begun for our trial of avelumab. 
Added value of this study 
To our knowledge, JAVELIN Lung 200 is the second phase 3, 
randomised clinical trial of an anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients 
with NSCLC and disease progression after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. It differs from earlier phase 3 trials of anti-PD-1 
or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy because patients were enrolled at a 
time when an increasing proportion of patients had access to 
an approved agent of these classes. In our study, avelumab was 
not associated with increased overall survival compared with 
docetaxel in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (deﬁned as 
PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumour cells based on the 
73-10 assay). However, exploratory analyses showed that 
avelumab was associated with improved overall survival relative 
to docetaxel in patients whose tumours had higher levels of 
PD-L1 expression (ie, at ≥50% and ≥80% cutoffs). The overall 
safety proﬁle of avelumab was better than that of docetaxel. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Although avelumab had clinical activity in patients with NSCLC 
who had disease progression after platinum-based 
chemotherapy, it did not signiﬁcantly improve overall survival 
compared with docetaxel. Furthermore, the improved efficacy of 
avelumab relative to docetaxel in patients whose tumours had 
higher levels of PD-L1 expression could support the use of 
tumour-cell PD-L1 expression as a biomarker to identify patients 
more likely to obtain a clinical beneﬁt with agents of this class. 
histologically confirmed stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent 
NSCLC with disease progression after previous platinum 
doublet treatment, available fresh biopsy or tumour 
archival material for biomarker assessment, an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 
of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of more than 
12 weeks, and adequate haematological (white blood 
cell count ≥2∙5 × 10⁹ per L, absolute neutrophil 
count ≥1∙5 × 10⁹ per L, lymphocyte count ≥0∙5 × 10⁹/L, 
platelet count >100 × 10⁹ per L, and haemoglobin ≥90 g/L 
[transfused blood permitted]), renal (estimated creatine 
clearance >30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula or local institutional standard method), and 
hepatic (total bilirubin concentration ≤1∙5 × upper limit of 
normal, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine 
aminotransferase concentrations ≤2∙5 × upper limit of 
normal) function. The presence of measurable disease 
was not an inclusion criterion. Patients were not eligible 
if they had non-squamous cell NSCLC harbouring an 
EGFR or ALK mutation (before the second protocol 
amendment on July 10, 2015, patients with tumours with 
EGFR mutations were eligible if they had also received 
previous treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or if 
they had previously received a drug targeting a T-cell 
regulatory protein or systemic anticancer treatment after 
disease progression with platinum-based combination 
therapy. Other exclusion criteria 
included brain 
metastases (unless treated locally and not associated with 
to brain 
ongoing neurological symptoms related 
localisation of disease), persisting toxicity after previous 
treatment, or other clinically significant diseases. Full 
eligibility criteria are in the appendix (p 6). 
The study protocol (appendix p 23) was approved by 
institutional review boards and ethics committees at 
each institution. The study was done in accordance with 
the trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and 
the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written 
informed consent. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were enrolled by study investigators and were 
randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-response 
system to either avelumab or docetaxel. The system was 
used by study investigators, who were potentially assisted 
by colleagues and study coordinators. We used stratified 
permuted block random isation with variable block 
length. Allocation was stratified by PD-L1 status 
(expression in ≥1% vs <1% of tumour cells) and NSCLC 
histology (squamous vs non-squamous). The trial was 
open label, so neither investigators nor patients were 
masked to assigned study treatments. 
Procedures 
PD-L1 expression 
tissue was assessed 
tumour 
centrally at baseline with the PD-L1 IHC 73-10 pharmDx 
assay, which identifies a higher proportion of PD-L1- 
positive tumour cells than do other PD-L1 assays.15,16 The 

primary analysis population (ie, the PD-L1-positive 
population) was defined as patients with PD-L1 expression 
in 1% or more of tumour cells. Tumour samples stained 
with the 73-10 assay were subsequently rescored to 
identify subgroups with PD-L1 expression in 50% or 
more and 80% or more of tumour cells. 
Participants in the avelumab group received 10 mg/kg 
avelumab intravenously over 1 h once every 2 weeks. 
An antihistamine and paracetamol (eg, oral diphen- 
hydramine 25–50 mg and oral or intravenous paracetamol 
500–600 mg, or equivalent) were given 30–60 min before 
each infusion of avelumab. Participants in the docetaxel 
group received 75 mg/m² docetaxel intravenously over 1 h 
every 3 weeks according to label instructions and local 
guidelines. Dexamethasone was given before each 
infusion of docetaxel according to local standard of 
care. Treatment was continued in both groups until 
unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, substantial 
clinical deterioration, or any other protocol-specified 
criterion for withdrawal occurred, including occurrence of 
an exclusion criterion, withdrawal of consent, non- 
compliance, or use of an unpermitted concomitant drug 
(appendix p 7). For patients in the avelumab group, 
initial disease 
treatment could continue beyond 
progression according to the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumours (RECIST; version 1.1)17 
if their 
performance status remained stable, they were tolerating 
treatment, and if investigators decided that treatment 
beyond progression would not delay interventions to 
prevent serious complications of disease progression. 
Dose modification of avelumab was not permitted. 
However, in patients in whom infusion was stopped early 
because of an adverse event during the infusion, a dose 
reduction was defined as a patient receiving a non-zero 
dose of <90% of the planned dose. Dose modifications 
and discontinuations of docetaxel were made 
in 
accordance with label instructions and local guidelines. 
No crossover to avelumab was permitted. Treatment was 
discontinued permanently in both groups in the event of 
any grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events 
(with the exception of protocol-specified transient events). 
Treatment was delayed in patients with grade 2 treatment- 
related adverse events that had not resolved to grade 1 or 
less by the time of the next scheduled infusion. Guidance 
for delaying or discontinuing treatment after adverse 
events is in the appendix (p 8). 
Tumours were assessed by radiographic imaging at 
baseline, every 6 weeks for the first 12 months, then 
every 12 weeks thereafter. Objective tumour response 
was assessed according to RECIST (version 1.1) by 
blinded independent endpoint review committee (IERC). 
Treatment decisions were based on investigator assess- 
ments. Safety assessments were done at each treatment 
visit. Adverse events were coded in accordance with 
MedDRA and graded according to the US National 
Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (version 4.03). Infusion-related reactions 





with avelumab were also assessed with a composite 
definition that comprised infusion-related reaction, drug 
hyper sensitivity, or hypersensitivity reaction occurring 
on the day of or the day after the infusion, or various 
signs and symptoms of 
infusion-related reaction 
(including chills, pyrexia, back pain, hypersensitivity, 
drug hypersensitivity, type I hypersensitivity, dyspnoea, 
hypotension, and flushing) occurring on the day of the 
infusion and resolving within 2 days. Immune-related 
adverse events were identified with a prespecified list of 
adverse events followed by a comprehensive medical 
review. Blood and urine samples were taken from non- 
fasted patients at each trial visit for routine laboratory 
analyses, including core serum chemistry, haematology, 
haemostaseology, and urinalysis. Full serum chemistry 
was assessed at weeks 3, 5, and 13 in the avelumab group 
and at weeks 4, 7, and 13 in the docetaxel group. 
Thereafter, serum chemistry was assessed every 6 weeks 
in both groups. Free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone concentrations were tested every 6 weeks in the 
avelumab group, and at week 13 and week 25 in the 
docetaxel group; concentrations of all other hormones 
were tested in both groups when clinically indicated. 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was 
defined as time from randomisation to death (irrespective 
of cause). Secondary endpoints were progression-free 
survival (defined as time from randomisation until the 
first documentation of objective progressive disease 
according to RECIST and adjudicated by the IERC or 
death from any cause, whichever occurred first), best 
overall response (defined as the best response obtained 
among all tumour assessments after the date of 
randomisation until documented disease progression, 
according to RECIST (version 1.1) and adjudicated by the 
IERC), changes in patient-reported outcomes or quality 
of life (assessed by the EQ-5D, the European Organisation 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer’s QLQ-C30, and 
module QLQ-LC13 instruments), and safety. Prespecified 
exploratory endpoints were duration of response (time 
from complete or partial response until disease pro- 
gression or death), tumour shrinkage in target lesions, 
serum titres of anti-avelumab antibodies, the pharma- 
cokinetic profile of avelumab, the relationship between 
PD-L1 expression and clinical response parameters, and 
assessment of potential biomarkers. Quality of life 
assessments, tumour shrinkage, pharmacokinetic data, 
and biomarker assessments are not reported in this 
paper. 
Statistical analysis 
We planned to enrol around 750 patients, which we 
estimated would include 522 patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours and 337 events (deaths) in the primary analysis 
population at the primary analysis. An interim analysis 
was planned after approximately 253 events had occurred 
in the PD-L1-positive population. Efficacy was analysed in 
all patients randomly assigned to study treatment 
(intention-to-treat analysis) and in the PD-L1-positive 
popu lation (primary analysis set). Safety was analysed in 
all patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment. Overall survival was analysed with a one-sided 
log-rank test (overall α 2·5%) stratified for PD-L1 status 
and tumour histology. A hierarchical test procedure was 
applied in the following order to control the overall 
significance level at 0·025 (one sided): overall survival in 
the PD-L1-positive population, overall survival in the 
full analysis set, best overall response in the PD-L1-positive 
population, progression-free survival in the PD-L1-positive 
population, best overall response in the full analysis 
set, and progression-free survival in the full analysis set. 
The α value in the primary analysis was 0·02041. 
Adjustment for multiple testing because of the interim 
analysis was done according to the O’Brien-Fleming 
approach and based on the observed number of overall 
survival events according to the Lan-DeMets method. 
Accordingly, CIs were adjusted to 96%. Treatment effects 
were estimated with a Cox proportional hazards model 
stratified by the randomisation strata (PD-L1 status and 
tumour histology) to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and

adjusted 96% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption 
was checked visually for the primary analysis by plotting 
log(−log(overall survival)) versus log(time) within each 
random isation stratum. Additionally, Schoenfeld residuals, 
including a locally weighted smoothing (LOESS) curve, 
were plotted to investigate graphically violations of 
the proportional hazards assumption. We analysed 
progression-free survival with the same log-rank test used 
for overall survival. The proportion of patients with an 
objective response (ie, a confirmed best overall response of 
complete or partial response) was calculated with 
corresponding two-sided exact Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs 
and compared with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, 
accounting for stratifi cation factors. Exploratory analysis of 
PD-L1-positive subgroups (ie, ≥50% and ≥80% cutoffs) was 
prespecified in the statistical plan (statistical tests within 
subgroups were two sided and unstratified). To explore 
the interaction between treatment and subgroup factors, 
we did likelihood ratio tests. Time-to-event end points 
were estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
two-sided CIs for the median were calculated with the 
Brookmeyer-Crowley method. Follow-up times for overall 
and progression-free survival were estimated with the 
inverse Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model based on an 
inverse probability of censoring weighting technique was 
used for a post-hoc analysis of the effect of post-study treat- 
ment.18 Statistical analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4).

Results 
Between March 24, 2015, and Jan 23, 2017, 792 patients 
were enrolled and randomly assigned: 396 to the avelumab 
group and 396 to the docetaxel group. 264 (67%) participants 
in the avelumab group and 265 (67%) in the docetaxel 
group had PD-L1-positive tumours (figure 1). The data 
cutoff date was Nov 22, 2017. Baseline characteristics were 
similar between the PD-L1-positive population and the full 
analysis set (table 1). In the PD-L1-positive popu lation, 
262 (99%) patients in the avelumab group and 245 (92%) in 
the docetaxel group received at least one dose of study 
treatment. 18 (90%) of the 20 PD-L1-positive participants in 
the docetaxel group who did not receive at least one dose 
withdrew consent, and thus information about subsequent 
treatment was scarce. Median duration of treatment in the 
PD-L1-positive population was 3·4 months (IQR 1·6–9·7) 
in the avelumab group and 2·8 months (1·4–4·4) in the

docetaxel group. The median number of infusions 
received was seven (IQR 3–21) in the avelumab group and 
four (2–6) in the docetaxel group. In the PD-L1-positive 
population, 41 (16%) participants in the avelumab group 
and four (2%) in the docetaxel group remained on 
treatment at data cutoff (figure 1). Figure 1 shows the 
reasons for treatment discontinuation in each treatment 
group. 
In the PD-L1-positive population, anticancer treatment 
after the study was received by 105 (40%) of 264 patients in 
the avelumab group and 126 (48%) of 265 in the docetaxel 
group, and proportions were similar in the full analysis 
set (157 [40%] of 396 vs 185 [47%] of 396). Post-study 
therapy in the PD-L1-positive population included an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or 
anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor) in 15 (6%) patients in the avelumab 
group and 70 (26%) in the docetaxel group (16 [4%] vs 
104 [26%] in the full analysis set). In the docetaxel group, 
post-study immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment was 
more frequently received by patients with non-squamous 
(58 [34%] of 173) than with squamous (12 [13%] of 92) 
tumours. At data cutoff, 342 of 529 participants in the 
PD-L1-positive population had died: 169 (64%) patients in 
the avelumab group and 173 (65%) in the docetaxel group. 
At data cutoff, in the full analysis set, 520 of 792 patients 
had died: 257 (65%) of 396 participants in the avelumab 
group and 263 (66%) of 396 in the docetaxel group. 
Median follow-up for overall survival in the PD-L1- 
positive population was 18·9 months (IQR 13·5–23·1) 
in the avelumab group, 17·8 months (12·6–22·4) in 
the docetaxel group, and 18·3 months (13·2–22·7) in 
the overall PD-L1 population. Median follow-up for 
overall survival was similar in the full analysis set 
(18·9 months [IQR 13·2–23·0] in the avelumab group, 
17·8 months [12·5–22·4] in the docetaxel group, and 
18·3 months [12·9–22·9] in the whole population). 
Overall survival in the PD-L1-positive population did not 
differ between the two treatment groups. Median overall 
survival was 11·4 months (95% CI 9·4–13·9) in the 
avelumab group versus 10·3 months (8·5–13·0) in 
the docetaxel group (stratified HR 0·90 
[96% CI 
0·72–1·12], p=0·16; figure 2A). No major violations of 
the proportional hazards assumption for overall survival 
were identified. 
In our subsequent efficacy analyses, which were now 
rendered exploratory in nature, median overall survival 
in the full analysis set was 10·5 months (95% CI 
9·2–12·9) in the avelumab group and 9·9 months 
(8·1–11·8) in the docetaxel group (stratified HR 0·90 
[96% CI 0·75–1·08]; nominal p=0·12; appendix p 15). 
in the PD-L1-positive 
The overall survival results 
population were consistent across most subgroups 
examined (figure 3). However, prespecified exploratory 
analysis of overall survival at higher PD-L1 cutoffs 
showed 
improved overall survival with avelumab 
compared with docetaxel in patients whose tumours had 
PD-L1 expression in 50% or more of tumour cells 
(figure 2B) or 80% or more of tumour cells (figure 2C). 
Prespecified exploratory analyses of overall survival by 
tumour histology in the PD-L1-positive population and 
post-hoc analyses of overall survival by tumour histology 
in patients with PD-L1 expression in 80% or more of 
tumour cells are shown in the appendix (pp 16–17). 
In the PD-L1-positive population, 323 of 529 patients had 
a progression event (disease progression or death) at data 
cutoff, including 180 (68%) of 264 participants in the 
avelumab group and 143 (54%) of 265 in the docetaxel 
group. In the full analysis set, 497 of 792 patients had a 
progression event, including 286 (72%) of 396 participants 
in the avelumab group and 211 (53%) of 396 in the 
docetaxel group. In the PD-L1-positive population, median 
progression-free survival according to IERC judgment was 
3·4 months (95% CI 2·7–4·9) in the avelumab group 
and 4·1 months (3·0–5·3) in the docetaxel group (strati- 
fied HR 1·01 [96% CI 0·80–1·28]; nominal p=0·53; 
appendix p 18). In the full analysis set, median progression- 
free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·7–3·5) in the 
avelumab group and 4·2 months (3·3–5·2) in the docetaxel 
group (unstratified HR 1·16 [95% CI 0·97–1·40]; nominal 
p=0·95). In the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression 
in 50% or more of tumour cells, median progression-free 
survival in the avelumab group was significantly longer 
than that in the docetaxel group (appendix p 19). Median 
progression-free survival was also longer in the avelumab 
group than in the docetaxel group in the subgroup of 
patients with PD-L1 expression in 80% or more of tumour 
cells (appendix p 19). Prespecified exploratory analyses of 
progression-free survival based on different PD-L1 cutoffs 
and post-hoc analyses of progression-free survival by 
histology based on different PD-L1 cutoffs are in the 
appendix (pp 18–19 and p 20, respectively). 
There was some discordance between investigator and 
IERC assessments, whereby progressive disease was

and ﬁve [1%] vs seven [2%] in the full analysis set). †The number of patients with PD-L1-positive tumours based on a 
≥1% cutoff in the full analysis set is slightly different from that in the primary analysis population because of minor 
differences in PD-L1 status reporting in the randomisation system.

diagnosed by the investigator but not the IERC. This 
discordance was noted more frequently in the docetaxel 
group than in the avelumab group (appendix p 9). 
In the PD-L1-positive population, a higher proportion 
of participants had objective responses in the avelumab 
group than in the docetaxel group (50 [19%] of 264 vs 
31 [12%] of 265; odds ratio [OR] 1·76 [95% CI 1·08–2·86]; 
nominal p=0·011; table 2). In prespecified analyses, 
objective responses were recorded significantly more 
frequently with avelumab than with docetaxel in the 
subgroups of patients with PD-L1 expression in 50% or 
more cells and in 80% or more cells (table 2). Median 
duration of response was not reached in the avelumab 
group (95% CI 9·9 to not estimable) and was 6·9 months 
(3·5 to not estimable) in the docetaxel group. Reasons 
for patients in the PD-L1-positive population not being 
assessable for best overall response are in the appendix 
(p 10). In the full analysis set, 59 (15%) of 396 patients in 
the avelumab group and 44 (11%) of 396 in the docetaxel 
group had an objective response (OR 1·40 [95% CI 
0·92–2·13]; nominal p=0·055): five (1%) versus two (1%) 
had complete responses, 54 (14%) versus 42 (11%) had 
partial responses, and 129 (33%) versus 158 (40%) had 
stable disease. 
Exploratory post-hoc analyses of the effect of treatment 
with an immune checkpoint inhibitor after discon- 
tinuation of study treatment on overall survival resulted in 
an adjusted HR for avelumab versus docetaxel in an 
inverse probability of censoring weighting model of the 
PD-L1-positive population of 0·80 (95% CI 0·62–1·04). In 
a naive sensitivity analysis in which patients were censored 
at the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, the adjusted 
HR was 0·86 (95% CI 0·68–1·09; appendix pp 11, 22). 
Avelumab was associated with fewer treatment-related 
adverse events than was docetaxel, and most adverse 
events associated with avelumab were low grade (table 3). 
Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred 
in 251 (64%) of 393 avelumab-treated patients and 
313 (86%) of 365 docetaxel-treated patients. The pro- 
portion of patients with a grade 3 or worse (39 [10%] of 
393 vs 180 [49%] of 365) or grade 4 or worse (eight [2%] vs 
79 [22%]) treatment-related adverse event was lower in 
the avelumab group than in the docetaxel group (appendix 
pp 12–13). In the avelumab group, the most common 
treatment-related adverse events of any grade were 
infusion-related reaction (65 [17%] of 393) and decreased 
appetite (34 [9%]; table 3, appendix pp 12–13), and the 
most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse 
events were infusion-related reaction (six [2%]) and 
increased lipase (four [1%]; table 3, appendix pp 12–13). In 
the docetaxel group, the most common treatment-related 
adverse events of any grade were alopecia (97 [27%] of 
365), anaemia (69 
[19%]), and decreased appetite 
(66 [18%]), and the most common grade 3 or worse 
treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia 
(51 [14%]), febrile neutropenia (37 [10%]), and decreased 
neutrophil count (36 [10%]; table 3; appendix pp 12–13).

In an expanded analysis of infusion-related reaction as 
an adverse event of special interest in the avelumab 
group, events of any grade occurred in 107 (27%) patients— 
including adverse events of grade 3 or worse in 
six (2%) participants—and led to avelumab discon- 
tinuation in six (2%) participants. First onset was within 
the first three infusions in 104 (26%) participants, and at 
infusion four or later in three (1%). Immune-related 
adverse events of any grade occurred in 65 (17%) of 
393 avelumab-treated patients, and grade 3 or higher 
immune-related events occurred in 11 (3%) participants. 
The most common immune-related adverse events of 
any grade in the avelumab group that occurred in at least 
2% of patients were rash and related terms (25 [6%]), 
hypothyroidism (19 [5%]), and pneumonitis (nine [2%]; 
appendix p 14). 
28 (7%) of 393 patients in the avelumab group and 
51 (14%) of 365 in the docetaxel group discontinued 
treatment because of a treatment-related adverse event. 
Dose reductions occurred in 16 (4%) participants in the 
avelumab group and 72 (20%) in the docetaxel group. 
Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 
34 (9%) patients in the avelumab group and 75 (21%) in 
the docetaxel group. The most common serious 
treatment-related adverse events in the avelumab group 
were pneumonitis (five [1%]) and interstitial lung disease 
(three [1%]), whereas in the docetaxel group they were 
febrile neutropenia (21 [6%]), neutropenia (ten [3%]), 
pneumonia (nine [2%]), diarrhoea (five [1%]), decreased 
neutrophil count (four [1%]), asthenia (three [1%]), 
leucopenia 
interstitial 
(three [1%]), and septic shock (three [1%]). Deaths

because of treatment-related adverse events occurred in 
four (1%) patients in the avelumab group (three on study 
and one 4 months after the last avelumab dose): two due 
to interstitial lung disease, one due to acute kidney injury, 
and one due to autoimmune myocarditis, acute cardiac 
failure, and respiratory failure. Deaths due to treatment- 
related adverse events occurred in 14 (4%) patients in 
the docetaxel group: three due to pneumonia, and 
one each due to febrile neutropenia, septic shock, 
febrile neutropenia with septic shock, acute respiratory 
failure, cardiovascular insufficiency, renal impairment, 
leucopenia with mucosal inflammation and pyrexia, 
infection, neutropenic infection, dehydration, and un- 
known causes. The total number of deaths in treated 
patients in the safety analysis set irrespective of relation- 
ship to study treatment was 255 (65%) of 393 patients in 
the avelumab group and 241 (66%) of 365 in the docetaxel 
group. 
In the avelumab group, serum anti-drug antibodies to 
avelumab were detected in 51 (14%) of 368 assessable 
patients. Antibodies were 
in 
46 patients (13%) and pre-existing in five (1%). No 
associations between efficacy or safety outcomes and 
serum anti-drug antibodies were identified (data not 
shown). 

Discussion 
In this randomised, phase 3 trial in patients with 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC and disease progression 
after platinum doublet therapy, avelumab was not 
associated with improved overall survival compared with 
docetaxel in the PD-L1-positive population (≥1% cutoff). 
Thus, the JAVELIN Lung 200 trial did not meet its 
primary endpoint. However, avelumab did show clinical 
activity and acceptable safety in these patients. 
The high frequency of post-study use of checkpoint 
inhibitors in our study is indicative of the increasing use 
of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC, and 
might have affected overall survival findings in our study. 
The frequency of use of checkpoint inhibitors after 
docetaxel treatment in this study (26% in the docetaxel 
group vs 6% in the avelumab group) is higher than that 
in previous trials in a similar setting, including a trial7 
of docetaxel versus atezolizumab (17% vs 4%) and a trial 
of docetaxel versus pembrolizumab (13% vs 1%).6 
Furthermore, the proportion of randomly assigned 
patients who did not receive any study treatment was 
higher in the docetaxel group than in the avelumab 
group (8% vs 1%), which is one of the limitations of a 
non-blinded randomised study and is suggestive of 
selective discontinuation after treatment assignment. 
Other potential factors that might have affected trial 
outcomes include methods of biomarker assessment, 
patient characteristics, or drug characteristics. 
Treatment outcomes after chemotherapy in patients 
with NSCLC tend to be better in Asian patients than in 
patients from other regions.19,20 Our trial included a high 
proportion of Asian patients in the PD-L1-positive 
population (71 [27%] in the docetaxel group vs 81 [31%] in 
the docetaxel group), including a high proportion of 
Japanese patients living in Japan (14% in both groups). 
By comparison, in both the KEYNOTE-010 and OAK 
trials, 21% of patients were Asian (217 of 1033 patients 
in KEYNOTE-010, and 180 of 850 in OAK).6,7 Cross-study 
comparisons should be interpreted with caution because 
of differences in study designs, patient populations, and 
dates of enrolment. However, the median overall 
survival in the avelumab group in patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumours in our trial was similar to that 
in the pembrolizumab group of a phase 2–3 trial

Objective responses were assessed by the independent efficacy review committee. *PD-L1-positive population based on randomisation. †Includes missing and not assessable

Non-complete response or 
non-progressive disease 




















in patients with PD-L1-positive 
(KEYNOTE-010) 
tumours (based on tumour cell PD-L1 expression).6 
Across trials of other drugs, median overall survival 
with docetaxel (pooled for patients with squamous and 
non-squamous tumours) has ranged from 8·1 months 
to 9·6 months.6,7,21 
Our prespecified exploratory analyses suggested that in 
subgroups of patients with higher PD-L1 expression, 
overall and progression-free survival were significantly 
longer, and objective responses were more common, 
with avelumab than with docetaxel—a finding consistent 
with those from other trials.6,21,22 Studies of the analytic 
performance of different PD-L1 assays have shown that 
the 73-10 assay used in this trial has higher sensitivity to 
detect PD-L1-positive tumour cells than other assays 
used in trials of other drugs, including the 22C3 
(pembrolizumab; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and 
SP142 (atezolizumab; Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA) 
assays.15,16 In a direct comparison16 of PD-L1 staining with 
the 73-10 and 22C3 assays 
in NSCLC samples, 
73-10 detected a higher proportion of PD-L1-positive 
tumours with a 1% or greater cutoff (80% vs 59%), and 
the 80% or greater cutoff for 73-10 was highly concordant 
with the 50% or greater cutoff for 22C3 (identifying 
24% vs 20% of samples, respectively; overall percentage 
agreement 94%). Additionally, according to prevalence 
data, the 80% or greater cutoff with the 73-10 assay 
identified a similarly sized proportion of patients in this 
trial (226 [29%] of 792) to the 50% or greater cutoff with 
the 22C3 assay in the KEYNOTE-010 trial (28%).6 By 
contrast, in the OAK trial of atezolizumab, in which 
PD-L1 expression by tumour or immune cells was 
measured with the SP142 assay, the proportion of patients 
with PD-L1-positive tumours above a minimum thres- 
hold (≥1% expression in tumour or immune cells) was 
only 54%, which emphasises the differences between 
PD-L1 assays.7 
In this trial, the frequency of treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors after docetaxel discontinuation was 
higher in patients with non-squamous NSCLC than in 
those with squamous NSCLC (34% vs 13%). In previous 
randomised trials4–6,21 of similar drugs, greater treatment 
effects relative to docetaxel have been reported in patients 
with squamous tumours compared with those with non- 
squamous tumours, including a progression-free survival 
benefit in the trial4 of nivolumab in squamous NSCLC, 
but not in the trial5 of nivolumab in non-squamous 
NSCLC.21 Additionally, the improved overall survival 
noted in patients with tumours with higher PD-L1 
expression during nivolumab treatment compared with 
docetaxel was more pronounced in patients with non- 
squamous tumours than in those with squamous 
tumours, but signifigance testing was not reported.21 
These findings might be because of biological differences 
between histological subtypes that could affect responses 
to immunotherapy, such as immunological characteristics 
of the tumour microenvironment or viral integration,23–25 
although further studies are needed to clarify the effects

of these factors during checkpoint inhibitor treatment of 
NSCLC. Notably, in the high PD-L1 expression subgroup 
(≥80% cutoff) in our study, avelumab showed clinical 
activity (in terms of effects on overall survival, progression- 
free survival, and objective response) irrespective of 
NSCLC histology, suggesting that checkpoint inhibition 
has an increased likelihood of clinical benefit in both 
that are 
squamous and non-squamous 
immunologically active. Analyses are underway 
to 
establish whether tumour mutational burden or other 
biomarkers could have contributed to the overall efficacy 
results in this trial. 

In safety analyses, avelumab was associated with a lower 
frequency of treatment-related adverse events of any grade 
and of grade 3 or worse adverse events than docetaxel. 
However, consistent with previous trials of avelumab,10–13,26 
the frequency of infusion-related reactions was higher in 
the avelumab group than in the docetaxel group. Infusion- 
related reactions were mostly mild, rarely led to treatment 
discontinuation, and typically occurred within the first 
three infusions (99% of cases). Other treatment-related 
adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in our trial 
to those in previous studies of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
antibodies compared with docetaxel.4,5,7,27 Avelumab was 
associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or worse 
immune-related treatment-related adverse events. 
Overall, although this trial did not meet its primary 
endpoint, the clinical activity and safety noted in this 
study support further studies of avelumab in patients 
with NSCLC, and several trials are underway in different 
treatment settings. Findings from JAVELIN Lung 200 
will help to inform the analyses of these trials, which 
could help to define a future role for avelumab in the 
treatment of NSCLC.
