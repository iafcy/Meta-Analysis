            "abstract": "PD-L1-blocking antibodies produce significant clinical benefit in selected cancer patients by reactivating functionally-impaired antigen-experienced anticancer T cells. However, the efficacy of current PD-L1-blocking antibodies is potentially reduced by 'on-target/off-tumor' binding to PD-L1 widely expressed on normal cells. This lack of tumor selectivity may induce a generalized activation of all antigen-experienced T cells which may explain the frequent occurrence of autoimmune-related adverse events during and after treatment. To address these issues, we constructed a bispecific antibody (bsAb), designated PD-L1xEGFR, to direct PD-L1-blockade to EGFR-expressing cancer cells and to more selectively reactivate anticancer T cells. Indeed, the IC50 of PD-L1xEGFR for blocking PD-L1 on EGFR+ cancer cells was ∼140 fold lower compared to that of the analogous PD-L1-blocking bsAb PD-L1xMock with irrelevant target antigen specificity. Importantly, activation status, IFN-γ production, and oncolytic activity of anti-CD3xanti-EpCAM-redirected T cells was enhanced when cocultured with EGFR-expressing carcinoma cells. Similarly, the capacity of PD-L1xEGFR to promote proliferation and IFN-γ production by CMVpp65-directed CD8+ effector T cells was enhanced when cocultured with EGFR-expressing CMVpp65-transfected cancer cells. In contrast, the clinically-used PD-L1-blocking antibody MEDI4736 (durvalumab) promoted T cell activation indiscriminate of EGFR expression on cancer cells. Additionally, in mice xenografted with EGFR-expressing cancer cells 111In-PD-L1xEGFR showed a significantly higher tumor uptake compared to 111In-PD-L1xMock. In conclusion, PD-L1xEGFR blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in an EGFR-directed manner, thereby promoting the selective reactivation of anticancer T cells. This novel targeted approach may be useful to enhance efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade in EGFR-overexpressing malignancies."

Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically or cytologically documented stage III, unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, for which they had received at least two cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, with no disease progression after this treatment. We randomly assigned patients (2:1) using an interactive voice response system and a blocked design (block size=3) stratified by age, sex, and smoking history to receive 10 mg/kg intravenous durvalumab or matching placebo 1-42 days after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, then every 2 weeks up to 12 months. The primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival have been reported previously. PROs were a prespecified secondary outcome. We assessed PRO symptoms, functioning, and global health status or quality of life in the intention-to-treat population with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3 and its lung cancer module, the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) at the time of random allocation to groups, at weeks 4 and 8, every 8 weeks until week 48, and then every 12 weeks until progression. Changes from baseline to 12 month in key symptoms were analysed with mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and time-to-event analyses. A 10-point or greater change from baseline (deterioration or improvement) was deemed clinically relevant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02125461, and EudraCT, 2014-000336-42.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between May 9, 2014, and April 22, 2016, 476 patients were assigned to receive durvalumab, and 237 patients were assigned to receive placebo. As of March 22, 2018, the median follow-up was 25·2 months (IQR 14·1-29·5). More than 79% of patients given durvalumab and more than 82% of patients given placebo completed questionnaires up to week 48. Between baseline and 12 months, the prespecified longitudinal PROs of interest, cough (MMRM-adjusted mean change 1·8 [95% CI 0·06 to 3·54] in the durvalumab group vs 0·7 [-1·91 to 3·30] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (3·1 [1·75 to 4·36] vs 1·4 [-0·51 to 3·34]), chest pain (-3·1 [-4·57 to -1·60] vs -3·5 [-5·68 to -1·29]), fatigue (-3·0 [-4·53 to -1·50] vs -5·2 [-7·45 to -2·98]), appetite loss (-5·8 [-7·28 to -4·36] vs -7·0 [-9·17 to -4·87]), physical functioning (0·1 [-1·10 to 1·28] vs 2·0 [0·22 to 3·73]), and global health status or quality of life (2·6 [1·21 to 3·94] vs 1·8 [-0·25 to 3·81]) remained stable with both treatments, with no clinically relevant changes from baseline. The between-group differences in changes from baseline to 12 months in cough (difference in adjusted mean changes 1·1, 95% CI -1·89 to 4·11), dyspnoea (1·6, -0·58 to 3·87), chest pain (0·4, -2·13 to 2·93), fatigue (2·2, -0·38 to 4·78), appetite loss (1·2, -1·27 to 3·67), physical functioning (-1·9, -3·91 to 0·15), or global health status or quality of life (0·8, -1·55 to 3·14) were not clinically relevant.

In an open-label phase 3 trial, we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor-expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight once every 2 weeks) or platinum-based chemotherapy (administered once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles). Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to receive nivolumab at the time of disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by means of blinded independent central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30). A total of 128 of 212 patients (60%) in the chemotherapy group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 92% of those who received chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 51% of those who received chemotherapy.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nNivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Overall survival was similar between groups. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile, as compared with chemotherapy, with no new or unexpected safety signals.

Precious therapeutic weapons impacting survival are monoclonal antibodies directed against the programmed death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint. Areas covered: Unfortunately, not all patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors have durable clinical responses. However, a better understanding of the complexity of interactions between the immune system and cancer, the latter capable of adopting evasion mechanisms, indicates different opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Expert opinion: In this paper, we review multiple strategies of combining immunotherapies that exploit not only additional immune checkpoint receptors and ligands but also other synergistic approaches such as vaccines or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors with the potential to extend the number of NSCLC patients achieving successful outcomes."

Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and CD80, blocking PD-L1, but not PD-L2. Areas covered: In advanced NSCLC patients, durvalumab has demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability, particularly with ≥25% PD-L1 tumor expression in the EGFR and ALK wild-type population. However, preliminary data have shown lower efficacy in EGFR mutant and ALK-positive patients. The results from the recent PACIFIC study in locally advanced patients have placed durvalumab as standard of care in consolidation after chemoradiation, leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Expert commentary: Early data suggest promising activity for durvalumab with the CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab, regardless of PD-L1 expression, and potentially in combination with other drugs such as platinum-doublet chemotherapy. However, treatment-related toxicity associated with the combinations is an important aspect of the benefit-risk evaluation in the decision-making process.

            "abstract": "Patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable to complications from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Recurrent hospital visits and hospital admission are potential risk factors for acquiring infection with its causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) constitute the therapeutic backbone for the vast majority of patients with advanced lung cancer in the absence of actionable driver oncogenes, there have been intense discussions within the oncology community regarding risk-benefit of delaying these treatments or use of alternative extended-interval treatment strategies to minimize the risk of viral transmission secondary to unintended nosocomial exposures. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for extended-interval strategy of pembrolizumab at a dose of 400 mg every 6 weeks for all already approved oncologic indications. Herein, we summarize the evidence from the in silico pharmacokinetic modeling/simulation studies supporting extended-interval dosing strategies for the ICIs used in lung cancer. We further review the evolving clinical evidence behind these approaches and predict that they will continue to be used in routine practice even long after the pandemic, particularly for patients with durable disease control."

Nonspecific immunotherapy using the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine has long been the mainstay for the treatment of high-risk superficial bladder carcinoma in an adjuvant setting after transurethral endoscopic resection. In metastatic disease, cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the main therapeutic modality. In Europe, the standard second-line chemotherapy for patients with cisplatin-refractory tumours is vinflunine. Other systemic treatments with a lower level of evidence include paclitaxel and docetaxel. Studies of tumour microenvironment indicate a significant role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of urothelial tumours and the presence of a CD8 lymphocyte infiltrate is associated with better survival. In urothelial tumours, the correlation between PD-L1 expression in the tumour and the response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical studies. Several inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are undergoing advanced-phase clinical trials and atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab have already have received permanent or temporary registration status in the United States, mostly as second-line treatments for patients progressing on cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Thirty NSCLC patients provided pre- and posttreatment tumors for messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis. NSCLC with ≥25% tumor cells and urothelial cancer with ≥25% tumor or immune cells stained for PD-L1 at any intensity were scored PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to adjust for gender, age, prior therapies, histology, ECOG status, liver metastasis, and smoking. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Results: In the NSCLC discovery set, a four-gene IFNγ-positive (IFNγ+) signature comprising IFNγ, CD274, LAG3, and CXCL9 was associated with higher overall response rates, longer median progression-free survival, and overall survival compared with signature-low patients. IFNγ+-signature NSCLC patients had improved survival regardless of IHC PD-L1 status. These associations were replicated in a urothelial cancer cohort. The IFNγ+ signature was induced 2-fold (P = 0.003) by durvalumab after 8 weeks of therapy in patients with NSCLC, and baseline signature was associated with TMB but not survival in TCGA data.Conclusions: The IFNγ+ mRNA signature may assist in identifying patients with improved outcomes with durvalumab, independent of PD-L1 assessed by IHC.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nOutcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.\n## METHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.\n## FINDINGS\nPatients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7-16·4) for atezolizumab versus 9·7 months (8·6-12·0) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·53-0·99]; p=0·04). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22-1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0·54 [0·33-0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40-0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62-1·75; p=0·871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-γ-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy.\n## FUNDING\nF Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.\n"

Eligible patients were enrolled into one of six dose levels (DL) of Du ± Tr which included concomitant treatment with standard platinum-doublet regimens; (pemetrexed, gemcitabine, etoposide, (each with cisplatin or carboplatin) or nab-paclitaxel (with carboplatin)). Dose escalation was according to a Rolling Six type design. Both weight-based and fixed dosing of Du and Tr were explored. Du was continued until progression. Tr dosing was finite (up to 6 doses) with increasing dose and/or frequency by DL. 136 patients were enrolled. The majority of drug-related adverse events (AEs) were ≤ grade 2 and attributable to chemotherapy. AEs considered related to immunotherapy were mainly ≤ grade 2; the most frequent (occurring ≥10 %) were colitis/diarrhea, skin, and thyroid dysfunction. Seven patients had DLTs including pneumonitis, myocarditis, diarrhea, encephalitis, motor neuropathy, and enterocolitis. There were 2 treatment-related deaths. Tr and Du exposures did not appear affected by chemotherapy. Among the 73 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated, the objective response rate was 51 % (95 %CI = 38.7-62.6 %) with a median progression-free and overall survival of 6.5 months (95 % CI = 5.5-9.4 months) and 19.8 months (95 % CI = 14.8 months - not yet reached) respectively. Anti-tumour activity was observed across PD-L1 subtypes. Du 1500 mg q3w and Tr 75 mg q3wx5 can be safely combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Efficacy among NSCLC patients appears comparable to results from other immunotherapy and chemotherapy combination trials. NCT02537418."

PD-1 signaling negatively regulates T cell-mediated immune responses and serves as a mechanism for tumors to evade an antigen-specific T cell immunologic response. It plays a role in promoting cancer development and progression by enhancing tumor cell survival. With this background, PD-1 signaling represents a valuable therapeutic target for novel and effective cancer immunotherapy. Clinical data shows that blockade of this PD-1 signaling significantly enhance antitumor immunity, produce durable clinical responses, and prolong survival. Currently, there are three FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitors for various malignancies ranging from non-small cell lung cancer to Merkel cell carcinoma. This review is to summarize many ongoing phase II/III trials of atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and new PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical developments. In particular, we focus on key trials that paved the pathway to FDA-approved indications for atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. Despite the popularity and accelerated FDA approval of PD-L1 inhibitors, further considerations into predictive biomarkers, mechanisms of resistance, treatment duration, immune-related toxicities, and PD-L1 expression threshold are needed to optimize anticancer potential in this class of immunotherapy."

A significant and meaningful survival benefit for consolidation with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy compared to chemoradiotherapy alone was observed in the PACIFIC trial. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that this treatment modality is also effective in a neoadjuvant setting in early stages, whereas the role as adjuvant treatment after surgery needs to be determined.

In particular, antibodies blocking the inhibitory immune checkpoints programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are associated with higher response rates, improved overall survival and better tolerability as compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recently, ICI has moved from the second-line to the first-line setting for many patients with non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The next logical step is to examine this therapy in patients with non-metastatic NSCLC to improve long-term overall survival and cure rates. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, ICI with durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy has brought a major improvement in 2-year progression-free and overall survival, which holds promise for an improved cure rate. As the relapse pattern in patients with completely resected early-stage NSCLC is predominantly systemic, high expectations rest on the integration of ICI therapy in their treatment approach. A large number of studies with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant ICI are ongoing and will be discussed here. The advent of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy has brought a valid alternative treatment of patients unfit for or not willing to undergo surgery. Data on combining systemic therapy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy are virtually non-existent, but there is a strong biological rationale to combine radiotherapy and ICI therapy.

Antibodies that block this pathway offer a promising new approach to treatment in advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the association of PD-L1 with important patient and disease characteristics, the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expressing NSCLC tumors, and the value of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments in advanced/metastatic NSCLC. A total of 35 eligible studies were selected for analysis. Methods used to determine PD-L1 in NSCLC tissue varied considerably; with different PD-L1 antibodies, antibody detection methods, and staining cut-offs. Immunohistochemistry was the most frequent type of PD-L1 assay. Overall, study evidence did not support an association between PD-L1 expression and gender, age, smoking history, tumor histology (adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma), performance status, pathologic tumor grade or EGFR/KRAS/ALK mutational status. In several studies, high PD-L1 expression was associated with shorter survival compared with low expression. Most evidence indicated that patients with high vs. low PD-L1 expression were more likely to experience treatment benefit with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab, and avelumab) in advanced NSCLC. Variability in the methods used to determine PD-L1 expression in NSCLC tissue suggests a need for standardized use of well-validated PD-L1 diagnostic assays. Although considerable research links PD-L1 expression in tumors to shorter survival in advanced/metastatic NSCLC, its use as a prognostic factor requires more study. As studies of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents continue, PD-L1 is likely to play an important role as a predictive biomarker for selecting patients deriving most benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and directing patients with lower levels of tumor PD-L1 expression (with a high unmet medical need), to alternative treatments, such as combination immunotherapies."

The novel immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) presents as the therapeutic 'Holly Grail' in lung cancer treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC. Many clinical trials are ongoing in the field of immunoradiotherapy in LA-NSCLC to define the optimal conditions for this therapeutic combination."

This paper reviews the clinical evidence end of 2017 and discusses the clinical development programs of atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab in GI-tract cancers. Since 2014, these antagonists of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have gained approval for use in numerous other tumors. Phase II trials and phase I expansion cohorts demonstrate clinical activity in patients with oesophageal, gastric, colorectal, anal and hepatic cancer. Signals of outstanding efficacy are particularly observed in biomarker selected populations and for certain combination regimen. Comprehensive phase III development programs have been initiated in oesophageal and gastric cancer, with randomized trials ongoing in hepatocellular and colorectal cancer as well."

An increasing number of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been recognized with their use. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of sarcoid-like pulmonary lymphadenopathy associated with durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody against programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). A 76-year-old woman received adjuvant durvalumab for Stage IIA pT2aN1M0 (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Seventh edition) poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. After three cycles, a sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction was identified in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Although the lymphadenopathy remained stable in size with the ongoing treatment, progressive intracranial metastases were identified after a further three cycles of durvalumab. Sarcoid-like inflammation with the formation of non-caseating granulomas in the absence of systemic sarcoidosis is an irAE which may mimic disease progression. Although a subset of patients who experience this reaction may have a favourable response to checkpoint inhibition, progression of disease may occur contemporaneously."

            "abstract": "In the biology of multiple myeloma (MM), immune dysregulation has emerged as a critical component for novel therapeutic strategies. This dysfunction is due to a reduced antigen presentation, a reduced effector cell ability and a loss of reactive T cells against myeloma, together with a bone marrow microenvironment that favors immune escape. The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) pathway is associated with the regulation of T cell activation and with the apoptotic pathways of effector memory T cells. Specifically, the binding with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) on the surface of tumor plasma cells down-regulates T cell-proliferation, thus contributing to the immune escape of tumor cells. In relapsed and/or refractory MM (RRMM) patients, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade was analyzed by using nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab. Outcomes with single agents were unsatisfactory, whereas combination strategies with backbone immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) suggested a synergistic action in such a complex immunological landscape, even in patients previously refractory to these drugs. Nevertheless, these combinations were also associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. This review aims to analyze the available preclinical and clinical data on the role of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in MM therapy, focusing on available preliminary efficacy and safety data and offering insights for future investigation."

            "abstract": "Background: Selecting patients who potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is critical. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein immunohistochemical expression on cancer cells or immune cells and next-generation sequencing-based tumor mutational burden (TMB) are hot spots in studies on ICIs, but there is still confusion in the testing methods. Because blood samples are much easier for clinical application, many potential peripheral biomarkers have been proposed. This study identified blood parameters associated with the outcome of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ICI monotherapy. Materials and Methods: Data from 76 NSCLC patients were analyzed retrospectively. To assess the connection between survival and peripheral blood markers measured before the first and fifth doses of ICI treatment, we utilized Cox regression model survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess the markers. Results: In the nivolumab cohort, the optimal cutoffs for predicting 11-month overall survival (OS) were 168.13 and 43 g/L for platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and albumin, respectively. When patients were grouped with PLR and albumin, a significant difference in SD-PR vs. PD rate was found between the high and low groups, which was not found when the patients were grouped by PD-L1 expression. Patients with high PLR (>168.13) or low albumin ( ≤ 43 g/L) before ICI had a significantly increased hazard of progression, separately (for PLR, P = 0.006; for albumin, P = 0.033), and of death (for PLR, P = 0.014; for albumin, P = 0.009) compared with those patients who had low PLR or albumin levels. More importantly, we found that a higher PLR (>168.13) before the fifth dose of ICIs was also a prognostic biomarker, which significantly correlated with shorter OS in both the nivolumab (P = 0.046) and durvalumab cohorts (P = 0.028). Conclusions: PLR and albumin may help in the stratification of high progression and death risk groups in advanced NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab and durvalumab monotherapy."

This study aimed to compare the staining properties of tumor cells between the antibody clones 28-8, 22C3, SP142, and SP263 and investigate interrater variation between pathologists to see if these stainings can be safely evaluated in the clinical setting. Using consecutive sections from a tissue microarray with tumor tissue from 55 resected lung cancer cases, staining with five PD-L1 assays (28-8 from two different vendors, 22C3, SP142, and SP263) was performed. Seven pathologists individually evaluated the percentage of positive tumor cells, scoring each sample applying cutoff levels used in clinical studies: <1% positive tumor cells (score 0), 1-4% (score 1), 5-9% (score 2), 10-24% (score 3), 25-49% (score 4), and >50% positive tumor cells (score 5). Pairwise analysis of antibody clones showed weighted kappa values in the range of 0.45-0.91 with the highest values for comparisons with 22C3 and 28-8 and the lowest involving SP142. Excluding SP142 resulted in kappa 0.75-0.91. Weighted kappa for interobserver variation between pathologists was 0.71-0.96. Up to 20% of the cases were differently classified as positive or negative by any pathologist compared with consensus score using ≥1% positive tumor cells as cutoff. A significantly better agreement between pathologists was seen using ≥50% as cutoff (0-5% of cases). In conclusion, the concordance between the PD-L1 antibodies 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 is relatively good when evaluating lung cancers and suggests that any one of these assays may be sufficient as basis for decision on treatment with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab. The scoring of the pathologist presents an intrinsic source of error that should be considered especially at low PD-L1 scores."

Currently, sorafenib remains the only established systemic therapy proven to increase the overall survival of patients with advanced disease. The approval of sorafenib in 2007 ushered in the era of targeted therapies. Several phase 2 and 3 clinical trials have failed however to improve on sorafenib in the first-line setting, and no single agent has been demonstrated to impact outcomes after sorafenib failure.

The primary strategy is centered on unleashing the immune system by releasing the inhibitory signals propagated by programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Many antibody constructs have been developed to block these interactions and are used in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab. One of the latest inhibitors is durvalumab, which is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Currently, there are a number of ongoing trials in advanced urothelial carcinoma both using durvalumab monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapies. In addition, durvalumab is being investigated in the non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is centered around intravenous formulations.

Median age of patients was 67 years (range, 43-89), with a male to female ratio of 21:10. The main disease requiring PD-1 inhibitor treatment was non-small cell lung cancer. Agents that caused PD-1 inhibitor-related SC were nivolumab (19 cases), pembrolizumab (10 cases), avelumab (1 case), and durvalumab (1 case). The median number of cycles until PD-1 inhibitor-related SC onset was 5.5 (range, 1-27). Abdominal pain or discomfort (35.5%, 11/31) was the most frequent symptom. Blood serum tests identified liver dysfunction with a notable increase in biliary tract enzymes relative to hepatic enzymes, and a normal level of serum immunoglobulin G4. Biliary dilation without obstruction (76.9%, 20/26), diffuse hypertrophy of the extrahepatic biliary tract (90.5%, 19/21), and multiple strictures of the intrahepatic biliary tract (30.4%, 7/23) were noted. In 11/23 (47.8%) cases, pathological examination indicated that CD8+ T cells were the dominant inflammatory cells in the bile duct or peribiliary tract. Although corticosteroids were mainly used for PD inhibitor-related SC treatment, the response rate was 11.5% (3/26).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Some clinical and pathological features of PD-1 inhibitor-related SC were revealed.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a welcome option for patients with different malignancies. This is in part because they offer the possibility of durable benefit, even for patients who have failed other treatment modalities. The recent demonstration that immunotherapy is effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a milestone in the history of this recalcitrant disease. The treatment of HCC has been a challenge, and for many years was limited to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib and to several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have shown efficacy and have been approved. The current role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of HCC, and how this role is likely to evolve in the years ahead, are key. Other than efforts evaluating single checkpoint inhibitors, potential combination strategies, including combinations with existing local and systemic approaches, including novel therapies are evolving. This is understandably of special interest considering the potential unique immune system of the liver, which may impact the use of immunotherapy in patients with HCC going forward, and how can it be enhanced further."

ICIs enhance T cell activation through various mechanisms and may help reverse the exhausted phenotype of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. However, disrupting the key role that checkpoint molecules play in immune homeostasis may result in autoimmune complications. A broad range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involve almost every organ but mostly affect the skin, digestive system, lung, endocrine glands, nervous system, kidney, blood cells, and musculoskeletal system. They are usually manageable but can be life-threatening. The incidence of irAEs is not very different in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to other tumour types, although there is a trend towards a higher incidence of hepatic irAEs. HCC usually develops on a background of cirrhosis with associated systemic manifestations. Extrahepatic organ dysfunction in cirrhosis may cause signs and symptoms that overlap with irAEs or increase their severity. Available guidelines for the management of irAEs have not specifically considered the assessment of toxicities in the context of patients with liver cancer and cirrhosis. This review addresses the toxicity profile of ICIs in patients with HCC, focusing on the challenges that the underlying liver disease poses to their diagnosis and management. Challenges include late recognition, inadequate work-up and delayed treatment, overdiagnosis and inappropriate interruption of ICIs, complications caused by immunosuppressive therapy, and increased cost. A specific algorithm for the management of hepatic irAEs is provided."

Nevertheless, new therapies have emerged recently, among which PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as nivolumab (OPDIVO®, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, Merck & Co), or PD-L1 ICI, such as atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®, Genentech), durvalumab (IMFINZI®, Astra-Zeneca), and avelumab (BAVENCIO®, EMD Serono). The prescription of pembrolizumab for advanced stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients requires the demonstration of PD-L1 expression by tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (minimum of 50% of positive tumor cells is required for first-line setting, and of 1% for second-line and beyond) and PD-L1 assay is now considered as a companion diagnostic tool for this drug. Numerous standardized PD-L1 assays performed on dedicated platforms have been validated in clinical trials, each antibody being associated to one specific PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. However, not all pathologists have access to the dedicated platforms and the high cost of these assays is still a limitation to their implementation; in addition, the small size of the NSCLC tumor samples does not allow to perform at the same time multiple assays for multiple drugs. The use of laboratory-developed tests seems feasible but their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as standardized tests. In this context, the French group of thoracic pathologists PATTERN has teamed up with thoracic oncologists to provide recommendations on the indication, the critical technical steps and the interpretation of the PD-L1 IHC test to help pathologists to implement quickly and in the best conditions this new theranostic test."

However, more effective treatments are needed. We evaluated the nab-paclitaxel and durvalumab combination in patients with previously treated advanced stage NSCLC. Methods: Patients with advanced stage NSCLC previously treated with one line of platinum-based doublet with or without an ICB and no activating EGFR mutations or ALK translocations received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8) plus durvalumab 1,125 mg (day 15) every 21 days. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Results: Between February 2016 and December 2016, 79 patients were enrolled. The median age was 63 years. Most patients were males (68.4%), had non-squamous histology (69.6%), and had no prior ICB treatment (88.6%). The median PFS was 4.5 months; median OS was 10.1 months.

Expert opinion: Available data suggest that, in both metastatic NSCLC and SCLC, combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade may produce a higher tumor response rate than PD-1 blockade alone. Nevertheless, combination therapy is associated with an increased toxicity. Several larger-scale studies are currently ongoing. For checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in SCLC and NSCLC, combination therapy is associated with a higher incidence of toxicities than single therapy; however, it appears to help increase tumor response rate.

In the treatment of metastatic melanoma, combinations of checkpoint inhibitors are more effective than single-agent inhibitors, but combination immunotherapy is associated with increased frequency and severity of toxicity. There are questions about the use of combination immunotherapy or single-agent anti-PD-1 as initial therapy and the number of doses of either approach required to sustain a response. In this article, we describe a novel use of sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to evaluate immune checkpoint inhibitors to find treatment regimens that adapt within an individual based on intermediate response and lead to the longest overall survival. We provide a hypothetical example SMART design for BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma as a framework for investigating immunotherapy treatment regimens. We compare implementing a SMART design to implementing multiple traditional randomized clinical trials. We illustrate the benefits of a SMART over traditional trial designs and acknowledge the complexity of a SMART.

However, this immunotherapy agent is also being explored in other cancers. There is also ongoing research to better predict the responses to this drug. Areas covered: We summarize the literature regarding durvalumab pharmacology, safety and efficacy in several tumor types. We searched PubMed/Medline database from inception to 20 April 2019, performed a snowball method, and visited independent websites such as the U.S. FDA ( https://www.fda.gov ), ClinicalTrials.gov, among others. Expert opinion: Advanced phase clinical trials have shown benefit of durvalumab in advanced urothelial and non-small cell lung cancers, and suggest benefit in several other tumor types. This agent has a tolerable toxicity profile and seems more effective in patients with a higher PDL-1 expression, although this correlation is not perfect. An improved method to predict a response to durvalumab would be beneficial to best tailor therapy and minimize medical care costs. More research is needed to establish its efficacy in different disease stages and applicability in other tumor types. Hopefully, prospective, randomized trials of durvalumab, alone and/or in combination with other agents, will bring answers to these questions in the near future."

The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI's) in the context of recurrent/metastatic (R/M) setting anticipates the possible integration of immunotherapy into the therapeutic armamentarium of locally advanced disease. Durvalumab (DUR) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1, anti-PD-L1 antibody with promising data in R/M HNSCC. The aim of our study is to test the antitumor activity of a combined regimen incorporating an immune checkpoint inhibitor into a conventional bio-radiation strategy for the cure of unfavorable locally advanced HNSCC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      In this open label, multi-center, single-arm, phase I/II study, enrolled patients will receive Radiotherapy (RT) (69.9 Gy/2.12 Gy in 33 fractions) with concurrent Cetuximab (CTX) (400 mg/m2 1 week before RT start followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly) and DUR (fixed dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks starting from RT-CTX week 1) followed by adjuvant DUR (to a maximum of 6 months after completion of RT-CTX).

Although immunotherapy as an effective treatment dates back to the live, attenuated bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, the recent impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) coupled with the promise of both anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies and indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) inhibitors have provided a resurgence. To date, pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, has been granted full FDA approval based on its high antitumor activity, tolerability, and efficacy, with notable prolonged durable responses in the second-line setting. Nivolumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab (PD-L1 inhibitors) have also gained accelerated drug approval in the second-line setting. In addition, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab have been approved for platinum-ineligible patients in the first-line setting. Effective 2-drug combinations reported include nivolumab plus the CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab and pembrolizumab plus the IDO-1 inhibitor epacadostat. Further expansion of immunotherapy will hinge in part on the ability to define responders versus nonresponders through the use of biomarkers like PD-L1 or mutational load. Clinical trials with immunotherapy for metastatic disease as single agents or in combination are ongoing. This review explores the rise of immunotherapy and presents the current treatments and challenges posed with development of biomarkers, and provides a summary of ongoing phase III clinical trials."

Moreover, we observed high and interrelated rates of PD-L1 positive macrophages and regulatory T cells in metastatic lymph nodes of cervical cancer patients. As cervical cancer in general initially metastasizes to regional lymph nodes, local administration of durvalumab (a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor) at an early stage will deliver these antibodies exactly where they are needed, facilitating immune protection.

In addition, we analyze the differences in incidence of pneumonitis between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and standard-of-care chemotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PubMed was searched up to 24 March 2017 for clinical trials of PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) in treatment of NSCLC. Besides, references of relevant articles were screened.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Finally, 22 trials were included in our study, 14 with data of pneumonitis, 19 with other severe IRAEs or treatment related deaths and 5 with control groups. Incidence of all-grade pneumonitis was 2.9% (95% CI, 2.0-4.8%) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-2.0%). Incidence of all-grade pneumonitis in PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor therapy (n=1,313) was significantly higher than that in chemotherapy (n=918) (OR=2.35, 95% CI, 1.32-4.20, P=0.004), but had no significance in grade 3-5 pneumonitis. Incidence of cardiorespiratory arrest (n=537) was 1.0% (95% CI, 0-2.0%), cardiac failure (n=214) 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-5.7%), myocardial infarction (n=402) 1.0% (95% CI, 0-3.8%), stroke (n=135) 2.0% (95% CI, 0-13.0%), disease progression (n=391) 1.0% (95% CI, 0-2.9%), pancreatitis (n=700) 1.0% (95% CI, 0-2.0%) and severe skin reactions (n=836) 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-3.8%). Incidence of treatment related deaths was 0.7%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Immune related adverse effects can on occasion be life-threatening even though usually rare. Incidence of pneumonitis in PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was significantly higher than that in chemotherapy. More studies should be conducted to investigate the incidence of these rare but life-threatening IRAEs."

Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was assessed as treatment for this condition.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 361 patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard, single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was overall survival. Additional end points included progression-free survival, rate of objective response, safety, and patient-reported quality of life.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the group that received standard therapy. Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P=0.01), and the estimates of the 1-year survival rate were approximately 19 percentage points higher with nivolumab than with standard therapy (36.0% vs. 16.6%). The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13; P=0.32). The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy. The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard-therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard-therapy group. Physical, role, and social functioning was stable in the nivolumab group, whereas it was meaningfully worse in the standard-therapy group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treatment with nivolumab resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with standard, single-agent therapy.

In 2017, the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab and the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab gained approval for use in cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced and metastatic UC. These approvals were based on single-arm trials, IMvigor210 (atezolizumab) and KEYNOTE-052 (pembrolizumab). Since then, additional checkpoint inhibitors, including avelumab, durvalumab, and nivolumab, have gained approval. Preliminary results suggest additional benefits with combinations of these agents in both first- and subsequent-line therapies, inferring a paradigm shift in the future treatment approach in advanced UC. Ongoing clinical trials will investigate how to utilize predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection and to incorporate immunotherapy into earlier lines of multimodal treatment.

            "abstract": "Concomitant radiochemotherapy has been the standard of care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), irrespective of histological sub-type or molecular characteristics. Currently, only 15-30 % of patients are alive five years after radiochemotherapy, and this figure remains largely unchanged despite multiple phase III randomised trials. In recent years, immune-checkpoint blockades with anti-PD-(L)1 have revolutionised the care of metastatic NSCLC, becoming the standard front- and second-line strategy. Several preclinical studies reported an increased tumour antigen release, improved antigen presentation, and T-cell infiltration in irradiated tumours. Immunotherapy has therefore recently been evaluated for patients with locally advanced stage III NSCLC. Following the PACIFIC trial, the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab antibody has emerged as a new standard consolidative treatment for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concomitant platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. Immunoradiotherapy therefore appears to be a promising association in patients with localised NSCLC. Many trials are currently evaluating the value of concomitant immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy and/or consolidative chemotherapy with immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC."

In most limited stage (LS)-SCLC cases, the standard initial therapy remains concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), typically with an etoposide and platinum-based regimen. Hyperfractionated twice daily (BID) RT remains the standard of care, though conventional daily (QD) RT is now a viable alternative supported by randomized evidence. In LS-SCLC patients who experienced good response to CRT, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) remains the standard of care. Brain imaging, ideally with MRI, should be performed prior to PCI to screen for clinically apparent brain metastases that may require a higher dose of cranial irradiation. Platinum doublet chemotherapy alone is the historic standard initial therapy in extensive stage (ES)-SCLC.

Durvalumab use is associated with increased immune-related adverse events. We report a case of a 55-year-old man who presented to our emergency room with hyperglycaemia after receiving durvalumab for urothelial high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. On presentation, he had polyuria, polyphagia, nausea and vomiting, and laboratory test revealed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Other than durvalumab, no precipitating factors were identified. Pre-durvalumab blood glucose was normal. The patient responded to treatment with intravenous fluids, insulin and electrolyte replacement. Simultaneously, he presented a thyroid hormone pattern that evolved in 10 weeks from subclinical hyperthyroidism (initially attributed to iodinated contrast used in a previous computerised tomography) to overt hyperthyroidism and then to severe primary hypothyroidism (TSH: 34.40 µU/mL, free thyroxine (FT4): <0.23 ng/dL and free tri-iodothyronine (FT3): 0.57 pg/mL). Replacement therapy with levothyroxine was initiated. Finally, he was tested positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) and antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (Abs) and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and silent thyroiditis caused by durvalumab. When durvalumab was stopped, he maintained the treatment of multiple daily insulin doses and levothyroxine. Clinicians need to be alerted about the development of endocrinopathies, such as DM, DKA and primary hypothyroidism in the patients receiving durvalumab.\n    \n\n\n          Learning points:\n        \n      \n      Patients treated with anti-PD-L1 should be screened for the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

Response rates were 25% in all 40 patients and 40% in the 20 uninfected patients, both of which are encouraging. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation can activate tumor immunogenicity by releasing tumor-associated antigen and by inducing the migration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to small intrahepatic metastatic nodules. Subsequent administration of anti-PD-1 antibody could control these small intrahepatic metastatic nodules. In a nonclinical study, the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib inhibited the cancer immunosuppressive environments induced by tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells. This, in turn, decreased the levels of TGF-β and IL-10, the expression of PD-1, and the inhibition of Tim-3, triggering anticancer immunity mediated by immunostimulatory cytokines such as IL-12.

This phase 3 study was designed to assess atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here, we report the comparison of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab monotherapy versus regorafenib in the third-line setting.\n## METHODS\nIMblaze 370 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, done at 73 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in 11 countries. Patients aged at least 18 years with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and disease progression on or intolerance to at least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. We used permuted-block randomisation (block size four) to assign patients (2:1:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to atezolizumab (840 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle), atezolizumab monotherapy (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks), or regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Stratification factors were extended RAS status (wild-type vs mutant) and time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs ≥18 months). Recruitment of patients with high microsatellite instability was capped at 5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. IMblaze370 is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788279.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 363 patients were enrolled (183 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 90 in the regorafenib group). At data cutoff (March 9, 2018), median follow-up was 7·3 months (IQR 3·7-13·6). Median overall survival was 8·87 months (95% CI 7·00-10·61) with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 7·10 months (6·05-10·05) with atezolizumab, and 8·51 months (6·41-10·71) with regorafenib; the hazard ratio was 1·00 (95% CI 0·73-1·38; p=0·99) for the combination versus regorafenib and 1·19 (0·83-1·71; p=0·34) for atezolizumab versus regorafenib. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 109 (61%) of 179 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 28 (31%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 46 (58%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. The most common all-cause grade 3-4 adverse events in the combination group were diarrhoea (20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue (eight [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the regorafenib group.

            "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the most common cause of cancer-related death. Non-small-cell lung cancer comprises ~87% of newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer, and nearly one-third of these patients have stage III disease. Despite improvements in the treatment of stage IV lung cancer, particularly with the introduction and dissemination of checkpoint inhibitors, very little progress has been made in the treatment of stage III lung cancer. In this article, we discuss the general staging criteria and treatment options for stage III lung cancer. We review how concurrent radiation and chemotherapy can have immunomodulatory effects, supporting the rationale for incorporating immunotherapy into existing treatment paradigms. Finally, we discuss the results of the PACIFIC trial and implications for the treatment of stage III lung cancer. In the PACIFIC trial, adding durvalumab as a maintenance therapy following the completion of chemoradiotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable stage III lung cancer. On the strength of these results, durvalumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in this setting, representing the first advance in the treatment of stage III lung cancer in nearly a decade."

            "abstract": "Checkpoint receptor blockers, known to act by blocking the pathways that inhibit immune cell activation and stimulate immune responses against tumor cells, have been immensely successful in the treatment of cancer. Among several checkpoint receptors of immune cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), T-cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) are the most commonly targeted checkpoints for cancer immunotherapy. Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile. This review aims to help in design of optimal checkpoint blocker combinations by discussing the mechanistic details and outlining the subtle differences between major checkpoints targeted for cancer immunotherapy."

            "abstract": "The treatment of cancer, especially of various types of solid tumors, has been revolutionized by the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Their success amongst hematologic malignancies, however, has been limited so far to the treatment of classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, which portrays a typical overexpression of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) as a consequence of changes in chromosome 9p24.1. Their current application in multiple myeloma (MM) is rather uncertain, as discordant results have been reported by distinct research groups concerning especially the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on malignant plasma cells or on the responsible immune effector cell populations, respectively. In MM it seems that an approach based on combination treatment might be appropriate as unsatisfactory results have been yielded by monotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Immunomodulatory drugs, which are the current cornerstone of MM treatment, are the most logical partners as they possess many possibly synergistic effects. Nevertheless, the initially optimistic results have become disappointing due to the excessive and unpredictable toxicity of the combination of pembrolizumab with lenalidomide or pomalidomide. The FDA has suspended or put on hold several phase 3 trials in relapsed as well as in newly diagnosed myeloma patients. There are also other potentially synergistic and promising combinations, such as the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab, irradiation, etc. Not only the effective partner but also the correct timing of the initiation of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment seems to be of utmost importance. These strategies are currently being examined in various stages of myeloma such as during consolidation post autologous stem cell transplantation, targeting minimal residual disease or even in high risk smoldering myeloma."

Several drugs targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved or are in the late stages of development. Inevitably, the introduction of these drugs will put pressure on healthcare systems, and there is a need to stratify patients to identify those who are most likely to benefit from such treatment. There is evidence that responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors may be predicted by expression of PD-L1 on neoplastic cells. Hence, there is considerable interest in using PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining to guide the use of PD-1-targeted treatments in patients with NSCLC. This article reviews the current knowledge about PD-L1 testing, and identifies current research requirements. Key factors to consider include the source and timing of sample collection, pre-analytical steps (sample tracking, fixation, tissue processing, sectioning, and tissue prioritization), analytical decisions (choice of biomarker assay/kit and automated staining platform, with verification of standardized assays or validation of laboratory-devised techniques, internal and external quality assurance, and audit), and reporting and interpretation of the results. This review addresses the need for integration of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry with other tests as part of locally agreed pathways and protocols.

The cancer cells use mechanisms able to avoid the immune control has led to the development of drugs able to overcome this escape route. The best known checkpoint pathways are the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1; they suppress T-cell activity in different ways: CTLA-4 regulates T-cell activity at an early stage whereas PD-1 regulates later effector T-cell activity within tissue and tumors.

The recent approval of the CTLA-4-blocking antibody ipilimumab for the treatment of melanoma was a watershed event, opening up a new era in the field of immunotherapy. Ipilimumab was the first treatment to ever show enhanced overall survival (OS) for patients with stage IV melanoma. However, measuring response rates using standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or modified World Health Organization criteria or progression-free survival does not accurately capture the potential for clinical benefit for ipilimumab-treated patients. As immunotherapy approaches are translated into more tumor types, it is important to study biomarkers, which may be more predictive of OS to identify the patients most likely to have clinical benefit. Ipilimumab is the first-in-class of a series of immunomodulating antibodies that are in clinical development. Anti-PD1 (nivolumab and MK-3475), anti-PD-L1 (BMS-936 559, RG7446, and MEDI4736), anti-CD137 (urelumab), anti-OX40, anti-GITR, and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies are just some of the agents that are being actively investigated in clinical trials, each having the potential for combination with the ipilimumab to enhance its effectiveness. Development of rational combinations of immunomodulatory antibodies with small-molecule pathway inhibitor therapies such as vemurafenib makes the discovery of predictive biomarkers even more important.

In computational docking studies, we observed that PD-L1-targeted monoclonal antibodies (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab) and a high-affinity PD-L1-binding peptide, WL12, have common interaction sites on PD-L1. Using the peptide radiotracer [64Cu]WL12 in vivo, we employed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies in multiple xenograft models and demonstrated that variable PD-L1 expression and its saturation by atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab can be quantified independently of biophysical properties and pharmacokinetics of antibodies. Next, we used [64Cu]WL12 to evaluate the impact of time and dose on the unoccupied fraction of tumor PD-L1 during treatment. These quantitative measures enabled, by mathematical modeling, prediction of antibody doses needed to achieve therapeutically effective occupancy (defined as >90%).

Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer-cell plasticity give rise to therapeutic resistance and recurrence through clonal replacement and reactivation of dormant CSCs, respectively. WNT signaling cascades cross-talk with the FGF, Notch, Hedgehog and TGFβ/BMP signaling cascades and regulate expression of functional CSC markers, such as CD44, CD133 (PROM1), EPCAM and LGR5 (GPR49). Aberrant canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in human malignancies, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovary, pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers, leukemia and melanoma, are involved in CSC survival, bulk-tumor expansion and invasion/metastasis. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics, such as anti-FZD1/2/5/7/8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (vantictumab), anti-LGR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (mAb-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE), anti-PTK7 ADC (PF-06647020), anti-ROR1 mAb (cirmtuzumab), anti-RSPO3 mAb (rosmantuzumab), small-molecule porcupine inhibitors (ETC-159, WNT-C59 and WNT974), tankyrase inhibitors (AZ1366, G007-LK, NVP-TNKS656 and XAV939) and β-catenin inhibitors (BC2059, CWP232228, ICG-001 and PRI-724), are in clinical trials or preclinical studies for the treatment of patients with WNT-driven cancers. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics are applicable for combination therapy with BCR-ABL, EGFR, FLT3, KIT or RET inhibitors to treat a subset of tyrosine kinase-driven cancers because WNT and tyrosine kinase signaling cascades converge to β-catenin for the maintenance and expansion of CSCs. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics might also be applicable for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockers, such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, to treat cancers with immune evasion, although the context-dependent effects of WNT signaling on immunity should be carefully assessed. Omics monitoring, such as genome sequencing and transcriptome tests, immunohistochemical analyses on PD-L1 (CD274), PD-1 (PDCD1), ROR1 and nuclear β-catenin and organoid-based drug screening, is necessary to determine the appropriate WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics for cancer patients."

The two best-known inhibitory immune checkpoints are cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1).

Encouraging results from recent clinical trials (a response rate above 50% in a relapsed setting) justify further clinical use.

Regarding the predictive factor, PD-L1 expression on cancer cells is the only biomarker validated in prospective clinical trials used for qualification to immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, it is not an ideal one. Unfortunately, no clinical benefits could be noted in patients with high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells against the effectiveness of immunotherapy that may be observed in patients without PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, the mechanism of antitumor immune response is extremely complex, multistage, and depends on many factors. Cancer cells could be recognized by the immune system, provided tumor-specific antigen presentation, and these arise as a result of somatic mutations in tumor cells. Based on novel immunotherapy registration, high tumor mutation burden (TMB) has become an important predictive factor. The intensity of lymphocyte infiltration in tumor tissue may be another predictive factor. The effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy is observed in patients with high expression of genes associated with the effector function of T lymphocytes (i.e., their ability to produce IFN-gamma). This does not end the list of potential factors that become useful in qualification of cancer patients for immunotherapy. There remains a need to search for new and perfect predictive factors for immunotherapy."

Targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitors represents a standard option for advanced NSCLC. Improvements in understanding of the immune profile of NSCLC has led to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules responsible for abrogating an anticancer immune response such as programmed cell-death 1 and programmed cell-death ligand 1. A recently published phase III trial (PACIFIC) showed for the first time an improved overall survival in stage III NSCLC patients with consolidative durvalumab.

This study sought to evaluate the occurrence and nature of vasculitis associated with cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-1, anti-PDL-1, and anti-CTLA4). A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted by searching all available clinical data up to February 2018 in several databases and search engines including Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Clinicaltrials.gov . Searches included the following FDA-approved anti-PD1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PDL1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab). The vasculitis cases were compiled and classified based on the 2012 revised Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature. The clinical feature of the vasculitis cases and their relationship to immune checkpoint inhibition was assessed. There were 53 cases of vasculitis of which 20 were confirmed. The main reported type of vasculitis was large vessel vasculitis and vasculitis of the central and peripheral nervous system. All cases resolved with either holding the immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or administering glucocorticoids. No death related to vasculitis was reported. Vasculitis, namely large vessel and vasculitis of the nervous system, is associated with immune checkpoint inhibition.

New data on targeted therapies confirmed previous findings, with combined BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) plus MEK inhibitor (cobimetinib) improving progression-free survival (PFS) compared to vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive tumors (CoBRIM trial). Positive results were also seen with combined dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and encorafenib plus binimetinib in BRAFV600-mutant cutaneous melanoma. Even more interesting news centered on the use of combination immunotherapy, in particular the randomized, double-blind CheckMate 067 study in which median PFS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was 11.5 months, compared to 2.9 months with ipilimumab alone (HR 0.42) and 6.9 months with nivolumab alone (HR 0.57). Of interest, in patients with ≥5% PD-L1 expression, median PFS was 14 months with the combination or with nivolumab alone compared with 3.9 months in the ipilimumab group, while in the PD-L1 negative cohort, the combination remained superior to both monotherapies. Given that combination therapy was accompanied by a high occurrence of side-effects, this raises the suggestion that combination therapy might be reserved for PD-L1 negative patients only, with PD-L1 positive patients achieving the same benefit from nivolumab monotherapy. However, overall survival data are awaited and the equivalence of single agent to the combination remains unconvincing. Interesting data were also reported on the combination of T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec) with ipilimumab, and the anti-PD-1 agent MEDI4736 (durvolumab) combined with dabrafenib plus trametinib. Emerging data also suggested that predictive markers based on immunoprofiling and mismatch repair deficiency may be of clinical use. In conclusion, the use of combination approaches to treat patients with melanoma, as well as other cancers, is no longer a just a wish for the future but is today a clinical reality with a rapidly growing evidence-base. Moreover, the most exciting consideration is that this is far from the end of the story, but rather a fantastic introduction."

The prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC."

Durvalumab (antiprogrammed cell death ligand-1) has enhanced the efficacy outcomes after cCRT for patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. Recently, durvalumab combined with platinum-etoposide demonstrated a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-etoposide as first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage SCLC and has also shown antitumor activity as monotherapy and combined with tremelimumab (anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4) in pretreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

Approximately 600 patients with documented histologic or cytologic LS-SCLC, World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and no progression after 4 cycles of cCRT will be randomized (1:1:1) to treatment (durvalumab 1500 mg plus placebo every 4 weeks [q4w] for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 75 mg q4w for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; or dual placebo q4w for 4 cycles, followed by single placebo q4w) within 1 to 42 days of completing cCRT, stratified by stage and receipt of prophylactic brain irradiation. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival rates, objective response rate, and safety and tolerability. Recruitment began in September 2018."

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed rapid advances in the discovery and development of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer medicine, particularly drugs targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proven antitumor efficacy coupled with low rates of drug-related toxicities observed, albeit idiosyncratic, with these novel immunotherapeutics have led to the registration of multiple PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, in second-line advanced NSCLC, whereas durvalumab and avelumab are in late-phase clinical testing. Moreover, pembrolizumab has shown a survival advantage in the first-line setting; however, nivolumab failed to show a survival benefit possibly relating to patient selection based on PD-L1 expression. Current patient selection is based on PD-L1 expression, using the relevant companion diagnostic test, where patients with strong PD-L1 expression being more likely to respond to these novel agents. Ongoing clinical research focuses on the development of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant NSCLC. There is also much interest in using these drugs as a therapeutic backbone for rational combinations with other treatment modalities including cytotoxic chemotherapies in the first-line NSCLC, other immunotherapies such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antagonists, molecularly targeted agents including EGFR and ALK inhibitors, and radiotherapy. Concurrent treatment with radiotherapy is of particular interest owing to the potential for the abscopal effect, using radiotherapy to facilitate systemic treatment."

This randomized, double-blind phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks.

The standard treatment for these patients is definitive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (CCRT). Although the goal of treatment in this setting is to achieve a cure, most patients progress and their prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 15-30%. There is thus an urgent need for the development of novel anticancer treatments in this patient population. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to a marked improvement in clinical outcome for advanced NSCLC. Such immunotherapy mainly consists of the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as antibodies to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) or to either programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells to PD-1 on T cells. The PACIFIC study recently evaluated consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab versus placebo administered after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. It revealed a significant improvement in both progression-free and overall survival with durvalumab, and this improvement was associated with a favorable safety profile. This achievement has made durvalumab a standard of care for consolidation after CCRT in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, and it has now been approved in this setting by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and the United Arab Emirates. In this review, we briefly summarize the results of the PACIFIC trial, including those of post hoc analysis, and we address possible molecular mechanisms, perspectives, and remaining questions related to combined treatment with CCRT and ICIs in this patient population."

Normally, the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 alters the immune activity by modulating it to inhibit autoimmune diseases or chronic inflammation. However, some cancers use this route to block the immune response of the patient and continue growing. The new immunotherapy against bladder cancer aims to block the ability of tumor cells to resist patient' immune response by acting on the checkpoints of immune cells. These drugs are able to block the PD-1 receptor present on the surface of the lymphocytes, or the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands expressed by the cancer cells; this would prevent the binding of both blocking the immunomodulatory signal and allowing the T cells continue active against the tumor. The therapeutic target of Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab is PD-1, the receptor protein of PD-L1 in immune cells. The rest of molecules approved for different types of cancer such as Atezolizumab, Avelumab or Durvalumab act on the PD-L1 protein that is expressed in high concentrations in some cancer cells. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients for whom previously there were few options for durable responses, including those who are ineligible for cisplatin-based regimens or who are at risk of significant toxicity. This review describes the most recent data on agents that inhibit PD-L1, found on the surface of tumor cells, and PD-1 found on activated T and B cells and macrophages.

More recently, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

In patients with ICI-induced SG dysfunction, 60% progress to fulfill classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), owing to immune foci in SGs and/or anti-SSA autoantibody positivity. We report the SG tissue analysis of a patient with SG dysfunction after treatment with a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, compared to that of a dry mouth (\"sicca\") control and pSS patient. Case presentation: The patient received the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks by intravenous infusion) as adjuvant treatment for stage 3 non-small cell lung carcinoma, following concurrent chemo radiotherapy. At 43 weeks after 21 cycles of Durvalumab, the patient was not capable of producing unstimulated or stimulated parotid gland saliva, and a biopsy was taken. Immunohistochemical analysis showed no classical AQP5+ CK7- acinar cell clusters (CK7 marks intercalated ducts, IDs). In contrast, the parenchyma was dominated by hybrid epithelial \"structures\" with ID-like morphology, containing a mixture of AQP5+CK7-, AQP5-CK7+, and AQP5+CK7+ cells (30 structures/mm2). These structures were present at lower frequencies in sicca control (2/mm2) and pSS (10/mm2) tissue. Hybrid structures contained proliferating (Ki67+) cells and senescent (p16+) cells. Striated ducts showed no abnormal morphology post PD-L1 treatment, in contrast to pSS tissue. PD-L1 expression was detected in the SG parenchyma following anti-PD-L1 therapy. The SG post-PD-L1 therapy further demonstrated focal lymphocytic sialadentitis, harboring disperse, and focal CD4+ T cell-rich infiltrates. CD8+ T cells were also present. In this patient, these CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in-between and inside hybrid structures. CD20+ B-cells were infrequently detected following PD-L1 blockade, in contrast to their preponderance in pSS SG tissue. Conclusion: This patient lacked conventional SG acinar cells following anti-PD-L1 therapy and demonstrated presence of hybrid intercalated duct-like structures. Understanding which mechanisms and dynamics underpinning this aberrant parenchyma may be crucial to understand how SG dysfunction post ICI therapy, and potentially other affected organs. Furthermore, although the patient treated with anti-PD-L1 antibody examined here fulfills the criteria for pSS and demonstrated focal lymphocytic sialadentitis, the further histopathological characteristics do not resemble pSS."

ICI are approved for the treatment of malign melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. They can lead to long-term anti-tumor responses by deactivating the brake mechanism in the immune system. Ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are examples of ICI. CTLA-4 is a brake mechanism in immune response. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against CTLA-4. PD-1 is another important immune checkpoint co-inhibitor receptor that is expressed by activated T cells in the peripheral tissue. As a result of blockage of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, local tumor-specific immune response augments, and long-term tumor control can be achieved. In recent years, ICI are approved for the treatment of various malignities. They may be responsible for specific toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are a consequence infiltration of normal tissues by activated T lymphocytes that are responsible for autoimmunity. Corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, such as infliximab and mycophenolate mofetil, are effective in the treatment of irAEs.

Here, we present the findings of an unplanned, ad-hoc interim analysis at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 97 medical centres across 11 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). Patients aged at least 18 years with multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, previously treated with at least two lines of therapy (excluding pomalidomide) and refractory to the last line were randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group via an interactive voice response or integrated web response system. Patients received oral pomalidomide 4 mg daily on days 1-21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02576977, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). On July 3, 2017, the FDA established that risks associated with the triple combination outweighed benefits and halted the study. Median follow-up was 8·1 months (IQR 4·5-10·9). Median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·7-7·5) in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 8·4 months (5·9-not reached) in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group; progression-free survival estimates at 6 months were 48% (95% CI 37-58) versus 60% (49-69) at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1·53; 95% CI 1·05-2·22; p=0·98). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 12·9-not reached) versus 15·2 months (12·7-not reached; HR 1·61; 95% CI 0·91-2·85; p=0·95); overall survival estimates at 6 months were 82% (95% CI 74-88) versus 90% (82-95). Serious adverse events occurred in 75 (63%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 56 (46%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Four (3%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic sepsis, myocarditis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome); myocarditis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were considered related to pembrolizumab. No treatment-related deaths were reported in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit-risk profile of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co (Kenilworth, NJ, USA).\n"

A laboratory is unlikely to use multiple assay platforms. Furthermore, commercially available diagnostic assays are not standardized, and different assay methods could lead to inappropriate treatment selection. This study establishes the extent of concordance between three validated, commercially available PD-L1 IHC diagnostic assays for NSCLC patients [Ventana SP263 (durvalumab), Dako 22C3 (pembrolizumab), and Dako 28-8 (nivolumab)].Experimental Design: Five hundred formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival NSCLC samples were obtained from commercial sources. Stained slides were read in batches on an assay-by-assay basis by a single pathologist trained in all methods, in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments program-certified laboratory. An additional pathologist performed an independent review of 200 stained samples for each assay.Results: PD-L1 expression was evaluable with all assays in 493 samples. The three assays showed similar patterns of tumor membrane staining, with high correlation between percent PD-L1 staining. An overall percentage agreement of >90% was achieved between assays at multiple expression cutoffs, including 1%, 10%, 25%, and 50% tumor membrane staining.Conclusions: This study builds optimism that harmonization between assays may be possible, and that the three assays studied could potentially be used interchangeably to identify patients most likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies, provided the appropriate clinically defined algorithm and agent are always linked.

Consequently, urologists are increasingly confronted with patients who are on, have recently received, or will be treated with ICI therapy. The care of these patients is likely to be shared between urologists and medical oncologists, with additional occasional support of other medical specialties. Therefore, it is important that urologists have good knowledge of immune-related side effects. Here, we provide advice on prevention, early diagnosis, and clinical management of the most relevant toxicities to strengthen urologists' insight and, thus, role in the multidisciplinary management in the new immunotherapy era.

Bladder cancer is known to be immunogenic and is responsive to immunotherapy including intravesical BCG and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Multiple trials have addressed the role of checkpoint inhibitors in advanced bladder cancer, including atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (all targeting the PD1/PD-L1 pathway). While these trials have demonstrated promising results and improvements over existing therapies, less than half of patients with advanced disease demonstrate clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Recent breakthroughs in cancer biology and immunology have led to an improved understanding of the influence of the tumor microenvironment on the host's immune system. It appears that tumors promote the formation of highly immunosuppressive microenvironments preventing generation of effective anti-tumor immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, reconditioning of the tumor microenvironment and restoration of the competent immune response is essential for achieving optimal efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we aim to discuss the major mechanisms of immune evasion in bladder cancer and highlight novel pathways and molecular targets that may help to attenuate tumor-induced immune tolerance, overcome resistance to immunotherapy and improve clinical outcomes."

Until recently, chemotherapy - characterized by some benefit but only rare durable responses - was the only treatment option for patients with NSCLC whose tumors lacked targetable mutations. By contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated distinctly durable responses and represent the advent of a new treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Three immune checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, are now approved for use in first- and/or second-line settings for selected patients with advanced NSCLC, with promising benefit also seen in patients with stage III NSCLC. Additionally, durvalumab following chemoradiation has been approved for use in patients with locally advanced disease. Due to the distinct features of cancer immunotherapy, and rapid progress in the field, clinical guidance is needed on the use of these agents, including appropriate patient selection, sequencing of therapies, response monitoring, adverse event management, and biomarker testing. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened an expert Task Force charged with developing consensus recommendations on these key issues. Following a systematic process as outlined by the National Academy of Medicine, a literature search and panel voting were used to rate the strength of evidence for each recommendation. This consensus statement provides evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors into the treatment plan for patients with NSCLC. This guidance will be updated following relevant advances in the field."

            "abstract": "Evidence has recently emerged on the influence of gender on the immune system. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs), we explored the impact of gender on survival in patients with advanced cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We performed a comprehensive search of the literature updated to April 2018, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE. We extracted data on study characteristics and risk of bias in duplicate. Of 423 unique citations, 21 RCTs were included, inherently to 12,635 patients. Both males and females showed reduced risk of death associated with ICIs use (HR 0.73, p < 0.001 and HR 0.77, p < 0.001, respectively). Subgroup analyses by specific ICI showed similar OS in both genders for anti-PD-1/PDL-1. Anti-CTLA-4 use was associated with longer OS in men only (HR 0.77, p < 0.012), with the exception of melanoma (in women, HR 0.80, p = 0.006). PFS was longer in men than in women (HR 0.67, p < 0.001 and HR 0.77, p = 0.100, respectively). Conclusively, ICIs use was associated with more favorable outcomes in men, particularly for anti-CTLA-4 agents. In melanoma, not gender-related factors may influence the anti-tumor immune response evoked by ICIs."

Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib in such patients was unclear.\n## METHODS\nIn an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 78.3% in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment with sunitinib.

            "abstract": "Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) that are part of the costimulatory and coinhibitory (immune checkpoint) signaling are critical for adequate T cell response and are important therapeutic targets for immunomodulation. Biologics targeting them have already achieved considerable clinical success in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or transplant recipients (e.g., abatacept, belatacept, and belimumab) as well as cancer (e.g., ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab). In view of such progress, there have been only relatively limited efforts toward developing small-molecule PPI inhibitors (SMPPIIs) targeting these cosignaling interactions, possibly because they, as all other PPIs, are difficult to target by small molecules and were not considered druggable. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been achieved during the last decade. SMPPIIs proving the feasibility of such approaches have been identified through various strategies for a number of cosignaling interactions including CD40-CD40L, OX40-OX40L, BAFFR-BAFF, CD80-CD28, and PD-1-PD-L1s. Here, after an overview of the general aspects and challenges of SMPPII-focused drug discovery, we review them briefly together with relevant structural, immune-signaling, physicochemical, and medicinal chemistry aspects. While so far only a few of these SMPPIIs have shown activity in animal models (DRI-C21045 for CD40-D40L, KR33426 for BAFFR-BAFF) or reached clinical development (RhuDex for CD80-CD28, CA-170 for PD-1-PD-L1), there is proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of such approaches in immunomodulation. They can result in products that are easier to develop/ manufacture and are less likely to be immunogenic or encounter postmarket safety events than corresponding biologics, and, contrary to them, can even become orally bioavailable."

The current situation in multiple myeloma (MM) is rather unclear, as distinct research groups have reported discordant results.

The results of monotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been unsatisfactory in MM, suggesting that a combination approach is needed. The most logical partners are immunomodulatory agents as they possess many synergistic effects. We are also proposing other rational and promising combinations (e.g., daratumumab, ibrutinib, anti-CD137) that warrant further investigation."

The key drugs are immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), whose mechanism of action is to elicit immune response against cancer cell antigens. Three types of CPIs are currently used and approved: an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab; and anti-PD-L1 antibodies: atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab. CPIs have been widely used in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma settings, metastatic lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck tumours, and Merkel cell carcinoma. However, side effects of CPIs differ from toxicities of other oncological drugs. According to literature data, in 10-30% of patients CPIs are responsible for immune-related adverse events (irAE) associated with excessive activation of the immune system. Systemic irAEs include enterocolitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the most common irAEs of checkpoint inhibitors are dermatologic toxicities ranging from pruritus and mild dermatoses to severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Each irAE can become serious if not early diagnosed and appropriately treated. In the article we present different types of skin irAEs related to CPIs together with the recommended therapies."

The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nOverall survival was significantly longer in the group receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 months, with higher survival rates in the ipilimumab-dacarbazine group at 1 year (47.3% vs. 36.3%), 2 years (28.5% vs. 17.9%), and 3 years (20.8% vs. 12.2%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3% of patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5% treated with dacarbazine and placebo (P<0.001). No drug-related deaths or gastrointestinal perforations occurred in the ipilimumab-dacarbazine group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIpilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram) in combination with dacarbazine, as compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, improved overall survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma. The types of adverse events were consistent with those seen in prior studies of ipilimumab; however, the rates of elevated liver-function values were higher and the rates of gastrointestinal events were lower than expected on the basis of prior studies.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nIpilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 to enhance antitumour immunity. Our aim was to assess the use of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.\n## METHODS\nWe did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8 Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm, and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861614.\n## FINDINGS\nFrom May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 9·5-12·7) with ipilimumab and 10·0 months (8·3-11·0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·85, 0·72-1·00; p=0·053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0·0031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1·46 (95% CI 1·10-1·95), for 5-12 months was 0·65 (0·50-0·85), and beyond 12 months was 0·60 (0·43-0·86). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.\n## INTERPRETATION\nAlthough there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb.\n"

            "abstract": "Purpose Data suggest that DNA damage by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition and/or reduced vascular endothelial growth factor signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition may complement antitumor activity of immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers. Patients and Methods This phase I study tested durvalumab doublets in parallel 3 + 3 dose escalations. Durvalumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with either olaparib tablets twice daily or cediranib on two schedules. The primary end point was the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Response rate and pharmacokinetic analysis were secondary end points. Results Between June 2015 and May 2016, 26 women were enrolled. The RP2D was durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with olaparib 300 mg twice a day, or cediranib 20 mg, 5 days on/2 days off. No dose-limiting toxicity was recorded with durvalumab plus olaparib. The cediranib intermittent schedule (n = 6) was examined because of recurrent grade 2 and non-dose-limiting toxicity grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) on the daily schedule (n = 8). Treatment-emergent AEs included hypertension (two of eight), diarrhea (two of eight), pulmonary embolism (two of eight), pulmonary hypertension (one of eight), and lymphopenia (one of eight). Durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib grade 3 and 4 AEs were hypertension (one of six) and fatigue (one of six). Exposure to durvalumab increased cediranib area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration on the daily, but not intermittent, schedules. Two partial responses (≥15 months and ≥ 11 months) and eight stable diseases ≥ 4 months (median, 8 months [4 to 14.5 months]) were seen in patients who received durvalumab plus olaparib, yielding an 83% disease control rate. Six partial responses (≥ 5 to ≥ 8 months) and three stable diseases ≥ 4 months (4 to ≥ 8 months) were seen in 12 evaluable patients who received durvalumab plus cediranib, for a 50% response rate and a 75% disease control rate. Response to therapy was independent of PD-L1 expression. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first reported anti-PD-L1 plus olaparib or cediranib combination therapy. The RP2Ds of durvalumab plus olaparib and durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib are tolerable and active. Phase II studies with biomarker evaluation are ongoing."

            "abstract": "Immuno-oncology works through activation of the patient's immune system against cancer, with several advantages over other treatment approaches, including cytotoxic agents and molecular-targeted therapies. The most notable feature of immuno-oncology treatments is the nature of the patient responses achieved, which can be more durable and sustained than with other modalities. Increased understanding of immune system complexity has provided a number of opportunities to advance several strategies for the development of immuno-oncology therapies. This review outlines the clinical pharmacology characteristics and development challenges for the 6 approved immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies that target 2 immune checkpoint pathways: ipilimumab (an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 antibody) and, more recently, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (both anti-programmed death-1 antibodies) and atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (all anti-programmed death ligand-1 antibodies). These agents have revealed much about the clinical pharmacology features of immune checkpoint inhibitors as a class, as well as the pharmacometric approaches used to support their clinical development and regulatory approval. The development experiences with these pioneering immuno-oncology agents are likely to serve as useful guides in the discovery, progression, and approval of future drugs or combination of drugs in this class. This review includes summaries of the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response of the immune checkpoint inhibitors approved to date, as well as an overview of some quantitative systems pharmacology approaches. The ability of immuno-oncology to meet its full potential will depend on overcoming development challenges, including the need for clear strategies to determine optimal dose and scheduling for monotherapy as well as combination approaches."

Samples from a subset of 181 patients from a Phase 1/2 study of durvalumab (NCT01693562) were analyzed to determine the optimal PD-L1 staining cut-off for enriching the probability of responses to treatment. The scoring algorithm was defined using statistical analysis of clinical response data from this clinical trial and PD-L1 staining parameters in HNSCC and NSCLC tissue.

            "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. While many HNSCCs are related to classical etiologic factors of smoking and alcohol, a clinically, genomically, and immunologically distinct subgroup of tumors arise from the epithelium of the tonsil and the base of tongue as a result of infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). In this review we describe the genomic and immunologic landscape of HNSCC, highlighting differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. While HPV-negative tumors are characterized by tobacco-associated mutations in genes including TP53 and CDKN2A, in HPV-positive HNSCC integration of viral genome from HPV into the host cellular genome results in expression of the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins, with consequent degradation of p53 and functional inactivation of Rb. The immune microenvironment of HNSCC is characterized by changes in immune cell populations, immune checkpoints, as well as tumor or microenvironmental factors that alter the balance of the immune milieu in favor of immunosuppression, allowing tumor evasion and escape from immune surveillance. Immune therapies, in particular those targeting the PD1 receptor or its ligand PD-L1, including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab have shown significant efficacy in subsets of patients with HNSCC. Current trials are evaluating the efficacy of these agents in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immune therapies including CTLA-4 and IDO-1 inhibitors. While biomarkers including PD-L1 expression, PD-L2 expression and the interferon-gamma gene signature show potential to predict benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy - it is hoped that improved understanding of the genomic and immune landscape will lead to ways to improved strategies to stratify patients and to select which HNSCC are most likely to benefit from these therapies."

Model-based covariate analysis identified liver metastasis as the most influential factor for tumor growth and immune-cell PD-L1 expression and baseline tumor burden as predictive factors for tumor killing.

Autoimmune diabetes is a rare immune-related adverse effect associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. It is now being increasingly described reflecting the wider use of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We report the case of a 49-year-old female who presented with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, 3 months following the commencement of durvalumab. On admission, she was in severe diabetic ketoacidosis with venous glucose: 20.1 mmol/L, pH: 7.14, bicarbonate 11.2 mmol/L and serum beta hydroxybutyrate: >8.0 mmol/L. She had no personal or family history of diabetes or autoimmune disease. Her HbA1c was 7.8% and her glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies were mildly elevated at 2.2 mU/L (reference range: <2 mU/L) with negative zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) and islet cell (ICA) antibodies. Her fasting C-peptide was low at 86 pmol/L (reference range: 200-1200) with a corresponding serum glucose of 21.9 mmol/L. She was promptly stabilised with an insulin infusion in intensive care and discharged on basal bolus insulin. Durvalumab was recommenced once her glycaemic control had stabilised. Thyroid function tests at the time of admission were within normal limits with negative thyroid autoantibodies. Four weeks post discharge, repeat thyroid function tests revealed hypothyroidism, with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 6.39 mIU/L (reference range: 0.40-4.80) and low free T4: 5.9 pmol/L (reference range: 8.0-16.0). These findings persisted with repeat testing despite an absence of clinical symptoms. Treatment with levothyroxine was commenced after excluding adrenal insufficiency (early morning cortisol: 339 nmol/L) and hypophysitis (normal pituitary on MRI).\n    \n\n\n          Learning points:\n        \n      \n      Durvalumab use is rarely associated with fulminant autoimmune diabetes, presenting with severe DKA.

            "abstract": "Programmed cell death protein 1 receptor and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that provide a survival benefit for select patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are second-line therapies for advanced NSCLC after chemotherapy failure. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are also approved as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, and durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor indicated as consolidation therapy in individuals with locally advanced NSCLC. The novel mechanism of action of these agents provides clear efficacy benefits to many NSCLC patients without good alternatives, but it may also result in unique immune-related adverse events that many health-care providers are unfamiliar with or uncertain about how to diagnosis and manage. Highlighting the resources of the Immuno-Oncology Essentials Initiative, particularly the Care Step Pathways (CSPs), this article addresses the role of the advanced practice provider in administration, side-effect identification and management, and education of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving ICI therapy. The diagnosis and management of pneumonitis, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, and arthralgias/myalgias are examined in detail, addressing special considerations in the NSCLC population."

However, there are at least 4 different assays and antibodies used for PD-L1 IHC, each developed with a different ICI. We set to test if next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a robust method to determine PD-L1 mRNA expression levels and furthermore, efficacy of predicting response to ICIs as compared to routinely used, standardized IHC procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 209 cancer patients treated on-label by FDA-approved ICIs, with evaluable responses were assessed for PD-L1 expression by RNA-seq and IHC, based on tumor proportion score (TPS) and immune cell staining (ICS). A subset of serially diluted cases was evaluated for RNA-seq assay performance across a broad range of PD-L1 expression levels.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Assessment of PD-L1 mRNA levels by RNA-seq demonstrated robust linearity across high and low expression ranges. PD-L1 mRNA levels assessed by RNA-seq and IHC (TPS and ICS) were highly correlated (p < 2e-16). Sub-analyses showed sustained correlation when IHC results were classified as high or low by clinically accepted cut-offs (p < 0.01), and results did not differ by tumor type or anti-PD-L1 antibody used. Overall, a combined positive PD-L1 result (≥1% IHC TPS and high PD-L1 expression by RNA-Seq) was associated with a 2-to-5-fold higher overall response rate (ORR) compared to a double negative result. Standard assessments of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) showed that a PD-L1 positive assessment for melanoma samples by RNA-seq had the lowest sensitivity (25%) but the highest PPV (72.7%). Among the three tumor types analyzed in this study, the only non-overlapping confidence interval for predicting response was for \"RNA-seq low vs high\" in melanoma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Measurement of PD-L1 mRNA expression by RNA-seq is comparable to PD-L1 expression by IHC both analytically and clinically in predicting ICI response. RNA-seq has the added advantages of being amenable to standardization and avoidance of interpretation bias. PD-L1 by RNA-seq needs to be validated in future prospective ICI clinical studies across multiple histologies."

We herein report the case of a 59-year-old man with PPC who showed a long-term response with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy. He was referred to our hospital with a mass shadow at the right upper lung. PPC clinical stage IIIB was diagnosed, and the tumor proportion score of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was 100%. Six days after transbronchial biopsy, he had difficulty walking owing to sensory abnormalities. We found that the primary tumor had invaded the spinal cord and compressed the cord at T1-T4, resulting in the abnormalities. He underwent tumor resection and received chemotherapy involving cisplatin (CDDP) + S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy (66 Gy). Subsequently, durvalumab treatment as consolidation therapy was commenced. After one year of durvalumab treatment had been completed, he had no apparent signs of relapse or severe adverse events. This case suggests that a long-term response can be achieved with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy for stage III inoperable PPC showing high PD-L1 expression. KEY POINTS: Significant findings of the report A long-term response might be achieved with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III inoperable pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma showing high expression of programmed death-ligand What this study adds It is possible to continue durvalumab treatment for one year without any severe adverse events.

Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.\n## RESULTS\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005). The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

For instance, interaction between program death-1 (PD-1) and program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) will lead the activated T cell to a state of anergy. PD-L1 is upregulated on a wide range of cancer cells. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have consequently been designed to restore T cell activity. Accumulating data are in favor of an association between PD-L1 expression in tumors and response to treatment. A PD-L1 expression is present in 30% to 50% of digestive cancers. Multiple anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and anti-PD-L1 mAbs (MPDL3280A, Medi4736) are under evaluation in digestive cancers. Preliminary results in metastatic gastric cancer with pembrolizumab are highly promising and phase II will start soon. In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a phase III trial of MPDL3280A as maintenance therapy will shortly be initiated. Trials are also ongoing in metastatic CRC with high immune T cell infiltration (i.e., microsatellite instability). Major challenges are ahead in order to determine how, when and for which patients we should use these ICIs. New radiologic criteria to evaluate tumor response to ICIs are awaiting prospective validation. The optimal therapeutic sequence and association with cytotoxic chemotherapy needs to be established.

Overall survival results from this study have now been reported, along with outcomes from other phase II trials. A thorough review of the efficacy and safety of checkpoint-inhibitors used in conjunction with cCRT for stage III unresectable NSCLC is needed. Published and presented literature on phase II and III data was identified using the key search terms \"non-small cell lung cancer\" AND \"checkpoint-inhibitors\" (OR respective aliases). One randomized phase III clinical trial and three phase II trials reporting outcomes of checkpoint-inhibitors in conjunction with cCRT for stage III unresectable NSCLC were identified. PACIFIC reported significantly improved overall survival for consolidation durvalumab following cCRT compared with placebo. Although discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) was higher with durvalumab, rates of grade 3/4 pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis were low and comparable between arms. Results from phase II trials also show promising activity for other checkpoint-inhibitors and alternative sequencing strategies, although these need to be confirmed in a randomized context. Preliminary data suggest differences in the safety profiles between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Currently, the role of PD-L1 expression levels for patient selection in this setting remains unclear, and durvalumab should be administered on an individual basis in patients with known driver mutations.

For patients with resectable and operable disease, ICIs administered before surgery, either alone (JHU/MSK, LCMC3, and NEOSTAR) or in combination with chemotherapy (Columbia/MGH and NADIM), have yielded high rates of major pathologic response in resection specimens, an outcome measure that correlates with improved progression-free survival and overall survival.

Recent successes have also raised the possibility that using ICIs in patients with earlier stages of lung cancer will enhance curability.

Despite not being eligible for a durvalumab trial because of lack of PD-L1 expression, she had a meaningful response to nivolumab. Once every 2 weeks, infusion of nivolumab resulted in rapid tumour shrinkage in multiple areas. In the next few months, she experienced a variety of side effects, some of which were potentially life-threatening. She had disease progression 9 months into treatment."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nFirst-line therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that lacks targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patients with a tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of choice. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in a phase 2 trial.\n## METHODS\nIn this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of 35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted among the patients in the placebo-combination group who had verified disease progression. The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.\n## RESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overall survival at 12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembrolizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001). Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in the placebo-combination group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

Data on their safety and efficacy is unknown as these patients were excluded from clinical trials due to concern of unforeseen side effects. Objectives. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in HIV patients being treated for advanced cancers and to assess the impact of these drugs on HIV status of the patients specifically CD4 count and HIV viral load. Materials and Methods. This was a retrospective analysis of data of 17 patients HIV treated with one of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, or Avelumab) for advanced cancer. Results. 10 out of 17 patients responded to therapy. 7 patients, all of whom had shown response to therapy, were alive and 4 were still on checkpoint inhibitor. 10 patients including all 7 nonresponders had died. Responders had minimum of 15 weeks of response while one had ongoing continued response at 34 weeks. Side effects were seen in 7 patients and only one patient needed cessation of therapy. CD4 counts were stable on treatment while HIV RNA remained undetectable. Conclusion. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors appear to have comparable efficacy and tolerable side effect profile and have no effect on HIV markers when used in HIV patients with advanced cancers."

In the last years, the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly changing lung cancer management and therefore guidelines are essential to assist clinicians in such an evolving field. We reviewed the recommendations about the use of these immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice guidelines issued by three scientific societies [European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO); American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM)] and one not-for-profit U.S. alliance [National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)] in order to underline their strengths and limitations. All the examined guidelines include some recommendations about use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer patients. ASCO guidelines have a good methodologic background while their major limitation is their slow updating. NCCN guidelines, by contrast, are continuously updated but suffer from weak methodology and poor comparative tools. ESMO guidelines introduce a tool to assess the magnitude of clinical benefit for each recommended intervention that, although with some limitations, may improve clinical decision making. AIOM guidelines apply a robust methodology, but contain recommendations only on drugs reimbursed in Italy, thus limiting their applicability in different contexts.

We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine.\n## METHODS\nThis randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel. Primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS. The significance threshold for overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02370498.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled. Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel. As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Median overall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2-10·7) with pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6-9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·66-1·03; one-sided p=0·0421). Median progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4-2·0) with pembrolizumab and 4·1 months (3·1-4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03-1·57). In the total population, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 42 (14%) of the 294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 96 (35%) of the 276 patients treated with paclitaxel.\n## INTERPRETATION\nPembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Pembrolizumab had a better safety profile than paclitaxel.

Studies examining the association of molecular biomarkers with clinical outcome in BC treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 monotherapy were included.

Eight additional studies from the bibliography of the review papers were included, making a total of 23 studies. Five PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies have been tested in BC immunohistochemistry (IHC). These studies used different expression scoring criteria and generally had poor ability to discriminate likelihood for response. Overall, the data suggests CD8+ T cell infiltration is necessary to mediate an antitumor immune response, but other immune cell populations, such as neutrophils may suppress T cell-mediated immunity and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. An IFNγ signature is a promising predictor, but there needs to be consensus on the optimal gene panel composition, and prospective validation. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a promising predictor in six studies reporting on 1200 patients, but there is not a consensus on the optimal definition of \"high TMB\". Detection of T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion has only been conducted in small studies and so its predictive value remains inconclusive. Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) are associated with poor prognosis and possibly intrinsic resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, but more work needs to be done to build upon and confirm the initial findings.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently no molecular biomarker is sufficiently mature for routine clinical use, while some candidates, or a combination show great promise and need further study."

This phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC) among patients with advanced/metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who achieved at least stable disease with first-line chemotherapy.Experimental Design: Eligible patients were randomized to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, then 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years, or BSC, which could include continuation of fluoropyrimidine until progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS); secondary endpoints included PFS by modified World Health Organization criteria and overall survival (OS).Results: Of 143 patients screened, 57 were randomized to each arm. irPFS with ipilimumab versus BSC was not improved [2.92 months, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-5.16 vs. 4.90 months, 95% CI, 3.45-6.54, HR = 1.44; 80% CI, 1.09-1.91; P = 0.097], resulting in study cessation.

Long-term survival remains stagnant around 12-14 months for patients with advanced disease who have progressed on or recurred after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Improving clinical outcomes for patients with urothelial carcinoma in all disease settings requires the development of novel treatments, especially for patients who failed on first-line chemotherapy. Since the discovery of intravesical Bacillus-Calmette Guerin (BCG) in the 1970s for non-muscle invasive disease, there have not been any major breakthrough drugs that exploit the immune-sensitivity of bladder cancer until recently. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways have shown significant anti-tumor activity, tolerable safety profiles and durable, long-term responses in clinical trials. Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab are promising PD-1/PD-L1 blockade drugs under investigation that will redefine the standard of care for bladder cancer. CTLA-4 inhibitors are also under investigation in this setting. Atezolizumab, approved in May 2016, and nivolumab, approved in February 2017, are the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immune-checkpoint inhibitors in bladder cancer for platinum-pretreated patients based on phase II data. On March 16, 2017, results from the phase III trial KEYNOTE-045 demonstrated that survival was significantly longer in patients treated with pembrolizumab when compared with the standard second-line chemotherapy. Research into biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, messenger RNA subtype, mutational and neoantigen load and gene signature expression will be crucial to determining why some patients respond to immunotherapy and others do not. This review article describes the advances in immunotherapy since the development of BCG, presents results from clinical trials investigating immune-checkpoint inhibitors and discusses biomarkers and prognostic factors associated with response to these new drugs."

These therapies, referred to here as PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapies, are designed to block the interaction between PD-L1, expressed by tumor cells, and PD-1, expressed by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, leading to enhanced antitumor CD8+ T cell responses and tumor regression. The influence of PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells on antitumor CD8+ T cell responses is well characterized, but the impact of PD-L1 expressed by immune cells has not been well defined for antitumor CD8+ T cell responses. Although PD-L1 expression by tumor cells has been used as a biomarker in selection of patients for PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapies, patients whose tumor cells lack PD-L1 expression often respond positively to PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapies. This suggests that PD-L1 expressed by non-malignant cells may also contribute to antitumor immunity. Here, we review the functions of PD-L1 expressed by immune cells in the context of CD8+ T cell priming, contraction, and differentiation into memory populations, as well as the role of PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells in regulating antitumor CD8+ T cell responses."

Many patients show remarkable efficacy and low toxicity. However, some patients have a better outcome than others with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. So, it is crucial to identify biomarkers of response. We review here the available data of several potential biomarkers of efficacy. The expression of PD-L1, detected by immunohistochemistry on tumor cells and immune cells is a good predictive biomarker of response for some cancers; however, this method is not standardized, and there are different antibodies, different cut-off values, and different targets (tumor or microenvironment). Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 is dynamic and heterogeneous within the tumor: expression is discordant between primary tumor and metastasis or between biopsy and surgical specimen. Peripheral blood lymphocytes also can be informative, especially the baseline neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio which is easy to measure in daily practice. High rate of neoantigens is also associated with improved response. Therefore, mutation burden can be predictive of response and this explains why tumors with microsatellites instability have an enhanced response. Similarly, genetic signatures are linked with resistance or response to treatment. Gut microbiota is associated with improved antitumor immune response although the underlying mechanism is not well understood so far. Lastly, it seems that cytokines, mediators of immunity may play a role in the response to immunotherapy and so, constitute an interesting biomarker. Several potential biomarkers are identified but none is prospectively validated so far."

Despite its limitations, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry may serve as a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-L1/PD1 therapy. While urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients with predominant or pure variant histology (UCV) account for up to one-third of advanced cases, to date, most ICB BC studies have excluded patients with such histologies. To assess the potential utility of ICB in patients with UCV, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in UCV and compared 3 commonly used and commercially available PD-L1 antibodies. Full sections from 84 UCV cases were stained with clones SP263, 22C3, and SP142, all of which are considered predictive assays to identify UC patients who are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, respectively. Expression on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) was assessed. Staining extent and characteristics were evaluated, and concordance among the 3 clones was determined at various cutoff points as used in previous studies in BC. We found that PD-L1 was expressed in a significant percentage of UCV cases at different cutoff points (cutoff 1% TC: 37% to 54%, cutoff 5% TC: 23% to 37%), with the highest expression in UC with squamous differentiation. These figures are equal to or higher than those for classic/pure UC (4% to 30%). The results suggest that patients with UCV may benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and argue against the exclusion of UC with predominant or pure variant histology from clinical ICB studies. The highest expression in both TC and IC was observed with clone SP263, followed by 22C3 and SP142, and all clones showed strong agreement in a pairwise comparison, both in TC and IC (R-values: 0.780 to 0.901), which indicates that all 3 clones are potentially useful in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in UCV."

A 2-compartment model with linear elimination described the data well. Covariate analysis revealed ideal body weight was not a significant covariate on the PK of danvatirsen; nor was age, sex or race.

Its composition and its organization represent a reproducible characteristic of tumors and a validated prognostic factor. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cytotoxic T CD8+ lymphocyte density, associated with a Th1 environment and tertiary lymphoid structures impacts survival. Tumor cell-immune cell interaction is targeted by PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors. In advanced NSCLC, PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors are more effective than second-line chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab outperforms first-line chemotherapy in NSCLC strongly positive for PD-L1. PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently tested in mesothelioma and thymic tumors. PD-L1 expression evaluated with immunochemistry is the most studied predictive biomarker of PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor efficacy. Tumor and immune cell expression of PD-L1 is still difficult to evaluate because of intra-tumoral heterogeneity and expression modulation by the microenvironment. Four commercial diagnostic antibodies are in development, with differences concerning recognized epitopes, methodology of evaluation of PD-L1 expression, positivity threshold, kit and platforms used. Clinical trials in NSCLC have shown that patients with tumors strongly positive for PD-L1 derived the best clinical benefit with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors whereas clinical benefit is less common in tumors negative for PD-L1. PD-L1 expression is not a perfect biomarker since some PD-L1 negative NSCLC respond to PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors and some PD-L1 positive NSCLC do not. PD-L1 testing is likely to be implemented in daily practice for selection of advanced NSCLC that will be treated with pembrolizumab, underscoring the relevance of ongoing harmonization studies of the use of the different antibodies available for PD-L1 testing."

In relation to current practice, we recommend adherence to the recent published guidelines which emphasize the importance of early recognition and administration of temporary immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids in most cases, depending on the organ system involved, and the severity of toxicity.

SCLC is generally classified as a limited-stage and extensive-stage disease depending on the extent of involvement. For patients with the extensive-stage disease, until recently, chemotherapy alone has been the recommended treatment, although radiotherapy could be used in select patients for palliation of symptoms. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC is platinum doublet chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Even though first-line therapy has an initial response rate of 60-80%, the prognosis is poor, with overall survival of 10-12 months. The only FDA-approved second line of therapy is topotecan, approved both as an intravenous formulation as well as an oral formulation, with response rates of 6-12% in chemorefractory disease and 15-37% in chemosensitive disease. Immunotherapy has recently been approved as a first-line agent in metastatic SCLC in combination with chemotherapy. It is also approved as a third-line agent in metastatic SCLC after the failure of two chemotherapy regimens. The FDA approved four drugs, two of them being PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), and two of them being PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) in SCLC.

Platinum-based chemotherapy has been the standard first-line treatment in these patients for the past decade; however, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 13-22%. Recent advances in cancer immunology research have highlighted the pivotal role of the immune system in cancer development and progression, and new immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated efficacy in a large variety of tumors including UC. Currently, five ICIs, including two anti-PD-1 antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) and three anti-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), have been granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with unresectable or metastatic UC who recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Among these agents, only pembrolizumab is supported by strong evidence from a large randomized Phase III trial (KEYNOTE-045). This trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS for patients assigned to the pembrolizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy arm, both in the total population (HR 0.73; P=0.002) and in the population with high PD-L1 expression (HR 0.57; P=0.005). For patients with cisplatin-ineligible UC, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab were approved based on Phase II studies, with limitations on the use of these agents in patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression later imposed by the FDA. In conclusion, pembrolizumab may be a potential first-choice second-line therapy for unresectable or metastatic UC patients following platinum-based chemotherapy. Several Phase III trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of combination therapies of ICIs with chemotherapy, and ICIs with other ICIs with or without chemotherapy as first-line therapy. The results of these trials might redirect treatment strategies for patients with unresectable or metastatic UC."

            "abstract": "Until recently, there were no true innovations in the management of locally advanced (aUC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) in the last three decades. Vinflunine has been approved by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) with only limited improvement compared to best supportive care in second line treatment. In addition, gemcitabine/cisplatin has been established as an alternative to methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) revolutionized the care of these patients, transforming a unanimously deadly disease into one with hope through sustained disease control. Five immune CPI have recently been approved for aUC/mUC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) including atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab. All five CPI are FDA-approved as second-line therapy with atezolizumab and pembrolizumab also being approved for first-line therapy in cisplatin-ineligible patients. The rapid acceptance in the treatment algorithm of UC is based on the impressive clinical efficacy of these agents in some patients, combined with their excellent safety profile. These new agents are indeed the most important advancement in UC care. However, the challenge in the age of precision medicine is to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from CPIs, as the majority of patients do not respond to CPI. Toward this goal, validation of clinical, molecular and imaging biomarkers that serve for prediction and monitoring of treatment response are of central necessity."

Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76).

Due to the promising therapeutic activity of immune check-point inhibitors (ICIs) in mesothelioma patients, the identification of biomarkers predictive of response to treatment is of crucial relevance. The prognostic role of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) proposed in cancer patients prompted us to investigate this protein in sera from mesothelioma patients (n = 40) enrolled in the NIBIT-MESO-1 study. A significant (p < 0.001) increase in sPD-L1 levels was detected in patients after the first cycle and during therapy vs. baseline.

On the basis of these initial results, the specific role of CTLA-4-, PD-L1-, or PD-1-targeting on sPD-L1 release was then investigated in sera from 81 additional ICI-treated solid cancer patients. Results showed a significant (p < 0.001) increase of sPD-L1 levels during therapy compared to baseline only in anti-PD-L1-treated patients, supporting the specific involvement of PD-L1 targeting in the release of its soluble form.

A group of experts from the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) identified the following items of importance for further improvement of supportive care: smoking cessation; nutrition before and during CCRT (including treatment and prevention of anorexia); physical exercise before and during CCRT; prevention and treatment of acute esophagitis and dysphagia; treatment of cough and dyspnea; treatment of skin reactions; treatment of fatigue; prophylaxis of nausea and emesis; prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac disease and damage; and optimization of radiotherapy techniques and chemotherapy adjustments to reduce toxicity in the era of immune therapy. The resulting recommendations are summarized in this manuscript and knowledge gaps identified, in which future investments are needed to improve supportive care and hence quality of life and survival for our stage III NSCLC patients."

            "abstract": "Lung cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Unlike non-squamous NSCLC, squamous NSCLC rarely harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations for which there are directed therapies, and until the recent approval of immunotherapies for squamous NSCLC, a limited number of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs have been FDA-approved for use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic squamous NSCLC. Immunotherapies directed at the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have demonstrated efficacy in both nonsquamous and squamous cell NSCLC. Because of their similar mechanism of action against the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, both drugs have similar toxicity profiles related to immune-mediated adverse reactions that can generally be monitored and managed with oral corticosteroids. This paper provides an overview of drug therapy options for squamous cell NSCLC with a focus on the evidence and clinical application of the anti-PD1 therapies. A comparison of the dosing, administration, indications, and differences in the measurement of PD-L1 expression in the clinical trials of nivolumab and pembrolizumab is also provided."

In peripheral blood, the number of different immune cell types, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, as well as different soluble factors, have been correlated with clinical outcome. For intra-tumoral biomarkers, expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 has been found to be of some predictive value for anti-PD-1-directed therapy for NSCLC and melanoma. A high mutational load, particularly when accompanied by neoantigens, seems to facilitate immune response and correlates with patient survival for all entities treated by use of ICI. Tumor microenvironment also seems to be of major importance. Interestingly, even the gut microbiome has been found to correlate with response to ICI, most likely through immuno-stimulatory effects of distinct bacteria. New imaging biomarkers, e.g., for PET, and magnetic resonance imaging are also being investigated, and results suggest they will make early prediction of patient response possible.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Several promising results are available regarding possible biomarkers for response to ICI, which need to be validated in large clinical trials.

            "abstract": "Breast cancer can be classified based on the expression or lack of expression of protein receptors including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (Her2). The basal molecular subtype is mostly made up of breast cancers that do not express ER/PR or Her2, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) (Bertucci et al. in Int J Cancer 123(1):236, 2008). TNBC tends to be more aggressive as there are no approved targeted treatments and the only treatment option currently is cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recent data show that some chemotherapies, specifically anthracyclines, not only have cytotoxic effects but also use the immune system by activating CD8+ T cell responses to kill cancer cells (Stagg et al. in Ther Adv Med Oncol 5(3):169-181, 2013), and thus, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes respond well to chemotherapy. Currently, systemic immunotherapy which utilizes the patient's own immune system directly to eradicate and target neoplastic cells is being explored as treatment for TNBC as this type of breast cancer has been shown to be immunogenic (Yu et al. in Int J Environ Res Public Health 14:68, 2017). According to the Cancer Genome Atlas, TNBC has higher PD-L1 mRNA expression (Mittendorf et al. Cancer Immunol Res 2(4):361-370, 2014). Higher rates of CD8+ T cell infiltration were also found in TNBC according to a study by Liu et al. (Breast Cancer Res 14:R48, 2012). In TNBC patients, Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets its ligand, have been investigated to assess dose tolerability and side effects. Further studies involving vaccines, immunotherapy that targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 and PD-L1, are currently being investigated for treatment of TNBC. This review outlines the systemic immunotherapies that are currently being investigated for patients with TNBC."

Due to the complex molecular and cellular interactions involved in immune response, a single biomarker may not be sufficient to predict response to cancer immunotherapy. Integration of multiple tumor, immune response, and genomic parameters is likely to influence the future interpretation of biomarker-based treatment outcomes. This article, in a case-based format, concisely summarizes most up-to-date evidence in answering some commonly seen clinical controversies of cancer immunotherapy, in terms of (i) the predictive value of programmed death-ligand 1 as a biomarker; (ii) whether the use of steroids with checkpoint inhibitors will decrease efficacy of the latter; (iii) selection of patients for cancer immunotherapy based on immune-based response criteria, and (iv) whether the use of influenza vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors is considered safe.

            "abstract": "Whether PD-L1-positive patients derive more overall survival benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the treatment of advanced solid tumours is unclear. We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane library and EMBASE databases from January 1, 1966 to March 1, 2019, to identify randomised controlled trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab) that had available hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to PD-L1 status. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled overall survival (OS) HR and 95% CI among PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients. An interaction test was performed to evaluate the heterogeneity between the two estimates. A total of 24 randomised trials, involving 12,966 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An OS benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was found in both PD-L1-positive patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.70) and PD-L1-negative patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.91) even at the minimum cut-off value of 1%. Significant differences in the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients were noted at different cut-off values. Moreover, there was a positive dose-response relationship between PD-L1 positivity and OS benefit (HR for 1%, 0.58, [0.50, 0.67]; 5%, 0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; 10%, 0.50 [0.40, 0.63]). Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent, regardless of study design, line of treatment, treatment type, tumour type, PD-L1 staining cell type and median follow-up time. We demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improved OS in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients compared to controls, but the magnitude of benefit was clinically PD-L1-dependent."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, fundamentally those that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have emerged as novel treatment strategies in NSCLC, demonstrating undoubted superiority over chemotherapy in terms of efficacy. Several of these immune checkpoint modulators have recently gained regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, such as nivolumab, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in first-line (only the latter) and second-line settings, and more recently, durvalumab as maintenance after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced disease. There is consensus that PD-L1 expression on tumor cells predicts responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors in several tumor types. Hence PD-L1 expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently used as a clinical decision-making tool to support the use of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients. However, the value of PD-L1 as the 'definitive' biomarker is controversial as its testing is puzzled by multiple unsolved issues such as the use of different staining platforms and antibodies, the type of cells in which PD-L1 is assessed (tumor versus immune cells), thresholds used for PD-L1-positivity, or the source and timing for sample collection. Therefore, newer biomarkers such as tumor mutation burden and neoantigens as well as biomarkers reflecting host environment (microbiome) or tumor inflamed microenvironment (gene expression signatures) are being explored as more reliable and accurate alternatives to IHC for guiding treatment selection with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC."

Thus, the development of effective therapies against gynecological cancers is still a largely unmet medical need. One of the novel therapeutic approaches is to induce anti-cancer immunity by the inhibition of the immune checkpoint pathways using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular targets for monoclonal antibodies are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The rationale for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with gynecological cancers was based on the immunohistological studies showing high expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in those cancers. Currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab. The efficacy and safety of these inhibitors, used as monotherapy and with combination with chemotherapy, is being currently evaluated in several clinical studies.

Despite this breakthrough, the median survival time of glioblastoma patients has remained at about 2 years. Therefore, the safety and anti-cancer efficacy of combination therapies that include ICMs are being actively investigated. Because of the distinct mechanisms of ICMs, which restore the immune system's anti-tumor capacity, unconventional immune-related phenomena are increasingly being reported in terms of tumor response and progression, as well as adverse events. Indeed, immunotherapy response assessments for neuro-oncology (iRANO) play a central role in guiding cancer patient management and define a \"wait and see strategy\" for patients treated with ICMs in monotherapy with progressive disease on MRI. This article deciphers emerging research trends to ameliorate four challenges unaddressed by the iRANO criteria: (1) patient selection, (2) identification of immune-related phenomena other than pseudoprogression (i.e., hyperprogression, the abscopal effect, immune-related adverse events), (3) response assessment in combination therapies including ICM, and (4) alternatives to MRI. To this end, our article provides a structured approach for standardized selection and reporting of imaging modalities to enable the use of precision medicine by deciphering the characteristics of the tumor and its immune environment.

Immunomodulation with the antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies has shown to mediate tumor shrinkage and extend overall survival from several pivotal phase I/II studies in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C. We reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of each compound based upon major registered clinical trials and published clinical data. Overall, response rate of more than 20% is consistently seen across all these trials, with maximal response of approximately 50% achieved by certain single antiprogrammed death-1 agents or when used in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade. The responses seen are early, durable, and have continued after treatment discontinuation. Immune-related adverse events are the most common side effects seen in these clinical trials. Overall, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organ systems affected by these compounds while hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic events are less frequent. These side effects are low grade, manageable, and typically resolve within a relatively short time frame with a predictable resolution pattern given proper management. We therefore propose detailed guidelines for management of major immune-related adverse events that are anticipated with antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapies based on general experience with other monoclonal antibodies and the established management algorithms for immune-related adverse events for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade with ipilimumab.

Early phase studies with novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as trastuzumab-deruxtecan and trastuzumab-duocarmazine suggest relevant clinical activity of these drugs in pretreated patients; in addition, these ADCs may offer activity in low HER2-expressing tumours as well. ZW25, a bispecific HER2-directed antibody targeting the extracellular domains 2 and 4, showed excellent tolerability and considerable single-agent activity. A combination of T‑DM1 with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor neratinib yielded high response rates, while a study of trastuzumab plus durvalumab reported disappointing results. Although formally negative, overall survival data from the PHEREXA trial suggest clinical activity of dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with prior trastuzumab treatment for advanced disease. A combined analysis of two tucatinib studies showed that systemic therapy is active when continued in case of isolated central nervous system progression and stable extracranial disease after local therapy of brain metastases; finally, a small prospective observation in asymptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction suggests that anti-HER2 treatment may be reasonably safe in this population."

            "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is regarded as an immune privileged environment; however, changes in the neuroimmunology paradigm have led to an increased interest in systematic immunotherapy in lung cancer therapy. The presence of the lymphatic system in the CNS as well as the physiological and biochemical changes in the blood-brain barrier in the tumor microenvironment suggests that immunocytes are fully capable of entering and exiting the CNS. Emerging clinical data suggest that inhibitors of programmed death receptor-1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) can stimulate surrounding T cells and thus have antitumor effects in the CNS. For example, PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab) monotherapy has displayed a 20-30% encephalic response rate in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Combined application of nivolumab and ipilimumab anti-PD-1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 showed an encephalic response rate of 55% in patients with brain metastases of melanoma. Further evidence is required to verify these response rates and identify the mechanisms of curative effects and drug tolerance. While regional treatments such as whole-brain radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and brain surgery remain the mainstream, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors display potential decreased neurotoxic effects. To date, five drugs have been approved for use in patients with encephalic metastases of lung carcinoma: the anti-PD-1 drugs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and the anti-PD-L1 agents, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. In recent years, clinical trials of inhibitors in combination with other drugs to treat brain metastasis have also emerged. This review summarizes the biological principles of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for brain metastasis of lung cancer, as well as ongoing clinical trials to explore unmet needs."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThere are few effective treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3-6 months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously or investigator's choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously (standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no longer enrolling patients.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab and 248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·4-9·4) with pembrolizumab and 6·9 months (5·9-8·0) with standard of care (hazard ratio 0·80, 0·65-0·98; nominal p=0·0161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab than with standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most common treatment-related adverse event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and fatigue with standard of care (in 43 [18%]). Treatment-related death occurred in four patients treated with pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and two patients treated with standard of care (malignant neoplasm progression and pneumonia).\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival and favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma support the further evaluation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in earlier stages of disease.\n## FUNDING\nMerck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.\n"

            "abstract": "Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the genitourinary system (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). In the USA, it is the fifth most common cancer and approximately 79,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2017 (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The mortality from bladder cancer is approximately 17,000 deaths each year (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The incidence rate for bladder cancer is higher in men compared to women. Risk factors are predominantly related to tobacco smoking, although infection with Schistosoma haematobium is another risk factor in selected populations (Antoni et al. in Eur Urol, 71:96-108, 2017). Cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012; Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). There is an estimated overall survival of 9-15 months in metastatic bladder cancer in those who receive the standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy (Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012). The median survival, however, is significantly reduced after relapse in patient treated with platinum chemotherapy to less than 7 months (Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). Thus, this approach is preferred for patients who can tolerate this treatment as first-line chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). Until recently, there were few treatment options for those patients with poor performance status who are ineligible to receive cisplatin including renal insufficiency and multiple comorbidities or had disease progression after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). With further understanding of tumor immune evasion, systemic immunotherapy which utilizes the patient's own immune system directly to eradicate and target neoplastic cells, has now been approved for urothelial bladder cancer. Monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), including Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, and its ligand, PD-L1, including Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, Avelumab, have all been investigated and approved in the setting of metastatic refractory urothelial cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ). Atezolizumab and Pembrolizumab have also been approved as first-line therapy in the setting of cisplatin-ineligible metastatic bladder cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ). Those that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, including Ipilimumab and Tremelimumab, have also been investigated and further studies are being performed (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ).

In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma.\n## METHODS\nDETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group.

            "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are the first clinically approved drugs designed to exploit synthetic lethality, and were first introduced as a cancer-targeting strategy in 2005. They have led to a major change in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, and altered the natural history of a disease with extreme genetic complexity and defective DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Furthermore, additional mechanisms apart from breast related cancer antigens 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) mutations can also result in HR pathway alterations and consequently lead to a clinical benefit from PARP inhibitors. Novel combinations of PARP inhibitors with other anticancer therapies are challenging, and better understanding of PARP biology, DNA repair mechanisms, and PARP inhibitor mechanisms of action is crucial. It seems that PARP inhibitor and biologic agent combinations appear well tolerated and clinically effective in both BRCA-mutated and wild-type cancers. They target differing aberrant and exploitable pathways in ovarian cancer, and may induce greater DNA damage and HR deficiency. The input of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer is based on the observation that immunosuppressive microenvironments can affect tumour growth, metastasis, and even treatment resistance. Several biologic agents have been studied in combination with PARP inhibitors, including inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; bevacizumab, cediranib), and PD-1 or PD-L1 (durvalumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab), anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (tremelimumab), mTOR-(vistusertib), AKT-(capivasertib), and PI3K inhibitors (buparlisib, alpelisib), as well as MEK 1/2, and WEE1 inhibitors (selumetinib and adavosertib, respectively). Olaparib and veliparib have also been combined with chemotherapy with the rationale of disrupting base excision repair via PARP inhibition. Olaparib has been investigated with carboplatin and paclitaxel, whereas veliparib has been tested additionally in combination with temozolomide vs. pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, as well as with oral cyclophosphamide, and topoisomerase inhibitors. However, overlapping myelosuppression observed with PARP inhibitor and chemotherapy combinations requires further investigation with dose escalation studies. In this review, we discuss multiple clinical trials that are underway examining the antitumor activity of such combination strategies."

In addition to the efficacy of ICIs for cancer, the adverse events (AEs) of ICIs are also noteworthy for gradually more extensive clinical use. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the treatment-related AEs that occurred in clinical trials using different kinds of ICIs, to explore the differences in AEs among ICIs for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, and to compare select immune-related AEs. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and other available sources were systematically searched for published reports up to January 1, 2019. Two reviewers independently selected reports about phase II/III randomized controlled trials to compare among ICIs and between ICIs and chemotherapy. After the bias assessment of all included trials, a Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed. The primary outcomes were any-grade and high-grade treatment-related AEs from all ICIs. The secondary outcomes were AEs in patients with NSCLC and melanoma and the presence of the select AEs pneumonitis/pneumonia and colitis. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials containing 11,223 patients with NSCLC or melanoma were included. A total network meta-analysis was conducted. The meta-analysis showed that atezolizumab 1,200 mg and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks were generally more tolerable than other ICIs. ICI combined with chemotherapy might suggest a higher risk of treatment-related AEs than monotherapy with a single ICI, except durvalumab and ipilimumab. In the NSCLC subgroup, pembrolizumab was associated with a higher risk of high-grade AEs than nivolumab. In addition, ICIs (nivolumab, atezolizumab, and avelumab) led to a lower risk of any/high-grade treatment-related AEs than traditional chemotherapy and ICI combination chemotherapy. However, ICIs did not present preferable safety and tolerability compared to chemotherapy in treating melanoma. Compared with chemotherapy, nivolumab, durvalumab, two ICIs, and ICI combined chemotherapy led to more pneumonitis/pneumonia. However, when treating NSCLC, different types of ICIs did not differ significantly regarding the incidence of pneumonitis/pneumonia. A combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab had the highest risk for colitis, while pembrolizumab and atezolizumab had a lower possibility than the other ICIs. Conclusion: Atezolizumab 1,200 mg and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks were ordinarily safer than other ICIs. When treating NSCLC, nivolumab had the lowest risk; when treating melanoma, pembrolizumab had the lowest toxicity."

We explored the use of ctDNA to predict survival on durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Experimental design:\n        \n      \n      Variant allele frequencies (VAF) of somatic mutations in 73 genes were assessed in ctDNA using targeted sequencing in a discovery cohort consisting of 28 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and two validation NSCLC and urothelial cancer (UC) cohorts of 72 and 29 patients, respectively, to correlate ctDNA changes with clinical outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Somatic variants were detected in 96% of patients. Changes in VAF preceded radiographic responses, and patients with reduction in VAF at 6 weeks had significantly greater reduction in tumor volume, with longer progression-free and overall survival.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      ctDNA VAF changes are strongly correlated with duration of treatment, antitumor activity, and clinical outcomes in NSCLC and UC. Early on-treatment reduction in ctDNA VAF may be a useful predictor of long-term benefit from immunotherapy. Prospective studies should validate these findings and the value of utilizing early changes in ctDNA for therapeutic decision making by identifying nonresponders to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies and guiding combination therapies."

Modern immunotherapy strategies augment the immune system and ideally, permit durable tumor-specific immune memory. In fact, several monoclonal antibodies that mediate the immune checkpoint receptors have provided the most clinically meaningful improvement for breast cancer patients to date, particularly for the triple negative subtype. Checkpoint blockade as monotherapy has demonstrated some encouraging results, although some combination strategies appear to augment those responses and may be particularly effective when administered earlier in the course of disease. For example, the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival when compared with chemotherapy alone.

            "abstract": "Although survival of patients with different types of cancer has improved, cardiotoxicity induced by anti-neoplastic drugs remains a critical issue. Cardiac dysfunction after treatment with anthracyclines has historically been a major problem. However, also targeted therapies and biological molecules can induce reversible and irreversible cardiac dysfunction. Over the last years, cancer immunotherapies haverevolutionized the clinical management of a wide spectrum of solid and hematopoietic malignancies previously endowed with poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are at the forefront of immunotherapy: the two most prominent are the targeting of cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) and of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the godfather of checkpoint inhibitors, whereas several blocking monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and BMS-946559) have been developed. Inhibitors of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can unleash anti-tumor immunity and mediate cancer regressions. Although CTLA-4 inhibitors and PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking agents are frequently associated with a wide spectrum of immune-related adverse events, cardiac toxicity has been underestimated. However, early animal studies have demonstrated that after CTLA-4 inhibition and PD-1 deletion autoimmune myocarditis can occur. Moreover, PD-1 and PD-L1 can be expressed in rodent and human cardiomyocytes. During the last years several cases of fatal heart failure have been documented in melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. The recent experience with cardiovascular toxic effects associated with checkpoint inhibitors introduces important concepts biologically and clinically relevant for future oncology trials and clinical practice."

PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with stage IV NSCLC. In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nIn the ongoing phase 3 CheckMate 214 trial, nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed superior efficacy over sunitinib in patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma, with a manageable safety profile. In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting.\n## METHODS\nIn the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214 trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated, advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system, with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were overall survival, progression-free survival per independent radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now closed to recruitment.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390 patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With extended follow-up (median follow-up 32·4 months [IQR 13·4-36·3]), in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI 35·6-not estimable] vs 26·6 months [22·1-33·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·54-0·80], p<0·0001), progression-free survival (median 8·2 months [95% CI 6·9-10·0] vs 8·3 months [7·0-8·8]; HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·65-0·90], p=0·0014), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of 425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0·0001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI not estimable] vs 37·9 months [32·2-not estimable]; HR 0·71 [95% CI 0·59-0·86], p=0·0003), progression-free survival (median 9·7 months [95% CI 8·1-11·1] vs 9·7 months [8·3-11·1]; HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·98], p=0·027), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0·015). In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]). Eight deaths in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and four deaths in the sunitinib group were reported as treatment-related.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe results suggest that the superior efficacy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over sunitinib was maintained in intermediate-risk or poor-risk and intention-to-treat patients with extended follow-up, and show the long-term benefits of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma across all risk categories.\n## FUNDING\nBristol-Myers Squibb and ONO Pharmaceutical.\n"

After an initial response on first-line therapy, virtually all patients develop disease progression. For those who showed an initial response only few therapy options with low response rates are currently available. Until now, many experimental and targeted agents have failed to yield convincing clinical benefits, and new therapy options are clearly warranted for these patients. In this year's oncological congresses, several new therapy strategies, including checkpoint inhibition, showed promising results in ongoing trials.

Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors.

Methods: Patients received LY2510924 at 20, 30, or 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) once daily in combination with durvalumab at 1500 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. The primary objective was to assess the MTD and safety of LY2510924 SC daily in combination with durvalumab in patients with advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid tumors. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK) and the antitumor activity of LY2510924 in combination with durvalumab. Exploratory objectives were biomarker analysis, including pharmacodynamic markers, relevant to LY2510924 and durvalumab, including immune functioning, drug targets, cancer-related pathways, and the disease state. Results: Nine patients (three each at 20, 30, and 40 mg) were enrolled in the study (eight patients with pancreatic cancer and one patient with rectal cancer). The majority of patients completed one or two cycles (100.0% ≥ 1 cycle; 88.9% ≥ 2 cycles) of LY2510924 and durvalumab. No dose limiting toxicities were reported. Most common (>10%) treatment-emergent adverse events were injection-site reaction (44.4%), fatigue (33.3%), and increased white blood cell count (33.3%). PK parameters for combination were similar to those reported in previous studies when given as monotherapy. Best overall response of stable disease was observed in four (44.4%) patients and one patient had unconfirmed partial response. Conclusion: The recommended phase 2 dose is 40 mg SC once-daily LY2510924 in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg IV and showed acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with advanced refractory tumors."

            "abstract": "Cancer therapy has been constantly evolving with the hope of finding the most effective agents with the least toxic effects to eradicate tumors. Cancer immunotherapy is currently among the most promising options, fulfilling this hope in a wide range of tumors. Immunotherapy aims to activate immunity to fight cancer in a very specific and targeted manner; however, some abnormal immune reactions known as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) might occur. Therefore, many researchers are aiming to define the most proper protocols for managing these complications without interfering with the anticancer effect. One of these targeted approaches is the inhibition of the interaction between the checkpoint protein, programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1), and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), via a class of antibodies known as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. These antibodies achieved prodigious success in a wide range of malignancies, including those where optimal treatment is not yet fully identified. In this review, we have critically explored and discussed the outcome of the latest PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor studies in different malignancies compared to standard chemotherapeutic alternatives with a special focus on the clinical efficacy and safety. The approval of the clinical applications of nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab in the last few years clearly highlights the hopeful future of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for cancer patients. These promising results of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have encouraged many ongoing preclinical and clinical trials to explore the extent of antitumor activity, clinical efficacy and safety as well as to extend their applications."

Despite advances in surgical techniques, the advent of efficient radiation delivery methods, and the introduction of newer chemotherapeutic agents, the survival rate for HNSCC has alarmingly remained unchanged for the past 50 years. However, there have been some promising developments in this field recently. Tumor protein 53 (TP53)-based gene therapeutics such as Gendicine® and Advexin®, and oncolytic viral therapeutics such as ONYX-015 and H101 have shown encouraging results and are gaining momentum. Cetuximab, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapeutic in HNSCC, although had a promising run initially, failed to garner enough attention subsequently due to its poor results in locally advanced HNSCC. Currently, its major utility is in palliation of recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC as a part of the EXTREME regimen alongside cisplatin/carboplatin and fluorouracil. Of late, immunotherapeutics are evolving rapidly in HNSCC by demonstrating satisfactory effectiveness and acceptable tolerance both in locally advanced and recurrent tumors, and both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Recent accelerated approval of two immune checkpoint receptor blockers, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, has rejuvenated enthusiasm among clinicians and researchers by opening up a new domain for targeted and co-targeted therapeutics. The interim results of many ongoing trials and the latest updates of previous landmark trials such as KEYNOTE and CheckMate show promising trends in this regard. Immunotherapeutic agents belonging to different classes, such as durvalumab, epacadostat, motolimod, and T4 immunotherapy, are all being investigated presently in various therapeutic roles. Human papilloma virus (HPV)-based vaccines are now understood to have both a preventive and therapeutic role in HNSCC. Phase I/II trials are underway evaluating the safety profile, tolerable limits, and therapeutic efficacy of several therapeutic vaccines against HPV-driven HNSCC. Similarly, co-targeting therapeutics and precision medicine concepts are exploring newer and effective options including individuating the therapy based on particular tumor's molecular makeup and so on, the results of which are expected to change the landscape of HNSCC."

Early-stage cervical cancer has an excellent long-term prognosis, with 5-year survival for localized disease being > 90%. Survival decreases markedly for both locally advanced and metastatic disease, and both are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Few effective treatment options exist for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. In 2014, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab was approved in combination with chemotherapy based on the results of the Phase III GOG-240 study. As the majority of cervical cancers have a viral etiology, which impairs the immune system, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and other agents, appears to be a promising approach. In June 2018, the US FDA approved the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with PD-L1 expression that progressed after one or more lines of chemotherapy. Another anti-PD1 antibody, cemiplimab also shows potential in this setting, either as monotherapy or combined with radiotherapy, and it is currently being evaluated in a Phase III trial. Additional checkpoint inhibitors including nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab, and camrelizumab are in different stages of clinical development for the disease.

Preclinical data suggest synergistic antitumor activity of ibrutinib with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in solid tumors. This study evaluated ibrutinib plus durvalumab, a PD-L1-targeting antibody, in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study enrolled previously treated patients with stage III/IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase 1b determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 2, patients were treated at the RP2D to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of ibrutinib plus durvalumab.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The RP2D was identified as ibrutinib 560 mg p.o. daily and durvalumab 10 mg/kg i.v. every 2 weeks, with 122 patients treated at the RP2D.

Overall response rates (complete or partial responses) were 2% for pancreatic cancer, 3% for breast cancer, and 0% for NSCLC. Median progression-free survival was 1.7, 1.7, and 2.0 months in the pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and NSCLC cohorts, respectively. Median overall survival was 4.2, 4.2, and 7.9 months in the pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and NSCLC cohorts, respectively. The safety profiles observed across tumor types were consistent with the known safety profiles for ibrutinib and durvalumab.

The Universal Methodology for Benefit-Risk Assessment (UMBRA) has also been used to effectively communicate the basis of regulatory decisions. Many NRAs in emerging markets place reliance on the public assessment reports (PARs) of reference agencies to inform about their own regulatory decisions. However, PAR users often criticise the redacted nature of PARs and may be challenged in identifying key benefits and risks, value judgements, and benefit-risk (BR) trade-offs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PARs for ertugliflozin l-pyroglutamic acid, erenumab, and durvalumab published by regulatory bodies in Australia, Europe, Canada, and the United States were compared with the validated UMBRA Benefit-Risk Template to evaluate the BR decision documentation. Published validation of UMBRA included report of a consortium of four regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and Singapore indicating that their clinical assessment templates were modified to align with the UMBRA approach.

            "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an intracellular signaling pathway involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and the survival of tumor cells. Several different mutations, involving BRAF or NRAS, exert an oncogenic effect by activating the MAPK pathway, resulting in an increase in cellular proliferation. These mutations have become targets for new therapeutic strategies in melanoma and other cancers. Selective MEK inhibitors have the ability to inhibit growth and induce cell death in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. MEK inhibitor therapy in combination with a BRAF inhibitor is more effective and less toxic than treatment with a BRAF inhibitor alone, and has become the standard of care for patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma. Trametinib was the first MEK inhibitor approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma not previously treated with BRAF inhibitors, and is also approved in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. Furthermore, cobimetinib is another MEK inhibitor approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma in combination with a BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. The MEK inhibitor binimetinib in combination with the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib is in clinical development. The addition of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent, such as pembrolizumab, durvalumab or atezolizumab, to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition has shown considerable promise, with several trials ongoing in metastatic melanoma. Binimetinib has also shown efficacy in NRAS-mutated melanoma patients. Future possibilities for MEK inhibitors in advanced melanoma, as well as other solid tumors, include their use in combination with other targeted therapies (e.g. anti-CDK4/6 inhibitors) and/or various immune-modulating antibodies."

Antibodies to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and to programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand enhance cytotoxic T-cell survival, thus augmenting antitumor action and consequently inducing immune-related adverse events, of which the most relevant is diarrhea and colitis. This review compiles recent data on pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of immune-mediated colitis (IMC). The pathogenesis of IMC is not completely understood, but recent studies have focused on the role of regulatory T cells and interactions with the gut microbiome. While sharing similarities with inflammatory bowel disease, IMC is considered a distinct form of colitis with acute onset and rapid progression leading to potential complications including bowel perforation and death. Prompt recognition and management of IMC is imperative for optimal outcomes. Although prospective clinical trials are lacking to guide therapy, recent guidelines recommend early endoscopic evaluation to establish the diagnosis and prompt initiation of corticosteroids. Response to first-line therapy should be assessed early to determine the need of escalation to biologic agents. With treatment, most patients will experience full resolution of symptoms, and subsequent rechallenge with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors can be considered."

This is a new standard of care for unresectable local-regionally advanced NSCLC and is the first trial to show that immunotherapy can increase survival in earlier-stage NSCLC. Several clinical trials are underway or in development to explore the role of adding immunotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation, followed by a year of immunotherapy or to even replace chemotherapy in this treatment paradigm. In resectable disease, adjuvant chemotherapy is still the standard of care for stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm) through stage III disease. However, new studies are investigating the role of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or as adjuvant therapy for 1 year after resection. Molecular profiling for early-stage disease is not currently the standard of care, but several national clinical trials are studying the benefit of adding adjuvant-targeted therapies.

This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-naïve squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies.

The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the benefit-risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n## METHODS\nKEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 3·4-9·6), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival estimates at 6-months were 82·0% (95% CI 73·2-88·1) versus 85·0% (76·8-90·5; hazard ratio [HR] 1·22; 95% CI 0·67-2·22; p=0·75). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.

Antibodies against PD-L1, including atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab, are also being developed and have been approved for various cancers. Compared with anti-CTLA-4 drugs, studies with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents have suggested higher response rates and improved survival. Targeting PD-L1 rather than PD-1 may also theoretically offer further benefit, with the potential for improved efficacy and reduced toxicity, although this has not been clearly shown by clinical experience to date. Anti-PD-L1 agents have shown good efficacy and manageable toxicity in several tumor types."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is an aggressive malignancy and has a poor prognosis in the metastatic state. Treatment of UC remains a challenge, and as a first-line regimen for advanced UC, standard platinum-based chemotherapy is unfit for many patients due to numerous comorbidities and poor performance status. Recently, five immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced UC who were ineligible for platinum-based regimens or suffered tumor progression in post-platinum setting. However, not long ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted the use of two common immune checkpoint blockades, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, due to uncertain survival benefit as mono-therapy. In this scenario, we reviewed rapidly surfacing clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 pathway for advanced UC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for all clinical trials where the efficacy and safety were reported. Our primary outcome was efficacy evaluated by objective response rate (ORR), 1-year overall survival (OS) rate and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, and second outcome was safety assessed by any grade and grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). We chose percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the evaluation indexes and used a random-effects model to account for heterogeneity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We included 14 clinical trials with 2674 total patients in this meta-analysis. After removing unqualified studies on the basis of sensitivity analyses, 13 studies were pooled to evaluate the overall ORR, 8 studies for the 1-year OS rate and 6 studies for the 1-year PFS rate. The pooled data of ORR, 1-year OS rate, and 1-year PFS rate were 0.20 (95% CI 0.18-0.22, I2 = 38.4%, P = 0.078), 0.50 (95% CI 0.46-0.53, I2 = 30.3%, P = 0.186), and 0.17 (95% CI 0.14-0.20, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.668), respectively. Similarly, 13 trials were utilized to compute the pooled rate of any-grade TRAEs. The pooled estimation of any-grade was 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.67, I2 = 1.7%, P = 0.429). The pooled rate of grade 3-4 TRAEs subgroups with Atezolizumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, Nivolumab and Avelumab were 0.11 (95% CI 0.06-0.15, I2 = 83.5%, P = 0.000), 0.15 (95% CI 0.13-0.18, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.971), 0.06 (95% CI 0.03-0.09, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.566), 0.19 (95% CI 0.15-0.23, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.480) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.11, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.702), respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study showed that the immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 pathway had durable efficacy and acceptable safety in patients with advanced UC.

Many tumors can upregulate expression of PD-L1, inhibiting antitumor T-cell responses and avoiding immune surveillance and elimination. We have identified and characterized MEDI4736, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and is uniquely engineered to prevent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In vitro assays demonstrate that MEDI4736 is a potent antagonist of PD-L1 function, blocking interaction with PD-1 and CD80 to overcome inhibition of primary human T-cell activation. In vivo MEDI4736 significantly inhibits the growth of human tumors in a novel xenograft model containing coimplanted human T cells. This activity is entirely dependent on the presence of transplanted T cells, supporting the immunological mechanism of action for MEDI4736. To further determine the utility of PD-L1 blockade, an anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody was investigated in immunocompetent mice. Here, anti-mouse PD-L1 significantly improved survival of mice implanted with CT26 colorectal cancer cells. The antitumor activity of anti-PD-L1 was enhanced by combination with oxaliplatin, which resulted in increased release of HMGB1 within CT26 tumors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of PD-L1 function can have potent antitumor activity when used as monotherapy or in combination in preclinical models, and suggest it may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer. MEDI4736 is currently in several clinical trials both alone and in combination with other agents, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and inhibitors of IDO, MEK, BRAF, and EGFR."

We assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells. We used a threshold for significance of p<0.00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a threshold of p<0.001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In the total population, median overall survival was 10.4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12.7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8.5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88; p=0.0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.61, 0.49-0.75; p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4.0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0.88, 0.74-1.05; p=0.07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94; p=0.004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 14.9 months vs 8.2 months; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.77; p=0.0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17.3 months vs 8.2 months; 0.50, 0.36-0.70; p<0.0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression-free survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5.0 months vs 4.1 months; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.78; p=0.0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (5.2 months vs 4.1 months; 0.59, 0.45-0.78; p<0.0001). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were less common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16%] of 343 given 10 mg/kg, and 109 [35%] of 309 given docetaxel).\n## INTERPRETATION\nPembrolizumab prolongs overall survival and has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. These data establish pembrolizumab as a new treatment option for this population and validate the use of PD-L1 selection.\n## FUNDING\nMerck & Co.\n"

            "abstract": "Twenty years ago, an individual patient data meta-analysis of eight cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) studies in completely resected early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated a 13 % reduction of the risk of death favoring chemotherapy that was of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.08). This marginal benefit boosted a new generation of randomized trials to evaluate the role of modern platinum-based regimens in resectable stages of NSCLC and, although individual studies generated conflicting results, overall they contributed to confirm the role of AC which is now recommended for completely resected stage II and III NSCLC, mostly 4 cycles, while subset analyses suggested a benefit in patients with large IB tumors. Cisplatin-based therapy was the core regimen of those adjuvant clinical trials and even if a substitution with other platinum-derived was also suggested, mainly based on extrapolated data from studies in advanced disease, cisplatin was confirmed to be slightly superior to carboplatin and is still the drug of choice in the adjuvant setting. Currently, any attempt to improve efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy through antiangiogenic drugs association or pharmacogenomics approaches have failed, while results of additional studies are eagerly awaited. In the context of promising targeted therapies, even if several randomized trials in the advanced setting evaluated tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis) versus platinum-based chemotherapy and showed impressive results, clinical experience with TKIs in the adjuvant setting is still limited and most of the trials have not required patients to be molecularly tested for the drug-specific molecular predictive factor. At the present time, the role of targeted agents as adjuvant approaches remains largely not investigated. Finally, with the negative experience of the use of vaccines in this setting, the integration of immunotherapy (mainly immunocheckpoint inhibitors) in platinum-based schedules has just started to be evaluated, representing a potential future clinical option, but still far from clinical practice."

            "abstract": "Starting in 2014, large phase III clinical trials began to disclose the study results of using programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and PD-ligand (L)1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) ICIs immunotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the recurrent and metastatic (R/M), cisplatin-refractory setting, nivolumab achieved a 2.2-fold increase of the median 1-year overall survival as compared with investigators' choice of salvage chemotherapy (36.0 vs. 16.6%). A paradigm shift to the winning regimen, pembrolizumab combined with platinum and infusional fluorouracil, has outperformed the past gold standard of cetuximab-based platinum and fluorouracil combination in terms of overall survival (median, 13.6 vs. 10.1 mo) when administered as the first-line treatment for R/M HNSCC. Nevertheless, many patients still did not respond to the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment, indicating innate, adapted, or quickly acquired resistance to the immunotherapy. The mechanisms of resistance to ICIs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the context of HNSCC are the focus of this review. The past 5 years have seen improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying checkpoint inhibition resistance in tumor cells, such as: tumor cell adaption with malfunction of the antigen-presenting machinery via class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), reintroduction of cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 complex to cell cycles, enrichment of CD44+ cancer stem-like cells, or development of inactivating mutation in IKZF1 gene; impairment of T-cell functions and proliferation through mutations in the interferon-γ-regulating genes, suppression of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, or resulted from constitutional nutritional iron deficiency state; metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells with changes in metabolites such as GTP cyclohydrolase 1, tetrahydrobiopterin, kynurenine, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and arginase 1; defective dendritic cells, CD-69 sufficient state; and the upregulation or activation of the alternative immune checkpoints, including lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3), T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT)/CD155 pathway, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), and V domain-containing Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA). Several potential biomarkers or biosignatures, which could predict the response or resistance to the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint immunotherapy, are also discussed."

            "abstract": "Anticancer immunotherapy, in the form of immune checkpoint inhibition, is a paradigm shift that has transformed the care of patients with different types of solid and hematologic cancers. The most notable improvements have been seen in patients with melanoma, non-small-cell lung, bladder, renal, cervical, urotherial, and colorectal cancers, Merkel cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints (i.e., anti-CTLA: ipilimumab; anti-PD-1: nivolumab, pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1: durvalumab, atezolizumab, avelumab) unleash the immune system against tumor cells targeting mainly T cells. Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with a variety of diverse and distinct immune-related adverse events (irAEs), reflecting the mechanistic underpinning of each target (i.e., CTLA-4, and PD-1/PD-L1 network). The most frequent endocrine irAEs associated with anti-PD-1 mAb treatment are thyroid dysfunctions, whereas hypophysitis is mostly linked to anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Type 1 diabetes mellitus and adrenalitis are rare irAEs. Combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1) can be associated with an increased risk and prevalence of endocrine irAEs. In this paper we discuss the pathophysiological and clinical aspects of irAEs with specific emphasis on endocrine irAEs associated with ICIs. With a growing number of patients treated with ICIs, a tight collaboration among oncologists, endocrinologists and immunologists appears necessary when the circumstances are more challenging and for better management of severe endocrine irAEs. Further investigations are urgently needed to better understand the mechanisms by which different ICIs can induce a variety of endocrine irAEs."

            "abstract": "The treatment of bladder cancer has evolved over time to encompass not only the traditional modalities of chemotherapy and surgery, but has been particularly impacted by the use of immunotherapy. The first immunotherapy was the live, attenuated bacterial Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, which has been the standard of care non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since 1990. Modern immunotherapy has focused on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, which are molecules that impede immune function, thereby allowing tumor cells to grow and proliferate unregulated. Several checkpoint targets (programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1] programmed cell death protien-1 [PD-1], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [CTLA4]) have received the most attention in the treatment of bladder cancer, and have inhibitor agents either approved or in late-stage development. This review describes the most recent data on agents that inhibit PD-L1, found on the surface of tumor cells, and PD-1 found on activated T and B cells and macrophages. Atezolizumab is the only member of this class currently approved for the treatment of bladder cancer, but nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab all have positive results for this indication, and approvals are anticipated in the near future. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients for whom previously there were few options for durable responses, including those who are ineligible for cisplatin-based regimens or who are at risk of significant toxicity. Research is ongoing to further categorize responses, define ideal patient populations, and investigate combinations of checkpoint inhibitors to address multiple pathways in immune system functioning."

            "abstract": "Objective We wanted to examine the incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) for a variety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oncology drugs in the adjuvant or curative setting to determine the value provided. Design We examined the annualized incremental drug costs of a variety of FDA approved chemotherapeutic drugs used in an adjuvant or curative setting based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) category 1 practice guidelines for melanoma, Her2/neu over-expressive breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, myeloma, B cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The studies we examined were randomized clinical trials on which the NCCN guidelines are based; we solely examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of the trial drug as we assumed that the costs of the health care provided were equivalent between the two treatment arms. We used a formula to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER compares a new intervention (C new) with its alternate (C alt) divided by the quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) that results from the new intervention (QALY new) versus the alternate (QALY alt) and is expressed as ICER = (C new-C alt)/(QALY new-QALY alt). The QALY's were derived from what was reported in the study and based on the incremental disease-free survival. Results Drugs such as rituximab provide high value in the curative therapy for lymphoma. Drugs such as adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib provide intermediate value in the treatment of melanoma, and similarly with maintenance lenalidomide in myeloma and adjuvant trastuzumab in breast cancer. Oncologic drugs that provide low value include adjuvant ipilimumab in melanoma, adjuvant sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma, adjuvant neratinib in breast cancer, adjuvant durvalumab in lung cancer, and brentuximab in the curative therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusion The ICER needs to be evaluated for newly approved FDA oncology chemotherapeutic drugs before incorporating them into routine clinical practice."

Multiple treatment approaches have evolved over the past few decades focusing on timing of chemoradiation (concurrent vs. sequential) and sequencing of therapy (induction vs. consolidation). Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) emerged as the standard of care for the majority of the patients worldwide. Despite improvements in median and overall survival (OS) using the concurrent approach, the rate of distant failure remains high. Consolidation with chemotherapy or targeted agents, adding more radiation dose, or induction chemotherapy did not improve OS. With continued research on defining optimal radiation doses and schedules and integrating novel systemic agents, immunotherapy consolidation has renewed optimism. Synergistic use of radiation and immunotherapy can prevent micrometastatic disease and reduce local failure and may have an abscopal effect in addition to survival benefits. The PACIFIC study reported an absolute progression-free survival benefit of 11.2 months with durvalumab consolidation after standard CCRT compared with placebo. The OS data with durvalumab consolidation are encouraging. Durvalumab is the only approved immunotherapy for unresectable stage III LA NSCLC. Improved survival confirms the definitive role of durvalumab as an effective adjuvant therapy after CCRT with no new safety signals. However, the potential mechanisms driving interaction between immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy require definitive investigation. These mechanisms may help define the timing of immunotherapy initiation as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or consolidation and maintenance therapy after progression.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) is a common pathway of malignant transformation accounting for approximately 15-20 % of human carcinogensis. It has been postulated that MMRD increases tumor antigenicity and highlights a role for immunotherapeutic approach MMR-deficient cancers. This strategy was pursued in a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and the results are reported here.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      Molecular profiling was performed using next generation DNA sequencing and (IHC) testing for MMR and PD-L1. A patient with sporadic, high grade urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis was found to have a hypermutator genotype with 73 mutations occurring amidst 62 known drivers of malignancy, and 340 VUS alterations. MMR deficiency phenotype was confirmed by the absence of MSH2 and MSH6 as well as deleterious mutations in these genes. IHC staining for programmed cell death ligand-1 [PD-L1] revealed 2+ staining in 80 % of cells. The patient gained access to combination immunotherapy trial utilizing MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 through a clinical trial. The patient achieved a prolonged, complete remission within two months and had no severe ill effects from the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Given their ability to generate neo-antigens, MMR-deficient cancers may be uniquely susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor strategies, including urothelial tract cancers. Screening for MMR deficient cancers has the potential to become a routine strategy for evaluating the role of PD-L1 inhibitors for patient with advanced disease.

            "abstract": "Immunotherapy has been used in localized urothelial carcinoma for decades, especially in the treatment of superficial disease, in which instillation of BCG is a commonly used treatment option. Clinical investigations based on new insights into the immunogenic potential of metastatic urothelial carcinoma have led to the accelerated FDA approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab. Preliminary findings suggest additional benefits of combinations of immunotherapeutic agents as a future treatment approach in metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Treatment experience with immunotherapy suggests that these drugs are associated with a unique spectrum of immune-related adverse events and specific immune-related patterns of response, including cases of pseudoprogression, which could impede the optimal use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic. Appropriate management of immune-related adverse events and a greater awareness of immune-mediated response patterns will help to inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes; predictive biomarkers of response might facilitate selection of patients who are most likely to respond to and benefit from these exciting new treatments."

However, a majority of patients do not respond to these agents. Use of biomarker assays to predict response to these agents is an active area of research; however, the predictive value of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays is largely inconsistent across clinical trials. In this meta-analysis of clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1-targeted agents, we evaluate the predictive value of a tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cell PD-L1 IHC assay as a biomarker for objective response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched databases (PubMed, Medline, ASCO abstracts, European Society for Medical Oncology abstracts, and Scopus) up until December 2016 for clinical trials using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with reported PD-L1 biomarker data. Objective response rates (primary end point) from all phase I to III trials investigating nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab in advanced solid tumors were collected.

NMIBC is an immune-responsive disease, as indicated by the use of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin as treatment for more than 3 decades. More recently, immunotherapy has seen much progress in a variety of cancers, including advanced and metastatic bladder cancer, in which historical 5-year survival rates are approximately 15%. The advent of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, especially those directed at programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), has had a significant effect on the therapy of advanced urothelial cancer. This had led to accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for atezolizumab and nivolumab in advanced urothelial cancer previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, level 1 evidence supports the use of pembrolizumab over single-agent tubulin-directed chemotherapy in the same setting. Several other treatments with immune-mediating mechanisms of action are in development and hold great promise, including monoclonal antibodies directed at other checkpoint molecules, oncolytic virus therapy, adoptive T-cell therapy, combination immunotherapy, and antibody-drug conjugates. This review focuses on the recent development of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors in advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer and addresses their potential use in combination. It also discusses a spectrum of novel immunotherapies with potential use in urothelial cancer."

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) versus chemotherapy in this patient population.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (IMvigor211) at 217 academic medical centres and community oncology practices mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a permuted block design (block size of four), to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (physician's choice: vinflunine 320 mg/m\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 931 patients from 198 sites to receive atezolizumab (n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464). In the IC2/3 population (n=234), overall survival did not differ significantly between patients in the atezolizumab group and those in the chemotherapy group (median 11·1 months [95% CI 8·6-15·5; n=116] vs 10·6 months [8·4-12·2; n=118]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·87, 95% CI 0·63-1·21; p=0·41), thus precluding further formal statistical analysis. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between treatment groups in the IC2/3 population: 26 (23%) of 113 evaluable patients had an objective response in the atezolizumab group compared with 25 (22%) of 116 patients in the chemotherapy group. Duration of response was numerically longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (median 15·9 months [95% CI 10·4 to not estimable] vs 8·3 months [5·6-13·2]; HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·26-1·26). In the intention-to-treat population, patients receiving atezolizumab had fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving chemotherapy (91 [20%] of 459 vs 189 [43%] of 443 patients), and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (34 [7%] vs 78 [18%] patients).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAtezolizumab was not associated with significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1 (IC2/3).

Immune-related endocrine events can affect the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, as well as other downstream target organs. These events are unique when compared with other irAEs because the manifestations are often irreversible. Immune-related endocrine events are typically grade 1/2 in severity and often present with non-specific symptoms, making them difficult to diagnose. The mechanisms underlying immune-related target organ damage in select individuals remain mostly undefined.

            "abstract": "Immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) differ from their tumor-targeting counterparts because they exert therapeutic effects by directly interacting with soluble or (most often) cellular components of the immune system. Besides holding promise for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, immunomodulatory mAbs have recently been shown to constitute a potent therapeutic weapon against neoplastic conditions. One class of immunomodulatory mAbs operates by inhibiting safeguard systems that are frequently harnessed by cancer cells to establish immunological tolerance, the so-called \"immune checkpoints.\" No less than 3 checkpoint-blocking mAbs have been approved worldwide for use in oncological indications, 2 of which during the past 12 months. These molecules not only mediate single-agent clinical activity in patients affected by specific neoplasms, but also significantly boost the efficacy of several anticancer chemo-, radio- or immunotherapies. Here, we summarize recent advances in the development of checkpoint-blocking mAbs, as well as of immunomodulatory mAbs with distinct mechanisms of action."

            "abstract": "Treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has changed little over the past few decades; available therapies have failed to extend survival in advanced disease. In recent years, immunotherapy with treatments such as interferons, TNFs, vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors has advanced and shown promise in the treatment of several tumor types. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, tremelimumab and ulocuplumab are at the forefront of immunotherapy and have achieved approvals for certain cancer types, including melanoma (ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab), non-SCLC (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and renal cell carcinoma (nivolumab). Clinical trials are investigating different immunotherapies in patients with other solid and hematologic malignancies, including SCLC. We review emerging evidence supporting the use of immunotherapy in SCLC patients."

            "title": "A historical turning point for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma: inhibition of immune checkpoint.",
            "abstract": "Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of renal malignancy with 87% frequency. As a global health problem, kidney cancer is responsible for 2.2% of new cancer cases. One of the highly effective mechanisms that renal cancer cells avoid in the immune system is PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction.Scope: Literature search is made from PubMed, Medline, and ASCO and ESMO Annual Meeting abstracts using the following search keywords: \"nivolumab,\" \"pembrolizumab,\" \"atezolizumab,\" \"avelumab,\" \"durvalumab,\" and \"renal cell cancer.\" The last search was on November 1, 2019.Findings: The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab have better survival results than sunitinib for intermediate and poor risk patients but not for favorable risk groups. In 2019, two combination regimens with pembrolizumab plus axitinib and avelumab plus axitinib demonstrated efficacy over sunitinib for every risk group. The overall survival data of these trials are still immature.Conclusions: Advanced RCC has high morbidity and mortality with an increasing prevalence. Following tyrosine kinase inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors have a great influence on treatment of advanced RCC, especially the combination of these two strategies. In 2019 these combined strategies demonstrated 5% complete remission with up to 60% objective response rate. While not immediately, but perhaps in the near future, advanced RCC will become a manageable chronic disease, even if a cure is not possible."

Data from pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers, consumers in the U.S., and post-marketing clinical trial reports from U.S. and non-U.S. studies. All cases of uveitis, dry eye syndrome, ocular myasthenia and eye inflammation with use of the following ICIs: atezolizumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Reported odds ratios (RORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for all drugs as a group or as individual agents.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 113 ocular adverse events for all ICIs of interest including uveitis, dry eye, ocular myasthenia and eye inflammation. Nivolumab had the highest number of adverse events (N = 68) associated with use of the ICI. Nivolumab had the highest association with ocular myasthenia [ROR = 22.82, 95% CI (7.18-72.50)] followed by pembrolizumab [ROR = 20.17, 95% CI (2.80-145.20)]. Among all ICIs approved in North America, atezolizumab had the highest association with eye inflammation [ROR = 18.89, 95% CI (6.07-58.81)] and ipilmumab had the highest association with uveitis [ROR = 10.54, 95% CI (7.30-15.22)].\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this disproportionality analysis suggest use of ICIs is associated with an increase risk for ocular adverse reactions. Future epidemiologic studies are needed to better quantify these adverse events."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have remarkable clinical efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the breakdown of immune escape causes a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). With the increasing use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other therapies, awareness and management of irAEs have become more important. We aimed to assess the incidence and nature of irAEs associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for NSCLC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Articles from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through December 2017. The incidence of overall and organ-specific irAEs was investigated in all clinical trials with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolimumab, durvalumab, and avelumab as single agents for treatment of NSCLC. We calculated the pooled incidence using R software with package Meta.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen trials were included in the meta-analysis: 10 trials with PD-1 inhibitors (3734 patients) and 6 trials with PD-L1 inhibitors (2474 patients). The overall incidence of irAEs was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-28) for all grades and 4% (95% CI, 2-6) for high-grade irAEs. The frequency of irAEs varied based on drug type and organ, and patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors had an increased rate of any grade and high-grade irAEs compared with patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors. Organ-specific irAEs were most frequently observed in, in decreasing order, the endocrine system, skin, pulmonary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The total number of patients whose death was attributed to irAEs was 14 (0.34%), and most (79%) of these patients died because of pneumonitis. The median time to the onset of irAEs after the initiation of treatment was 10 weeks (interquartile range, 6-19.5 weeks) and varied depending on the organ system involved.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The specificity of irAEs was closely associated with the mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies involved in restarting anticancer immune attacks. Comprehensive understanding, timely detection, and effective management could improve the compliance of patients and guide the interruption of treatment."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Lung cancer occupies the leading position of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide, including in the Czech Republic. Despite significant advances in systemic oncology treatments, lung cancer still has the worst prognosis, which is driving the need for innovative therapies and methods to treat this disease. Immunotherapy is a developing area of systemic oncology treatment, which has recently begun to be significantly applied to patients with lung carcinoma. The most useful type of immunotherapy currently employs checkpoint inhibitors, including CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab). Except for monotherapy, different combinations of these inhibitors or combinations between one more of these inhibitors and chemotherapy or targeted treatment are being actively studied. Despite intensive investigations, anti-tumor vaccines and cytokines have not had an important impact on the treatment of lung cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors have yielded favorable results, especially for the treatment of advanced (i.e., stage IIIB and IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are being extensively investigated for the treatment of SCLC.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review was to summarize the most important achievements, possibilities, and perspectives of modern immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with lung cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Immunotherapy is an important tool in todays arsenal of oncology treatments, and for patients with lung cancer it offers the hope of prolonging life and img iprovints quality.Key words: immunotherapy - lung cancer - NSCLC - SCLC - checkpoint inhibitors This work was supported by National Sustainability Programme I No. LO1503 provided by Ministry of education, youth and sports and program No. 17-30748A devided by The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
