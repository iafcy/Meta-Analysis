Background. Theinfluenceofpretransplantationdialysisonkidneytransplantoutcomes
hasbeenthesubjectoflongstandinginterest.Althoughincreasedtimeondialysispriorto
kidneytransplantationisassociatedwithdecreasedgraftandpatientsurvivals,analysesof
the impact of dialysis modality on kidney allograft outcome have produced conflicting
results.
Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of dialysis duration
and modality on the function and survival of renal allografts.
Patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 421 adults who received first
kidney transplantations from cadaveric heart-beating donors performed in our unit from
May 1989 to May 2007. Three hundred seventy-four patients (88.8%) were on hemodial-
ysis(HD)priortokidneytransplantation,including247patients(58.7%)ontreatmentfor
at least 24 months.
Results. Patients with a dialysis duration (cid:1)24 months were significantly older (45.9 vs
42.8years;P(cid:1).013).Renalfunctionat3,12,60,and96monthswassimilarbetweenthe
2groups.Longerdurationondialysiswasassociatedwithpooreroverallgraftandpatient
survivals. No differences were observed in renal function or graft and patient survivals
comparing HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of
correlation between dialysis duration or modality and allograft failure.
Conclusion. Longer dialysis duration influenced overall graft and patient survival.
However, dialysis modality showed no influence on graft function or survival.

survival,7,8,13whereasotherreportsdidnotshowlong-term
graft and patient survivals to be affected by the dialysis
modality.6 Our results showed no differences between PD
and HD on short-term or long-term graft and patient
survivals. However, the small number of patients on PD
prior to kidney transplantation impaired statistical power
when compared with subjects on HD prior to transplanta-
tion.
Our study supported the concept that dialysis duration
influencedoverallgraftandpatientsurvivals.Thechoiceof
a pretransplantation dialysis modality did not influence
transplantationresults.
