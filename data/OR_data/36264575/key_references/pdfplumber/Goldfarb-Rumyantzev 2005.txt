2000(n(cid:1)92,844;60%males;70%white;23%black).PretransplantationandpredominantRRTmodalityduringthe
end-stagerenaldisease(ESRD)periodandnumberandspecificcombinationsofRRTmodalitieswereevaluated.
Results:Comparedwithhemodialysis(HD),aCoxmodelshowedthatperitonealdialysis(PD)immediatelybefore
transplantationpredictsa3%lowerriskforgraftfailure(P<0.05)and6%lowerriskforrecipientdeath(P<0.001).
WhenpredominantRRTmodalitywasanalyzed(modalityusedfor>50%oftheESRDtime),PD(hazardratio[HR],
0.97; P < 0.05) had a protective effect for graft survival compared with HD. Better recipient survival also was
associated with PD (HR, 0.96; P < 0.05). Increased number of RRT modalities during the ESRD course was
associatedwithincreasedriskforgraftfailure(HR,1.04peradditionalmodalityused;P<0.005)andrecipientdeath
