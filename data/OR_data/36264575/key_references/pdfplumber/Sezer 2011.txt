Dialysis as a Bridge Therapy to Renal Transplantation: Comparison of
Graft Outcomes According to Mode of Dialysis Treatment
S. Sezer, S. Karakan, F.N. Özdemir Acar, and M. Haberal
ABSTRACT
Background. Renal transplantation is the ideal renal replacement therapy in patients
with end-stage renal disease. It was unclear whether a difference in dialysis modality
influencesoutcomesafterkidneytransplantation.Therefore,weevaluatedtheinfluenceof
dialysis modality.
Methods. We compared various clinical and laboratory parameters of 70 peritoneal
dialysis(PD)and180hemodialysis(HD)patients(n(cid:1)250),including91femalesandan
overall age 36.7 (cid:2) 9.7 years who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2008 to
evaluate factors affecting delayed graft function (DGF) and of transplant graft failure.
Results. Overall graft survival was 82% at 3 and 75% at 5 years. Among HD patients,
16%displayedDGF,versus12%ofPDpatients.Multivariateanalysisshowedthatfactors
affecting DGF were: mode of dialysis (relative risk [RR] (cid:1) 1.39, 95% confidence interval
(CI):1.35–1.43;P(cid:3).01);parathyroidhormone(RR(cid:1)0.32,95%CI:0.30–0.34,P(cid:3).05),
C-reativeprotein(RR(cid:1)1.03,95%CI:0.97–1.09;P(cid:3).05),hemoglobinlevels(RR(cid:1).75,
95%CI:0.72–0.79;P(cid:3).05).At3and5yearsfollow-up,PDpatients’showedfewergraft
failures than HD patients (14% vs 20%; P (cid:3) .05 and 17% vs 28%; P (cid:3) .05).
Conclusion. Early graft function rates were better for PD than for HD patients.
