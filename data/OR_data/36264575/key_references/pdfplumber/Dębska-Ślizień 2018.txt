Abstract
The impact of dialysis modality before transplantation (HD or PD) on outcomes is not clear.
We retrospectively analyzed the impact of dialysis modality on post-transplantation follow up. To
T
minimize the donor bias, a paired kidney analysis was applied. 133 pairs of peritoneal dialysis
P
(PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients transplanted in our center between 1994 and 2016 who
I
received kidneys from the same donor were included.
R
HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was
C
similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to
immunosuppressive protocols and the number of mismatches 2.96 vSs 2.95.
One-year patient (98% vs 96%) and graft (90% vs 93%) survivUal was similar in PDP and HDP
group. The Kaplan-Meier curves of patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. DGF
N
and AR occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting
A
in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and in 4 HD (3%) patients (p>0.05). Creatinine serum
M
concentration and eGFR (MDRD) one-month, one-year, and at last visit, did not differ.
On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with graft loss were: graft vessels
thrombosis, DGF, graft function one month aDfter transplantation. On univariate analysis the age,
coronary heart disease, graft loss were associated with death. Amongst these factors only coronary heart
E
disease ("Model 1") and graft loss were significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.
T
Conclusion: Long-term outcomeP of renal transplantation is similar in patients coming from either
PD or HD. Those groups of Epatients differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular
thrombosis in PDP, and to DGF and AR in HDP.

INTRODUCTION
Renal transplantation remains the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). Studies examining the association between dialysis modality, i.e. hemodialysis (HD) or
peritoneal dialysis (PD), and patient and graft survival after transplantation have shown ambiguous results.
Some studies reported that there was no association between dialysis modality and the patient and graft
T
outcome after transplantation [1-6]. However, Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. in 92,844 US ESRD patients,
P
observed that kidney transplant recipients on PD before transplantation had a lower risIk of death, and a
R
lower risk of (death-censored) graft failure than HD patients [7]. Molmar et al. in 12,416 HD and 2,092
C
PD US patients found that PD recipients had lower mortality, but similar graft loss or delayed graft
S
function [8]. On the other hand, Snyder et al. in 22,776 US ESRD patients noticed that death censored
U
graft failure was 1.15 times higher in PD vs HD patients, but mortality and overall graft failure rates were
N
not different. In that study, transplantation in PD patients was more frequently associated with early, but
A
not late, graft failure. In those patients for whom data on the cause of early graft failure was available,
M
graft thrombosis was more frequent in PD patients [9]. Similar observations were also reported in the
studies of Ojo et al., Murphy et al. and van der Vlie t et al. [10-12]. Vats et al. analyzing 1,090 PD and 780
D
HD children, found that graft loss resulting from vascular thrombosis was more common in children who
E
were on PD before transplantation [13]. Martins et al. in the most recent study, analyzing the impact of
T
dialysis modality on the outcome of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) in type 1
P
diabetic patients, found that transplantation in PD patients was more frequently complicated with intra-
E
abdominal infection leading to pancreatic loss, and with renal thrombosis with an adverse impact on graft
C
survival [14]. The effect of dialysis modality on early post-transplant infections also remains
C
controversial. While some studies have noted a higher incidence of infections in PD patients in the first
A
month after transplant [15] others failed to show differences in the rate of post-transplant infections in PD
and HD patients [16].
The primary goal of this single-center study was to analyze short and long-term outcomes of
kidney transplantation in pre-transplant PD and HD patients. We also studied the incidence of
1
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
postoperative complications, with a focus on post-transplant vascular thrombosis, infectious complications
and delayed graft function. In order to minimize the impact of donor variability and bias, paired kidney
analysis was applied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
T
Peritoneal dialysis patients (n=207) constituted 13.7% (207 from 1505) of all kidney transplantations
P
performed in Gdansk Transplantation Center between December 1994, when the first pIatient dialyzed by
R
means of PD was transplanted, and December 2016. 133 of those peritoneal dialysis patients (PDP) who
C
had a paired kidney recipient from the same donor, who was on hemodialysis (HDP) before
S
transplantation, were included in the analysis. Patients who sequentially underwent both dialysis
U
modalities were excluded from the study. Only patients receiving few hemodialysis sessions before
N
starting long-lasting PD were accepted. Patients receiving second and next KTx were excluded from the
A
study.
M
Statistical Analyses
D
Quantitative variables were presented as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with inter-
E
quartile range (IQR). Qualitative data was shown as numbers and percentages.
T
Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, whereas chi-
P
square test or Fisher’s exact test were applied for categorical variables.
E
Survival curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival between PD
C
group and HD group were compared using log-rank [17] test and Renyi’s test (supreme version of the
C
weighted log-rank test) [18]. The reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator [19] was used to evaluate median
A
follow-up. Univariate and multivariate models were based only on Cox proportional hazards regression
[20]. Results from the Cox regressions were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were built using the following strategies: only significant
2
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
variables (P value of 0.05 or less) with univariate models (model 1), and forward selection (model 2).
The assumption of proportionality hazards was evaluated by including time-dependent interactions of each
variable, and tested using Schoenfeld residuals [21].
In order to verify the linearity of continuous covariates, the martingale residuals [2022] with LOESS
(local polynomial regression) curve were plotted.
T
The goodness of fit of multiple regression was assessed using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The
P
2-tailed tests were carried out at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. I
R
All statistical analyses were performed using R package version 3.2.3.

RESULTS
U
Recipient Characteristics
N
The PDP group consisted of 133 (65 male, 68 female) patients aged between 12 and 71 (mean 44.42 ±
A
15.1) years. The HDP group also constituted 133 ( 86 male, 47 female) patients aged between 19 and 81
M
(mean 48.88 ± 15.5). The PDP patients were significantly younger (t-Student Test, p=0.04), but with
regard to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [2 3, 24] we found no differences in the number of
D
comorbidities between PDP and HDP patients (3.12 vs 3.46).
E
T
The underlying renal diseases in the PDP and HDP groups included chronic glomerulonephritis (38.5% vs
P
31.8%), chronic interstitial nephritis (6.2% vs 7.7%), diabetic nephropathy (14.6% vs 15.5%), cystic
E
kidney disease (7.7% vs 11.6%), hypertensive nephropathy (12.3% vs 14.0%), and not known and others
C
about 20% in both groups.
C
Dialysis time before transplantation was significantly shorter in PDP than in HDP group (20.35 ± 17 vs
A
33.55± 36 mo.; p<0.05).
The frequency of diabetes type 1 and 2 was equal in PDP and HDP (15/9; p>0.05). The time on the
waiting list for PDP recipients (mean 4.9 ± 5; range 1 day to 23 mo.) and HDP (mean 5.2 ± 8; range 1
3
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
days to 45 mo.) was not different (P >0.05) – available data from years 2011-2016. The PDP and HDP
groups did not differ with respect to types of immunosuppressive protocols, mean total ischemia time
(14h 33' vs 14h 48') and panel reactive antibody titers (6.1/3.1% vs 4.6/1.2% historical and current,
respectively).
Patients characteristics were performed in Tab. 1.

P
Donor Characteristics I
R
The donors for PDP and HDP recipients (87 male, 52 female) were aged between 15 and 74 (mean 43.3
C
±14) years. Their mean eGFR (Cockroft-Gault) level was 114.2 ± 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The cause of donor
S
death was traumatic in 42%, cerebrovascular in 52% and other factors accounted for 6% of the deaths.
U
According to deceased-donor score (A,B,C,D) the categories of donors were as follows: A - 41; B - 50; C-
N
36; D- 1; no data – 5 in the PDP group and A - 40; B - 49; C - 38; D- 1; no data - 5 for the HDP group.
A
The groups slightly differed due to the fact that in deceased-donor score, the number of mismatches
M
between donor and recipient is therefore also taken into account [25].
D
Post-transplantation follow-up in PDP and HDP Groups
E
The post-transplantation follow-up for the PDP and HDP groups is presented in Table 2. The groups (PDP
T
vs HDP) differ significantly with respect to the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). 28 (21.05%)
P
PDP patients, and 57 (42.86%) HDP patients experienced DGF (P< 0.05). DGF was defined as the need
E
for hemodialysis during the first week after transplantation. The incidences of acute rejection (AR) were
C
significantly fewer in the PDP (14.3% vs 32.3%) in PDP vs HDP, respectively; p<0.05). AR was not
C
always biopsy-proven, so the probability of mis-diagnosis of AR in patients suffering from DGF was
A
probable.
The most common complications were infections: urinary tract infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV),
and also new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). PDP and HDP had a similar rate of bacterial
infections (mostly urinary tract infection) (p>0.05), and the duration of the first hospitalization was
4
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
slightly longer in HDP group (24.1 vs 22.2 days, p>0.05). The number of cardiovascular complications
was small, and similar in both groups.
Among the surgical complications, the most common were lymphoceles, hematomas, urinary fistulas,
ureter obstructions and graft vessels thrombosis. The amount of early graft vessel thrombosis was higher
T
in PDP as compared to HDP: 6, 7.2%vs3% (p>0.05).
P
On univariate analysis PD was not a risk factor for graft vessel thrombosis (Tab. 3) I
R
In multivariate “forward model“ analysis (Tab. 4). PD can be directed as an independent risk factor for
C
graft vessels thrombosis, the risk was almost 3 times higher than in HDP (p=0.09).

The groups (PDP vs HDP) did not differ significantly from each other with respect to 1-year patient

(89% vs 90%). The Kaplan-Meier curves of patients and graft and death-censored graft survival did not
differ significantly (Fig 1,2,3).

During follow-up there were a total of 20 death events - estimated median length of follow-up was 46
months (95% CI: 26-57) .
On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with death-censored graft loss were: DGF, graft
vessels thrombosis, infections (mainly UIT) and graft function one month after transplantation, the
T
independent predictors upon multivariate analysis were: DGF, graft vessels thrombosis and eGFR (Table
P
7, 8). DGF, graft vessels thrombosis, graft function one month after transplantation weIre independent
R
factors of graft loss (Table 9, 10). On univariate analysis the age, coronary heart disease, graft loss were
C
associated with death. Amongst these factors only coronary heart disease ("Model 1") and graft loss were

significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.

DISCUSSION
Previous single-center studies have brough t contradictory results in estimation of the influence of
D
pre-transplant dialysis modality on transplantation outcome in recipients receiving grafts from the same
E
donor. Our study groups PDP and HDP were comparable in respect of comorbidities, gender and CCI,
T
mean age of HDP group was higher. Patients received kidneys from donors with excellent kidney function
P
and were given similar types of initial immunosuppressive protocols. Short and long-term medical care
E
was performed by the same transplant team. This methodological factor mitigates the confounding
C
influence of differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of donors, as well as different
C
transplant center surgical and medical protocols, on the results. The groups (PDP vs HDP) did not differ
A
significantly from each other with respect to 1-year patient survival and 1-year death censored graft
survival and 1-year graft survival.
While some studies have failed to find a difference in outcomes [1,2,3,4,5,6], others have found PD to
have some beneficial effects after renal transplantation compared to HD [7, 8, 9]. In our center, PDP had a
6
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
similar to HDP one-year patient survival (98% vs 96%), one-year death censored graft survival (90% vs
93%) and one-year graft survival (89% vs 90%). The Kaplan-Meier curves showing long-term follow-up
(0.5-23 years) patients and graft survivals did not differ significantly in PDP and HDP (Fig 1, 2, 3).
Cardiovascular, and most other, complications listed in table 2 were observed in similar frequency in PDP
and HDP; Infectious complication were equally common in both groups. Graft function in both groups did
T
not differ, both early and late, after transplantation. Similar numbers of patients died during the follow-up;
P
main causes of death (cardiovascular disease or neoplasm) were not different. I
R
However, the studied groups have differed in certain aspects. Some studies have shown PDP to
C
experience fewer incidences of DGF (8, 9, 26, 27) the others have not (4). In our center, in quite well-
S
matched groups, we confirmed that PDP experienced significantly less DGF. In PDP we also diagnosed a
U
significantly fewer number of ARs, although the diagnosis was usually based on clinical symptoms and
N
doppler US, and in HDP experiencing much more frequently DGF, the number of ARs could be
A
overestimated. On the other hand, DGF may predispose to rejection [20].
M
PD patients have been reported to be more likely to have allograft vascular thrombosis, compared to
patients treated with HD [10-14]. The incidence of vascular thrombosis at our center was higher in PDP as
D
compared to HDP but not significantly (multivariate “forward model“ analysis the risk in PDP was
E
almost 3 times higher than in HDP).
T
What is to be noticed is that among PDP were more individuals with type 1 diabetes (DM1) (11vs 7% in
P
PDP and HDP respectively), but none of patients with thrombosis suffered from DM 1. In HDP
E
thrombosis occurred in three patients, and none of them was diabetic. Martins et al. in his recent study
C
analyzing the impact of dialysis modality on the outcome of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation
C
(SPKT) in DM1 patients, found that transplantation in PD patients was more frequently complicated with
A
renal thrombosis with an adverse impact on survival [14]. There are several risk factors for vascular
thrombosis in solid organ transplantation; such as multiple vessels, technical problems during
anastomosis, very young pediatric donors or elderly donors, thrombocytosis, hemoconcentration,
hypotension and the existence of a previous transplant and hypercoagulable states [10,29]. Diabetes itself
7
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
has been considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis [30]. Controversies still exist whether PD by
itself predisposes to a thrombophilic state [10]. However, patients with vascular access problems are
referred more often to PD, possibly due to a pre-existing prothrombotic state in some of them. Robertson
et al. [31] and Scheffert et al. [29] reported potential beneficial effects of aspirin and low-dose heparin
started in the early post-operative period, at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding in PKT. Schenker et
T
al. have found better results using low molecular-weight heparin [32].
P
In our transplant center low molecular-weight heparin is a standard in post-operative pIrotocols. However,
R
taking into consideration our, and other authors’, observations, both in kidney transplantation and PKT,
C
the use of small doses of aspirin could be conceivable.
S
Our results show that short and long-term patients and graft survival are independent of the pre-transplant
U
dialysis modality. Those groups of patients differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular
N
thrombosis in PDP, and to DGF and AR in HDP. As PD first strategy, besides pre-emptive
A
transplantation, in ESRD patients is advised, the risk of renal thrombosis should be taken into
M
consideration and appropriate measures undertaken.

A paired kidney analysis was applied to evaluate the impact of dialysis modality on
post-transplantation follow up in 133 pairs receiving grafts from the same donor.
Long-term transplantation outcome is similar in patients coming from either PD or
HD.
PD and HD groups differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular
thrombosis in PD, and to DGF and AR in HD.
