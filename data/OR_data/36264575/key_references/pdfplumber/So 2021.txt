Introduction:Individuals aged $65 years are increasingly prevalent on the waitlist for kidney trans-
plantation, yet evidence on recipient and donor factors that define optimal outcomes in elderly patients
after kidney transplantation is scarce.
Methods: We used multivariable Cox regression modeling to determine the factors associated with all-
cause death, death with a functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft survival, using data
from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry.
Results: A total of 802 kidney transplant recipients aged $65 years underwent their first transplantation
betweenJune2006andDecember2016.Medianageattransplantationwas68years(interquartilerange¼
