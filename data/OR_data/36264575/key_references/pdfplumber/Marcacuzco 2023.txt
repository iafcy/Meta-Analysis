4. Abstract
ABSTRACT
Background. Controversy remains with regard to the higher risk of intraabdominal
infections and lower patient and graft survival when peritoneal dialysis (PD) rather
than hemodialysis (HD) is used in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation
(SPKT).
Methods. From March 1995 to December 2015 we performed 165 SPKTs. Prior to
transplant, patients received hemodialysis (Group HD; n=98) or peritoneal dialysis
(Group PD; n=67). A comparison was performed to analyze posttransplant
complications and patient, pancreas and kidney graft survivals.
Results. Donor, pretransplant and perioperative recipient variables were similar in
both groups. Overall rates of infections (69.4% in HD vs. 73.1% in PD; p=0.50) and
intraabdominal infections (31.6% in HD vs. 35.8 in PD; p=0.57) were similar in both
groups. The rates of pancreatitis, hemorrhage or thrombosis of the graft, duodenal
graft leak, relaparotomy, transplantectomy, pancreas rejection and retransplantation
were similar in both groups.
One, 3, and 5-year patient survival (95.9%, 93.9% and 93.9% in HD vs. 95.5%,
92.2% and 90.4% in PD; p=0.54), and pancreas graft survival (83.6%, 78.0%, and
71.8% in HD vs. 79.2%, 77.4%, and 71.0% in PD; p=0.8) were similar in both
groups. Kidney graft survival was similar in both groups.
Pancreas graft thrombosis, rejection and relaparotomy for intraabdominal
complications were independent predictors of lower pancreas graft survival, but
dialysis modality did not influence patient or graft survival.

Conclusions. Pre-SPKT modality of dialysis does not significantly influence overall
or intraabdominal infection and patient, pancreas or kidney graft survivals.
1. INTRODUCTION
Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) is the treatment of choice for
patients who suffer diabetes type 1 or type 2 at end-stage renal disease, because it
is the only proven method to restore long-term glycemic control.1-3 Glycemic control
after a successful pancreas transplant can reduce the development or progression
of many secondary diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy,
and cardiovascular disease).4
Recipients with pretransplant dialysis show a higher risk of death compared to non-
dialyzed recipients, and therefore a preemptive SPKT transplant should be
considered whenever possible.5 There is some controversy regarding the best
modality of dialysis before SPKT. Thus, several authors have compared the
outcomes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) before SPKT, showing
discordant results mainly with regard to patient and graft survival and the
development of intraabdominal infections.6-13
The aim of this study, to our knowledge the largest series considering patients who
have undergone SPKT with previous HD versus PD, is to compare both groups
regarding the rates of posttransplant complications, patient survival, and survival of
pancreas and kidney grafts.

2. PATIENTS AND METHODS
From March 1995 to December 2015 we performed 215 pancreas transplants from
brain-death donors, and 173 of these were SPKTs. The sample size for this
retrospective, longitudinal cohort study comprised 165 patients, after exclusion of
eight patients who underwent SPKT in predialysis status. The sample was divided
into two groups according to the dialysis modality before transplant: group HD (n=
98; 59.4%) and group PD (n=67; 40.6%). This study was approved by the
institutional review board.
The whole pancreas with duodenum and first jejunal limb, and kidney grafts were
recovered and preserved in Belzer or Celsior solution. The pancreas graft was
placed intraperitoneally, in a caudal or cephalad position, on the right iliac fossa. The
portal vein was anastomosed end-to-side to the common iliac vein (first 27 SPKTs)
or to the distal caval vein, and the arterial Y graft of the pancreas was anastomosed
end-to-side to the common iliac artery of the recipient. A side-to-side stapled
duodeno-cystostomy or a side-to-side hand-sewn duodeno-enterostomy was
performed. At the end of pancreas implantation, PD catheters were removed in all
recipients, but catheter tip culture was not routinely performed. Only in cases of
suspicion of intraperitoneal fluid contamination a culture was carried out. The kidney
graft was implanted extraperitoneally through a second oblique incision in the left
iliac fossa.

Immunosuppression comprised thymoglobulin (1.5 mg/kg/d) induction for 7 days or
basiliximab (20 mg/kg/d at the 1st day, and 20 mg/kg/d at the 4th day), tacrolimus
(maintenance levels of 10-15 ng/ml during the first 6 months and 5-10 ng/ml
thereafter), azathioprine (100 mg/d) during the first three months and thereafter
substituted by mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg/12 h), and steroids.
Prophylaxis of infections consisted of intravenous ceftazidime and vancomycin for
bacterial infections, ganciclovir or valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infections, fluconazole for fungal infections, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for
Pneumocystis jirovecii infections.
Initially, thrombosis prophylaxis was performed with perioperative low-molecular-
weight dextran (250 ml/d) or perioperative low-dose of intravenous heparin (50 U/kg
for 5-7 days), and acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg/d) beginning at the 5th day (n=23 HD;
n=19 PD); thereafter, we changed to enoxaparin (4000 IU/d) and acetylsalicylic acid
(100 mg/d) beginning at the 5th day. Currently we follow the latter prophylaxis
regimen.
Posttransplant intraabdominal infection was classified into four grades: 1) evidence
of fluid collections by drainage that were managed by antibiotic therapy alone; 2)
intraabdominal collections managed by percutaneous drainage; 3) peritonitis or
infected collections that required relaparotomy for surgical drainage; and 4)
intraabdominal infections that required transplantectomy. Patients who suffered
grades 2, 3 or 4 were also treated with antibiotics.

The chronology followed in this comparative study was the registration of
pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics, intraoperative and posttransplant
variables, postoperative complications, and patient and pancreas and kidney graft
survivals.
2.1 Statistical analysis
Quantitative variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean values
plus or minus standard deviation (SD), or as median 25 and 75 percentiles when the
distribution was abnormal. Qualitative variables were described as percentages.
Differences in properties between qualitative variables were assessed by chi-square
test or Fisher´s exact test. Comparison of quantitative variables was made by
Student´s t test. Graft and patient survivals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Comparison of survival curves was performed using the log-rank test.
Pretransplant and perioperative variables showing statistically (near-) significant
differences in the univariate analysis were subsequently investigated in a
multivariate analysis using the Cox regression method to assess the effect of dialysis
modality on patient and graft survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were determined by adjusting for the dialysis type. A P value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis of these data was performed
with the SPSS 15.0 statistical software package.

2. RESULTS
In the comparative analysis between HD and PD recipients we did not find any
significant differences regarding gender, age, body mass index (BMI), duration of
diabetes, time on dialysis, personal background, and laboratory parameters (Table
1).
Regarding donor characteristics (gender, age, BMI, cause of death, intensive care
unit (ICU) stay, hypotension, cardiac arrest, blood transfusion, vasoactive drugs, and
laboratory data) there were no statistically significant differences between the groups
(Table 2).
With respect to perioperative variables (type of preservation solution, warm and cold
ischemia times, frequency of donor CMV+/recipient CMV-, venous and exocrine
drainage of the pancreas graft, graft thrombosis prophylaxis, induction therapy with
antibodies, and maintenance immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors) we did
not find any significant differences between the groups (Table 3).
Culture of intraperitoneal fluid was performed in 3 recipients of the PD group
because of suspicion of contamination or infection; Candida albicans was detected in
2 cases. The overall rate of infections was similar between the groups: 68 (69.4%)
patients showed at least one episode of infection in the HD group vs. 49 (73.1%)
patients in the PD group (P=0.50). The rate of intraabdominal infections was also
similar in both groups: 31 (31.6%) patients in the HD group vs. 24 (35.8%) in the PD
group (P=0.57). There was no significant difference in the rate of patients with light
intraabdominal infections (grade 1) who were managed with antibiotic therapy alone:

23 (23.5%) patients in the HD group vs. 13 (19.4%) in the PD group (P=0.51).
Surgical drainage of intraabdominal collections (peritonitis and abscesses) was more
frequently carried out in the PD group than in the HD group: 8 (11.9%) patients in PD
vs. 4 (4.1%) in HD. In the PD group, 4 patients underwent 2 relaparotomies and 2
patients needed 3 relaparotomies for drainage of intraabdominal collections. In the
HD group, 1 patient underwent 2 relaparotomies and 2 patients needed 3
relaparotomies. The mean period from SPKT to the first reoperation was 7+1.7 days
in the HD group versus 13+3.4 days in the PD group.
Percutaneous drainage was indicated in 4 (4.1%) patients of HD group vs. in 2
(3.0%) patients in the PD group. Finally, transplantectomy was only necessary in 1
(1.5%) patient of the PD group because of pancreas graft abscesses.
The rates of other complications, such as wound and CMV infections, overall
relaparotomy, graft pancreatitis, graft hemorrhage, graft venous or arterial
thrombosis, duodenal leak, transplantectomy, and acute or chronic rejection of the
pancreas graft and retransplantation did not reach any significant differences
between the groups. The only complication that was almost significantly more
frequent in the PD group was the rate of duodenal fistula (6% in HD vs. 15% in PD;
P=0.06). The rates of pancreas graft loss because of pancreatitis, hemorrhage,
thrombosis, duodenal leak, and rejection were also similar in both groups. The
median hospital stay was 26 days in both groups (Table 4). The rates of bacterial
and fungal organisms that were isolated from patients with intraabdominal infections
were similar in both groups. The most frequently encountered organisms are shown
in Table 5. Five patients developed antibiotic resistance to Pseudomona aeruginosa

(3 patients in the HD group and 1 in the PD group) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1
patient in the PD group).
One, 3, and 5-year actuarial patient survival was similar in the HD and PD groups
(95.9%, 93.9% and 93.9% in HD vs. 95.5%, 92.2% and 90.4% in PD; P=0.54).
Likewise, we did not find any significant differences between the groups comparing
the rates of actuarial pancreas graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years (83.6%, 78.0%, and
71.8% in HD vs. 79.2%, 77.4%, and 71.0% in PD; P=0.83), or kidney graft survival at
1, 3, and 5 years (93.8%, 88.1%, and 86.9% in the HD group vs. 95.3%, 92.0%, and
92.0% in the PD group; P=0.71) (Figure 1).
Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patient and pancreas graft
survivals were not adversely affected by the modality of pre-SPKT dialysis. On the
other hand, pancreas graft thrombosis or rejection, and the necessity of
relaparotomy for management of intraabdominal complications were confirmed as
independent predictors of pancreas graft loss (Table 6).
3. DISCUSSION
There is some controversy regarding the relative mortality risk for end-stage renal
disease patients treated with either PD or HD. However, several studies have shown
improvements in prognosis for both HD and PD patients.14-16 In a recent review, it
was established that patient survival is similar in PD and HD, but older patients,
diabetic patients and those with comorbidities may have a worse prognosis on PD
versus HD, whereas younger patients with no comorbidities show higher survival
when treated with PD versus HD.17

The results are also controversial when a comparison is made between HD and PD
patients who undergo kidney transplantation alone, because some authors do not
find any significant differences between the groups,18,19 whereas others find worse
results when PD is used before kidney transplant.20,21
Several potential risks of PD in diabetic patients have been described (fluid overload,
dysregulation of metabolic response to glucose, hyperinsulinemia, obesity,
dyslipidemia and peritoneal infection), but important benefits have also been
reported (home-based continuous therapy, more liberal diet, intraperitoneal insulin
administration, better preservation of residual renal function and blood pressure
control, preservation of vascular access, avoidance of myocardial stunning and
circulatory stress, and no need for systemic anticoagulation).22 A series of more than
400 patients showed that survival rate of diabetics on PD was equal to that of
nondiabetics on HD, and diabetics on HD had the worst survival.23 It has been
suggested that new PD solutions with low accumulation of glucose degradation
products may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, by
preserving residual renal function, optimizing volume control, and possibly reducing
local and systemic inflammation.22
Series comparing PD and HD prior to SPKT have also shown discordant results with
respect to patient and pancreas graft survival and the rate of posttransplant
intraabdominal infections.6-13

Our present series of SPKTs shows homogeneity with respect to the distribution of
donor, recipient, and perioperative variables between the groups, and intraabdominal
infections, thrombosis, pancreatitis, bleeding and leak of the pancreas graft are the
most frequent surgical complications after SPKT. Overall infection rate after SPKT
has been reported in up to 80% of patients,24-26 whereas intraabdominal infections
can represent up to 70% of all infections after pancreas transplant,27 and are
associated with higher risk of mortality and pancreas graft loss.28,29 Ninety per cent of
patients who suffer severe intraabdominal infections will need a relaparotomy, and
70% of these will require a pancreas explant.30 Many risk factors can contribute to
the development of intraabdominal infections after SPKT, such as pancreas graft
age >45 years, prolonged graft ischemia time,27,30 long duration of diabetes, PD
(association of progressive peritoneal fibrosis), enteric exocrine drainage,
immunosuppression,8,9,31 retransplantation, older recipient, prolonged time of
surgery,27,30,32,33 graft pancreatitis,34 and leakage from the duodeno-enteric
anastomosis.30
Several authors have reported that the use of PD compared to HD before SPKT
constitutes a higher risk factor for the development of intraabdominal infections,6-9,13
showing an incidence between 23.5% and 44% in PD groups versus 7.7% to 34% in
HD groups.8,9 However, other studies do not find any significant differences between
the groups in the overall incidence of intraabdominal infections (9.6% to 28% in PD
groups versus 8.8% to 30% in HD groups).10-12 In our series the overall rate of
infections was 71%, and 55 (33%) patients showed intraabdominal location with no
significant difference between the groups (31.6% in HD vs. 35.8% in PD). The
majority of our infected patients corresponded to grades 1 and 2, and were managed

by minimally aggressive therapies, such as antibiotic therapy alone in 36 (21.8%) or
percutaneous drainage in 6 (3.6%) patients.
Our overall rate of patients undergoing surgical drainage for intraabdominal
infections (grade 3) was 7.3% (12 patients), corresponding 8 (11.9%) patients in the
PD group vs. 4 (4.1%) patients in the HD group, and only 1 patient needed
transplantectomy (grade 4) because of pancreas abscesses.
Other authors have reported rates between 5-29% of surgical drainage of
intraabdominal collections,10,12,13 with the main causes being the presence of
infection, bleeding, and thrombosis.13
Although we did not find a significant difference in overall incidence of
intraabdominal infections between the PD and HD groups, there is a tendency to
develop more severe intraabdominal infections in the PD group. Therefore,
additional studies with a larger sample size are required to substantiate this
preliminary finding. As in other series,13 pancreatitis, hemorrhage, thrombosis and
rejection of the pancreas graft, and duodenal graft leakage were our main causes of
graft loss, but we did not observe any significant differences between the HD and PD
groups. Moreover, the rate of duodenal leakage was close to being significantly
higher in our PD group. Our rates of wound and CMV infections were also similar
between the groups.

In a recent report, significantly lower patient and kidney graft survivals were seen in
the PD group.13 However, as other authors,10,12 we did not find any significant
differences with respect to patient, pancreas and kidney graft survivals between the
HD and PD groups.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that graft thrombosis, pancreas
rejection and mandatory relaparotomy are independent predictors of lower pancreas
graft survival. Moreover, the dialysis modality did not affect patient or pancreas graft
survival. Other authors found in a multivariate analysis that concomitant
cardiovascular disease, pancreas and/or kidney failure, and PD are independent
predictors of patient death.13
In conclusion, the current study confirms that the pre-SPKT modality of dialysis does
not influence the overall rate of infections, or specifically of intraabdominal infections,
and patient, pancreas and kidney graft survivals.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pancreas graft thrombosis or rejection, and
the necessity of relaparotomy for management of intraabdominal complications are
independent predictors of pancreas graft loss.
