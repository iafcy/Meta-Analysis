Summary
It remains controversial whether dialysis modality prior to SPKT (simultaneous pan-
creas–kidney transplantation) affects the outcome. We analyzed outcomes in type 1
diabetic patients undergoing SPKT, comparing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialy-
sis (HD) groups: 119 had been on HD; 39 on PD. They were comparable except
regarding dialysis time, higher in HD patients (30  23 vs. 21  15 months,
P = 0.003). Thrombosis-driven relaparotomy was more frequent in PD patients
(12.8% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.014). Pancreas loss due to infection was higher in PD patients
(12.8% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.042). Thrombosis-related kidney loss was more frequent in PD
patients (5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.058). Thirteen deaths occurred, more
within the PD group (17.9% vs. 5%; P = 0.011), being infection the leading cause
(13.5%, vs. 1.7% in HD patients, P = 0.010). Patient survival was inferior in PD
patients. Besides PD, cardiovascular disease and graft failure were independent predic-
tors of patient death. In conclusion, PD patients more frequently complicated with
intra-abominal infection leading to pancreatic loss and with renal thrombosis, with
adverse impact on survival. As a PD ﬁrst strategy in end-stage renal disease patients is
generally associated with good outcomes, these gloomier results after SPKT urge for
careful adjustment of infection and thrombosis prophylactic protocols in PD patients.

Introduction
Several studies demonstrated that pre-emptive transplanta-
tion, deﬁned as transplantation before chronic dialysis is
required, improves patient and graft outcomes in renal
transplant patients [1–3]. However, most patients have to
start renal replacement by dialysis because the kidney graft
is not immediately available.
Regarding dialysis modality, peritoneal dialysis (PD) or
hemodialysis (HD), and its impact on transplant outcomes,
there is no consensus on which is associated with better
results [1,3–5], meaning that outcomes might be generally
similar after adjusting for patient characteristics and center
experience. The amount of time on dialysis may be the cru-
cial factor with impact on outcome [1, 6], along with
patient
comorbidities
[7].
Nevertheless,
studies
were
focused mostly on renal transplantation only, and with
inconclusive results related to several issues comparing pre-
vious dialysis modality: There are conﬂicting reports about
an increased renal graft loss in PD patients [8], mainly due
to renal vascular thrombosis (VT) [4,5,8–11], by unclear
predisposing mechanisms [12]; and about an increased
incidence of sepsis in these patients [13,14]. Early infection
may be related to other factors, namely the length of hospi-
talization or more intense immunosuppression, as in cases
of acute rejection [15].
On the other hand, there is a lack of data about the prefer-
able dialysis modality prior to simultaneous pancreas–kidney
transplantation (SPKT). Option for PD or HD normally
depends on patient condition, such as their own autonomy;
comorbid situations; vascular and peritoneal conditions;
dialysis-center factors; and patient convenience. Patient
selection biases for each modality cannot be ruled out.
The purpose of this study was to analyze grafts and
patient outcomes, in our type 1 diabetic (DM1) patients
undergoing SPKT, comparing the subgroup that had been
on PD with the other on HD.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study in
adult SPKT performed at our unit. Among the 165 per-
formed between May 2000 and December 2013, we studied
158 on dialysis prior to SPKT. Cases who received a pre-
emptive transplant were not included in the comparative
analysis because of the small number of patients (n = 7).
PD was the dialysis modality in 39 patients, while 119 were
on HD.
Systemic–enteric drainage was the technique used in all
SPKT. Pancreas transplantation is performed using a side-
to-side anastomosis between the donor0s duodenal arch and
the recipient’s jejunum, with pancreas head up. Vascular
implantation normally does not require prior reconstruc-
tion. Donor0s aorta patch with the origin of the mesenteric
superior artery and the splenic artery is anastomosed to the
recipient0s common iliac artery and donor0s portal vein
anastomosed to the recipient’s common iliac vein. Kidney
transplantation is performed through a second incision, on
the left iliac fossae, with extraperitoneal graft placement, the
usual practice for kidney transplantation alone. Peritoneal
catheter is always removed during the surgery. Celsior is the
preservation solution used for pancreas grafts. Immunosup-
pression comprised antithymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, my-
cophenolate, and steroids. Two abdominal drains are left
for some days in the transplanted patient: one draining the
abdominal cavity; the second draining the renal graft fossae.
Drain removal depends on volume and drainage character-
istics: They are removed after two consecutive days with
decreasing exudate amylase level and drainage volume,
combined with its leukocyte count and microbiological
analysis revealing no signs of infection. All patients had one
bladder catheter for at least 5 days; and one central venous
catheter, usually for the 5 days of antithymocyte globulin
administration. Antibiotic prophylaxis included vancomy-
cin, ﬂucanozole, and second-generation cephalosporin pre-
operatively and during the ﬁrst few days while catheter and
drains persist; cotrimoxazole, nystatin, and valgancyclovir
were started after surgery. Before implantation, duodenal
graft disinfection is always made using povidone–iodine,
ampicillin, and ﬂuconazole. Thrombosis prophylaxis was
made with aspirin (100 mg/day) started before surgery and
enoxaparin (from 20 to 40 mg/day, depending on patient
weight and renal function recovery) started immediately
after surgery, or when blood losses were considered to be
not signiﬁcant. Data were collected from patient ﬁle
records, during the admission and after discharge, along
with the outpatient follow-up.

(and percentages). Categorical data were compared using
Pearson’s v2 test or Fisher0s exact test and continuous vari-
ables were compared with Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney
U-test, as appropriate. Patient survival was determined from
the time of SPKT until death or end of follow-up. Death-
censored kidney graft survival was determined from the time
of SPKT until kidney failure (return to dialysis or retrans-
plantation) or end of follow-up. Death-censored pancreas
graft survival was determined from the time of SPKT until
pancreas failure (permanent insulin requirement or retrans-
plantation) or end of follow-up. Graft survival curves were
performed using Kaplan–Meier method and compared by
log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analy-
sis was applied to assess independent predictors of patient
death, including clinically relevant variables and/or those
presenting P ≤0.15 in univariable analysis: recipient gender
and age, dialysis technique (HD vs. PD), time on dialysis,
years of DM1, pretransplant glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
< or ≥9%, concomitant cardiovascular disease, and graft
failure (kidney and/or pancreas).
A two-sided P value <0.05 was considered as statistically
signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS,
version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The relevant demographic and clinical data of the study
population are presented in Table 1. PD and HD patients
were similar for the majority of their pretransplant
characteristics: age; gender; duration of diabetes; HbA1c;
body mass index (BMI); percent of patients chronically tak-
ing aspirin; percent of patients with previously known car-
diovascular disease (CVD); and value of hemoglobin (Hb)
before surgery. Time on dialysis was the single distinguish-
able
parameter,
being
inferior
to
the
PD
group
(20.7  14.6 months, vs. 32.0  22.1 months in the HD
group, P = 0.003). On the contrary, time on the waiting list
for transplantation was undistinguishable (14 months for
PD vs. 16 months for HD patients, P = 0.137). Regarding
donor characteristics, the proportion of grafts from donors
with traumatic brain death (74.4% for PD; 74.8% for HD)
and length of donor0s admission in the intensive care unit
(2.6 days for PD; 2.8 days for HD) as well as donor’s age
(28 years for both groups) were similar between PD and
HD patients. Other factors, such as the number of HLA
mismatches; cold ischemia time; acute rejection rate; and
length of admission, did not differ between both groups.
There was a trend toward a lower rate of delayed renal graft
function in PD patients. In those cases of dialysis need after
SPKT, HD was always used.
The global relaparotomy rate was similar in PD and HD
patients. However, when we analyzed the reasons for
re-intervention, thrombosis predominated (12.8%) among
all causes for reoperation in PD patients (28.2%), being sig-
niﬁcantly higher when compared to HD patients (12.8% vs.
1.7%, P = 0.014). A nonsigniﬁcant higher proportion of
HD patients (7.6%, vs. 2.6% in PD patients) underwent
bleeding-driven relaparotomy. To exclude a possible effect

Pancreas–Kidney transplants: dialysis type and outcome
Martins et al.

of era and cumulative experience on the rate of infection
and thrombosis complications, the rate of such events was
explored in each year of the SPKT program and it was seen
that the events were distributed similarly along the time
course of the SPKT program.
Table 2 summarizes complications leading to each graft
loss and patient death, in both groups. Death-censored
pancreas graft loss was not signiﬁcantly different in both
groups (28.2% for PD, vs. 19.3% for HD patients). How-
ever, we registered more pancreas losses due to infection
among PD patients (12.8%, vs. 3.4% among HD patients,
P = 0.042). There was a trend toward a higher rate of glo-
bal pancreas failure (death-censored) at month 1 in PD
patients (15.4%, vs. 6.7% in HD patients, P = 0.099), but
thereafter this difference disappeared. Additionally, we veri-
ﬁed that the permanence of the abdominal drain after sur-
gery was almost double in PD patients (means of
4.7  1.5 days,
vs.
2.6  1.2 days
in
HD
patients,
P < 0.001).
We analyzed past peritonitis in PD patients and also
intra-abdominal complications observed in this group.
From the 39 PD patients, only ten have had peritonitis:
These experienced 14 peritonitis episodes— four patients
with two episodes. The isolated microbiological agents were
gram positive in all but one: Staphylococcus Epidermidis (6
cases); Staphylococcus Aureus (3 cases); Streptococcus Viri-
dans (2 cases); Enterococcus Faecalis (2 cases); and Pseudo-
monas Aeruginosa (1 case). The latter was efﬁciently treated
with antibiotics and the patient had an uneventful recovery
more than 1 year before SPKT, not needing catheter substi-
tution. This patient did not present abdominal complica-
tions after SPKT. Only one of ﬁve the patients who
complicated with intra-abdominal infection had in the past
a gram-positive peritonitis (Staph Epidermidis, 11 months
ago), and the intra-abdominal agents after SPKT were dis-
tinct: E. Coli and Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Similarly, only one
of the four who complicated with pancreas thrombosis had
a Staphylococcus Aureus peritonitis, 8 months before SPKT.
Microbiological agents identiﬁed in the ﬁve patients with
intra-abdominal infection were almost exclusively gram
negative: E. Coli+ Klebsiella; Enterobacter Aerogenes; Pseudo-
monas (2 cases); and Klebsiella+ vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus Faecium.
As a note, from the single 3 patients who were on PD >
40 months, only one had a peritonitis in the past, but none
of these 3 suffered intra-abdominal complications after
SPKT. Plastic peritonitis and obstruction were not registered.
Additionally, none was switched to HD due to lack of ultra-
ﬁltration or PD efﬁcacy. One single patient was switched
from PD to HD, due to visual impairment, 13 months
before SPKT and was accounted as an HD patient in this
study. Excluding the 3 cases who started renal replacement
by HD, for a few weeks, waiting for conditions for PD cathe-
ter utilization, none was switched from HD to PD.
As to the renal graft, death-censored graft failure was also
not different in both groups (12.8% for PD, vs. 5.9% for
HD patients). Analyzing the causes of renal loss, we noted a
similar acute rejection rate in both groups, but a tendency

Pancreas–Kidney transplants: dialysis type and outcome

to a higher rate of losses due to thrombosis in PD patients
(5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.058). There was a
trend toward an increased ﬁrst-month renal graft failure in
PD patients (5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.060), and
we observed that this tendency persisted after this period,
when accounting for the total number of renal losses dur-
ing follow-up (20.5%, vs. 9.2% among HD patients,
P = 0.060).
We also analyzed other factors prior to SPKT that might
have inﬂuenced thrombosis rate, leading or not to graft
loss: The rate of patients taking aspirin as chronic medica-
tion; the level of Hb; and pre-existent CVD were similar in
patients with and without thrombosis. On the contrary,
patients who complicated with thrombosis more often were
under PD (6/39 vs. 7/119, P = 0.061). The same analysis
was made for pre-existent conditions predisposing to
bleeding, needing surgery or even leading to graft loss.
None of the studied factors (chronic medication with aspi-
rin, Hb level, previous CVD, and dialysis modality) were
associated with a higher incidence of bleeding. Among
those who complicated with bleeding, 11 of 12 were on
HD, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.296).
Patient death was signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group:
17.9% (n = 7), compared with 5.0% (n = 6) in the HD
group, P = 0.011. Infection, as a cause of death, predomi-
nated in PD patients (13.5%, vs. 1.7% in HD patients,
P = 0.010). CVD-related death was registered only in HD
group (4 cases, or 3.4%), although not statistically different
from the PD group.
Four-year and 8-year survival rates are presented in
Table 3. Death-censored survival rates for pancreas graft
were similar in HD and PD patients, irrespective of ﬁrst-
month losses inclusion or not. Death-censored survival
rates for the renal graft were similar in HD and PD patients
when ﬁrst-month losses were excluded. If these early losses
were also considered, then renal survival was inferior in PD
patients. Lower patient survival was observed in the PD
group (87.0% and 71.2% vs. 98.1% and 95.2% in HD
group, at 4 and 8 years, respectively, P = 0.003).
On multivariate analysis, graft failure (one or both
grafts), the modality of dialysis, and concomitant CVD
were conﬁrmed as independent predictors of patient death
(Table 4). The likelihood of death was 8.76 times higher if
at least one graft failed; 6.23 times higher if PD was the
dialysis modality prior to SPKT; and 4.05 times higher
when they have had clinically signiﬁcant CVD. Figure 1
illustrates patient survival curves.
Discussion
Results from published studies about the relationship
between dialysis modality and the outcome of transplant
are not concordant. PD has been associated with poorer
transplant outcomes by some authors [8–11], but others
did not report any detrimental effect of PD [4,5]. However,
most of these results came from kidney transplantation
alone (KTA).
In SPKT, infection [16–20], thrombosis [21,22], and
bleeding
[21],
leading
to
subsequent
relaparotomy
[20,21,23], are feared complications, as they have been
associated with lower graft survival.
There are several classical and well-recognized risk fac-
tors for VT, such as multiple vessels, technical problems
during anastomosis, very young pediatric donors or elderly
donors, thrombocytosis, hemoconcentration, hypotension,
and the existence of a previous transplant [9]. Obviously,
hypercoagulable states substantially increase the rate of
thrombosis [9,21]. Diabetes, itself, has been considered an
additional risk factor for thrombosis [9], and prothrombot-
ic disorders may be frequent in DM1 patients undergoing
SPKT [24].
Though controversies still exist, PD may predispose to a
thrombophilic state by several mechanisms [9] that are not

Pancreas–Kidney transplants: dialysis type and outcome
Martins et al.

completely clear. Enhanced plasmatic activities of procoag-
ulant factors [25] and hemoconcentration [26] were men-
tioned as being more likely to occur in PD than in HD
patients. Robertson et al. [12] showed that the addition of
low-dose aspirin was beneﬁcial in reducing the rate of VT
in KTA patients. Additionally, impaired ﬁbrinolysis caused
by increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) levels is linked with insulin resistance that occurs
with uremia and might be exacerbated in certain PD
patients [27].
Concerning the prevention of pancreas graft thrombosis,
one recent study reported potential beneﬁcial effects with
low-dose heparin started in the early postoperative period
(in association with aspirin), at the expense of a higher
number of relaparotomies [21]. Others have found better
results using lower molecular-weight heparin and con-
cluded that this prophylaxis strategy might not be inferior
to the one using dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated
heparin [22].
PD population usually includes patients with vascular
access problems, possibly due to a pre-existing prothrom-
botic state in some of them—a selection bias that may help
to explain higher rates of renal VT in PD patients [9]. The
transplant center volume and professional skill can addi-
tionally inﬂuence the results. Our transplant team for SPKT
is restricted and has remained stable over the years, render-
ing a bias from different technical skills of multiple sur-
geons very unlikely.
In this study, we observed a higher relaparotomy rate
due to thrombosis and a near signiﬁcant higher rate of
renal graft loss secondary to thrombosis, in PD patients.
Only 2 patients had a previous renal transplant and none
complicated with VT, albeit repeated transplantation is an
established risk factor [9]; Hb level and chronic medication
with aspirin were comparable in PD and HD patients.
However, we have to be cautious in interpreting these
results, given the small number of renal thrombosis (2
cases). Future results from larger series including PD
patients may bring more consistent data regarding the asso-
ciation between PD and thrombosis in SPKT patients who
are normally under thrombosis prophylaxis.
A distinct approach, with more aggressive anticoagula-
tion prophylaxis, has been suggested in PD patients, but it
is not deﬁnitely established. Yet, the bleeding risk must be
weighed. More studies clarifying the predisposing factors to
thrombotic events in PD patients are needed, in order to
design an effective prophylaxis against thrombosis.
While some authors reported similar abdominal infec-
tion rates in PD and HD patients [16,17], there are several
others reporting higher incidence of peritonitis in PD
patients [18,19,28]. Manipulation of the peritoneal cathe-
ter, communicating with the skin and the external environ-
ment, is the major cause for peritonitis in PD patients.
Whether this catheter remains colonized by microbial
agents due to bioﬁlm formation, even without overt infec-
tion, is a real possibility [16]. However, the cultured agents
from the drainage are frequently diverse (gram negative)
from those more often cultured during peritonitis episodes
(gram positive) in PD patients [16], as we also observed. In
SPKT, there are other confounding factors, such as the sur-
gery procedure itself and the opening of the small bowel to
perform duodenal anastomosis.
Fluid collections, as well as vascular catheters or surgical
drains, contribute to the risk of infection. Some degree of
persistent ascites after PD catheter removal is frequently
observed, representing chronic and remarkable changes in
peritoneal membrane [29]. Important volume drainage
leads to the maintenance of the surgical drain for more
days, as we observed in our PD group, again increasing the
risk of infection. In our practice, PD catheter is always
removed at the beginning of SPKT procedure and residual
ascites cultured. The abdominal drainage is repeatedly cul-
tured while it remains important and the drain maintained,
being removed as soon as possible when drainage amylase
decreases and microbiological analysis is sterile. However,
prophylactic antibiotics may need to be extended in
patients with more prolonged drain patency.
Fibrosis and peritoneal thickening following PD [30]
may adversely affect peritoneal and intestinal healing after
the surgery, contributing to increased technical difﬁculty
and to the rate of leak and infection [16]. Graft pancreatitis
and duodenal leak are of paramount importance for
abdominal cavity infection occurrence [31]. Abdominal
surgical re-exploration, in immunosuppressed patients,
represents another risk factor for infectious complications
and for adverse graft outcomes [23], leading to an
enhanced rate of transplantectomy [20].

Pancreas–Kidney transplants: dialysis type and outcome

More intense immunosuppression used in SPKT, com-
pared with KTA, also augments patient susceptibility for sev-
eral types of infections. Our results demonstrated an increased
rate of pancreas loss due to infection in PD patients. The
length of admission and the acute rejection incidence, possible
contributors to infection [15], cannot explain the higher
infection rate in this group, given that they were similar
between HD and PD patients.
Other relevant clinical variables explaining our worse
outcomes in PD patients were not identiﬁed: both groups
had similar age, time of diabetes, acute rejection, and
delayed graft function rates as well as comorbidities such as
CVD. On the contrary, PD patients had a mean time on
dialysis lower than HD patients, meaning they were early
referred to SPKT, which is a positive aspect. Additionally,
more patients were referred from PD centers in the more
recent years, which explains the shorter follow-up after
SPKT in the PD group. It has been reported that PD
patients are more likely to receive a renal transplant [8],
and less likely to evolve with delayed kidney graft function
[8], a tendency also observed in our study.
CVD and graft loss are unquestionable risk factors for
patient death [32]. In our study, PD was a predictor of
death, mainly due to infection and thrombosis. Should
these results be conﬁrmed in further studies, then HD
might be preferable for SPKT candidates, to optimize trans-
plant outcome. Focused investigation is utterly needed as
the risk of these complications after SPKT may be poten-
tially modiﬁable with adjusted per-operatory infection and
thrombosis prophylactic protocols.
