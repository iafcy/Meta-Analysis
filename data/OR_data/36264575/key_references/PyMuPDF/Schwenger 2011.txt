Abstract
Background and objectives. The pretransplant dialysis
modality might inﬂuence renal allograft and patient sur-
vival after transplantation. Studies published to date
yielded conﬂicting results.
Methods. Deceased-donor allograft recipients reported to
the ‘Collaborative Transplant Study’ were analysed, using
multivariate Cox regression analysis, considering poten-
tial confounders which included pretransplant patient car-
diovascular risk evaluation as well as immunological and
treatment parameters. Primary end points were all-cause
graft survival, death-censored graft survival and patient
survival.
Results. In total, 60 008 recipients were analysed. Patients
who were on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n ¼ 11 664) prior to
transplantation demonstrated a 10% lower all-cause mortal-
ity (P ¼ 0.014) but similar death-censored graft surviv-
al (P ¼ 0.39) as recipients treated with haemodialysis
(n ¼ 45 651). This lower all-cause mortality in PD patients
was primarily a consequence of a signiﬁcantly lower rate of
cardiovascular death with a functioning graft (P < 0.013) in
a subcohort of patients deﬁned as at increased risk.
Conclusions. Pretransplant dialysis modality per se has
no signiﬁcant impact on allograft outcome. Superior all-
cause survival of PD patients is primarily due to a lower
rate of cardiovascular death in a subcohort of high-risk
recipients. This might explain the conﬂicting results pub-
lished to date.
Introduction
Previous investigations have suggested that the modality of
pretransplant dialysis might have an impact on subsequent
renal allograft outcome and indicated an advantage of treat-
ment
with
peritoneal
dialysis
(PD).

explanation, delayed graft function was found to be less
common in recipients transplanted after treatment with PD
than in patients on haemodialysis (HD) [1–5]. On the other
hand, at least in patients with early graft failure, acute graft
thrombosis was more common in PD than in HD patients,
suggesting that dialysis modality was associated with pos-
itive and negative effects [6–8]. Some reports have failed to
demonstrate an inﬂuence of pretransplant dialysis modality
on allograft and patient survival [1, 3, 9–11]. Most of the
published studies have been limited either by relatively
small patient numbers or by a lack of consideration of
‘death with a functioning graft’ and confounding risk fac-
tors. We utilized the large database of the international
Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS) [12] to address the
impact of pretransplant dialysis modality on allograft and
patient survival.
Materials and methods
Study design
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of recipients of a deceased-
donor kidney transplant performed during the time period 1998–2007 at
transplant centers in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.
Only ﬁrst transplants in adult recipients (18 years) were studied; multi-
organ transplant recipients (for example kidney plus pancreas) were
excluded.
Patient categorization
Expanded criteria donors (ECDs) were deﬁned as kidney donors with one
or more of the following donor characteristics: age  60 years, history of
hypertension, non-heartbeating donor or considered ‘marginal’ by the
transplant centre for other reasons.
Increased-risk recipients (IRRs) were deﬁned as having a recipient age
of 65 years or diabetes mellitus as the original disease leading to end-
stage renal disease or a moderate or poor evaluation status as a candidate
for transplantation as indicated by the transplant center at time of
transplant.
Statistical analysis and outcome
The primary end points were all-cause graft survival, death-censored
graft survival (for which patients dying with a functioning graft were
censored) and patient survival. Survival rates were calculated using the
Kaplan–Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare out-
come curves. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with back-step elim-
ination was used to eliminate the inﬂuence of potential confounders. The
following pretransplant factors were considered: original disease leading
to end-stage renal failure; pre-existing diabetes mellitus; time on dialysis;
year of transplantation; geographical region; recipient and donor sex,
race and age; evaluation of recipient as a candidate for transplantation;
evaluation of cardiovascular risk, extended donor criteria; human leuco-
cyte antigen (HLA) mismatches; preformed panel-reactive antibodies
and cold ischaemic preservation time. Rather than assuming a linear
inﬂuence, all metric confounders were included in the Cox regression
model as dichotomous variables. For adjusted comparison of Cox regres-
sion incidence plots, the confounders were set to zero or the most fre-
quent value. To take into account differences between PD and HD in
special subpopulations, separate multivariate Cox regression analyses
(considering the above-mentioned parameters) of different risk groups
(taking into account IRR and ECD) were performed. In addition, the
follow-up time period was partitioned into the ﬁrst posttransplant year
and the Years 2–5 to meet the proportional hazards assumption of the
Cox regression model.
Continuous variables were summarized using mean  SD and tested
with the Mann–Whitney U-test. P-values of <0.05 were considered stat-
istically signiﬁcant (two tailed). Statistical analysis was performed using
the software packages R (version 2.10, http://CRAN.R-project.org) and
IBM SPSS Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
In total, 60 008 deceased-donor kidney allograft patients
were eligible for inclusion in the study. Demographics
and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Recipients were categorized into four groups according to
the pretransplant dialysis modality: PD (n ¼ 11 664), HD
(n ¼ 45 651), the combination of both forms of dialysis
(PD 1 HD; n ¼ 1543) and no dialysis (preemptive trans-
plantation, n ¼ 1150). All baseline characteristics varied
signiﬁcantly between the groups and were therefore ap-
propriately considered as confounders in multivariate
analysis.

Figure 1a–c. Unadjusted 5-year rates of graft survival
(79.6 versus 76.1%, log-rank P < 0.001), death-censored
graft survival (87.0 versus 85.2%, P < 0.001) and patient
survival (89.6 versus 86.8%, P < 0.001) were all better in
recipients on pretransplant PD than in recipients on pretrans-
plant HD treatment. The 5-year rates for patients whose
dialysis modality was changed from PD to HD prior to trans-
plantation were similar to those of HD patients (Figure 1).
The best 5-year success rates were observed in recipients
with a preemptive transplant for graft (85.1%), death-
censored graft (90.2%) and patient survival (92.3%), respec-
tively (compared to all other groups P < 0.001).
Multivariate Cox regression analysis (considering origi-
nal disease leading to end-stage renal failure; pre-existing
diabetes mellitus; time on dialysis; year of transplantation;
geographical region; recipient and donor sex, race and
age; evaluation of recipient as a candidate for transplanta-
tion; evaluation of cardiovascular risk, extended donor
criteria; HLA mismatches; preformed panel-reactive anti-
bodies and cold ischaemic preservation time) revealed
superior all-cause 5-year graft and patient survival in trans-
plant recipients who had been on PD treatment as com-
pared to patients on HD (P ¼ 0.033 and P ¼ 0.014,
respectively) (Table 2), whereas no statistical difference
was demonstrated for death-censored graft survival (P ¼
0.39). The relative risk for 5-year cardiovascular mortality
posttransplantation of HD patients was 1.24 times higher
[95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.05–1.48; P ¼ 0.013] than
that of PD patients. For control purposes, we found that the
mortality due to cancer did not differ between HD and PD
patients (HD 3.7 versus PD 3.4%; P ¼ 0.84). In addition to
pretransplant dialysis modality, diabetes mellitus [hazard
ratio (HR) 2.71; 95% CI 2.33–3.15; P < 0.001] and indi-
cation of increased cardiovascular risk during pretransplant
evaluation (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.83; P ¼ 0.001) were
shown to signiﬁcantly contribute to cardiovascular mortal-
ity by Cox regression. Interestingly, when 5-year survival
rates were analysed considering pretransplant risk catego-
rization of recipient (IRR) and donor (ECD) as described in
the methods section, multivariate Cox regression analysis
showed superior 5-year graft (P < 0.001) and patient sur-
vival (P ¼ 0.022) for PD recipients mainly in the subcohort
of patients considered to be at increased pretransplant risk
(IRR) who received allografts from ECDs (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Considering the early posttransplant phase
(e.g. the ﬁrst year after transplantation) and long-term

follow-up separately, we analysed graft survival in the
IRR–ECD group within the ﬁrst year and between Years
2–5 after renal transplantation. Graft survival in the PD
patient cohort was not only superior within the ﬁrst year
after renal transplantation (85.0 versus 80.9%, P < 0.001;
HR 1.12) but also in the time period between Years 2 to 5
(78.8 versus 71.6%, P < 0.001, HR 1.38) (Supplementary
Figure S1). In view of potential country-speciﬁc differences
regarding indications and conditions of renal replacement
therapy, we separately analysed graft survival for IRR–
ECD patients from Europe and North America. We found
a congruent superior graft survival of PD patients in Europe
(P < 0.001) as well as in North America (P ¼ 0.008).
Additional analysis of death-censored graft survival re-
vealed that the superior all-cause graft survival in the
IRR–ECD patient group was due to better patient survival.
In this subgroup, even though pretransplant cardiovascular
risk evaluation showed a similar fraction of patients at in-
creased risk in the two dialysis populations (HD 37.4 versus
PD 37.2%, P ¼ 0.95), consideration of multiple confound-
ers (see Materials and methods) including pretransplant
diabetes mellitus (HD 19.7 versus PD 25.2%, P < 0.001)
and time on dialysis (median: HD 39 months versus PD 31
months, P < 0.001), revealed that mortality with a function-
ing graft due to cardiovascular death during the ﬁrst ﬁve
posttransplant years was signiﬁcantly higher in HD patients
than in PD patients (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.16–2.40; P ¼
0.006). Deducted from the Cox regression analysis, Figure
3a shows the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular death
with a functioning graft for a simulated IRR–ECD cohort of
60–64 year old diabetic male allograft recipients, adjusted
for all potential confounders listed under Methods. To eval-
uate the inﬂuence of posttransplant renal allograft function,
we analysed the cardiovascular death rate considering renal
allograft function as a confounder in the Cox regression.
The results showed that the cardiovascular death rate was
increased (HR 1.92; 95% CI 1.24–2.97; P ¼ 0.003). Figure
3b shows the adjusted curves for patients with a S-creatinine
of <130 lmol/L at 3 months after transplantation.
Discussion
At ﬁrst glance, our Kaplan–Meier analysis of >60 000
kidney transplant recipients supports the view that pretrans-
plant PD is associated with better graft and patient survival
and thus apparently agrees with observations from the
USRDS database [13] and other studies [1, 3, 9–11]. How-
ever, after performing multivariate analysis in which multi-
ple patient characteristics and immunological confounders,

Pretransplant dialysis modality in renal transplantation

as well as time on dialysis, year of transplantation, geo-
graphical region, pretransplant evaluation of the recipient
as a candidate for transplantation and pretransplant evalua-
tion of cardiovascular risk were considered, it emerged that
only patient survival but not death-censored graft survival
was superior in PD patients. The superior all-cause graft
survival in PD patients was thus a consequence of a higher
death rate in patients transplanted after treatment with
HD. Aside from the necessity of analysing large patient
numbers in order to reduce the element of chance, several
additional aspects must be taken into consideration. First,
almost one-half of renal allograft recipients die with a
functioning graft and the evaluation of death-censored
graft survival is therefore essential. Considering patient
death with a functioning graft, the current opinion, that
renal replacement therapy per se has an impact on allog-
raft survival, could no longer be supported. This pro-
vides an explanation why our data, e.g. in contrast to
the published non-death-censored USRDS registry data,
did not demonstrate a superior graft survival rate in PD
patients [13].
Secondly, to analyse these effects appropriately, prog-
nostically important baseline characteristics as well as post-
transplant renal allograft function must be taken into
account. As demonstrated herein, baseline characteristics
differed between the PD and HD groups and we therefore
performed multivariate Cox regression analysis. We ac-
counted not only for various demographics and comorbid-
ities but also for pretransplant immunological parameters,
as well as differences of geographical speciﬁcs in indica-
tions and circumstances of renal replacement therapy, time
on dialysis, posttransplant allograft function and, most im-
portantly, the evaluation of pretransplant cardiovascular
risk. Furthermore, one has to consider not only the dialysis
treatment modality applied immediately prior to transplan-
tation but long-term treatment, including changes from one

dialysis modality to another. Because a change of modality
prior to transplantation might bias the results, we decided to
form a separate group for those patients whose dialysis
modality was changed. Our analysis shows that the better
overall patient survival observed in PD patients is primarily
a result of superior survival in the subcohort of PD patients
at ‘high risk’ (patients considered at increased pretransplant
risk who received allografts from ECDs). In other words,

particularly the high-risk recipients who were transplanted
from increased-risk donors beneﬁted from pretransplant PD
treatment. Recognizing that country-speciﬁc differences in
renal replacement therapy might bias the results, we sepa-
rately evaluated graft survival for the IRR–ECD patient
cohort in Europe and North America and observed a con-
gruent superior graft survival of PD patients. Whereas dif-
ferences in graft survival are usually most pronounced
within the ﬁrst year after transplantation, remarkably, our
results revealed the strongest effect after the ﬁrst year. This
suggests an indirect long-term effect rather than a direct
consequence of dialysis modality per se. The result of the
patient subpopulation at increased pretransplant risk who
received allografts from ECDs affects the overall patient
survival rate and thus portends a general superiority of
pretransplant PD treatment. After exclusion of the high-risk
population, posttransplant survival of PD and HD patients
was similar. This serves to illustrate why, in contrast to the
USRDS registry report and in line with our observation, a
recent analysis performed after exclusion of diabetic pa-
tients showed no survival advantage with respect to pre-
transplant dialysis modality [14].
What might be a plausible explanation for the superior
survival of high-risk transplant recipients after PD treat-
ment? Our investigation of cardiovascular death rates
provides a clue. Although similar fractions of HD and
PD patients in the IRR–ECD cohort were at increased
pretransplant cardiovascular risk (HD 37.4 versus PD
37.2%, P ¼ 0.95), and even though there was a signiﬁ-
cantly higher rate of patients with pretransplant diabetes
in the PD group (25.2 versus 19.7%, P < 0.001), the
highest rate of cardiovascular mortality was found in
IRR–ECD patients after HD treatment (Figure 3a). This
effect was veriﬁable even after adjusting for allograft
function after 3 months (Figure 3b). However, the under-
lying mechanism leading to this observation is not easily
understood.
We can only speculate that possibly residual renal func-
tion (RRF), which is believed to be better preserved in PD
than in HD patients [15], might be responsible for the re-
sults since it has be shown that RRF has been associated
with various effects inﬂuencing cardiovascular morbidity
[16]. It is conceivable that high-risk patients are particularly
vulnerable when loss of RRF occurs. However, this hy-
pothesis remains speculative because RRF was not incor-
porated as a variable in the CTS database.
Our study has the limitation that, although the analysis
carefully considered the inﬂuence of potential confounders
as listed under Materials and methods, this was a retrospec-
tive cohort analysis and selection bias cannot be deﬁni-
tively
excluded.
In
summary,
giving
appropriate
consideration to pretransplant patient overall and especially
cardiovascular risk evaluation, our data revealed that post-
transplant allograft survival is not inﬂuenced by the pre-
transplant dialysis modality per se. The observed overall
superior survival of PD patients was mainly a subpopula-
tion effect. Mainly ‘high-risk patients who received kid-
neys
from
extended
criteria
donors
beneﬁted
from
pretransplant PD treatment in terms of better patients sur-
vival. These results suggest that particularly high-risk pa-
tients listed on the renal transplant waiting list might beneﬁt
from pretransplant PD treatment. Further studies are re-
quired to validate this hypothesis.
