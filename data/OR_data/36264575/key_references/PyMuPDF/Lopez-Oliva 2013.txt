Abstract
Background
Kidney transplantation is the best option for
the treatment of end-stage renal disease in terms of survival
and quality of life. These results can be inﬂuenced by the
pretransplant dialysis modality. The aim of this study was
to evaluate whether the pretransplantation dialysis modal-
ity
inﬂuences
patient
and
allograft
survival
beyond
10 years and examine the potential risk factors associated
with the outcomes.
Methods
We conducted an observational, retrospective,
single-center clinical study that included 236 patients [118
undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 118 undergoing
hemodialysis (HD)] who proceeded to transplantation
during the period December 1990–2002. Donor and reci-
pient data were collected from our hospital’s clinical reg-
istries. The follow-up period extended to the patient’s
death, the loss of the allograft, or loss to follow-up. The
end date of the study was set at March 2012.
Results
In the multivariate analysis, the long-term patient
survival rate was higher for the PD group than for the HD
group [HR = 2.62 (1.01–6.8); p = 0.04]; however, the
allograft survival rate was not signiﬁcantly different
between
the
two
groups
[HR = 0.68
(0.41–1.10);
p = 0.12].
Conclusion
Pretransplantation dialysis modality is asso-
ciated with long-term patient survival, with outcomes
favoring peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis. However,
the pretransplant dialysis modality does not inﬂuence long-
term graft loss risk.

Introduction
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a life-threatening dis-
ease that requires the appropriate and sequential selection
and ordering of available therapies, dialysis, and trans-
plantation to accomplish the general objective of pro-
longing the patient’s life. Although kidney transplantation
is the best option in terms of positive outcomes (survival
and quality of life) [1], the overall results could be inﬂu-
enced by the interaction between previous treatments and
the transplantation. The various dialysis modalities, which
differ in practical terms, can differentially inﬂuence the
outcomes for transplanted patients [2–11].

The long-term effects of the interaction among the three
modalities have been explored in a number of studies, with
conﬂicting results. A number of authors have demonstrated
that the dialysis modality does not affect the outcome [3–6,
8, 9, 12]. Other authors have shown increased survival for
patients and grafts treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) [7,
10, 13, 14] or on the contrary increased graft survival by
hemodialysis (HD) [6]. A common element of these studies
was the use of a medium-term survival analysis, which did
not extend the analysis of the patient outcome to 10 years.
The importance of considering the long term when evalu-
ating the true success of kidney transplantation is unques-
tionable. A long-term perspective could provide additional
information to the already available data by conﬁrming or
disproving the interpretation of the synergies and antago-
nisms among the various ESRD treatments.
The objective of the present study was to evaluate
whether the pretransplantation dialysis modality inﬂuences
allograft and patient survival beyond 10 years and examine
the potential risk factors associated with the outcomes. The
study was conducted on a large series of patients from a
university hospital kidney transplantation program from
December 1990 to 2002.
Patients and methods
The study was conducted according to the strengthening
the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology
(STROBE) methodology [15].
Study design
This was an observational, retrospective, single-center,
record-based clinical study. We created two cohorts based
on the immediate pretransplantation dialysis modality. The
ﬁrst cohort consisted of patients treated with PD, and the
second cohort consisted of patients treated with HD.
Patients
We included all 118 patients who were treated with PD at
our center and who proceeded to kidney transplantation
during the period from December 1990 to 2002 (PD
group). This period was selected for reasons related to the
beginning of the cyclosporine (CyA) era. The control group
(HD group) included 118 patients treated with HD who
received a kidney allograft from the same donor (58 cases
matched by donor) or, in cases where no matching donor
was available, the HD recipient who closely preceded or
followed each PD case. For both groups, we only included
the ﬁrst allograft received during the study period.
The follow-up period (range 2 days–237 months; mean
duration: 102.1 ± 63.1 months) extended to the patient’s
death, the loss of the allograft requiring a permanent return
to dialysis, or loss to follow-up (12 in the HD group and
14
in
the
PD
group,
with
a
mean
follow-up
of
95.7 ± 57.2 months). The end date of the study was set to
March 2012.
Donor and recipient data were collected from our hos-
pital’s clinical registries. Donor selection and acceptance
was performed with similar criteria based on kidney
function, absence of clinical kidney abnormalities, and
macroscopic examination of grafts, all of which occurred
over the 12-year period. Pretransplant kidney biopsies were
not performed in this study group.
Immunosuppression regimen
The immunosuppression protocol was based on steroids,
cyclosporine (CyA) or tacrolimus (Tac), and azathioprine
(Aza). Aza has been substituted by mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) since 1995. Induction therapy with OKT3 was
added in high immunological risk patients (panel reactive
antibody [50 %).
Demographic and clinical variables
We included recipient variables (age, gender, body mass
index, pretransplantation time on dialysis, and cause of
kidney disease), donor variables (age, gender, donor type,
and cause of death in cadaver donors), and transplantation
variables (length of stay of the initial hospitalization, HLA-
DR mismatches, cold ischemia time, and immediate use of
calcineurin inhibitors vs. administration of OKT3).
Other variables related to the intermediate outcome
were also included: surgical complications over the ﬁrst
6 months, incidence of acute rejection, immediate graft
function (deﬁned as immediate diuresis with a decrease of
at least 30 % in serum creatinine levels 6 h after surgery),
and delayed graft function (DGF), deﬁned as the require-
ment for post-transplantation dialysis during the ﬁrst week.
Laboratory measurements included kidney function eval-
uated by serum creatinine and 24-h proteinuria levels and
lipid proﬁles.
Survival analysis
We performed an overall patient and graft survival analysis
that considered causes of death and graft loss. We also
performed a speciﬁc analysis of graft survival rates com-
paring patients in the PD and HD groups who shared the
same donor to examine the effects of truly paired kidneys
by origin.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and the
R,
cmprsk
statistical
package.
Qualitative
data
are
expressed in absolute and relative frequencies [percentage
(%)]. Quantitative data are described as mean ± standard
deviation
or
median
and
interquartile
range
(IQR,
pp 25–75).
We used a v2 test or Fisher’s exact test to study the
association between qualitative variables. To compare the
means of two independent samples, we used Student’s
t test.
To study patient and graft survival, we calculated the
cumulative incidence of mortality and graft loss in the
presence of competitive events. We considered graft loss to
be a competing event of death, given that graft loss was the
condition being tracked. Death was also considered a
competing event of graft loss. We considered censored
patients all those who dropped out of the study without
reaching the primary outcome.
A univariate analysis was performed to study the pos-
sible risk factors associated with mortality and graft loss.
Variables with clinical effects and a value of p \ 0.2 in the
univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model
to estimate the effect of treatment adjusted for other risk
factors. The univariate analysis was performed with the
proportional hazards regression models described by Fine
and Gray (1999) for quantitative variables and Gray’s test
to compare cumulative incidences between groups. The
multivariate model was adjusted by the same method.
We considered p values \0.05 to be statistically sig-
niﬁcant. All statistical tests were two-tailed.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of all
patients included in this study. Patients in the PD group
were younger, spent a shorter time on pretransplantation
dialysis, and had a lower frequency of prior failed allo-
grafts. However, other general risk factors such as diabetes
as the cause of kidney disease and signiﬁcantly higher BMI
(BMI data were available for 55 % of the patients) were
more frequent among PD patients. The other analyzed
variables showed no signiﬁcant differences between the
two groups.
Of the 236 patients, 226 patients received a cadaver
donor allograft, 2 received a non-heart beating donor
allograft, and 8 received a living donor allograft. These
proportions and other donor characteristics (age, gender,
and cause of death) were similar in both groups. There
were no differences in cold ischemia times and the number
of HLA-DR mismatches.
The initial immunosuppression regimen was similar in
both groups. Patients in the HD group received OKT3 more
frequently, although the differences were not signiﬁcant.
Immediate post-transplantation period
Patients in the PD group showed earlier kidney function
recovery with less need for dialysis during the ﬁrst week.
The acute rejection rates were similar for both groups, as
was the frequency of surgical complications during the ﬁrst
6 months (Table 2).

Medium- and long-term kidney function outcomes
The overall results for serum creatinine and 24-h protein-
uria levels showed no signiﬁcant differences between the
two groups throughout the follow-up; however, 24-h pro-
teinuria levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group at
12 months (PD: 0.8 ± 2.3 vs. HD: 0.3 ± 0.3; p = 0.03). A
higher kidney disease recurrence was conﬁrmed as the
cause of graft loss in the PD group.
Lipid proﬁle
The serum cholesterol levels were similar throughout the
study, but the serum triglyceride levels at 12 months were
signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group (PD: 175.3 ± 974 vs.
HD: 147.8 ± 62.9; p = 0.02).
Causes of death and patient survival
A total of 47 deaths (17 in the PD group and 30 in the HD
group, p = 0.07) were registered. Deaths resulting from
vascular (3 in the PD group vs. 10 in the HD group) and
neoplastic (2 in the PD group vs. 9 in the HD group)
conditions were more prevalent in the HD group, with
infections causing a similar number of deaths between
groups (8 in the PD group vs. 7 in the HD group) (Table 2).
The long-term patient survival rate was higher for the
PD group than for the HD group (Fig. 1), both overall
(Table 4) and when adjusted for signiﬁcant univariate
variables (Table 3) [PD vs. HD; HR = 2.62 (1.01–6.8);
p = 0.04]. Recipient age was another independent variable
inversely correlated with survival [HR = 1.09 (1.00–1.17);
p = 0.02]. Pretransplantation BMI was also signiﬁcantly
and
inversely
correlated
with
survival
[HR = 1.12
(1.12–1.23), p = 0.019]. The type of calcineurin inhibitor
was also a protective factor for patient survival, which
favored tacrolimus over CyA [HR = 2.64 (1.12–6.23);
p = 0.02].
Causes of graft loss and allograft survival
Seventy-ﬁve (75) cases experienced allograft loss over the
course of the follow-up, 43 in the PD group and 32 in the
HD group (p = 0.07). The causes of loss varied and
included vascular thrombosis (4 in the PD group and 1 in
the HD group, p = 0.17) and kidney disease recurrence (6
in the PD group and 0 in the HD group). The detailed
causes of loss are shown in Table 2. Patients in the PD
group had a higher frequency of graft loss during the ﬁrst
3 months due to various reasons that included vascular
thrombosis (4 cases), kidney disease recurrence (3 cases),
and acute rejection (3 cases). In the HD group, the causes
included vascular thrombosis (1 case), acute rejection

(2 cases), and other causes (3 cases). Death with func-
tioning graft was not included among the causes of graft
loss, although it was the principal cause of graft loss among
HD patients.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence of graft loss,
which was higher in the PD group due to the higher pre-
mature loss rate. However, the allograft survival rate was
not signiﬁcantly different between the two groups in the
univariate [HR = 0.7 (0.43–1.1); p = 0.1] and multivari-
ate analysis [HR = 0.68 (0.41–1.10); p = 0.12] of the

(0.96–0.99);

in the multivariate analysis model. The time spent on
dialysis was not statistical signiﬁcant (Table 4).
Discussion
The main result from our study is the higher 10-year patient
survival rate after transplantation for patients treated with
PD than for patients treated with HD. The practice of
performing PD before transplantation could add years of
life to the transplant and suggests that there could be a
connection between these two therapies. We believe that a
high degree of self-care, a fundamental property on which
PD is based, could have contributed to this result. Patients
treated with this technique before transplantation can extend
their self-care skills into the post-transplantation period.
Our results are in line with earlier studies, such as the
US Renal Data System study (n = 92,844) (Goldfarb-
Rumyantzev et al. [13]) that found greater patient survival
[HR = 0.94 (0.91–0.97)] for transplant recipients who
received PD immediately before transplantation; the study
by Molnar et al. [10] (n = 14,508) that demonstrated a
patient survival beneﬁt for patients with the pretransplant
PD modality, with a 43 % [HR = 0.57 (0.38–0.87)]
lower death risk; and the study by Schwenger et al. [14]

(1.02–1.18)]. A large US study (n = 22,776) by Snyder
et al. [6], however, reported that patients treated with PD
had mortality rates similar to those of patients treated with
HD [PD: HR = 0.95 (0.85–1.06)].
However, as in other studies, the different baseline
characteristics between our two groups could explain the
different results. As we can see in Table 1, patients on PD
spent less time on dialysis before transplantation, had fewer
second transplants, and were younger. Nevertheless, the
univariate and multivariate analyses conﬁrmed that reci-
pient age, pretransplant PD (vs. HD), pretransplant BMI
(independent of dialysis modality), and tacrolimus use (vs.
CyA) were independent risk factors in terms of long-term
patient survival. Time on dialysis before transplantation
and retransplantation did not inﬂuence patient survival.
The patients in our PD group had a higher mean pre-
transplant BMI than the patients in the HD group, and BMI
was an independent risk factor for long-term patient sur-
vival [HR = 1.12 (1.12–1.23)] but not for graft survival.
The mortality risk for patients treated with HD is inversely
related to body size; however, the results for patients
treated with PD are less consistent. Analyses of data from
the Australia and New Zealand registry (ANZDATA)
(n = 27,015) have consistently shown a higher mortality
risk for obese patients treated with PD [16], which is in line
with our results. Other studies such as the study by Lie-
vense et al. [17] (n = 8,016), however, have shown similar
survival for obese patients treated with PD and for those
treated with HD.
Another predictor of graft and patient survival evalu-
ated in our analysis was diabetic nephropathy, which did
not inﬂuence patient or graft survival [HR = 1.32 (0.49–
3.52); p = 0.57 and HR = 1.47 (0.71–3.03); p = 0.29,
respectively], which was in line with the study by Gold-
farb-Rumyantzev (HR = 1.11; p = 0.107 and HR = 0.96;
p = 0.48, respectively) [13].
Furthermore, the improved survival rate among PD
patients when compared with HD patients was independent
of higher allograft loss, which was caused primarily by
chronic allograft nephropathy.
We also found greater long-term survival among patients
who were treated with tacrolimus than among those treated
with CyA. Given that our study was not designed to assess
this difference, this issue needs to be directly addressed in
future studies in order to be conﬁrmed.
Our long-term graft survival results did not differ
between patients treated with pretransplant HD and PD,
which was in line with the adjusted results of Molnar et al.
[10] [PD HR = 0.95 (0.74–1.23)] and those of other
studies [4–6, 9]. These results, however, differed from
those of Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. [13], who reported
higher
graft
survival
for
PD
patients
[HR = 0.97
(0.94–1.00)], and those of Snyder et al. [6], who observed a
lower
death-censored
graft
survival
for
PD
patients
[HR = 1.15 (1.04–1.26)] restricted to the ﬁrst 3 months of
follow-up. In our study, patients in the PD group experi-
enced graft loss more frequently and earlier than patients in
the HD group (as seen in the study by Snyder et al. [6]),
although this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Chronic allograft nephropathy was the main cause of graft
loss in both groups. Graft loss due to primary graft
thrombosis and kidney disease recurrence was more fre-
quent in the PD group, and it is likely that both causes
contributed to the higher rate of early graft failure in the
PD group. Four patients in the PD group and 1 patient in
the HD group lost their graft due to vascular thrombosis;
however, these differences were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.17)
and were not conﬁrmed when examining paired donation
allografts (data not shown). Our results were in line with
those of a preliminary survey by Escuin et al. [18]
(n = 1,030, incidence of graft thrombosis PD vs. HD: 2.17
vs. 3.47 %, NS) and those of the study by Pe´rez-Fonta´n
et al. [19] (n = 827, incidence of graft thrombosis PD vs.
HD: 4.7 vs. 6.1 %, NS) who speciﬁcally examined this
question and did not conﬁrm an increased risk of primary
graft thrombosis in patients treated with PD. On the other
hand, Snyder et al. [6] and Murphy et al. [20] (n = 202)
have reported that graft thrombosis is more common in
patients treated with PD than in those treated with HD
[Snyder et al.: HR = 1.59 (1.08–2.36); Murphy et al.:
prevalence of graft thrombosis PD vs. HD: 9.27 vs. 0 %].
Their results, however, should be interpreted cautiously
because the study by Snyder et al. had a large proportion of
missing data on the cause of graft failure, and the study by
Murphy et al. was conducted on a small population with no
multivariate analysis, thereby limiting their conclusions.

Overall, older donors and younger recipients were
associated with shorter long-term graft survival. However,
at the time of our study, our donors and recipients were
younger than current donors and recipients. Seventy-two
percent of the donors and recipients were younger than
55 years of age, which suggests that this result is irrelevant.
However, older recipients showed better graft survival,
although the main reason for loss was chronic allograft
nephropathy at any age. These ﬁndings were independent
of those related to dialysis modality.
The overall incidence of acute rejection was also similar
between the two groups despite the higher number of graft
losses for acute rejection in the PD group. Patients treated
with PD have been reported to have better immune
responses to various agents [21], which can induce a higher
rejection severity.
Pe´rez-Fonta´n [3] was one of the ﬁrst authors to show
that patients treated with PD had a lower risk of DGF than
patients on HD. Other studies, including ours, have con-
ﬁrmed this ﬁnding [5, 9–11]. In our case, the immediately
improved function did not inﬂuence long-term graft sur-
vival. The reasons for late losses were independent of the
kidney function recovery rate and were related to speciﬁc
delayed complications.
Our study is limited primarily by its single-center nat-
ure, which could favor uniformity in various actions but
limits the extrapolation of results. However, this does not
lessen the validity of the results, although their interpre-
tation requires consideration of local conditions and cir-
cumstances. The retrospective nature of this study was
unavoidable because randomization of the dialysis modal-
ity is difﬁcult and data from randomized trials are currently
not available. However, the use of the STROBE method-
ology in this study can help overcome this difﬁculty.
The strengths of our study include the homogeneity of
the clinical practice; our hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,
and transplantation programs have been conducted by the
same nephrologists, and the daily practice and protocols
have remained essentially unchanged, although they have
been regularly updated. Another strength of the study was
the long-term observation, which lasted 22 years. A ﬁnal
strength of our study was the use of competing risk
methods to evaluate the differences in transplant outcomes
between both dialysis modalities; a competitive event
survival analysis precludes interferences [22].
In conclusion, our data show that the pretransplantation
dialysis modality is associated with long-term patient sur-
vival, with the results favoring peritoneal dialysis over
hemodialysis, independently of other conditions (younger
age, lower BMI, and immunosuppression based on tacrol-
imus). However, pretransplant dialysis modality did not
inﬂuence long-term allograft survival.
