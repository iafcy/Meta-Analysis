Access to, and outcome of, renal transplantation according to
treatment modality of end-stage renal disease in France.
Background. Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) is recognized
as one of the methods of treatment of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD), there have been recurrent concerns about the access
of patients treated by this modality to kidney transplantation
(KTx), as well as reports showing increased complications of
KTx in such patients, such as graft thrombosis and infections.
Methods. The aim of this study was to provide a compre-
hensive view of the impact on transplantation of pretransplant
modality of treatment of ESRD using a multivariate analysis
of the French database. From 1997 to 2000, after exclusion of
pediatric patients, multiple transplantations, and living donors,
6420 were patients registered on the waiting list, and 3464 were
transplanted.
Results. Using a Cox proportional hazard analysis, we found
a shorter waiting time for PD patients (RR 0.71, P < 0.0001),
which became equivalent to hemodialysis (HD) patients when
taking into account the transplant center as a variable (RR 1.0,
P =0.95).Concerninggraftsurvival,onlypreemptivetransplan-
tation had a signiﬁcant impact, being associated to a decreased
risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P = 0.005).
Conclusion. Our study supports the concept that the choice of
any pretransplant dialysis modality does not inﬂuence waiting
time for transplant or the results of transplantation.
Several renal replacement therapies are available for
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), namely
hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or preemp-
tive transplantation (Pre-T) [1], but the selection for any
given individual depends on many variables, including his
acceptance of therapy modalities and pretransplantation
strategy. HD is by far the most frequent modality used for
renal replacement therapy in many countries. The fre-
quency of patients with ESRD treated by PD reached

15% in many industrialized countries, but is only around
10% in France [2].
For a long time, many physicians have been reluctant
to propose PD to candidates for kidney transplantation.
There have been reports that transplanted patients pre-
viously on PD had more frequent graft thrombosis [3, 4]
or infections [5] compared to patients treated with HD.
Whenlookingattransplantationoutcomes,equivalent[6]
or inferior results [7] have been reported for PD patients.
However, recent studies have shown that PD is associ-
ated with a lower incidence of post-transplant delayed
graft function (DGF) compared to HD [8, 9].
Although these concerns might have a detrimental im-
pact on the waiting time of PD patients, recent studies
have shown, on the contrary, a faster access to transplan-
tation of PD patients [6, 10].
The relationship between the choice of ESRD treat-
ment (HD, DP, or Pre-T) modality, waiting time, and graft
survival depends on many variables.
The aim of this study was, thus, to evaluate at a na-
tional scale by multivariate analysis the role of ESRD
treatment on the likelihood to receive a transplant (wait-
ing time), and on patient and graft survivals after kidney
transplantation.
METHODS
Patient population
In France, it is mandatory to register donors, candi-
dates, as well as graft and recipient follow-up, in the na-
tional information system of the French Transplantation
Agency (Etablissement Fran¸cais des Greffes).
We reviewed the data of all the patients that were regis-
tered on the national French waiting list between January
1997 and December 2000, as well as all recipients of a kid-
ney graft during the same time frame. A total of 6420 reg-
istrations and 3464 grafts performed by 37 centers were
ﬁnally included in the analysis after exclusion of living
donors, pediatric recipients (<16 years), multiple organ
transplants, nonresident, and retransplant registrations.

Recipient and graft criteria considered for adjustment
were: recipient age at registration and at transplantation,
gender, blood group, diabetes mellitus, peak panel reac-
tive antibody (PRA) level, frequency of human lympho-
cytic antigen (HLA) alleles (with scarcity deﬁned as a
frequency <3% among all registered patients), time on
dialysis at registration, year of registration, ESRD treat-
ment modality at registration, waiting time before trans-
plantation, HLA mismatching (0–6), cold ischemia time,
gender and blood group matching, donor age, gender,
blood group, and cause of death.
Statistical analysis
The effect of ESRD treatment modality was evaluated
on two main outcomes: likelihood of transplantation was
assessed through the analysis of waiting time to trans-
plantation and transplant outcome through the analysis
of patient and graft survivals.
Differences among categorized patient’s characteris-
tics were tested by chi-square test for discrete variables,
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous vari-
ables.
To estimate waiting time to transplant, time on the na-
tional kidney transplant waiting list was calculated for
each patient. The event of interest is transplant, with pa-
tients dying on the list censored at date of death. Patients
removed from the list were censored at the date of re-
moval, and those still awaiting a transplant at the end of
the analysis period were censored at that time. To esti-
mate graft survival after transplant, deﬁned as a patient
alive with a functioning graft, end point was deﬁned as ei-
ther death or graft failure. Kaplan-Meier estimators were
used to determine waiting time and graft survival.
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to ana-
lyze the effect of ESRD treatment modality on waiting
time and on graft survival adjusted on all risk factors asso-
ciated with each outcome in the univariate analysis, with
a P value <0.2.
The ﬁnal multivariable model is adjusted on centers af-
ter investigation of a possible association between ESRD
treatment modalities and center waiting times. Statistical
signiﬁcance was accepted at P < 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware package, version 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA).

fered between 1997 and 2000 (P < 0.0001). Registration
of patients treated by PD increased in time, from 128
(8.5%) in 1997 to 177 (10.8%) in 2000, as well as Pre-T
registrations from 106 (7.2%) in 1997 to 189 (11.3%) in
2000, while HD decreased (84.3% in 1997 to 77.9% in
2000).
Signiﬁcant differences between patients according to
ESRD treatment modalities were observed for gender
(P = 0.004) and age at registration (P = 0.04). More pre-
cisely, PD and Pre-T patients were more often women,
and were registered at a younger age.
The overall waiting time curves differed signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.0001) between ESRD treatment modalities
(Fig. 1), with 13.5 months median waiting time for HD,
9.4 for PD, and 11.7 for Pre-T patients (P < 0.0001).
Using the proportional hazard regression model, we
found a number of variables to be signiﬁcant in univari-
ate analysis for their effect on waiting time before trans-
plantation (Table 2). An increased risk was observed for
female gender (RR = 1.1, P = 0.0003), O and B blood
groups [RR = 1.83, P < 0.0001, peak PRA level between
15% and 69% (RR = 1.42, P < 0.0001) and 70% and
more (RR = 2.06, P < 0.0001), and an increased number
of infrequent HLA alleles (RR = 1.2, P < 0.0001)]. On
the contrary, patients of less than 30 years at registration
(RR = 0.81, P = 0.0001), or 60 years and above (RR =
0.87, P = 0.01) had a reduced waiting time.

ESRD treatment modality at registration had a pro-
found impact on waiting time, with a risk ratio of 0.71
(P < 0.0001) for PD and 0.83 (P = 0,002) for Pre-T pa-
tients compared to HD patients. As allocation rules in
France do not take into account the modality of ESRD
treatment, this prompted us to investigate the potential
relationship between waiting time and percentage of PD
patients on the waiting list in individual transplant cen-
ters. Results are shown in Figure 2, and clearly show that
PD patients are more likely to be registered in centers
with the shortest waiting times. Indeed, centers with a
median waiting time of less than 10 months have the high-
est percentage of PD patients on list (16%) compared
to the longer waiting centers, averaging only around 5%
PD patients on list. After adjustment on all risk factors
described above and adjustment on centers, no effect of
ESRD treatment modality was observed any longer, with
a risk ratio of 1.0 (P = 0.95) for PD modality (Table 2).
Two-year graft survival after transplantation
The characteristics of donors and recipients at trans-
plantation are summarized in Table 3. Of the 3464
transplant patients, 400 (11.5%) were treated by PD at
registration, 2738 (79.1%) by HD, and 326 (9.4%) by
Pre-T. The same differences seen in registered patients
in terms of age and gender between ESRD treatment
modalities are again observed in transplanted patients
(Table 1). The unadjusted overall graft survival differs
signiﬁcantly (P = 0.003) according to ESRD treatment
modality (Fig. 3). Pre-T graft survival was signiﬁcantly
higher when compared to HD (P = 0.0009) and to PD
graft survival (P = 0.02). No difference was observed be-
tween HD and PD populations (P = 0.31).
Using the proportional hazard regression model, we
found different variables to be signiﬁcant in univariate
analysis for their effect on graft survival (Table 4), such
as donor age above 54 years (RR = 1.66, P < 0.0001), re-
cipient age above 60 years at transplantation (RR = 2.13,
P < 0.0001), months on dialysis before transplantation
(RR = 1.003, P = 0.003), and cold ischemic time (RR =
1.02, P = 0.004). Pre-T compared to HD was found to
be the only treatment modality signiﬁcantly linked with
better graft survival, and no signiﬁcant effect on graft sur-
vival was observed for any dialysis modality.
After adjustment for risk factors linked with graft sur-
vival in univariate analysis (P < 0.2), PD (RR = 0.90, P
= 0.52) had no effect on graft survival, but Pre-T (RR =
0.46, P = 0.005) was still found to be associated with a
decreased risk of graft failure.
Concerning patient survival, no difference was found
between the different groups of patients (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Peritoneal dialysis is still used in a minority of patients
needing renal replacement therapy. The rates range from
45% in the United Kingdom to 8% in Germany [2], as
compared to 13% in the United States [11]. However,
the percentage of patients waiting for a kidney transplant
treated by PD may be different, depending on the char-
acteristics of the patients such as age or comorbidities.
In France, no such difference exists, as the percentage of
ESRD patients treated by PD is 10%, and the percent-
age of patients on the transplant waiting list treated by
PD is exactly the same. Transplants from living donors
represent less than 5% of all kidney transplantations per-
formed in France. The proportion of patients registered
on the waiting list and expecting a living donor transplant
and treated by PD in France is 9%, which is comparable
to the percentage of patients registered on the waiting
list for a deceased donor. Moreover, the analysis of graft
survival was performed on the cohort of patients ﬁnally
transplanted among the cohort of patients included in
the analysis of time to transplant and, therefore, did not
include the effect of the donor type.
Small differences, however, exist in terms of age at reg-
istration and female gender between HD and PD patients
(see Table 1). PD patients are more likely to be female
and younger, as seen in the United States [8].
The likelihood of transplantation for PD patients has
recently been reported as 1.39 times greater than HD pa-
tients in a retrospective analysis of the UNOS database
[11], even after considering clinical differences between
HD and PD patients, such as sex, race, age, BMI, and co-
morbidities. Likewise, in our analysis, we found a reduced
median waiting time to transplantation for PD patients
(Fig. 1) that persisted after taking into account such vari-
ables as gender, age, or PRA level. However, this result
could not be easily explained, as kidney allocation rules
in France are blind to dialysis modality. As the median
waiting time differs signiﬁcantly between transplant cen-
ters in France [12], we hypothesized that a center effect

could be responsible for this apparent difference in wait-
ing time between PD and HD patients. We, thus, divided
the transplant groups into short, medium, or long waiting
time, and assessed the proportion of PD patients regis-
tered in those three types of centers (Fig. 2). There is
a striking difference, with a much higher proportion of
PD patients in the centers with the lowest median wait-
ing time. We then estimated waiting time integrating the
center as a variable, which became strictly identical be-
tween dialysis modalities. This potential bias could cast a
doubt on previous publications, demonstrating a shorter
waiting time of PD patients.
Our analysis points out to another potential bias,
namely pretransplant dialysis duration. Indeed, it has
been demonstrated that dialysis duration impacts neg-
atively on graft survival [13]. This period of time is, in
fact, the sum of the time spent on dialysis before regis-

tration and the actual waiting time for transplant. In our
series, PD patients were registered signiﬁcantly earlier
than other patients (11.4 vs. 19.5 months, P < 0.0001).
This leads to a shorter dialysis time for PD patients, even
with equivalent waiting times. This might explain the re-
sults of previously published studies with longer dialysis
duration for HD patients [6, 10, 14].
Graft survival in our analysis does not depend on dial-
ysis modality, but is strongly enhanced by preemptive
transplantation, in accordance with previously published
studies [15–17]. Although our database does not include
complications such as thrombosis or rejections, the sim-
ilar survival suggests that any potential complication

arising in the PD patients has no detrimental effect on
patient or graft survival at two years [6, 11].
CONCLUSION
Our study supports the concept that the choice of dial-
ysis modality does not inﬂuence either the patient waiting
time for transplantation or patient and graft survival.
