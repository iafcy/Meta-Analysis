ABSTRACT
Background: Among factors determining long-term kidney allograft outcome, pre-transplant renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) is the most easily modifiable. Previous studies analyzing RRT 
modality impact on patient and graft survival are conflicting. Studies on allograft function are 
scarce, lack sufficient size and follow-up.
Methods: We retrospectively studied patient and allograft survival together with allograft function 
and its decline in 2277 allograft recipients during 2000-2014. Pre-transplant RRT modality 
≥60days as grouped into ‘no RRT’ (n=136), ‘hemodialysis (HD)’ (n=1847), ‘peritoneal dialysis 
(PD)’ (n=159), and ‘HD+PD’ (n=135) was evaluated.
Results: Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated superior 5-/10-/15-yr patient (93.0/81.8/73.1% vs. 
86.2/71.6/49.8%), death-censored graft (90.8/85.4/71.5% vs. 84.4/75.2/63.2%), and 1-yr rejection-
free graft survival (73.8 vs. 63.8%) in PD vs. HD patients. Adjusted Cox regression revealed 
34.5% [1.5-56.5%] lower hazards of death, whereas death-censored graft loss was similar 
(HR=0.707 [0.469-1.064]) and rejection was less frequent (HR=0.700 [0.508-0.965]). Allografts 
showed higher 1-/3-/5-yr estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in ‘PD’ vs. ‘HD’ groups. 
Living donation benefit for allograft function was most pronounced in groups ‘no RRT’ and ‘PD’. 
Functional allograft decline (eGFR slope) was lowest for ‘PD’.
Conclusions: Allograft recipients on pre-transplant PD vs. HD demonstrated superior all-cause 
patient and rejection-free graft survival along with better allograft function (eGFR).

INTRODUCTION
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 1 in 10 people worldwide. In the US, more than half a 
million patients have currently progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD cases 
increase by 5-6% annually worldwide. Patients with CKD have up to 5-fold increased mortality1 
and ESRD survival rate is often worse than for many solid tumors, highlighting the importance 
and urgency of the problem.2 Compared to dialysis, kidney allograft transplantation offers 
substantial survival3,4 and quality of life5 benefits for ESRD patients, and it is cost-effective in the 
long run.6 However, organ shortage warrants optimal use of organ donations in order to improve 
patient outcomes and to make use of available resources most effectively. While short-term 
outcomes after kidney transplantation have improved significantly, long-term graft survival 
remains a major challenge.7
Long-term allograft outcome is determined by factors (both modifiable and non-
modifiable) relating to transplant procedure, recipient, and donor, respectively. Among those 
factors, dialysis modality prior to allograft transplant seems the most readily modifiable. Previous 
studies demonstrated conflicting results with regard to pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient 
and allograft outcomes.8-12 A recent meta-analysis found that compared to HD, pre-transplant PD 
was associated with better post-transplant patient survival, decreased risk for delayed graft 
function (DGF) and similar graft survival.13 However, most studies lacked sufficient sample size. 
While studies with large sample size do exist, due to the nature of large registry databases, 
analysis is focused on hard endpoints and functional allograft data is not available.8-12 Published 
evidence suggests that a higher level of residual renal function (RRF) is independently associated 
with a better survival in dialysis patients.14-16 While pre-transplant RRF does not impact on graft 
survival or function in preemptive renal transplants,17 it is unclear whether this holds true for 
patients on dialysis and whether the higher RRF in PD vs. HD patients exerts benefit beyond 
kidney transplantation. To the best of our knowledge, there are only 2 studies looking at allograft 
function with respect to pre-transplant dialysis modality18,19, both demonstrating similar graft 
function in recipients with pre-transplant HD vs. PD regimens. However, sample size was 
small18,19, functional graft data was available only up to 1 year18 and generalizability might be 
impaired because only donors after cardiac death were studied.18 We therefore analyzed patient 
and allograft outcome with respect to pre-transplant modality and included kidney allograft 
function and the trajectory of its decline in our analysis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design and patient population
In this study we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of kidney transplant recipients at 
Hannover Medical School during a period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2014. It was 
approved as a retrospective cohort study of routinely collected data by the local medical ethics 
board and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2000. Specific informed 
consent was waived due to the retrospective and non-invasive nature of the study. Only transplants 
in adults (≥18 years) were studied. Our cohort did not include any graft donation after cardiac 
death. Both living and deceased donors were included in the analysis and were analyzed 
separately. For recipients of multiple kidney transplants, the most recent one was considered the 
target transplantation. Recipients of multi-organ transplants other than kidney/pancreas were 
excluded as per Figure 1.
Outcome variables
Primary study outcomes were all-cause patient death and graft survival. As allograft failure and 
death act as competing events after kidney transplantation, we calculated death-censored graft 
survival (survival with a functioning graft) as suggested by the European best practice guidelines 
for renal transplantation.20 Both outcomes were modeled by using continuous survival time 
variables. As analyses for graft survival (non-censored for death) presented similar results, data 
are not shown in the manuscript.
Secondary outcomes included long-term graft function as measured by serum creatinine 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at time points 1, 3, and 5 years post 
transplantation, respectively. GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
formula. We also assessed long-term graft function decline measured by patient-individual eGFR 
slope derived from eGFR measurements. Patients with graft loss were omitted from graft function 
analyses. Finally, we analyzed incidence rates of DGF, defined as need for dialysis within 7 days 
post-transplant, and episodes of acute rejection (AR, defined as biopsy-proven acute T cell- or 
antibody-mediated rejection requiring treatment as per Banff classification21) within 1 year post-
transplant.
Independent variables
The primary variable of interest was RRT modality prior to transplantation. We applied the “60-

day rule” as per USRDS convention stating that a dialysis modality that lasts ≥60 days can be 
considered stable. Hence, patients were grouped into one of the following categories as per 
dialysis status prior to kidney transplant: Patients who had been on HD or PD for at least 60 days 
without a switch were classified as “HD” and “PD”, respectively. Patients who had been on both 
RRT modalities for at least 60 days and were switched at one or more time points were assigned to 
the group “HD+PD”. Patients who had been on the same dialysis modality for less than 60 
consecutive days or received pre-emptive transplants were classified as “no RRT ≥60 days”.
Other covariates included transplant, recipient, and donor variables. Transplant covariates 
included urgency status, number of mismatches for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, 
and HLA-DR, respectively, AB0 incompatibility, full house match, and cold ischemia time (CIT).
Recipient covariates included gender, blood group, height, weight, body mass index 
(BMI), body surface area (BSA), age at transplantation, primary kidney disease (categorized as 
glomerulonephritis, 
cystic 
kidney 
disease, 
diabetic 
nephropathy, 
interstitial 
nephritis/pyelonephritis/reflux nephropathy, vascular nephropathy, congenital and hereditary 
[excl. cystic], thrombotic microangiopathy [TMA], other, and unknown), dialysis vintage prior to 
transplantation, current and highest panel reactive antibodies (PRA), previous kidney 
transplantation, simultaneous pancreas transplantation, comorbidities as per Charlson comorbidity 
index (myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral artery vascular disease, stroke, hemiplegia, 
diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, connective tissue disease, ulcus 
disease, malignancy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, dementia) plus additional information 
on coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA] or 
coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], and atrial fibrillation).
Donor covariates included donor type (deceased vs. living), gender, blood group, height, 
weight, BMI, BSA, and age.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables in the subgroups were compared by using cross-tabulation, continuous 
variables are summarized by means ± standard deviation unless stated otherwise. D’Agostino & 
Pearson omnibus test was used to test for normality. T tests, ordinary one-way ANOVA and non-
parametric tests were used for comparison of means as applicable. Survival analyses comprised 
Kaplan-Meier graphs analyzed by log rank test and multivariable Cox regression models. 
Observations were censored for all-cause death, graft failure (dialysis initiation), or loss to follow-

up, whichever came first. To avoid collinearity between the primary variables of interest separate 
Cox models were used. For covariates with non-proportional hazards we added interaction of 
covariates with function of time to the model. Multivariable analysis was performed with a full 
model accounting for transplant, donor, and recipient variables as well as with a reduced model 
that takes into account only pre-RRT variables, since the decision which RRT modality is used is 
far before the transplantation. In the reduced model all transplant- or donor-related variables were 
therefore regarded as mediators rather than confounders of RRT modality. Since variable selection 
does not improve model stability,22 we conducted analyses without pre-selection (i.e. adjusting for 
all pre-RRT variables) to avoid over-adjustment bias.23 For adjusted comparison of Cox regression 
incidence plots, the confounders were set to zero or the most frequent value. Wald’s backward and 
forward elimination models yielded the same results. We also performed separate analyses of all 
tests mentioned above after exclusion of patients with simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplant 
(n=184). Results did not differ from the data presented here. Linear regression was used to 
estimate the per-patient slope of eGFR over time. Only those patients with 3 determinations of 
eGFR at time points 1, 3, and 5 years were used. Interaction was tested with General Linear Model 
analysis. All tests were two-tailed. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant 
differences. IBM SPSS Statistics v22.0 and GraphPad Prism v6.0 were used for data analysis.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
In total, 2277 kidney allograft patients with complete data were included in the analysis (Figure 
1). Demographics and baseline characteristics with respect to transplantation, recipient, and donor 
are summarized in Table 1. Transplantations occurred at an equal rate across the study period 
(759, 757, and 761 in years 2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014, respectively). Several baseline 
characteristics varied significantly between the four groups categorized according to pre-transplant 
RRT modality and were therefore appropriately considered as confounders in multivariable 
analysis.
Primary outcome: all-cause death and death-censored graft survival
We recorded 553 events of death and 528 events of graft loss. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 
primary outcome parameters are shown in Figure 2. Unadjusted 5-yr, 10-yr, and 15-yr survival 
rates were significantly better for allograft recipients on pre-transplant PD compared to those on 
pre-transplant HD for patient survival (93.0 vs. 86.2%, p=0.002; 81.8 vs. 71.6%, p=0.002; 73.1 vs. 
49.8%, p=0.001) as well as for death-censored graft survival (90.8 vs. 84.4%, p=0.024; 85.4 vs. 
75.2%, p=0.021; 71.5 vs. 63.2%, p=0.017). Patients with dialysis vintage ≥60 days for both HD 
and PD had similar 5-yr, 10-yr, and 15-yr overall survival rates compared with HD patients 
(p=0.319, 0.385, and 0.340, respectively), whereas death-censored graft survival showed a 
tendency towards increased rates compared with HD patients (p=0.053, 0.059, and 0.054, 
respectively). Compared with all other groups those patients with no RRT for ≥60 days prior to 
transplantation had the best overall survival after 5, 10, and 15 years (97.3, p<0.001; 93.5, 
p<0.001; 90.2%, p<0.001) as well as the best death-censored graft survival (97.5, p<0.001; 91.6, 
p<0.001; 65.5%, p=0.001).
Supplementary Table 1 shows univariable survival data for all-cause patient death and 
death-censored graft survival. After multivariable adjustment for several baseline covariates Cox 
regression analysis demonstrated superior overall survival (Figure 3) in transplant recipients with 
pre-transplant PD regimens compared to patients on pre-transplant HD (34.5% lower hazards of 
death [95% confidence interval, CI 1.5-56.5%], p=0.042), whereas hazards for death-censored 
graft loss (Figure 4) were similar (HR=0.71 [0.47-1.06], p=0.096). Compared to patients with pre-
transplant HD regimens, transplant recipients with no RRT for ≥60 days pre-transplant had 
significantly lower HR for death (HR=0.23 [0.10-0.51], p<0.001) and for death-censored graft

survival (HR=0.36 [0.19-0.69], p=0.002). Regarding recipient variables, the reduced and the full 
Cox models demonstrated similar results. In addition to pre-transplant dialysis modality, the full 
model showed that highly immunized (HI) and highly urgent (HU) urgency status, HLA-DR 
mismatches, higher cold ischemia time, higher recipient age, primary kidney disease, hemiplegia, 
ulcus disease, Charlson comorbidity index showed effects on all-cause patient death 
(Supplementary Figure 1). Similarly, HLA-DR mismatches, pre-emptive transplant, recipient 
BMI, previous kidney transplant, living donor type, and donor age showed effects on graft loss 
(Supplementary Figure 2). Cardiovascular diseases were predictive of patient death and graft 
loss in univariable (Supplementary Table 1) but not in multivariable analyses. Simultaneous 
pancreas transplant was neither a predictor in univariable nor in multivariable Cox proportional 
hazard models and results did not differ when patients were analyzed separately.
Secondary outcome: 1-yr, 3-yr, 5-yr graft function and eGFR slope
Allograft function after 1, 3, and 5 years post-transplant differed significantly between pre-
transplant RRT modality groups (Figure 5). Lowest serum creatinine and highest eGFR was seen 
in recipients with no pre-transplant RRT, followed by pre-transplant PD, HD, and HD+PD groups, 
respectively. Results were consistent across years 1, 3, and 5 post-transplant. Multiple 
comparisons demonstrated that serum creatinine was significantly lower in allograft recipients 
with pre-transplant PD regimens than in those with HD regimens at 1 year (142.0 [95% CI 130.8-
153.3] vs. 152.5 [149.4-155.6] µmol/L, p=0.007), 3 years (151.6 [134.3-168.9] vs. 158.8 [154.8-
162.9] µmol/L, p=0.048), and 5 years post-transplant (143.1 [130.0-156.2] vs. 159.4 [155.1-163.6] 
µmol/L, p=0.012), respectively. Compared to recipients with no pre-transplant RRT, who had the 
best allograft function, those with pre-transplant HD demonstrated significantly lower eGFR at 1 
year (47.7 [46.7-48.8] vs. 52.5 [49.7-55.3] mL/min/1.73m2, p<0.001), 3 years (46.0 [45.0-47.0] vs. 
52.5 [48.4-56.6] mL/min/1.73m2, p<0.001), and 5 years post-transplant (45.4 [44.2-46.5] vs. 50.0 
[46.4-53.5] mL/min/1.73m2, p=0.008), respectively, whereas eGFR in patients on pre-transplant 
PD was similarly good at 1 year (49.9 [46.9-52.9] mL/min/1.73m2, p=0.134), 3 years (47.2 [43.9-
50.5] mL/min/1.73m2, p=0.220), and 5 years post-transplant (48.9 [45.2-52.7] mL/min/1.73m2, 
p=0.397), respectively. We also analyzed allograft function with respect to subgroups for possible 
influential covariates: As expected, living donation allografts demonstrated significantly better 
function as compared to deceased donation allografts (5-yr serum creatinine 147.6 [140.8-154.2] 
vs. 160.3 [155.9-164.8] µmol/L, p=0.027; 5-yr eGFR 48.8 [46.7-50.9] vs. 44.9 [43.7-45.9]

mL/min/1.73m2, p<0.001). Interestingly, as demonstrated by significant interaction between donor 
type and pre-transplant RRT (p=0.001), this benefit was particularly more pronounced in patients 
with either no RRT (Δ=6.5 mL/min/1.73m2) or on PD (Δ=4.6 mL/min/1.73m2) compared to a 
relatively small benefit for HD (Δ=2.6 mL/min/1.73m2) and HD+PD (Δ=2.8 mL/min/1.73m2) 
patients, respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 6A). On the other hand, linear regression analyses 
demonstrated that there was a fairly robust inverse relationship between donor age and long-term 
eGFR, which was only present in patients who had received pre-transplant dialysis, whereas 5-yr 
eGFR was not related to donor age in patients with no RRT prior to allograft transplantation 
(Figure 6B).
Allograft function decline measured by eGFR slope during post-transplant years 1-5 was 
slowest in recipients on pre-transplant PD (-0.56 mL/min/1.73m2 per year), followed by HD (-0.86 
mL/min/1.73m2 per year), HD+PD (-0.97 mL/min/1.73m2 per year), and patients with no pre-
transplant RRT (-1.47 mL/min/1.73m2 per year). However, differences between pre-transplant 
RRT groups were not statistically significant (p=0.283). Repeated measures linear mixed-effects 
modeling accounting for living vs. deceased donation status yielded similar results (data not 
shown). In addition to that, secondary analysis of eGFR slopes comparing subgroups of living vs. 
deceased donation allografts within the respective pre-transplant RRT groups revealed significant 
benefits only for recipients on pre-transplant PD, who profited the most from living donation and 
even demonstrated eGFR gain, as compared to all other subgroups that lost allograft function to 
varying degrees and did not differ significantly (Figure 7).
Secondary outcome: delayed graft function and early acute rejection episodes
Our data raise the question about a possible mechanism by which PD would improve outcomes. If 
one postulates such a mechanism to be procedure-related and not related to patient characteristics, 
its effect should be manifested mainly during the early post-transplant period. We therefore were 
interested to evaluate effects of pre-transplant RRT on early post-transplant outcomes such as the 
incidence of DGF and AR episodes within 1 year of transplant.
We recorded 546 events of DGF. The rates were 2.9, 14.5, 26.6, and 21.5% for groups ‘no 
RRT’, ‘PD’, HD’, and ‘HD+PD’, respectively (p<0.001), demonstrating reduced DGF prevalence 
in ‘PD’ vs. ‘HD’ patients. 
We recorded 771 patients who experienced ≥1 episode of AR requiring treatment within 1 
year of transplantation. The rates were 25.7, 25.8, 35.1, and 34.8% for groups ‘no RRT’, ‘PD’,

HD’, and ‘HD+PD’, respectively (p=0.019). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of cumulative AR-
free graft survival are shown in Figure 8A and demonstrate similar survival for ‘no RRT’ and 
‘PD’ patients. Unadjusted 3-months, 6-months, and 1-yr AR-free graft survival rates were 
significantly better for ‘PD’ vs. ‘HD’ groups (82.8 vs. 72.8%, p=0.011; 75.7 vs. 66.6%, p=0.012; 
73.8 vs. 63.8%, p=0.012). Finally, multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated superior 
overall AR-free graft survival (Figure 8B) in ‘PD’ compared to ‘HD’ patients (HR=0.700 [95% 
CI 0.508-0.965], p=0.029).

DISCUSSION
In 2277 kidney allograft recipients who were followed for up to 18 years post-transplantation, pre-
transplant treatment with PD was associated with superior patient survival (36% lower all-cause 
mortality risk) compared to pre-transplant HD, which is consistent with results from large registry 
studies.8-12 Despite efforts to adjust for many covariates even registry analyses have yielded 
conflicting results for post-transplant allograft outcome, highlighting the challenges in comparing 
inherent differences in HD vs. PD patient populations: patients on PD are generally younger, 
healthier, have been on dialysis for a shorter time, and additionally receive transplants at a higher 
rate than those on HD.12,13
Along those lines, we found an AR-free allograft survival benefit associated with pre-
transplant PD vs. HD treatment, hinting at a RRT modality-related rather than patient 
characteristics-related effect. We confirm recent results from others9-11 but contradicting older 
findings of still others who reported pre-transplant PD to be associated with either favorable8 or 
deleterious12 effects on allograft survival. However, the authors analyzing USRDS registry data 
only evaluated all-cause, not death-censored graft survival, and superior all-cause graft survival in 
PD patients was thus a consequence of a higher death rate in HD patients.8 Moreover, some 
studies categorized pre-transplant RRT according to the modality used either for the longest 
period8, at the time of transplantation12 or at study entry10 and therefore did not further subgroup 
patients who had received both HD and PD in a sequential manner. When looking at pre-
transplant RRT modality as the primary variable of interest one needs to consider the importance 
of stable long-term treatment with a single RRT modality vs. bias due to changes from one 
dialysis modality to another. In order to minimize adverse effects on internal validity, we therefore 
applied the “60-day rule” as per USRDS convention stating that a dialysis modality that lasts ≥60 
days can be considered stable. We grouped patients accordingly and adverse outcomes for patients 
with HD+PD regimens demonstrate the necessity of doing so. Differences in results might also be 
explained by the fact that previous studies pertained to pre-millennial cohorts of 20-29 years 
ago8,12 before significant changes in immunosuppressive regimens. While our sample size is 
noticeably smaller than those of large registry studies, their follow-up times of maximum 58,9,11,12 
and 6 years10, respectively, are considerably shorter than our 18 years.
To the best of our knowledge, no single study so far reported on the trajectory of functional 
graft decline, as measured by eGFR slope. Herein, we report for the first time on a significant 
allograft function benefit of pre-transplant PD over HD recipients as indicated by lower serum

creatinine and higher eGFR at 1, 3, and 5 years post-transplant. This may in part be due to 
between-group differences regarding predictors of allograft survival as per multivariable Cox 
regress models. Although it is known that measurements of serum creatinine and eGFR may fail to 
detect a fair percentage of biopsy-proven episodes of acute rejection episodes24 and development 
of interstitial fibrosis and atrophy may not be accurately represented in changes in serum 
creatinine,25 compared to invasive GFR measurement and protocol biopsies, serum creatinine and 
eGFR still represent by far the most feasible and cost-effective method of assessing graft function. 
Furthermore, changes in graft function over time as estimated by eGFR slope have been shown to 
be highly correlated with measured iothalamate GFR slopes in allograft recipients, thus providing 
valuable information for the trajectory of functional decline.26 In addition, it has been shown that 
eGFR slope is a strong predictor of long-term kidney allograft outcome and may facilitate its 
prediction.27,28 While the overwhelming number of studies analyzing pre-transplant RRT modality 
did not incorporate data on actual allograft function, there are only 2 reports taking into account 
creatinine or eGFR, both failing to demonstrate graft function differences in recipients with pre-
transplant HD vs. PD regimens. However, sample size was small in both studies18,19. Moreover, 
functional graft data was available only up to 1 year18 and solely donors after cardiac death were 
studied, impairing generalizability to a large extent.18 
Finally, we analyzed long-term allograft function with respect to donor age as well as 
living vs. deceased donation status within pre-transplant RRT modality groups. Higher donor age 
was associated with decreased 5-yr eGFR only in patients on dialysis prior to transplantation but 
not in patients who had been transplanted pre-emptively or received <60 days of dialysis (‘no 
RRT’). This might be partly due to a donor selection effect as the proportion of living donation 
was higher among this group. Moreover, we found the living donation benefit for 5-yr eGFR to be 
most pronounced in groups ‘no RRT’ and ‘PD’. Again, this underpins the importance of residual 
renal function (RRF) at the time of transplant for allograft outcome, as compared to HD patients, 
both recipients of pre-emptive allografts and PD patients are known to have better preserved 
RRF.14,29 Higher RRF in PD patients may be associated with various effects influencing 
cardiovascular morbidity, thereby in part explaining the survival benefit of PD over HD patients.11 
We could not test this formally, though, as RRF at the time of transplant was not available and 
thus was not incorporated as a variable in our study. Finally, eGFR slopes did not differ 
significantly between pre-transplant RRT modality groups. Interestingly, however, functional 
allograft decline was lowest in PD patients. Those PD patients receiving living donation grafts

even demonstrated eGFR gain during post-transplant years 1-5. However, due to the small sample 
size significant interaction between donor type and pre-transplant RRT could not be demonstrated 
for eGFR slope. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution. While it has been 
reported that more than half of patients can have stable or even positive GFR slopes, our results 
warrant careful interpretation, as there is considerable debate on the applicability of different 
eGFR formulas and their validity in transplant recipient cohorts.26 The same authors have also 
reported that eGFR slope, particularly when calculated by MDRD-estimated GFR within the first 
post-transplant year, significantly underestimated the number of patients with declining graft 
function, which is why we used time points from 1 to 5 years post-transplant.
There are several limitations to our study. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, we 
could not compare outcomes of ESRD patients with equal eligibility for HD vs. PD. As patients 
eligible for PD are usually healthier, more autonomous, frequently professionally active and often 
have higher educational and socio-economic status, despite any effort in multivariable adjustment, 
PD status at the time of transplantation should therefore be interpreted as a marker of an unknown 
cluster of positive characteristics, rather than reflecting a causal relation. Estimates comparing HD 
vs. PD are therefore likely to be biased by the pre-transplant selection process responsible for 
baseline differences at the time of transplantation. Prospectively designed studies are needed in 
order to exclude this issue. Also, waiting times for a deceased donor kidney in Germany are 
comparatively long. PD technical failure occurs in up to 50% of patients during the 3 first years 
after dialysis initiation. The PD cohort might therefore be composed by patients who either 
received a living donation graft early on, had preferential early allocation by chance due to a 
deceased donor with superior matching or had technique survival until standard allocation. As 
median waiting times in Germany are >4 years, there might have been a selection of a population 
receiving either good quality kidneys early or having long-term PD technique survival. The last 
category of patients probably has characteristics that are difficult to adjust for in a classical 
multivariate model. Due to the single-center nature, our results may not extrapolate to other 
centers, especially as donation after cardiac death is not performed in Germany. Also, most studies 
analyzing pre-transplant dialysis modality excluded recipients of simultaneous organ transplants. 
While we excluded all simultaneous organ transplantations other than pancreas/kidney, we took 
special care in performing separate analyses for cohorts with and without simultaneous 
kidney/pancreas transplants. Simultaneous pancreas transplant was neither a predictor in Cox 
models nor did the results any of the other tests differ from the data presented herein. However,

residual confounding cannot be definitely excluded. Also, the analysis of allograft function decline 
is conditional on a functioning graft and interpretation of results should take this fact into account. 
Compared to registry databases, our sample size might be relatively small. Still, we present long-
term data of up to 18 years of follow-up with consistent properties of allograft transplant 
procedure. Moreover, outcome data of incident allograft recipients were prospectively collected. 
Data completeness and regularity are thus easier to control in a single-center study than with 
registry data.
The strengths of our study include its long follow-up of up to 18 years, the homogeneity of 
clinical practice with regard to both RRT and transplant procedures, as well as the competing risk 
methodology for graft survival precluding interferences of competing events. Additionally, to our 
knowledge, this is the first analysis of long-term kidney allograft function >1-yr post-transplant 
and of DGF and AR episodes in a comparatively large-size sample analyzing pre-transplant RRT 
as primary variable of interest.
In conclusion, our data are in line with recent registry studies confirming superior patient 
and AR-free graft survival for recipients on pre-transplant PD vs. HD. Moreover, this is the first 
study to demonstrate in a considerable sample-size population a significant allograft function 
benefit of pre-transplant PD over HD recipients at 1, 3, and 5 years post-transplant. Our findings 
demonstrate that additional investigations with respect to residual renal function (RRF) at the time 
of transplantation and its effect on long-term kidney allograft function are warranted, as 
preservation of RRF might prove a worthwhile goal not only pertaining to outcome on dialysis but 
also extending beyond transplantation to kidney allograft outcome.
