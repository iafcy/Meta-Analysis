Abstract 
Background Kidney transplantation is the best option for 
the treatment of end-stage renal disease in terms of survival 
and quality of life. These results can be inﬂuenced by the 
pretransplant dialysis modality. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate whether the pretransplantation dialysis modal- 
ity inﬂuences patient and allograft 
survival beyond 
10 years and examine the potential risk factors associated 
with the outcomes. 
Methods We conducted an observational, retrospective, 
single-center clinical study that included 236 patients [118 
undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 118 undergoing

during the period December 1990–2002. Donor and reci- 
pient data were collected from our hospital’s clinical reg- 
istries. The follow-up period extended to the patient’s 
death, the loss of the allograft, or loss to follow-up. The 
end date of the study was set at March 2012. 
Results 
In the multivariate analysis, the long-term patient 
survival rate was higher for the PD group than for the HD 
group [HR = 2.62 (1.01–6.8); p = 0.04]; however, 
the 
rate was not signiﬁcantly different

between 
(0.41–1.10); 
p = 0.12]. 
Conclusion Pretransplantation dialysis modality is asso- 
ciated with long-term patient survival, with outcomes 
favoring peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis. However, 
the pretransplant dialysis modality does not inﬂuence long- 
term graft loss risk. 




Keywords Peritoneal dialysis (cid:2) Hemodialysis (cid:2) 
Kidney transplantation (cid:2) Outcomes 

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a life-threatening dis- 
ease that requires the appropriate and sequential selection 
and ordering of available therapies, dialysis, and trans- 
plantation to accomplish the general objective of pro- 
longing the patient’s life. Although kidney transplantation 
is the best option in terms of positive outcomes (survival 
and quality of life) [1], the overall results could be inﬂu- 
enced by the interaction between previous treatments and 
the transplantation. The various dialysis modalities, which 
differ in practical terms, can differentially inﬂuence the 
outcomes for transplanted patients [2–11]. 




The long-term effects of the interaction among the three 
modalities have been explored in a number of studies, with 
conﬂicting results. A number of authors have demonstrated 
that the dialysis modality does not affect the outcome [3–6, 
8, 9, 12]. Other authors have shown increased survival for 
patients and grafts treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) [7, 
10, 13, 14] or on the contrary increased graft survival by 
hemodialysis (HD) [6]. A common element of these studies 
was the use of a medium-term survival analysis, which did 
not extend the analysis of the patient outcome to 10 years. 
The importance of considering the long term when evalu- 
ating the true success of kidney transplantation is unques- 
tionable. A long-term perspective could provide additional 
information to the already available data by conﬁrming or 
disproving the interpretation of the synergies and antago- 
nisms among the various ESRD treatments. 
The objective of the present study was to evaluate 
whether the pretransplantation dialysis modality inﬂuences 
allograft and patient survival beyond 10 years and examine 
the potential risk factors associated with the outcomes. The 
study was conducted on a large series of patients from a 
university hospital kidney transplantation program from 
December 1990 to 2002. 

The study was conducted according to the strengthening 
the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology 
(STROBE) methodology [15]. 

This was an observational, retrospective, single-center, 
record-based clinical study. We created two cohorts based 
on the immediate pretransplantation dialysis modality. The 
ﬁrst cohort consisted of patients treated with PD, and the 
second cohort consisted of patients treated with HD. 

We included all 118 patients who were treated with PD at 
our center and who proceeded to kidney transplantation 
during the period from December 1990 to 2002 (PD 
group). This period was selected for reasons related to the 
beginning of the cyclosporine (CyA) era. The control group 
(HD group) included 118 patients treated with HD who 
received a kidney allograft from the same donor (58 cases 
matched by donor) or, in cases where no matching donor 
was available, the HD recipient who closely preceded or 
followed each PD case. For both groups, we only included 
the ﬁrst allograft received during the study period. 

The follow-up period (range 2 days–237 months; mean 
duration: 102.1 ± 63.1 months) extended to the patient’s 
death, the loss of the allograft requiring a permanent return 
to dialysis, or loss to follow-up (12 in the HD group and 
14 in the PD group, with a mean follow-up of 
95.7 ± 57.2 months). The end date of the study was set to 
March 2012. 
Donor and recipient data were collected from our hos- 
pital’s clinical registries. Donor selection and acceptance 
was performed with similar criteria based on kidney 
function, absence of clinical kidney abnormalities, and 
macroscopic examination of grafts, all of which occurred 
over the 12-year period. Pretransplant kidney biopsies were 
not performed in this study group. 

The immunosuppression protocol was based on steroids, 
cyclosporine (CyA) or tacrolimus (Tac), and azathioprine 
(Aza). Aza has been substituted by mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF) since 1995. Induction therapy with OKT3 was 
added in high immunological risk patients (panel reactive 
antibody [50 %). 

We included recipient variables (age, gender, body mass 
index, pretransplantation time on dialysis, and cause of 
kidney disease), donor variables (age, gender, donor type, 
and cause of death in cadaver donors), and transplantation 
variables (length of stay of the initial hospitalization, HLA- 
DR mismatches, cold ischemia time, and immediate use of 
calcineurin inhibitors vs. administration of OKT3). 
Other variables related to the intermediate outcome 
were also included: surgical complications over the ﬁrst 
6 months, incidence of acute rejection, immediate graft 
function (deﬁned as immediate diuresis with a decrease of 
at least 30 % in serum creatinine levels 6 h after surgery), 
and delayed graft function (DGF), deﬁned as the require- 
ment for post-transplantation dialysis during the ﬁrst week. 
Laboratory measurements included kidney function eval- 
uated by serum creatinine and 24-h proteinuria levels and 
lipid proﬁles. 

We performed an overall patient and graft survival analysis 
that considered causes of death and graft loss. We also 
performed a speciﬁc analysis of graft survival rates com- 
paring patients in the PD and HD groups who shared the 
same donor to examine the effects of truly paired kidneys 
by origin. 


The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and the 
R, cmprsk statistical package. Qualitative data are 
expressed in absolute and relative frequencies [percentage 
(%)]. Quantitative data are described as mean ± standard 
deviation or median and interquartile 
(IQR, 
pp 25–75). 

We used a v2 test or Fisher’s exact test to study the 
association between qualitative variables. To compare the 
means of two independent samples, we used Student’s 
t test. 
To study patient and graft survival, we calculated the 
cumulative incidence of mortality and graft loss in the 
presence of competitive events. We considered graft loss to 
be a competing event of death, given that graft loss was the 
condition being tracked. Death was also considered a 
competing event of graft loss. We considered censored 
patients all those who dropped out of the study without 
reaching the primary outcome. 
A univariate analysis was performed to study the pos- 
sible risk factors associated with mortality and graft loss. 
Variables with clinical effects and a value of p \ 0.2 in the 
univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model 
to estimate the effect of treatment adjusted for other risk 
factors. The univariate analysis was performed with the 
proportional hazards regression models described by Fine 
and Gray (1999) for quantitative variables and Gray’s test 
to compare cumulative incidences between groups. The 
multivariate model was adjusted by the same method. 




The initial immunosuppression regimen was similar in 
both groups. Patients in the HD group received OKT3 more 
frequently, although the differences were not signiﬁcant. 

Patients in the PD group showed earlier kidney function 
recovery with less need for dialysis during the ﬁrst week. 
The acute rejection rates were similar for both groups, as 
was the frequency of surgical complications during the ﬁrst 
6 months (Table 2).

Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of all 
patients included in this study. Patients in the PD group 
were younger, spent a shorter time on pretransplantation 
dialysis, and had a lower frequency of prior failed allo- 
grafts. However, other general risk factors such as diabetes 
as the cause of kidney disease and signiﬁcantly higher BMI 
(BMI data were available for 55 % of the patients) were 
more frequent among PD patients. The other analyzed 
variables showed no signiﬁcant differences between the 
two groups. 
Of the 236 patients, 226 patients received a cadaver 
donor allograft, 2 received a non-heart beating donor 
allograft, and 8 received a living donor allograft. These 
proportions and other donor characteristics (age, gender, 
and cause of death) were similar in both groups. There 
were no differences in cold ischemia times and the number 
of HLA-DR mismatches.

conditions were more prevalent in the HD group, with 
infections causing a similar number of deaths between 
groups (8 in the PD group vs. 7 in the HD group) (Table 2). 
The long-term patient survival rate was higher for the 
PD group than for the HD group (Fig. 1), both overall 
(Table 4) and when adjusted for signiﬁcant univariate 
variables (Table 3) [PD vs. HD; HR = 2.62 (1.01–6.8); 
p = 0.04]. Recipient age was another independent variable 
inversely correlated with survival [HR = 1.09 (1.00–1.17); 
p = 0.02]. Pretransplantation BMI was also signiﬁcantly 
and inversely correlated with survival 
[HR = 1.12 
(1.12–1.23), p = 0.019]. The type of calcineurin inhibitor 
was also a protective factor for patient survival, which 
favored tacrolimus over CyA [HR = 2.64 (1.12–6.23); 
p = 0.02]. 

Seventy-ﬁve (75) cases experienced allograft loss over the 
course of the follow-up, 43 in the PD group and 32 in the 
HD group (p = 0.07). The causes of loss varied and 
included vascular thrombosis (4 in the PD group and 1 in 
the HD group, p = 0.17) and kidney disease recurrence (6 
in the PD group and 0 in the HD group). The detailed 
causes of loss are shown in Table 2. Patients in the PD 
group had a higher frequency of graft loss during the ﬁrst 
3 months due to various reasons that included vascular 
thrombosis (4 cases), kidney disease recurrence (3 cases), 
and acute rejection (3 cases). In the HD group, the causes 
included vascular thrombosis (1 case), acute rejection

The overall results for serum creatinine and 24-h protein- 
uria levels showed no signiﬁcant differences between the 
two groups throughout the follow-up; however, 24-h pro- 
teinuria levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group at 
12 months (PD: 0.8 ± 2.3 vs. HD: 0.3 ± 0.3; p = 0.03). A 
higher kidney disease recurrence was conﬁrmed as the 
cause of graft loss in the PD group. 

The serum cholesterol levels were similar throughout the 
study, but the serum triglyceride levels at 12 months were 
signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group (PD: 175.3 ± 974 vs. 
HD: 147.8 ± 62.9; p = 0.02). 

A total of 47 deaths (17 in the PD group and 30 in the HD 
group, p = 0.07) were registered. Deaths resulting from

tioning graft was not included among the causes of graft 
loss, although it was the principal cause of graft loss among 
HD patients. 
Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence of graft loss, 
which was higher in the PD group due to the higher pre- 
mature loss rate. However, the allograft survival rate was 
not signiﬁcantly different between the two groups in the 
univariate [HR = 0.7 (0.43–1.1); p = 0.1] and multivari-

p = 0.01] were associated with a higher allograft loss rate 
in the multivariate analysis model. The time spent on 
dialysis was not statistical signiﬁcant (Table 4). 

The main result from our study is the higher 10-year patient 
survival rate after transplantation for patients treated with 
PD than for patients treated with HD. The practice of 
performing PD before transplantation could add years of 
life to the transplant and suggests that there could be a 
connection between these two therapies. We believe that a 
high degree of self-care, a fundamental property on which 
PD is based, could have contributed to this result. Patients 
treated with this technique before transplantation can extend 
their self-care skills into the post-transplantation period. 
Our results are in line with earlier studies, such as the 
US Renal Data System study (n = 92,844) (Goldfarb-

(1.02–1.18)]. A large US study (n = 22,776) by Snyder 
et al. [6], however, reported that patients treated with PD 
had mortality rates similar to those of patients treated with 
HD [PD: HR = 0.95 (0.85–1.06)]. 
However, as in other studies, 
the different baseline 
characteristics between our two groups could explain the 
different results. As we can see in Table 1, patients on PD 
spent less time on dialysis before transplantation, had fewer 
second transplants, and were younger. Nevertheless, the 
univariate and multivariate analyses conﬁrmed that reci- 
pient age, pretransplant PD (vs. HD), pretransplant BMI 
(independent of dialysis modality), and tacrolimus use (vs. 
CyA) were independent risk factors in terms of long-term 
patient survival. Time on dialysis before transplantation 
and retransplantation did not inﬂuence patient survival. 
The patients in our PD group had a higher mean pre- 
transplant BMI than the patients in the HD group, and BMI 
was an independent risk factor for long-term patient sur- 
vival [HR = 1.12 (1.12–1.23)] but not for graft survival. 
The mortality risk for patients treated with HD is inversely 
related to body size; however, 
the results for patients 
treated with PD are less consistent. Analyses of data from 
the Australia and New Zealand registry (ANZDATA) 
(n = 27,015) have consistently shown a higher mortality 
risk for obese patients treated with PD [16], which is in line 
with our results. Other studies such as the study by Lie- 
vense et al. [17] (n = 8,016), however, have shown similar 
survival for obese patients treated with PD and for those 
treated with HD. 
Another predictor of graft and patient survival evalu- 
ated in our analysis was diabetic nephropathy, which did 
not inﬂuence patient or graft survival [HR = 1.32 (0.49– 
3.52); p = 0.57 and HR = 1.47 (0.71–3.03); p = 0.29, 

respectively], which was in line with the study by Gold- 
farb-Rumyantzev (HR = 1.11; p = 0.107 and HR = 0.96; 
p = 0.48, respectively) [13]. 

the improved survival rate among PD 
patients when compared with HD patients was independent 
of higher allograft loss, which was caused primarily by 
chronic allograft nephropathy. 
We also found greater long-term survival among patients 
who were treated with tacrolimus than among those treated 
with CyA. Given that our study was not designed to assess 
this difference, this issue needs to be directly addressed in 
future studies in order to be conﬁrmed. 





results did not differ 
between patients treated with pretransplant HD and PD, 
which was in line with the adjusted results of Molnar et al. 
[10] [PD HR = 0.95 (0.74–1.23)] and those of other 
studies [4–6, 9]. These results, however, differed from 
those of Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. [13], who reported 
higher graft 
[HR = 0.97 
(0.94–1.00)], and those of Snyder et al. [6], who observed a 
lower death-censored graft 
for PD patients 
[HR = 1.15 (1.04–1.26)] restricted to the ﬁrst 3 months of 
follow-up. In our study, patients in the PD group experi- 
enced graft loss more frequently and earlier than patients in 
the HD group (as seen in the study by Snyder et al. [6]), 
although this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. 
Chronic allograft nephropathy was the main cause of graft 
loss in both groups. Graft 
loss due to primary graft 
thrombosis and kidney disease recurrence was more fre- 
quent in the PD group, and it is likely that both causes 
contributed to the higher rate of early graft failure in the 
PD group. Four patients in the PD group and 1 patient in 
the HD group lost their graft due to vascular thrombosis; 
however, these differences were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.17) 
and were not conﬁrmed when examining paired donation 
allografts (data not shown). Our results were in line with 
those of a preliminary survey by Escuin et al. 
[18] 
(n = 1,030, incidence of graft thrombosis PD vs. HD: 2.17 
vs. 3.47 %, NS) and those of the study by Pe´rez-Fonta´n 
et al. [19] (n = 827, incidence of graft thrombosis PD vs. 
HD: 4.7 vs. 6.1 %, NS) who speciﬁcally examined this 
question and did not conﬁrm an increased risk of primary 
graft thrombosis in patients treated with PD. On the other 
hand, Snyder et al. [6] and Murphy et al. [20] (n = 202) 
have reported that graft thrombosis is more common in 
patients treated with PD than in those treated with HD 
[Snyder et al.: HR = 1.59 (1.08–2.36); Murphy et al.: 
prevalence of graft thrombosis PD vs. HD: 9.27 vs. 0 %]. 
Their results, however, should be interpreted cautiously 
because the study by Snyder et al. had a large proportion of 
missing data on the cause of graft failure, and the study by 
Murphy et al. was conducted on a small population with no 
multivariate analysis, thereby limiting their conclusions. 



recipients were 
associated with shorter long-term graft survival. However, 
at the time of our study, our donors and recipients were 
younger than current donors and recipients. Seventy-two 
percent of the donors and recipients were younger than 
55 years of age, which suggests that this result is irrelevant. 
However, older recipients showed better graft survival, 
although the main reason for loss was chronic allograft 
nephropathy at any age. These ﬁndings were independent 
of those related to dialysis modality. 
The overall incidence of acute rejection was also similar 
between the two groups despite the higher number of graft 
losses for acute rejection in the PD group. Patients treated 
immune 
with PD have been reported to have better 
responses to various agents [21], which can induce a higher 
rejection severity. 
Pe´rez-Fonta´n [3] was one of the ﬁrst authors to show 
that patients treated with PD had a lower risk of DGF than 
patients on HD. Other studies, including ours, have con- 
ﬁrmed this ﬁnding [5, 9–11]. In our case, the immediately 
improved function did not inﬂuence long-term graft sur- 
vival. The reasons for late losses were independent of the 
kidney function recovery rate and were related to speciﬁc 
delayed complications. 
Our study is limited primarily by its single-center nat- 
ure, which could favor uniformity in various actions but 
limits the extrapolation of results. However, this does not 
lessen the validity of the results, although their interpre- 
tation requires consideration of local conditions and cir- 
cumstances. The retrospective nature of this study was 
unavoidable because randomization of the dialysis modal- 
ity is difﬁcult and data from randomized trials are currently 
not available. However, the use of the STROBE method- 
ology in this study can help overcome this difﬁculty. 
The strengths of our study include the homogeneity of 
the clinical practice; our hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
and transplantation programs have been conducted by the 
same nephrologists, and the daily practice and protocols 
have remained essentially unchanged, although they have 
been regularly updated. Another strength of the study was 
the long-term observation, which lasted 22 years. A ﬁnal 
strength of our study was the use of competing risk 
methods to evaluate the differences in transplant outcomes 
between both dialysis modalities; a competitive event 
survival analysis precludes interferences [22]. 
In conclusion, our data show that the pretransplantation 
dialysis modality is associated with long-term patient sur- 
vival, with the results favoring peritoneal dialysis over 
hemodialysis, independently of other conditions (younger 
age, lower BMI, and immunosuppression based on tacrol- 
imus). However, pretransplant dialysis modality did not 
inﬂuence long-term allograft survival.
