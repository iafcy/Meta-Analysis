Introduction: Individuals aged $65 years are increasingly prevalent on the waitlist for kidney trans- 
plantation, yet evidence on recipient and donor factors that deﬁne optimal outcomes in elderly patients 
after kidney transplantation is scarce. 
Methods: We used multivariable Cox regression modeling to determine the factors associated with all- 
cause death, death with a functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft survival, using data 
from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry. 
Results: A total of 802 kidney transplant recipients aged $65 years underwent their ﬁrst transplantation 
between June 2006 and December 2016. Median age at transplantation was 68 years (interquartile range ¼ 
66(cid:2)69 years). The 1-year and 5-year overall patient and graft survivals (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]) were 
95.1 (93.5(cid:2)96.7) and 79.0 (75.1(cid:2)82.9), and 92.9 (91.1(cid:2)94.7) and 75.4 (71.3(cid:2)79.5), respectively. Factors 
associated with higher risks of all-cause death included prevalent coronary artery disease (adjusted hazard 
ratio [95% conﬁdence interval] ¼ 1.47 [1.03–2.11]), cerebrovascular disease (1.99 [1.26–3.16]), increasing 
graft ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03–1.09]), donor age (1.02 per year [1.01–1.03]), delayed graft function 
(1.64 [1.13(cid:2)2.39]), and peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation (1.71 [1.17–2.51]). 
Conclusion: Prevalent vascular disease and peritoneal dialysis as a pretransplantation dialysis modality 
are risk factors associated with poorer outcomes in transplant recipients aged $65 years. Careful selection 
and evaluation of potential candidates may improve graft and patient outcomes in older patients.

aged 45 to 64 years.3 In Europe, approximately 56% 
of all 
incident patients commencing KRT are aged 
>65 years.4 Kidney transplantation is a practical option 
for older patients on dialysis. There is now indisput- 
able evidence from observational studies suggesting 
that kidney transplantation improves the quality of 
life and survival for most patients with kidney failure, 
even in elderly individuals.5(cid:2)7 Chronological age is no 
longer a contraindication for kidney transplantation 
because of the incremental gains in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years experienced by older pa- 
tients with functioning grafts compared to maintenance 
dialysis.8 
Elderly candidates represent an increasingly preva- 
lent group on the waitlist for kidney transplantation. 
However, age-related comorbidities such as ischemic 
heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and frailty 
are risk factors for premature death and postoperative 
complications after transplantation.9(cid:2)13 The risk of 




early postoperative death is also high among recipients 
aged $65 years, with an increased risk of death by 1.5 
times during the perioperative period compared to 
those remaining on dialysis.6,7 
Careful selection of suitable candidates is therefore 
central to attenuate the risk of postoperative compli- 
cations and to ensure appropriate utilisation of the 
precious resources. Yet knowledge of recipient- and 
donor-related factors that contribute to optimal out- 
comes in older recipients after kidney transplantation 
are unclear, because most studies that have included 
patients aged $65 years are limited by small sample 
size, without relevant listing data and hence with un- 
certain effects on patient-relevant outcomes.14(cid:2)16 In 
this study, we aimed to determine the recipient-related 
and donor-related factors that are associated with pa- 
tient and graft survivals in a large cohort of kidney 
transplant recipients aged $65 years. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study Population 
This observational study used linked data between the 
Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant 
(ANZDATA) registry and the National Organ Matching 
System (NOMS). Data were collected through the cal- 
endar year by medical and nursing staff in each renal 
unit in Australia and New Zealand and submitted 
annually to the ANZDATA registry by the end of 
March in the following year. We included all Austra- 
lian patients who had commenced dialysis when 
aged $65 years and were subsequently placed on the 
deceased donor kidney transplant waitlist between 28 
June 2006 and 31 December 2016 (inclusive), who then 
received their ﬁrst kidney transplant 
(living or 
deceased donor) during this study period. This study 
was approved by the Western Sydney Local Health 
District 
the 
committee. We

Data Collection 
Baseline data on recipients included age, ethnicity, sex, 
Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) score (with a 
higher score indicating greater socioeconomic advan- 
tage), causes of primary renal disease, and comorbid- 
ities 
disease, 
coronary 
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, 
diabetes mellitus) at the time of waitlisting and trans- 
plantation, and smoking status (at the time of renal 
replacement therapy). We also collected data on the 
date and cause of death. Transplantation data collected 
included the date of the kidney transplantation, donor 
details (age, sex, and total ischemic time in hours), data 

function (with “delayed graft 
on immediate graft 
function” deﬁned as “no immediate function and 
dialysis required within 72 hours” and with “no 
delayed graft function” deﬁned as “spontaneous fall in 
serum creatinine by 10% within 24 hours”, “sponta- 
neous fall in serum creatinine by 10% ﬁrst recorded 
between 25 and 72 hours”, or “poor immediate func- 
tion with no spontaneous fall 
in serum creatinine 
within 72 hours but no dialysis required”), and date 
and cause of graft failure. Data collected from NOMS 
included dates of waitlisting and waitlisting status for 
each recipient. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was overall patient survival, 
deﬁned as time from kidney transplantation to death, 
censored for loss to follow-up or end of inclusion 
period for the study (31 December 2016). 
Secondary outcomes included death with a func- 
tioning graft (censored for graft failure, loss to follow- 
up, or end of the inclusion period), overall graft sur- 
vival (censored for loss to follow-up and end of the 
inclusion period), and death-censored graft survival 
(censored for death, loss to follow-up, or end of the 
inclusion period). Overall graft survival was deﬁned as 
the time from kidney transplantation until death with a 
functioning graft or return to dialysis. 

Covariates 
Recipient factors that were analyzed as potential risk 
factors were sex, age at transplantation, Socioeconomic 
Index for Area (SEIFA) score, primary renal disease, 
dialysis modality at time of transplantation (hemodial- 
[PD]), ethnicity 
ysis 
(Caucasian, Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander, Asian, 
Maori, Paciﬁc and other), smoking status, comorbid- 
ities at time of transplantation (coronary artery disease, 
peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus), body mass 
index at time of transplantation (kg/m2), state of resi- 
dence at 
trans- 
plantation, acute rejection (deﬁned by ANZDATA as 
rejection within the ﬁrst 6 months posttransplantation), 
delayed graft function (which we deﬁned as “no im- 
mediate function and dialysis required within 72 
hours” from the data available from the ANZDATA 
Registry), and time on dialysis prior to transplantation. 
The total time that a patient was not active on the 
deceased donor waitlist was calculated as a proportion 
of the total time from time of being waitlisted to 
transplantation. Donor-related factors that were also 
assessed as potential risk factors included the age of the 
donor, sex, deceased versus living kidney donor status, 
and ischemic time.

Statistical Analyses 
Continuous variables were summarized using means 
and SDs for normally distributed variables, and me- 
for non(cid:2)normally 
dians and interquartile ranges 
distributed variables. Comparison of baseline charac- 
teristics between recipients who reached the primary 
outcome of interest (i.e., death) and those who did not, 
were made by the Student t test and c2 test for 
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. 
Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess 
predictors of all-cause mortality, death with a func- 
tioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft loss. 
Kaplan(cid:2)Meier curves were constructed to estimate 
survival time until all-cause mortality, death with a 
functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft 
loss. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Fine 
and Gray competing risks models17 for graft failure, 
with death as a competing event, and death with graft 
failure as a competing event. 
For each model, potential risk factors were ﬁrst 
assessed by univariable analysis. Variables with P 
values <0.20 on univariable analysis were included in 
the initial multivariable model. Backward stepwise 
variable selection was applied, and variables with P 
values <0.05 in the multivariable model were kept. 
Acute rejection was modeled as a time-dependent co- 
variate, with time without a prior rejection episode 
considered “no previous rejection” and time after 
experiencing any acute rejection episode counted as 
“rejection.” We performed prespeciﬁed tests for effect 
modiﬁcation between patient age at transplantation and 
sex and the other included covariates in the models. 
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 
Statistics v22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and R 
version 3.6.0 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). A P 
value of ˂0.05 was regarded as signiﬁcant. The pro- 
portional hazard assumption was assessed in all models 
using the coxph.zph function and graphically by

RESULTS 
Characteristics of the Study Cohort 
A total of 1324 patients commenced KRT aged $65 
years and were listed on the deceased donor kidney 
transplant waitlist between June 2006 and December 
2016. Of these, 1267 had no prior transplants. In all, 
802 received either a deceased or living donor trans- 
plant during this period (Figure 1). 
Most transplant recipients were men (531, 66.2%). 
Seven hundred ﬁve (87.9%) recipients received trans- 
plants from deceased donors. The median age at 
(interquartile range 
transplantation was 68 years 
[IQR]: 66(cid:2)69 years). The median time on renal 
replacement therapy was 37.9 months. The median 
time from kidney replacement therapy to waitlisting 
was 16.6 months (IQR: 8.7(cid:2)31.7 months). The most 
common causes of primary kidney disease were 
glomerulonephritis (n ¼ 276, 34.4%), followed by 
diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 (n ¼ 147, 18.3%) and 
polycystic kidney disease (n ¼ 118, 14.7%). Median 
ischemic time was 11 hours (IQR ¼ 7(cid:2)15 hours). 
Baseline characteristics of patients who received their 
ﬁrst kidney transplants are shown in Table 1. 
Patient Survival 
Over a follow-up time of 2707 patient-years, 136 pa- 
tients (17% of total patients) died, and 111 patients 
(81.6% of total deaths) died with a functioning graft.

and 79% (95% CI ¼ 75.1%(cid:2)82.9%) respectively 
(Figure 2a). The 1-year and 5-year survivals with a

and 82.4% (95% CI ¼ 78.8%(cid:2)86.1%)

(Figure 2b). 

Factors Associated With All-Cause Death and 
Death With a Functioning Graft 
Factors associated with all-cause death (adjusted HR 
[95% conﬁdence interval]) included pretransplantation 
dialysis modality as peritoneal dialysis (1.71 [1.17– 
2.51]), prevalent coronary artery disease (1.47 [1.03– 
2.11]), prevalent cerebrovascular disease (1.99 [1.26– 
3.16]), total ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03–1.09]), 
increasing donor age (1.02 per year [1.01–1.03]), and 
function (1.64 [1.13(cid:2)2.39]). Factors 
delayed graft 
associated with all-cause death and death with a 
functioning graft (discussed below) are represented in 
Figure 4.

(1.05 per 1-hour increase [1.02(cid:2)1.09], P ¼ 0.004). In

(1.69

[1.14(cid:2)2.50], P ¼ 0.009), coronary artery disease at time

increasing graft ischemic time (1.05 per hour increase 
[1.02–1.08], P ¼ 0.004), in the competing risk model 
(with graft loss considered as a competing risk event) 
(Supplementary Table S4). 



Graft Survival 
Overall, 51 patients (6.4%) lost their allografts. Causes 
of graft loss are shown in Figure 5. The 1-year and 5- 
year overall graft survivals were 92.9% (95% CI ¼ 
91.1%(cid:2)94.7%) and 75.4% (95% CI ¼ 71.3%(cid:2)79.5%) 
(Figure 2c), respectively. The 1-year and 5-year death- 
censored graft survivals were 96.8% (95% CI ¼ 
95.4%(cid:2)98.2%) and 92% (95% CI ¼ 89.8%(cid:2)94.2%) 
(Figure 2d). 
Factors Associated With Overall Graft Survival 
and Death-Censored Graft Loss 
Factors associated with lower overall graft survival 
(adjusted HR [95% CI]) were cerebrovascular disease 
(1.70 [1.10–2.63], P ¼ 0.02), increasing ischemic time 
increase [1.01–1.07], P ¼ 0.01), 
(1.04 per hour 
increasing donor age (1.02 per year increase [1.01– 
1.03], P < 0.001), acute rejection (1.54 [1.04(cid:2)2.26], P ¼ 
0.03), and delayed graft function (1.59 [1.14(cid:2)2.24], P ¼ 
0.007). Factors associated with death-censored graft loss

(adjusted HR [95% CI]) were cerebrovascular disease 
(2.44 [1.20(cid:2)4.95], P ¼ 0.01], acute rejection (4.27 
[2.28(cid:2)7.98], P ¼ 0.01), increasing donor age (1.04 per 
year increase [1.01–1.06], P ¼ 0.002) and delayed graft 
function (2.92 [1.63(cid:2)5.25], P < 0.001). Recent trans- 
plant era was associated with improved graft survival 
(0.85 per year increase [95% CI ¼ 0.76(cid:2)0.96], P ¼ 
0.009). Factors associated with overall graft survival 
and death-censored graft loss are shown in Figure 6. 
In the sensitivity analysis, similar estimates were 
found for the association between cerebrovascular 
disease (2.32 [1.10(cid:2)4.88], P ¼ 0.03), acute rejection 
episodes (4.29 [2.18(cid:2)8.44], P ¼ 0.02), increasing donor 
age (1.03 per year increase [1.01(cid:2)1.06], P ¼ 0.008), and 
delayed graft function (2.73 [1.49(cid:2)5.01], P ¼ 0.001) 
with graft survival in the competing risk model (with 
death considered a competing risk event). Recent 
transplant era was 
found to be associated with 
improved graft survival (0.84 [0.74(cid:2)0.94], P ¼ 0.003) 
(Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). 
Increasing proportion of inactive time on the waitlist 
was not associated with adverse patient and graft 
outcomes after transplantation (adjusted HR [95% 
CI] ¼ 1.51 [0.89–2.55] and 1.01 [0.62–1.64], respec- 
tively). Donor type (living vs. deceased donor) was not 
associated with overall patient and graft survival (P ¼ 
0.61 and P ¼ 0.63, respectively). 
For patients who were on hemodialysis prior to 
transplantation, the median time from KRT to wai- 
tlisting was 18.4 months (IQR ¼ 9.7–37.4 months), and 
median time on KRT prior to transplantation was 42.1 
months (IQR ¼ 23.9–64.5 months). 
In comparison, patients on peritoneal dialysis prior 
to transplantation had a median time from KRT to 









waitlisting of 13.0 months (IQR ¼ 7.0–4.0 months) and 
median time on KRT prior to transplantation of 29.6 
months (IQR ¼ 17.2–48.9 months). 
In this selected cohort of elderly transplant recipients, 
our study ﬁndings suggest that overall patient and 
graft survival rates may be comparable to those in 
younger recipients, with 5-year patient and death- 
censored graft survivals exceeding 75%. These pa- 
tient and graft survivals are higher than what has been 
previously reported in older transplant recipients 
(aged $65 years). Such discrepant ﬁndings may be 
attributed to the younger donor ages observed in our 
study and also recipients from different transplantation 
eras. A single prior study has focused on recipients 
who received their ﬁrst transplant largely in the last 
decade (2002–2012).18 Apart from the known recipient- 
related risk factors for death including coronary artery 
disease and cerebrovascular disease,14,19 we have 
shown that dialysis modality prior to transplantation is 
a risk factor for adverse outcomes after transplantation. 
Patients on peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation 
experienced an excess risk of death by 1.5-fold 
compared to patients on maintenance hemodialysis. 

contrary, prior work indicated pre- 
transplant dialysis modality was not a risk factor for 
patient survival.19(cid:2)26 However, most of the published 
data included younger populations, with a mean age 
of recipients under 50 years.19,20,26 Given the obser- 
vational nature of the analyses, participants were not 
randomly assigned to the initial 
type of dialysis. 
Inherent biases including selection, confounding, and 
indication biases may exist; therefore, causality cannot 
be established. Patients on PD typically have lower 
hemoglobin and serum albumin levels compared to 
patients with pretransplantation HD,20 and this may 
have contributed to the increased risk of death. 
Consistent with previous literature,27 in our cohort, 
those patients on HD had a higher prevalence of 
coronary artery disease (Supplementary Material). 
However, 1 recent paper27 showed that despite this 
higher prevalence, there was no difference in survival 
between patients receiving HD and those receiving 
PD, but there was a trend toward increased mortality 
in those aged $65 years who were receiving PD with 
a dialysis vintage of over 3 years. This is also appli- 
cable to many of the patients on PD prior to trans- 
plantation in our cohort, who had a mean dialysis 
vintage of more than 3 years, and may partly explain 
our ﬁnding. Further investigation into the role of 
dialysis-related factors and its impact on elderly kid- 
ney transplant recipients is warranted. 
Although preferential allocation of older donors to 
older recipients is not an explicit criteria for the 
deceased donor organ allocation in Australia, as is 
currently implemented in the Eurotransplant Pro- 
gram28 and the US Kidney Allocation System,28 there 
is evidence to suggest that an “old-for-old” standard 
has been applied implicitly in the Australian 
deceased donor allocation system. Given the persis- 
tent shortage of donor organs and the advancing age 
of the end-stage kidney disease population, balancing 
utility (allocation of organs to those who derive the 
greatest beneﬁt) 
to 
transplantation for all age groups) is a critical element 
for consideration of an equitable deceased donor 
algorithm within Australia.29 Trans- 
allocation 
plantation of an elderly recipient with an older 
kidney still offers a survival beneﬁt over dialysis,6 
and reduces waiting time for transplantation,30 but 
carefully weighed 
these 
against the known risk of increased graft loss and 
mortality compared to those in recipients of deceased 
donor kidneys with higher kidney donor proﬁle in- 
dex (KDPI).30 





The most common cause of death in our study was 
infectious complications, which is consistent with prior 
literature in the elderly kidney transplantation pop- 
ulation.31(cid:2)33 A single study suggested that reduction of 
immunosuppression in elderly patients aged $60 
years34 was associated with improved patient and graft 
outcomes, but current guidelines do not consider the 
adverse effects such as catastrophic infections that are 
unique and important to older recipients.35 Evidence 
on recommended immunosuppressive 
is 
derived mainly from trials in which where elderly 
patients were either excluded or a minority.36 Any 
reduction of 
immunosuppression must balance the 
risks and implications of increased rejection. Rejection 
episodes in the elderly transplant recipient may have a 
disproportionately higher adverse impact on graft loss 
in younger recipients.37 Further 
compared to that 
comparative studies on the optimal immunosuppres- 
sion regimen in this population is warranted. 

One of the strengths of this study was the large and 
complete cohort, which included all elderly kidney 
transplant recipients in Australia and New Zealand 
during the study period, with few missing values, good 
follow-up data points, and involvement in all trans- 
plantation centers, thus enhancing external validity. 
However, our study has focused on a highly selected 
cohort of elderly patients, and these ﬁndings may not 
be generalizable to all patients of this age group on 
maintenance dialysis. 

limitations. Residual 
confounding effects may exist, as details pertaining to 





the parameters of dialysis adequacy prior to trans- 
plantation and the reasons for the choice of pre- 
transplantation dialysis modality were not collected 
routinely. Furthermore, frailty is a risk factor for poor 
outcomes posttransplantation,9 and markers of frailty 
are not routinely collected by the registry. Other in- 
formation such as the severity of disease are not 
routinely collected, 
in- 
and prior 
terventions of vascular comorbidities are also not re- 
ported within the registry. Similarly, details regarding 
the stage and histological types of prior cancers were 
also missing. As such, we were unable to quantify the 
impact of these co-existing comorbidities as potential 
prognostic factors on death. 

Although the relative risk of mortality is increased 
in the elderly transplant recipient compared to younger 
transplant recipients,38 it is reassuring to note that the 
absolute rates of death 1 year and 5 years post- 
transplantation among older recipients remains low. 
Pre-existing vascular disease is a major risk factor for 
adverse outcomes after transplantation, and careful 
evaluation and selection of the appropriate candidates 
is necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes and use 
of this scarce resource. 

in this selected cohort of elderly 
kidney transplant recipients, 5-year patient and graft 
survivals exceeded 75%. Results from this study have 
identiﬁed several factors associated with death and 
graft failure, which may be critical to inform the se- 
lection and to identify targets of opportunity to 
improve outcomes in elderly dialysis patients for future 
kidney transplantation.
