Access to, and outcome of, renal transplantation according to 
treatment modality of end-stage renal disease in France. 
Background. Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) is recognized 
as one of the methods of treatment of end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD), there have been recurrent concerns about the access 
of patients treated by this modality to kidney transplantation 
(KTx), as well as reports showing increased complications of 
KTx in such patients, such as graft thrombosis and infections. 
Methods. The aim of this study was to provide a compre- 
hensive view of the impact on transplantation of pretransplant 
modality of treatment of ESRD using a multivariate analysis 
of the French database. From 1997 to 2000, after exclusion of 
pediatric patients, multiple transplantations, and living donors, 
6420 were patients registered on the waiting list, and 3464 were 
transplanted. 
Results. Using a Cox proportional hazard analysis, we found 
a shorter waiting time for PD patients (RR 0.71, P < 0.0001), 
which became equivalent to hemodialysis (HD) patients when 
taking into account the transplant center as a variable (RR 1.0, 
P = 0.95). Concerning graft survival, only preemptive transplan- 
tation had a signiﬁcant impact, being associated to a decreased 
risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P = 0.005). 
Conclusion. Our study supports the concept that the choice of 
any pretransplant dialysis modality does not inﬂuence waiting 
time for transplant or the results of transplantation. 
Several renal replacement therapies are available for 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), namely 
hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or preemp- 
tive transplantation (Pre-T) [1], but the selection for any 
given individual depends on many variables, including his 
acceptance of therapy modalities and pretransplantation 
strategy. HD is by far the most frequent modality used for 
renal replacement therapy in many countries. The fre- 
quency of patients with ESRD treated by PD reached 
Key words: peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, graft survival, waiting 
time.

15% in many industrialized countries, but is only around 
10% in France [2]. 
For a long time, many physicians have been reluctant 
to propose PD to candidates for kidney transplantation. 
There have been reports that transplanted patients pre- 
viously on PD had more frequent graft thrombosis [3, 4] 
or infections [5] compared to patients treated with HD. 
When looking at transplantation outcomes, equivalent [6] 
or inferior results [7] have been reported for PD patients. 
However, recent studies have shown that PD is associ- 
ated with a lower incidence of post-transplant delayed 
graft function (DGF) compared to HD [8, 9]. 
Although these concerns might have a detrimental im- 
pact on the waiting time of PD patients, recent studies 
have shown, on the contrary, a faster access to transplan- 
tation of PD patients [6, 10]. 
The relationship between the choice of ESRD treat- 
ment (HD, DP, or Pre-T) modality, waiting time, and graft 
survival depends on many variables. 
The aim of this study was, thus, to evaluate at a na- 
tional scale by multivariate analysis the role of ESRD 
treatment on the likelihood to receive a transplant (wait- 
ing time), and on patient and graft survivals after kidney 
transplantation. 


In France, it is mandatory to register donors, candi- 
dates, as well as graft and recipient follow-up, in the na- 
tional information system of the French Transplantation 
Agency (Etablissement Fran¸cais des Greffes). 
We reviewed the data of all the patients that were regis- 
tered on the national French waiting list between January 
1997 and December 2000, as well as all recipients of a kid- 
ney graft during the same time frame. A total of 6420 reg- 
istrations and 3464 grafts performed by 37 centers were 
ﬁnally included in the analysis after exclusion of living 
donors, pediatric recipients (<16 years), multiple organ 
transplants, nonresident, and retransplant registrations. 



Recipient and graft criteria considered for adjustment 
were: recipient age at registration and at transplantation, 
gender, blood group, diabetes mellitus, peak panel reac- 
tive antibody (PRA) level, frequency of human lympho- 
cytic antigen (HLA) alleles (with scarcity deﬁned as a 
frequency <3% among all registered patients), time on 
dialysis at registration, year of registration, ESRD treat- 
ment modality at registration, waiting time before trans- 
plantation, HLA mismatching (0–6), cold ischemia time, 
gender and blood group matching, donor age, gender, 
blood group, and cause of death. 

The effect of ESRD treatment modality was evaluated 
on two main outcomes: likelihood of transplantation was 
assessed through the analysis of waiting time to trans- 
plantation and transplant outcome through the analysis 
of patient and graft survivals. 
Differences among categorized patient’s characteris- 
tics were tested by chi-square test for discrete variables, 
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous vari- 
ables. 
To estimate waiting time to transplant, time on the na- 
tional kidney transplant waiting list was calculated for 
each patient. The event of interest is transplant, with pa- 
tients dying on the list censored at date of death. Patients 
removed from the list were censored at the date of re- 
moval, and those still awaiting a transplant at the end of 
the analysis period were censored at that time. To esti- 
mate graft survival after transplant, deﬁned as a patient 
alive with a functioning graft, end point was deﬁned as ei- 
ther death or graft failure. Kaplan-Meier estimators were 
used to determine waiting time and graft survival. 
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to ana- 
lyze the effect of ESRD treatment modality on waiting 
time and on graft survival adjusted on all risk factors asso- 
ciated with each outcome in the univariate analysis, with 
a P value <0.2. 
The ﬁnal multivariable model is adjusted on centers af- 
ter investigation of a possible association between ESRD 
treatment modalities and center waiting times. Statistical 
signiﬁcance was accepted at P < 0.05. 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft- 
ware package, version 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA). 


The characteristics of patients at registration are sum- 
marized in Table 1. A total of 6240 registrations on the 
waiting list were included: 647 (10.1%) PD, 5190 (80.8%) 
HD, and 583 (9.1%) Pre-T. The number of new yearly 
registrations according to ESRD treatment modality dif-

fered between 1997 and 2000 (P < 0.0001). Registration 
of patients treated by PD increased in time, from 128 
(8.5%) in 1997 to 177 (10.8%) in 2000, as well as Pre-T 
registrations from 106 (7.2%) in 1997 to 189 (11.3%) in 
2000, while HD decreased (84.3% in 1997 to 77.9% in 
2000). 
Signiﬁcant differences between patients according to 
ESRD treatment modalities were observed for gender 
(P = 0.004) and age at registration (P = 0.04). More pre- 
cisely, PD and Pre-T patients were more often women, 
and were registered at a younger age. 
The overall waiting time curves differed signiﬁcantly 
(P < 0.0001) between ESRD treatment modalities 
(Fig. 1), with 13.5 months median waiting time for HD, 
9.4 for PD, and 11.7 for Pre-T patients (P < 0.0001). 
Using the proportional hazard regression model, we 
found a number of variables to be signiﬁcant in univari- 
ate analysis for their effect on waiting time before trans- 
plantation (Table 2). An increased risk was observed for 
female gender (RR = 1.1, P = 0.0003), O and B blood 
groups [RR = 1.83, P < 0.0001, peak PRA level between 
15% and 69% (RR = 1.42, P < 0.0001) and 70% and 
more (RR = 2.06, P < 0.0001), and an increased number 
of infrequent HLA alleles (RR = 1.2, P < 0.0001)]. On 
the contrary, patients of less than 30 years at registration 
(RR = 0.81, P = 0.0001), or 60 years and above (RR = 
0.87, P = 0.01) had a reduced waiting time. 
cipient age above 60 years at transplantation (RR = 2.13, 
P < 0.0001), months on dialysis before transplantation 
(RR = 1.003, P = 0.003), and cold ischemic time (RR = 
1.02, P = 0.004). Pre-T compared to HD was found to 
be the only treatment modality signiﬁcantly linked with 
better graft survival, and no signiﬁcant effect on graft sur- 
vival was observed for any dialysis modality. 
After adjustment for risk factors linked with graft sur- 
vival in univariate analysis (P < 0.2), PD (RR = 0.90, P 
= 0.52) had no effect on graft survival, but Pre-T (RR = 
0.46, P = 0.005) was still found to be associated with a 
decreased risk of graft failure. 



Peritoneal dialysis is still used in a minority of patients 
needing renal replacement therapy. The rates range from 
45% in the United Kingdom to 8% in Germany [2], as 
compared to 13% in the United States [11]. However, 
the percentage of patients waiting for a kidney transplant 
treated by PD may be different, depending on the char- 
acteristics of the patients such as age or comorbidities. 
In France, no such difference exists, as the percentage of 
ESRD patients treated by PD is 10%, and the percent- 
age of patients on the transplant waiting list treated by 
PD is exactly the same. Transplants from living donors 
represent less than 5% of all kidney transplantations per- 
formed in France. The proportion of patients registered 
on the waiting list and expecting a living donor transplant 
and treated by PD in France is 9%, which is comparable 
to the percentage of patients registered on the waiting 
list for a deceased donor. Moreover, the analysis of graft 
survival was performed on the cohort of patients ﬁnally 
transplanted among the cohort of patients included in 
the analysis of time to transplant and, therefore, did not 
include the effect of the donor type. 
Small differences, however, exist in terms of age at reg- 
istration and female gender between HD and PD patients 
(see Table 1). PD patients are more likely to be female 
and younger, as seen in the United States [8]. 
The likelihood of transplantation for PD patients has 
recently been reported as 1.39 times greater than HD pa- 
tients in a retrospective analysis of the UNOS database 
[11], even after considering clinical differences between 
HD and PD patients, such as sex, race, age, BMI, and co- 
morbidities. Likewise, in our analysis, we found a reduced 
median waiting time to transplantation for PD patients 
(Fig. 1) that persisted after taking into account such vari- 
ables as gender, age, or PRA level. However, this result 
could not be easily explained, as kidney allocation rules 
in France are blind to dialysis modality. As the median 
waiting time differs signiﬁcantly between transplant cen- 
ters in France [12], we hypothesized that a center effect

ESRD treatment modality at registration had a pro- 
found impact on waiting time, with a risk ratio of 0.71 
(P < 0.0001) for PD and 0.83 (P = 0,002) for Pre-T pa- 
tients compared to HD patients. As allocation rules in 
France do not take into account the modality of ESRD 
treatment, this prompted us to investigate the potential 
relationship between waiting time and percentage of PD 
patients on the waiting list in individual transplant cen- 
ters. Results are shown in Figure 2, and clearly show that 
PD patients are more likely to be registered in centers 
with the shortest waiting times. Indeed, centers with a 
median waiting time of less than 10 months have the high- 
est percentage of PD patients on list (16%) compared 
to the longer waiting centers, averaging only around 5% 
PD patients on list. After adjustment on all risk factors 
described above and adjustment on centers, no effect of 
ESRD treatment modality was observed any longer, with 
a risk ratio of 1.0 (P = 0.95) for PD modality (Table 2). 

The characteristics of donors and recipients at trans- 
plantation are summarized in Table 3. Of the 3464 
transplant patients, 400 (11.5%) were treated by PD at 
registration, 2738 (79.1%) by HD, and 326 (9.4%) by 
Pre-T. The same differences seen in registered patients 
in terms of age and gender between ESRD treatment 
modalities are again observed in transplanted patients 
(Table 1). The unadjusted overall graft survival differs 
signiﬁcantly (P = 0.003) according to ESRD treatment 
modality (Fig. 3). Pre-T graft survival was signiﬁcantly 
higher when compared to HD (P = 0.0009) and to PD 
graft survival (P = 0.02). No difference was observed be- 
tween HD and PD populations (P = 0.31). 
Using the proportional hazard regression model, we 
found different variables to be signiﬁcant in univariate 
analysis for their effect on graft survival (Table 4), such 
as donor age above 54 years (RR = 1.66, P < 0.0001), re-

tration and the actual waiting time for transplant. In our 
series, PD patients were registered signiﬁcantly earlier 
than other patients (11.4 vs. 19.5 months, P < 0.0001). 
This leads to a shorter dialysis time for PD patients, even 
with equivalent waiting times. This might explain the re- 
sults of previously published studies with longer dialysis 
duration for HD patients [6, 10, 14]. 
Graft survival in our analysis does not depend on dial- 
ysis modality, but is strongly enhanced by preemptive 
transplantation, in accordance with previously published 
studies [15–17]. Although our database does not include 
complications such as thrombosis or rejections, the sim- 
ilar survival suggests that any potential complication

could be responsible for this apparent difference in wait- 
ing time between PD and HD patients. We, thus, divided 
the transplant groups into short, medium, or long waiting 
time, and assessed the proportion of PD patients regis- 
tered in those three types of centers (Fig. 2). There is 
a striking difference, with a much higher proportion of 
PD patients in the centers with the lowest median wait- 
ing time. We then estimated waiting time integrating the 
center as a variable, which became strictly identical be- 
tween dialysis modalities. This potential bias could cast a 
doubt on previous publications, demonstrating a shorter 
waiting time of PD patients. 
Our analysis points out to another potential bias, 
namely pretransplant dialysis duration. Indeed, it has 
been demonstrated that dialysis duration impacts neg- 
atively on graft survival [13]. This period of time is, in 
fact, the sum of the time spent on dialysis before regis-

arising in the PD patients has no detrimental effect on 
patient or graft survival at two years [6, 11]. 

Our study supports the concept that the choice of dial- 
ysis modality does not inﬂuence either the patient waiting 
time for transplantation or patient and graft survival.
