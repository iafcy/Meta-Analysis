Abstract 
Background. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) 
is a common metabolic complication in kidney allograft 
recipients, significantly contributing to the elevated car- 
diovascular morbidity after renal transplantation and in- 
creased risk of chronic transplant dysfunction. The aim 
of the present investigation was to evaluate the factors 
influencing PTDM development. Under particular con- 
sideration were the elements, existing before the trans- 
plantation, especially the modality of dialysis treatment 
significance, i.e. haemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal 
dialysis (PD). 
Methods. Three hundred and seventy-seven consecutive 
outpatients who underwent renal transplantation (RTx) in 
our institution between January 2003 and December 
2005 were analysed. PTDM was diagnosed according to 
the current American Diabetic Association/World Health 
Organization criteria. Statistical inference was conducted 
by means of univariate methods (one factor versus PTDM) 
and multivariate methods in frames of generalized linear 
model. 
Results. In the study group, 72 patients (23.4%) developed 
PTDM after RTx (55 HD and 17 PD patients). PTDM in- 
cidence at 3, 6 and 12 months was 15.9%, 22.1% and 
23.4%, respectively. The mean interval from transplant- 
ation to the onset of PTDM was 3.08 ± 2.73 months. In 
univariate analysis, the factors associated with the elevated 
risk of PTDM appearance were older recipient age, posi- 
tive family history of diabetes, hypertensive nephropathy 
as end-stage renal disease cause, higher body mass index 
at transplantation, treatment by PD, and the graft from an 
older donor. In multivariate verification, statistical signifi- 
cance remained: older recipient age (P < 0.001), positive 
family history of diabetes (P = 0.002), and treatment by 
PD (P = 0.007). 
Conclusions. Treatment by PD appears to be a possible 
novel factor, not yet reported, which may increase the risk 
of PTDM development.

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common 
metabolic complication in kidney allograft recipients ap- 
pearing in 4–30% of patients [1–4]. 
It is also well known that PTDM contributes significant- 
ly to the elevated cardiovascular morbidity after kidney 
transplantation and increased risk of chronic transplant 
dysfunction [1,5,6]. Pathogenesis of PTDM embraces both 
impairment of insulin secretion and peripheral resistance 
[7]. 
In most studies, the main focus was paid to factors 
affecting PTDM occurrence in the post-transplantation 
period, such as the type of calcineurin inhibitor used 
(cyclosporine versus tacrolimus), acute rejection rate, cu- 
mulative steroid dose, viral infection presence, number of 
HLA mismatches and quality of the transplanted organ 
[1,8–11]. 
However, less attention was devoted to factors deriving 
from chronic dialysis treatment. Therefore, the aim of the 
present investigation was to evaluate the factors influen- 
cing the occurrence of PTDM, including those existing be- 
fore transplantation in the dialysis period. Under particular 
consideration was the modality of dialysis treatment with 
the purpose of determination, whether being treated by 
peritoneal dialysis (PD) versus haemodialysis (HD) has 
significance for PTDM appearance. 

A retrospective cohort of 377 consecutive patients who underwent renal 
transplantation in our institution between January 2003 and December 
2005 were analysed. All grafts were transplanted from deceased donors. 
Three hundred and fifty patients received a first kidney graft, and 27 
received a second transplant. During the first 12 months, 5 patients chan- 
ged transplant centre, 12 patients lost graft function and 4 patients died. 
Finally, the study group encompassed 356 kidney allograft recipients 
with graft functioning >12 months. Forty-eight recipients (13.5%) were 
already diabetic during dialysis. 
Therefore, the final analysis included 308 patients (all Caucasian) 
whose clinical characteristics (quantitative and qualitative parameters) 
are presented in Tables 1 and 2. 
Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 8.0 software by 
means of univariate methods (one factor versus PTDM): Pearson’s chi- 
square test of independence (testing dependencies between categorical 
variables), non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test (comparing means of 
qualitative variables in the two groups, when binary variable—PDTM— 
could be the cause of differences), and simple logistic regression (inves- 
tigating influence of one qualitative variable on PDTM). Multivariate ana- 
lysis was conducted in frames of generalized linear model (GLM) with 
the logit link function (investigating many qualitative and categorical vari- 
ables to test their independent influence on PTDM). Statistical signifi- 
cance was recognized with P-value <0.05. Results with P-value greater 
than the significance level but <0.1 are also mentioned. The parameters 
of quantitative variables are given as mean ± SD. 
In the cyclosporine subgroup, the steroid administration was as fol- 
lows: Day 0—perioperative methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. bolus, Day 
1—250 mg i.v. bolus, Day 2—125 mg i.v. bolus, Day 3–14—40 mg 
prednisone p.o., Day 15–28—30 mg prednisone p.o., Day 29–42— 
20 mg prednisone p.o., Day 43–60—15 mg prednisone p.o., and from 
Day 61—10 mg prednisone. 
In the tacrolimus subgroup, significantly smaller steroid doses were 
given: Day 0—perioperative methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. bolus, Day 
1—125 mg i.v. bolus, Day 2–14—20 mg prednisone p.o., Day 15–28 
—15 mg prednisone, Day 29–42—10 mg prednisone p.o., and from 
Day 43—5 mg prednisone p.o. 
The mean yearly cumulative prednisone dose in cyclosporine-receiving 
patients was 5590 mg compared with 3000 mg in tacrolimus-treated 
recipients. 
In addition, the tacrolimus-treated patients were significantly younger 
than those taking cyclosporine (mean age, 42.3 ± 14.4 and 47.8 ± 
11.4 years, respectively, P = 0.0029). 




The current ADA criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are: symp- 
toms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration ≥200 mg/dL 
(11.1 mmol/L), fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), or a 
2-h post-load glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glu- 
cose tolerance test [12].

Some disparities appeared between patients treated by 
HD and PD. Patients on maintenance PD were younger 
(P = 0.0554), with higher percentage of females (P = 
0.0545) and shorter dialysis period (P = 0.0385). PD pa- 
tients exhibited lesser weight gain during 12 months of 
post-transplantation follow-up (P = 0.0285) and received 
more frequently tacrolimus (P = 0.0866) and mycophe- 
nolate mofetil (P = 0.0059) than cyclosporine and 
azathioprine. The average cumulative annual prednisone 
dose in PD group was 4150 mg versus 4570 mg in HD 
group. 
There was also difference in maintenance steroid dose 
between cyclosporine- and tacrolimus-treated recipients 
(smaller in tacrolimus group). 
In the study group, 72 patients (23.4%) developed 
PTDM after RTx (55 HD and 17 PD patients). PTDM in- 
cidence at 3, 6 and 12 months was 15.9%, 22.1% and 
23.4%, respectively. The mean interval from transplant- 
ation to the onset of PTDM was 3.08 ± 2.73 months. 


The following factors not connected with transplant- 
ation procedure and immunosuppressive regimen used, 
already existing prior to transplantation, exerted significant 
impact on PTDM appearance: older recipient age (P < 
0.001, OR = 1.050 per 1 year), positive family history of 
diabetes (P = 0.0046, OR = 2.366), hypertensive nephro- 
pathy versus glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, 
polycystic kidney disease and others as the end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) cause (P = 0.0048, OR = 2.452), 
higher body mass index (BMI) at transplantation day (P 
= 0.045, OR = 1.066 per 1 kg/m2), and treatment by 
PD (P = 0.0319, OR = 2.044 with 95% confidence 
interval of 1.054–3.963). 
From the elements operating after transplantation exclu- 
sively, older donor age was significantly associated with 
PTDM (P = 0.032, OR = 1.023 per 1 year). The other con- 
sidered factors, particularly the type of calcineurin inhibi- 
tor used, duration of cold ischaemia time, number of HLA 
mismatches, cumulative methylprednisolone i.v. dose for 
acute rejection treatment, gender of donor and recipient, 
presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before 
RTx, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes infections after 
RTx, and number of RTx (data not inserted), did not pre- 
dict PTDM development. 
In GLM analysis of covariance, the occurrence of 
PTDM was significantly associated with the age of re- 
cipient (P < 0.001, OR = 1.051 per 1 year), family his- 
tory of diabetes (P = 0.002, OR = 2.665), and PD 
treatment (P = 0.007, OR = 2.782) (Table 6). The lack 
of significant influence of other variables on PTDM risk 
could be the result of the relatively small number of pa- 
tients for multivariate model. Referring to no discerned

differences between the kinds of calcineurin inhibitor 
used, it should be underlined that the tacrolimus-treated 
patients were significantly younger than those taking 
cyclosporine. 
Influence of PD on risk of PTDM is even higher in 
multivariate model because PD patients are younger than 
HD patients. The difference in risk of PTDM develop- 
ment between PD- and HD-treated patients is depicted 
in Figure 1 and with respect to the age factor in Figure 2. 
Considering the age of recipients, the probability of PTDM 
appearance was below the age 50 years in PD patients, 
similar to the rate of occurrence in HD group older than 
50 years. 

In the cohort of kidney transplant recipients under this 
study, the appearance of PTDM was almost exclusively af- 
fected by patient pre-transplant clinical characteristics. The 
factors significantly augmenting PTDM occurrence were 
older recipient age (P ≤ 0.001), hypertensive nephropathy 
as the ESRD cause (P ≤ 0.01), higher BMI at transplant- 
ation day (P ≤ 0.05), and PD as the method of renal re- 
placement therapy (P ≤ 0.05 versus HD). The only 
factor associated with transplant procedure significantly 
contributing to PTDM development was older donor age 
(P ≤ 0.05). The multivariate analysis revealed that the in- 
dependent significant predictors of PTDM development 
were recipient age, positive family history of diabetes, 
and PD treatment. The novel finding, not reported in pre- 
vious literature, is the observation of significantly higher 
rate of PTDM in the PD-treated patients compared with 
the number in HD group. The proportion of PD patients 
with PTDM was 35.4% with 95% confidence interval of 
21.3–49.5% versus the proportion of HD patients equal to 
21.2% with 95% confidence interval of 15.8–26.6%. 

It is of particular note that this association was disclosed 
in multivariate analysis, albeit PD patients were younger 
(on the borderline of statistical significance, P = 0.055) 
and exhibited significantly (P = 0.03) lower weight gain 
post-transplantation (Table 1). Furthermore, the periods 
of dialysis treatment were significantly shorter in PD 
group (P = 0.04). The possible confounding effect of more 
frequent tacrolimus use in the PD group (on the borderline 
of significance P = 0.087) can be excluded based on the 
fact that there was no relationship between calcineurin in- 
hibitor type and diabetes occurrence in the study group, 
probably due to extensively smaller accompanying steroid 
dose in the patients treated with tacrolimus (mean yearly 
cumulative steroid dose in the tacrolimus group was 
3000 mg versus 5590 mg in the cyclosporine patients). 
In addition, the tacrolimus-treated patients were signifi- 
cantly younger than those taking cyclosporine. 
Therefore, our data suggest that the glucose load asso- 
ciated with PD therapy may increase the risk of PTDM 
development. Recently, Bergrem et al. reported that pre- 
transplant impaired glucose tolerance, revealed by a 
standard oral glucose tolerance test, was predictive for 
hyperglycaemia appearance 10 weeks post-transplant. 
However, they did not consider in the investigation the 
effect of dialysis modality. The major factor underlying 
PTDM occurrence in their study population was the re- 
cipient age which was previously reported [13]. The men- 
tion of PD treatment appears in the latest paper published 
by Hornum et al. after this manuscript submission [14]. 
In a smaller group of 57 kidney transplant recipients from 
live donors, they did not observe the impact of positive 
family history of diabetes and PD as treatment modality 
on PTDM occurrence. 
Noteworthy, according to our data, the risk of PTDM in 
PD patients below age 50 years was similar to the risk in 
HD patients above 50 years, with starting point of risk in- 
crease at age 40 years. 
The remaining elements, i.e. hypertensive nephropathy, 
higher BMI and older donor age, were strongly correlated 
with the age of recipients. In fact, it reflects the more 
frequent occurrence of hypertensive nephropathy and 
BMI increase in older recipients, and the higher prob- 
ability to receive allograft from older donor. The lack 
of difference in PTDM frequency between cyclosporine- 
and tacrolimus-treated patients seems to be caused by higher

accompanying prednisone doses in our cyclosporine-based 
immunosuppressive regimen. 
In summary, the present study has identified the features 
of the recipients associated with an elevated risk of PTDM 
development, such as older age, family history of diabetes, 
hypertensive nephropathy as ESRD cause, higher BMI at 
transplantation, treatment by PD, and the graft from an old- 
er donor. The recipients carrying these features should 
undergo detailed pre-transplant glucose metabolism evalu- 
ation with oral test for glucose intolerance, and be consid- 
ered for calcineurin inhibitors or steroid-minimization 
protocols. 


It is of note that 49 cases of PTDM from the total num- 
ber of 72 cases during 1 year were developed during the 
first 3 months post-transplantation. 

In evaluating the risk of PTDM occurrence, more attention 
should be paid to the stratification of the predisposing ab- 
normalities present during the dialysis period. Treatment 
by PD may increase the risk of PTDM development.

Abstract 
Background. Some aspects of kidney transplant outcome 
in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients 
are still controversial. Besides, published experience is 
scarce in Europe. 
Methods. A multicentre case–control study was designed 
to analyse the outcome of renal transplant in HIV + pa- 
tients in Spain. Twenty HIV+ patients were compared with 
a matched cohort of 40 HIV− recipients. 
Results. Post-transplant follow-up period was 39.98 ± 
36.51 months. Pre-transplant dialysis duration and the in-

plantation, HIV+ recipients presented lower incidence of
