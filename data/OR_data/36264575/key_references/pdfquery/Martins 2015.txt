It remains controversial whether dialysis modality prior to SPKT (simultaneous pan- 
creas–kidney transplantation) affects the outcome. We analyzed outcomes in type 1 
diabetic patients undergoing SPKT, comparing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialy- 
sis (HD) groups: 119 had been on HD; 39 on PD. They were comparable except 
regarding dialysis time, higher in HD patients (30 (cid:1) 23 vs. 21 (cid:1) 15 months, 
P = 0.003). Thrombosis-driven relaparotomy was more frequent in PD patients 
(12.8% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.014). Pancreas loss due to infection was higher in PD patients 
(12.8% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.042). Thrombosis-related kidney loss was more frequent in PD 
patients (5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.058). Thirteen deaths occurred, more 
within the PD group (17.9% vs. 5%; P = 0.011), being infection the leading cause 
(13.5%, vs. 1.7% in HD patients, P = 0.010). Patient survival was inferior in PD 
patients. Besides PD, cardiovascular disease and graft failure were independent predic- 
tors of patient death. In conclusion, PD patients more frequently complicated with 
intra-abominal infection leading to pancreatic loss and with renal thrombosis, with 
adverse impact on survival. As a PD ﬁrst strategy in end-stage renal disease patients is 
generally associated with good outcomes, these gloomier results after SPKT urge for 
careful adjustment of infection and thrombosis prophylactic protocols in PD patients.

Several studies demonstrated that pre-emptive transplanta- 
tion, deﬁned as transplantation before chronic dialysis is 
required, improves patient and graft outcomes in renal 
transplant patients [1–3]. However, most patients have to 
start renal replacement by dialysis because the kidney graft 
is not immediately available. 


Regarding dialysis modality, peritoneal dialysis (PD) or 
hemodialysis (HD), and its impact on transplant outcomes, 
there is no consensus on which is associated with better 
results [1,3–5], meaning that outcomes might be generally 
similar after adjusting for patient characteristics and center 
experience. The amount of time on dialysis may be the cru- 
cial factor with impact on outcome [1, 6], along with 
patient 
studies were 
focused mostly on renal transplantation only, and with 
inconclusive results related to several issues comparing pre- 
vious dialysis modality: There are conﬂicting reports about 
an increased renal graft loss in PD patients [8], mainly due 
to renal vascular thrombosis (VT) [4,5,8–11], by unclear 
predisposing mechanisms [12]; and about an increased 
incidence of sepsis in these patients [13,14]. Early infection 
may be related to other factors, namely the length of hospi- 
talization or more intense immunosuppression, as in cases 
of acute rejection [15]. 
On the other hand, there is a lack of data about the prefer- 
able dialysis modality prior to simultaneous pancreas–kidney 
transplantation (SPKT). Option for PD or HD normally 
depends on patient condition, such as their own autonomy; 
comorbid situations; vascular and peritoneal conditions; 
dialysis-center factors; and patient convenience. Patient 
selection biases for each modality cannot be ruled out. 
The purpose of this study was to analyze grafts and 
patient outcomes, in our type 1 diabetic (DM1) patients 
undergoing SPKT, comparing the subgroup that had been 
on PD with the other on HD. 

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study in 
adult SPKT performed at our unit. Among the 165 per- 
formed between May 2000 and December 2013, we studied 
158 on dialysis prior to SPKT. Cases who received a pre- 
emptive transplant were not included in the comparative 
analysis because of the small number of patients (n = 7). 
PD was the dialysis modality in 39 patients, while 119 were 
on HD. 
Systemic–enteric drainage was the technique used in all 
SPKT. Pancreas transplantation is performed using a side- 
to-side anastomosis between the donor0s duodenal arch and 
the recipient’s jejunum, with pancreas head up. Vascular 
implantation normally does not require prior reconstruc- 
tion. Donor0s aorta patch with the origin of the mesenteric 
superior artery and the splenic artery is anastomosed to the 
recipient0s common iliac artery and donor0s portal vein 
anastomosed to the recipient’s common iliac vein. Kidney 
transplantation is performed through a second incision, on 
the left iliac fossae, with extraperitoneal graft placement, the 
usual practice for kidney transplantation alone. Peritoneal 
catheter is always removed during the surgery. Celsior is the 
preservation solution used for pancreas grafts. Immunosup- 
pression comprised antithymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, my- 
cophenolate, and steroids. Two abdominal drains are left 
for some days in the transplanted patient: one draining the 
abdominal cavity; the second draining the renal graft fossae. 
Drain removal depends on volume and drainage character- 
istics: They are removed after two consecutive days with 
decreasing exudate amylase level and drainage volume, 
combined with its leukocyte count and microbiological 
analysis revealing no signs of infection. All patients had one 
bladder catheter for at least 5 days; and one central venous 
catheter, usually for the 5 days of antithymocyte globulin 
administration. Antibiotic prophylaxis included vancomy- 
cin, ﬂucanozole, and second-generation cephalosporin pre- 
operatively and during the ﬁrst few days while catheter and 
drains persist; cotrimoxazole, nystatin, and valgancyclovir 
were started after surgery. Before implantation, duodenal 
graft disinfection is always made using povidone–iodine, 
ampicillin, and ﬂuconazole. Thrombosis prophylaxis was 
made with aspirin (100 mg/day) started before surgery and 
enoxaparin (from 20 to 40 mg/day, depending on patient 
weight and renal function recovery) started immediately 
after surgery, or when blood losses were considered to be 
not 
signiﬁcant. Data were collected from patient ﬁle 
records, during the admission and after discharge, along 
with the outpatient follow-up. 

Continuous data were described using mean ((cid:1)standard 
deviation), and categorical data were expressed as number 




(and percentages). Categorical data were compared using 
Pearson’s v2 test or Fisher0s exact test and continuous vari- 
ables were compared with Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney 
U-test, as appropriate. Patient survival was determined from 
the time of SPKT until death or end of follow-up. Death- 
censored kidney graft survival was determined from the time 
of SPKT until kidney failure (return to dialysis or retrans- 
plantation) or end of follow-up. Death-censored pancreas 
graft survival was determined from the time of SPKT until 
pancreas failure (permanent insulin requirement or retrans- 
plantation) or end of follow-up. Graft survival curves were 
performed using Kaplan–Meier method and compared by 
log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analy- 
sis was applied to assess independent predictors of patient 
death, including clinically relevant variables and/or those 
presenting P ≤ 0.15 in univariable analysis: recipient gender 
and age, dialysis technique (HD vs. PD), time on dialysis, 
years of DM1, pretransplant glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
< or ≥ 9%, concomitant cardiovascular disease, and graft 
failure (kidney and/or pancreas). 
A two-sided P value <0.05 was considered as statistically 
signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, 
version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 

The relevant demographic and clinical data of the study 
population are presented in Table 1. PD and HD patients 
their pretransplant 
the majority of 
were similar 



characteristics: age; gender; duration of diabetes; HbA1c; 
body mass index (BMI); percent of patients chronically tak- 
ing aspirin; percent of patients with previously known car- 
diovascular disease (CVD); and value of hemoglobin (Hb) 
before surgery. Time on dialysis was the single distinguish- 
able parameter, being 
to the PD group 
(20.7 (cid:1) 14.6 months, vs. 32.0 (cid:1) 22.1 months in the HD 
group, P = 0.003). On the contrary, time on the waiting list 
for transplantation was undistinguishable (14 months for 
PD vs. 16 months for HD patients, P = 0.137). Regarding 
donor characteristics, the proportion of grafts from donors 
with traumatic brain death (74.4% for PD; 74.8% for HD) 
and length of donor0s admission in the intensive care unit 
(2.6 days for PD; 2.8 days for HD) as well as donor’s age 
(28 years for both groups) were similar between PD and 
HD patients. Other factors, such as the number of HLA 
mismatches; cold ischemia time; acute rejection rate; and 
length of admission, did not differ between both groups. 
There was a trend toward a lower rate of delayed renal graft 
function in PD patients. In those cases of dialysis need after 
SPKT, HD was always used. 
The global relaparotomy rate was similar in PD and HD 
patients. However, when we analyzed the reasons for 
re-intervention, thrombosis predominated (12.8%) among 
all causes for reoperation in PD patients (28.2%), being sig- 
niﬁcantly higher when compared to HD patients (12.8% vs. 
1.7%, P = 0.014). A nonsigniﬁcant higher proportion of 
HD patients (7.6%, vs. 2.6% in PD patients) underwent 
bleeding-driven relaparotomy. To exclude a possible effect

of era and cumulative experience on the rate of infection 
and thrombosis complications, the rate of such events was 
explored in each year of the SPKT program and it was seen 
that the events were distributed similarly along the time 
course of the SPKT program. 
Table 2 summarizes complications leading to each graft 
loss and patient death, in both groups. Death-censored 
pancreas graft loss was not signiﬁcantly different in both 
groups (28.2% for PD, vs. 19.3% for HD patients). How- 
ever, we registered more pancreas losses due to infection 
among PD patients (12.8%, vs. 3.4% among HD patients, 
P = 0.042). There was a trend toward a higher rate of glo- 
bal pancreas failure (death-censored) at month 1 in PD 
patients (15.4%, vs. 6.7% in HD patients, P = 0.099), but 
thereafter this difference disappeared. Additionally, we veri- 
ﬁed that the permanence of the abdominal drain after sur- 
(means of 
gery was almost double in PD patients 
4.7 (cid:1) 1.5 days, 
in HD patients, 
P < 0.001). 


We analyzed past peritonitis in PD patients and also 
intra-abdominal complications observed in this group. 
From the 39 PD patients, only ten have had peritonitis: 
These experienced 14 peritonitis episodes— four patients 
with two episodes. The isolated microbiological agents were 
gram positive in all but one: Staphylococcus Epidermidis (6 
cases); Staphylococcus Aureus (3 cases); Streptococcus Viri- 
dans (2 cases); Enterococcus Faecalis (2 cases); and Pseudo- 
monas Aeruginosa (1 case). The latter was efﬁciently treated 
with antibiotics and the patient had an uneventful recovery 

more than 1 year before SPKT, not needing catheter substi- 
tution. This patient did not present abdominal complica- 
tions after SPKT. Only one of ﬁve the patients who 
complicated with intra-abdominal infection had in the past 
a gram-positive peritonitis (Staph Epidermidis, 11 months 
ago), and the intra-abdominal agents after SPKT were dis- 
tinct: E. Coli and Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Similarly, only one 
of the four who complicated with pancreas thrombosis had 
a Staphylococcus Aureus peritonitis, 8 months before SPKT. 
Microbiological agents identiﬁed in the ﬁve patients with 
intra-abdominal 
infection were almost exclusively gram 
negative: E. Coli+ Klebsiella; Enterobacter Aerogenes; Pseudo- 
monas (2 cases); and Klebsiella+ vancomycin-resistant 
Enterococcus Faecium. 
As a note, from the single 3 patients who were on PD > 
40 months, only one had a peritonitis in the past, but none 
of these 3 suffered intra-abdominal complications after 
SPKT. Plastic peritonitis and obstruction were not registered. 
Additionally, none was switched to HD due to lack of ultra- 
ﬁltration or PD efﬁcacy. One single patient was switched 
from PD to HD, due to visual 
impairment, 13 months 
before SPKT and was accounted as an HD patient in this 
study. Excluding the 3 cases who started renal replacement 
by HD, for a few weeks, waiting for conditions for PD cathe- 
ter utilization, none was switched from HD to PD. 
As to the renal graft, death-censored graft failure was also 
not different in both groups (12.8% for PD, vs. 5.9% for 
HD patients). Analyzing the causes of renal loss, we noted a 
similar acute rejection rate in both groups, but a tendency

to a higher rate of losses due to thrombosis in PD patients 
(5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.058). There was a 
trend toward an increased ﬁrst-month renal graft failure in 
PD patients (5.1%, vs. 0% in HD patients, P = 0.060), and 
we observed that this tendency persisted after this period, 
when accounting for the total number of renal losses dur- 
ing follow-up (20.5%, vs. 9.2% among HD patients, 
P = 0.060). 
We also analyzed other factors prior to SPKT that might 
have inﬂuenced thrombosis rate, leading or not to graft 
loss: The rate of patients taking aspirin as chronic medica- 
tion; the level of Hb; and pre-existent CVD were similar in 
patients with and without thrombosis. On the contrary, 
patients who complicated with thrombosis more often were 
under PD (6/39 vs. 7/119, P = 0.061). The same analysis 
was made for pre-existent conditions predisposing to 
bleeding, needing surgery or even leading to graft loss. 
None of the studied factors (chronic medication with aspi- 
rin, Hb level, previous CVD, and dialysis modality) were 
associated with a higher incidence of bleeding. Among 
those who complicated with bleeding, 11 of 12 were on 
HD, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.296). 
Patient death was signiﬁcantly higher in the PD group: 
17.9% (n = 7), compared with 5.0% (n = 6) in the HD 
group, P = 0.011. Infection, as a cause of death, predomi- 
nated in PD patients (13.5%, vs. 1.7% in HD patients, 
P = 0.010). CVD-related death was registered only in HD 
group (4 cases, or 3.4%), although not statistically different 
from the PD group. 
Four-year and 8-year survival rates are presented in 
Table 3. Death-censored survival rates for pancreas graft 
were similar in HD and PD patients, irrespective of ﬁrst- 
month losses inclusion or not. Death-censored survival

rates for the renal graft were similar in HD and PD patients 
when ﬁrst-month losses were excluded. If these early losses 
were also considered, then renal survival was inferior in PD 
patients. Lower patient survival was observed in the PD 
group (87.0% and 71.2% vs. 98.1% and 95.2% in HD 
group, at 4 and 8 years, respectively, P = 0.003). 

failure (one or both 
grafts), the modality of dialysis, and concomitant CVD 
were conﬁrmed as independent predictors of patient death 
(Table 4). The likelihood of death was 8.76 times higher if 
at least one graft failed; 6.23 times higher if PD was the 
dialysis modality prior to SPKT; and 4.05 times higher 
when they have had clinically signiﬁcant CVD. Figure 1 
illustrates patient survival curves. 

Results from published studies about 
the relationship 
between dialysis modality and the outcome of transplant 
are not concordant. PD has been associated with poorer 
transplant outcomes by some authors [8–11], but others 
did not report any detrimental effect of PD [4,5]. However, 
most of these results came from kidney transplantation 
alone (KTA). 
In SPKT, 
infection [16–20], thrombosis [21,22], and 
relaparotomy 
bleeding 
to subsequent 
[20,21,23], are feared complications, as they have been 
associated with lower graft survival. 


There are several classical and well-recognized risk fac- 
tors for VT, such as multiple vessels, technical problems 
during anastomosis, very young pediatric donors or elderly 
donors, thrombocytosis, hemoconcentration, hypotension, 
and the existence of a previous transplant [9]. Obviously, 
hypercoagulable states substantially increase the rate of 
thrombosis [9,21]. Diabetes, itself, has been considered an 
additional risk factor for thrombosis [9], and prothrombot- 
ic disorders may be frequent in DM1 patients undergoing 
SPKT [24]. 
Though controversies still exist, PD may predispose to a 
thrombophilic state by several mechanisms [9] that are not

with aspirin were comparable in PD and HD patients. 
However, we have to be cautious in interpreting these 
results, given the small number of renal thrombosis (2 
cases). Future results from larger series including PD 
patients may bring more consistent data regarding the asso- 
ciation between PD and thrombosis in SPKT patients who 
are normally under thrombosis prophylaxis. 
A distinct approach, with more aggressive anticoagula- 
tion prophylaxis, has been suggested in PD patients, but it 
is not deﬁnitely established. Yet, the bleeding risk must be 
weighed. More studies clarifying the predisposing factors to 
thrombotic events in PD patients are needed, in order to 
design an effective prophylaxis against thrombosis. 
While some authors reported similar abdominal infec- 
tion rates in PD and HD patients [16,17], there are several 
others reporting higher incidence of peritonitis in PD 
patients [18,19,28]. Manipulation of the peritoneal cathe- 
ter, communicating with the skin and the external environ- 
ment, is the major cause for peritonitis in PD patients. 
Whether this catheter remains colonized by microbial 
agents due to bioﬁlm formation, even without overt infec- 
tion, is a real possibility [16]. However, the cultured agents 
from the drainage are frequently diverse (gram negative) 
from those more often cultured during peritonitis episodes 
(gram positive) in PD patients [16], as we also observed. In 
SPKT, there are other confounding factors, such as the sur- 
gery procedure itself and the opening of the small bowel to 
perform duodenal anastomosis. 
Fluid collections, as well as vascular catheters or surgical 
drains, contribute to the risk of infection. Some degree of 
persistent ascites after PD catheter removal is frequently 
observed, representing chronic and remarkable changes in 
peritoneal membrane [29]. Important volume drainage 
leads to the maintenance of the surgical drain for more 
days, as we observed in our PD group, again increasing the 
risk of infection. In our practice, PD catheter is always 
removed at the beginning of SPKT procedure and residual 
ascites cultured. The abdominal drainage is repeatedly cul- 
tured while it remains important and the drain maintained, 
being removed as soon as possible when drainage amylase 
decreases and microbiological analysis is sterile. However, 
prophylactic antibiotics may need to be extended in 
patients with more prolonged drain patency. 
Fibrosis and peritoneal thickening following PD [30] 
may adversely affect peritoneal and intestinal healing after 
the surgery, contributing to increased technical difﬁculty 
and to the rate of leak and infection [16]. Graft pancreatitis 
and duodenal 
importance for 
leak are of paramount 
abdominal cavity infection occurrence [31]. Abdominal 
surgical re-exploration, 
in immunosuppressed patients, 
represents another risk factor for infectious complications 
and for adverse graft outcomes [23], 
leading to an 
enhanced rate of transplantectomy [20]. 

completely clear. Enhanced plasmatic activities of procoag- 
ulant factors [25] and hemoconcentration [26] were men- 
tioned as being more likely to occur in PD than in HD 
patients. Robertson et al. [12] showed that the addition of 
low-dose aspirin was beneﬁcial in reducing the rate of VT 
in KTA patients. Additionally, impaired ﬁbrinolysis caused 
by increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1) levels is linked with insulin resistance that occurs 
with uremia and might be exacerbated in certain PD 
patients [27]. 
Concerning the prevention of pancreas graft thrombosis, 
one recent study reported potential beneﬁcial effects with 
low-dose heparin started in the early postoperative period 
(in association with aspirin), at the expense of a higher 
number of relaparotomies [21]. Others have found better 
results using lower molecular-weight heparin and con- 
cluded that this prophylaxis strategy might not be inferior 
to the one using dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated 
heparin [22]. 
PD population usually includes patients with vascular 
access problems, possibly due to a pre-existing prothrom- 
botic state in some of them—a selection bias that may help 
to explain higher rates of renal VT in PD patients [9]. The 
transplant center volume and professional skill can addi- 
tionally inﬂuence the results. Our transplant team for SPKT 
is restricted and has remained stable over the years, render- 
ing a bias from different technical skills of multiple sur- 
geons very unlikely. 
In this study, we observed a higher relaparotomy rate 
due to thrombosis and a near signiﬁcant higher rate of 
renal graft loss secondary to thrombosis, in PD patients. 
Only 2 patients had a previous renal transplant and none 
complicated with VT, albeit repeated transplantation is an 
established risk factor [9]; Hb level and chronic medication 




More intense immunosuppression used in SPKT, com- 
pared with KTA, also augments patient susceptibility for sev- 
eral types of infections. Our results demonstrated an increased 
rate of pancreas loss due to infection in PD patients. The 
length of admission and the acute rejection incidence, possible 
contributors to infection [15], cannot explain the higher 
infection rate in this group, given that they were similar 
between HD and PD patients. 
Other relevant clinical variables explaining our worse 
outcomes in PD patients were not identiﬁed: both groups 
had similar age, time of diabetes, acute rejection, and 
delayed graft function rates as well as comorbidities such as 
CVD. On the contrary, PD patients had a mean time on 
dialysis lower than HD patients, meaning they were early 
referred to SPKT, which is a positive aspect. Additionally, 
more patients were referred from PD centers in the more 
recent years, which explains the shorter follow-up after 
SPKT in the PD group. It has been reported that PD 
patients are more likely to receive a renal transplant [8], 
and less likely to evolve with delayed kidney graft function 
[8], a tendency also observed in our study. 
CVD and graft loss are unquestionable risk factors for 
patient death [32]. In our study, PD was a predictor of 
death, mainly due to infection and thrombosis. Should 
these results be conﬁrmed in further studies, then HD 
might be preferable for SPKT candidates, to optimize trans- 
plant outcome. Focused investigation is utterly needed as 
the risk of these complications after SPKT may be poten- 
tially modiﬁable with adjusted per-operatory infection and 
thrombosis prophylactic protocols.
