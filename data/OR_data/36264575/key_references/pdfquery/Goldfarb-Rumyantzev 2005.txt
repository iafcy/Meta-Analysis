● Background: The effect of pretransplantation renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality on allograft and recipient 
survival outcome is not well understood. Methods: We studied allograft and recipient survival by using US Renal 
Data System records from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999, with a follow-up period through December 31, 
2000 (n (cid:1) 92,844; 60% males; 70% white; 23% black). Pretransplantation and predominant RRT modality during the 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) period and number and speciﬁc combinations of RRT modalities were evaluated. 
Results: Compared with hemodialysis (HD), a Cox model showed that peritoneal dialysis (PD) immediately before 
transplantation predicts a 3% lower risk for graft failure (P < 0.05) and 6% lower risk for recipient death (P < 0.001). 
When predominant RRT modality was analyzed (modality used for > 50% of the ESRD time), PD (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.97; P < 0.05) had a protective effect for graft survival compared with HD. Better recipient survival also was 
associated with PD (HR, 0.96; P < 0.05). Increased number of RRT modalities during the ESRD course was 
associated with increased risk for graft failure (HR, 1.04 per additional modality used; P < 0.005) and recipient death 
(HR, 1.11 per additional modality used; P < 0.001). Any combination or any single modality (except for PD (cid:2) HD for 
graft survival and PD (cid:2) HD and PD (cid:2) HD (cid:2) transplantation for recipient survival) had protective effects on graft and 
recipient survival compared with HD. Conclusion: Our results suggest that compared with PD, HD as an RRT 
modality immediately before transplantation or as a predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course, used alone 
or in combination with other RRT modalities, is associated with increased risks for graft failure and recipient death. 
Increased number of RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is associated with worsening of graft and 
recipient survival. Am J Kidney Dis 46:537-549.

in transplant recipients 
compared with patients with end-stage renal dis- 
ease (ESRD) remaining on the waiting list,1 loss 
of the allograft terminates the patient survival 
beneﬁt.2 Recent improvement in immunosuppres- 
sion has reduced the incidence of acute rejection, 
but the effect on chronic allograft nephropathy 
and late graft loss has not been well shown in the 
literature.3 
Predictive factors of graft survival have been 
studied extensively in adults4,5 and children6,7 
based on data from the United Network for 
Organ Sharing and North American Pediatric 
Renal Transplant Cooperative Study. 
Donor and recipient age,8 preexisting donor 
hypertension and diabetes,9 non–heart-beating 
donor,10 prolonged cold storage time,11 retrans- 
plantation,12 multiple blood transfusions,13 and 
body mass index of donor and recipient,14 along 
with other factors, have important roles in graft 
outcome. However, the ESRD course itself (eg, 
the modality of renal replacement therapy [RRT], 
alone or in combination) as a predictor of graft 
and patient outcomes has not been well studied. 
Several studies suggested that pretransplantation 
dialysis modality had an impact on patient out- 
come.15-18 However, some reports did not show 
that long-term graft survival was affected by the 
modality of dialysis treatment.19,20 What is estab- 
lished is that increased time on dialysis therapy is 
associated with decreased survival of transplant 
recipients.20

The goal of the present project is to perform a 
retrospective analysis of US Renal Data System 
(USRDS) records to evaluate the role of renal 
replacement modalities, number of modalities 
used, and their combinations in allograft and 
recipient survival. 


Using the USRDS database, we collected data for all 
kidney allograft recipients (both pediatric and adults) who 
underwent kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation from 
January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1999. Follow-up 
data were collected through December 31, 2000. 
For recipients of multiple transplants, the most recent one 
was considered the target transplantation (transplant of inter- 
est). Patient records with missing information regarding 
graft or patient survival were excluded from the study. A 
total of 92,844 patients with a kidney transplant were identi- 
ﬁed. Records of patients with prior kidney transplants (n (cid:1) 
11,714) also were identiﬁed and analyzed separately. 

There are 2 outcomes in this study. The ﬁrst outcome is 
time between the most recent kidney transplantation and 
failure of the graft. The second outcome is time between the 
most recent kidney transplantation and patient death. Both 
outcomes were modeled by using continuous survival time 
variables. 
The graft failure deﬁnition did not include patient death 
with a functioning graft, the latter determined in the USRDS 
as a single binary variable. In case the value of this variable 
was missing and the patient’s death date was equal to the 
graft failure date, we assumed the patient died with a 
functioning graft unless the cause of death was coded as one 
of the following: 3200 (graft failure: primary failure), 3201 
(graft failure: rejection), 3202 (graft failure: technical), 3299 
(graft failure: other), or 3903 (miscellaneous: renal failure). 
Allograft outcome was censored at the earliest of the 
following events: loss to follow-up, patient death, or study 
completion date (December 31, 2000) and analyzed as days 
to graft failure or censor. Patient follow-up was censored at 
the earliest of loss to follow-up or study completion date and 
analyzed as day to recipient death or censor. 

The primary variables of interest were those pertinent 
to RRT from the USRDS database: RRT modality imme- 
diately before the current transplantation, predominant 
RRT modality during the ESRD course (deﬁned as modal- 
ity used for (cid:2)50% of the ESRD period; if none of the 
modalities were used for (cid:2)50%, the predominant modal- 
ity was labeled “none”), number of different RRTs used, 
combination of RRT modalities used (eg, peritoneal dialy- 
sis [PD] and hemodialysis [HD] and transplantation), and 
time course during the pretransplantation period that the 
patient was treated with a speciﬁc RRT modality. We 
deﬁned the use of a speciﬁc dialysis modality by using the 
“60-day rule,” the convention adopted by the USRDS 
stating that a dialysis modality must continue for at least 
60 days to be considered stable and therefore constitute a 
change in modality. 
The ﬁnal decision about which covariates to include into 
ﬁnal models was based primarily on known associations 
between variables that could cause confounding of the 
primary variables of interest; therefore, even variables with 
no signiﬁcant association with the outcome that were not 
selected by the stepwise regression, but were deemed to be 
clinically signiﬁcant or represent potential confounding, 
were included in the ﬁnal model. Results of the stepwise 
analysis were used only as a supportive tool. Covariates 
included a recipient comorbidity score that used cardiovascu- 
lar disease, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, diabe- 
tes mellitus, and hypertension (similar to the Davis comor- 
bidity index,21 but limited to the comorbid conditions listed 
that were collected at the time of transplantation); recipient 
variables (age, sex, race, height, weight, history of hyperten- 
sion, diabetes, history of prior transplant, total duration of 
ESRD, total number of transplants, panel reactive antibody 
levels [mean and peak], education level, primary source of 
renal care payment, and citizenship); donor variables (heart- 
beating donor or not, age, sex, race, height, weight, number 
of matched HLA antigens, and citizenship); and transplanta- 
tion procedure variables (day of the week for the procedure, 
season and year of the transplantation, and cold storage 
time). 
Other variables, delayed graft function, episodes of acute 
rejection, and type of immunosuppressive medications were 
not included in the models. Delayed graft function and acute 
rejection may represent intermediate outcome, rather than 
the confounding factor, and therefore we speculated that 
adjusting for it might yield false-negative results (type 2 
error: failure to reject null hypothesis). 
Patients with a prior history of kidney transplantation 
were analyzed separately and the following variables were 
added to the analysis: donor type for the transplantation 
immediately before the current transplantation, age at ﬁrst 
transplantation, age at ﬁrst graft failure, age at transplanta- 
tion immediately before the current transplantation and at 
graft failure immediately before the current transplantation, 
and time between last transplant failure and current transplan- 
tation. To reduce lead time bias, the models also were 
adjusted for total duration of ESRD. 

Categorical variables in the subgroups were compared 
by using cross-tabulation. Continuous variables were sum- 
marized by using means and SDs. Kaplan-Meier graphs 
and Cox regression models were used for survival analy- 
sis. To avoid collinearity between the primary variables of 
interest, we analyzed them in separate Cox models. SAS 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for survival analysis 
(Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models), 
whereas S-Plus (Insightful, Seattle, WA) was used for 
descriptive statistics and tree-based modeling for data 
imputation. 




The data set consisted of 92,844 records of 
patients receiving kidney or kidney-pancreas 
transplants starting January 1, 1990, and through 
December 31, 1999. Study population character- 
istics are listed in Table 1. Average age was 43.3 
years, and 60% were male. The graft failed 
during the 11 years of the study period in 34.9% 
of patients. We compared some baseline charac- 
teristics in patients on HD and PD therapy as a 
predominant pretransplantation modality. Aver- 
age ages were 44.8 (cid:3) 13.7 years in HD patients 
and 41.1 (cid:3) 15.1 years in PD patients (P (cid:4) 
0.001), comorbidity scores were 0.86 (cid:3) 0.81 in 
HD patients and 0.82 (cid:3) 0.78 years in PD patients 
(P (cid:4) 0.001), pretransplantation durations of 
ESRD were 2.63 (cid:3) 2.86 years in HD patients 
and 2.11 (cid:3) 1.96 years in PD patients (P (cid:4) 
0.001), total numbers of transplants before the 
current one were 1.08 (cid:3) 0.31 in HD patients and 
1.05 (cid:3) 0.25 in PD patients (P (cid:4) 0.001), and 
peak and mean panel reactive antibody levels 
were 12.01 (cid:3) 21.89 and 5.15 (cid:3) 14.83 for HD 
patients and 9.93 (cid:3) 19.47 and 4.15 (cid:3) 12.98 for 
PD patients, respectively (P (cid:4) 0.001 for both). 
Numbers of matched HLA antibodies between 
recipient and donor were 1.80 (cid:3) 1.52 in HD 
patients and 1.84 (cid:3) 1.54 in PD patients (P (cid:4) 
0.001). Finally, donor ages were 34.72 (cid:3) 15.64 
years in HD patients and 33.81 (cid:3) 15.41 years in 
PD patients (P (cid:4) 0.001). 
RRT Modality Immediately 
Before Transplantation 
The Cox model using HD as a reference showed 
the following results. Having a transplant immedi- 
ately before the transplantation of interest without 
dialysis therapy in between was associated with 
increased risk for graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 
1.65; P (cid:4) 0.001). PD as a modality immediately 
before transplantation predicts better graft outcome 
compared with HD (HR, 0.97; P (cid:4) 0.05; Table 2). 
A similar association was found in the subgroup of 
patients with a previous history of kidney transplan- 
tation: having the transplantation as an RRT modal- 
ity before the last transplantation without going on 
dialysis therapy in between poses a greater risk for 
graft failure (HR, 1.99; P (cid:4) 0.001) in this subgroup 
of patients (Table 3). The protective effect of PD 
therapy is not signiﬁcant in this patient subgroup. 
In the analysis of recipient survival in the Cox 
model using HD as a reference, both prior trans- 
plantation (HR, 0.80; P (cid:4) 0.005) and PD (HR, 
0.94; P (cid:4) 0.001) had a protective effect on 
recipient survival compared with HD. This asso- 
ciation was conﬁrmed again in the subgroup of 
patients who had prior transplants, although the 
difference between PD and reference (HD) pa- 
tients was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3). 

Predominant RRT modality, deﬁned as RRT 
modality used for more than 50% of the entire 
ESRD period, was analyzed in a Cox model in 
relation to graft survival; both PD (HR, 0.97; 
P (cid:4) 0.05) and transplantation (HR, 0.86; P (cid:4) 
0.001) had a protective effect for graft survival 
compared with HD. Absence of the predominant 
modality (each modality was used for (cid:4) 50% of 
the duration of ESRD or no RRT was used) also 
was associated with lower risk for graft failure 
(HR, 0.90; P (cid:4) 0.001; Table 2). These results 
were illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots (Fig 1A). 
In the Cox model, better recipient survival also 
was associated with both PD (HR, 0.96; P (cid:4) 
0.05) and transplantation (HR, 0.82; P (cid:4) 0.001) 
as predominant pretransplantation RRT modali- 
ties. Patients who had no predominant modality 
during the ESRD course also had better survival 
compared with HD, although the difference was 
not statistically signiﬁcant (HR, 0.921; P (cid:1) 
0.063). The worst patient outcome associated 
with HD is illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots 
(Fig 1B). The same trends for graft and recipient 
survival were found in the subgroup of patients 
with prior transplants (Table 3). 

We calculated the number of different RRT 
modalities that a patient was exposed to during 
the ESRD course by using the 60-day rule, in 
which the change in dialysis technique is con- 
sidered stable if the patient remained on a new 
modality for 60 or more days (the 60-day rule 
does not apply to transplantation). We ana- 
lyzed the Cox model and showed that number 
of RRT modalities is a signiﬁcant predictor of 
graft failure (HR, 1.04 per additional modality; 
P (cid:4) 0.001) and recipient death (HR, 1.11 per

NOTE. The Cox model represents multivariate analysis of graft and recipient survival. To avoid colinearity between the 
primary variables of interest, they were analyzed in separate Cox models. Only primary variables of interest are listed in the 
table. All models also were adjusted for the following covariates: recipient variables: age, sex, race, height, weight, history of 
hypertension, diabetes, comorbidity score, history of prior transplant, total duration of ESRD, total number of transplants, 
panel reactive antibody levels (mean and peak), education level, primary source of renal care payment, and citizenship; 
donor variables: heart-beating donor or not, age, sex, race, height, weight, number of matched HLA antigens, and 
citizenship; and transplant procedure variables: day of the week for the procedure, season and year of the transplantation, 
and cold storage time.

additional modality; P (cid:4) 0.001; Table 2). In 
the separate model in the subgroup of patients 
with prior transplants, number of modalities 
was not a signiﬁcant risk for graft failure, 
whereas it was for recipient death (HR, 1.09; P 
(cid:4) 0.005; Table 3). These associations are

NOTE. The Cox model represents multivariate analysis of graft and recipient survival. To avoid colinearity between the 
primary variables of interest, they were analyzed in separate Cox models. Only primary variables of interest are listed in the 
table. All models also were adjusted for the following covariates: recipient variables: age, sex, race, height, weight, history of 
hypertension, diabetes, comorbidity score, total duration of ESRD, total number of transplants, panel reactive antibody levels 
(mean and peak), education level, primary source of renal care payment, and citizenship; donor variables: heart-beating 
donor or not, age, sex, race, height, weight, number of matched HLA antigens, and citizenship; transplant procedure 
variables: day of the week for the procedure, season and year of the transplantation, and cold storage time; parameters of 
prior transplant(s): donor type for the transplant immediately before the current transplant, age at ﬁrst transplantation, age at 
ﬁrst graft failure, age at transplantation immediately before the current transplantation and at graft failure immediately before 
the current transplantation, and time between last transplant failure and current transplantation.

RRT modality. Similarly, 0 modality used be- 
fore transplantation was associated with the 
best recipient survival, but increased number 
of modalities greater than 1 does not affect 
recipient survival (Fig 2B). 

We considered 8 different combinations of 
RRT modalities during the ESRD course indepen- 
dent of the sequence and number of times a 
patient would return to a particular modality: PD

only, HD only, transplantation only, PD plus HD, 
PD plus transplantation, HD plus transplanta- 
tion, all 3 modalities, and none. We deﬁne combi- 
nations of RRT modalities by using the 60-day 
rule described. In the Cox model (HD only was 
used as a reference group), any combination or 
single modality (except for transplantation only, 
PD plus HD, and none) was better than HD only 
(Table 2). In particular, PD only was associated 
with an HR of 0.93 (P (cid:4) 0.001). PD plus HD and 
none were associated with a not statistically 
signiﬁcant greater risk. When patient survival 
was evaluated, modality combinations showing 
the signiﬁcant difference with the reference group 
(HD only) were PD only (HR, 0.90; P (cid:4) 0.001) 
and none (HR, 0.81; P (cid:4) 0.001) and also PD plus 
HD (HR, 1.10; P (cid:4) 0.001). When patients with 
prior transplants were analyzed separately com- 
pared with HD alone, PD alone was associated 
with lower risk for graft failure (HR, 0.60; P (cid:4) 
0.05); PD plus HD plus transplantation also was 
beneﬁcial (HR, 0.79; P (cid:4) 0.005), as well as HD 
plus transplantation (HR, 0.791; P (cid:4) 0.005; 
Table 3). When recipient survival was used as an 
outcome, PD plus transplantation (HR, 0.73; P (cid:4) 
0.05), HD plus transplantation (HR, 0.74; P (cid:4) 
0.005), and transplantation only (HR, 0.62; P (cid:4) 
0.0005) were associated with lower mortality 
risk. 

The Cox model discussed in this section was 
not adjusted for total duration of ESRD to avoid 
colinearity with the primary variables of interest. 
The duration of both dialysis modalities was 
associated with greater risk for graft failure. 


Fig 2. Number of differ- 
ent RRT modalities and (A) 
graft and (B) recipient sur- 
vival. Increased number of 
modalities is associated 
with worsening of graft sur- 
vival, and the best graft and 
recipient survival are asso- 
ciated with 0 RRT modali- 
ties (preemptive kidney 
transplantation). 
Each year of PD therapy is associated with an 
HR of 1.02 (P (cid:4) 0.005), and each year of HD 
therapy is associated with an HR of 1.02 (P (cid:4) 
0.001). Conversely, number of years with a func- 
tioning graft in the past had a protective effect on 
current graft survival (HR, 0.98; P (cid:4) 0.001). In 
the subgroup of patients with a prior transplant, 
the same trend is true, but the association be- 
tween duration of PD therapy and graft failure is 
not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 2). We per- 
formed the same analysis for recipient survival 
and showed similar associations. The longer the 
patient was on HD (HR, 1.05; P (cid:4) 0.0001) or PD 
therapy (HR, 1.04; P (cid:4) 0.005), the greater the 
risk for dying, whereas number of years with a 
prior transplant did not make a signiﬁcant differ- 
ence. Recipient survival in the subgroup of pa- 
tients with a prior transplant also was analyzed. 
Number of years on PD (HR, 1.05; P (cid:4) 0.005) or 
HD therapy (HR, 1.04; P (cid:4) 0.001) was associ- 
ated with greater risk for recipient mortality, 
whereas number of years with a functioning graft 
was not associated with a signiﬁcant change 
(Table 2). 

Prediction of renal transplant recipient and graft 
survival presents an important clinical tool, espe- 
cially in view of the growing shortage of renal 
transplants. Almost half the transplant recipients 
die with a functioning graft. In the rest, the allograft 
fails because of chronic renal allograft dysfunction. 
Although many risk factors are known (as de- 
scribed), the role of pretransplantation RRT modal- 
ity in both graft and patient survival was not clear 
from the literature. In general, prior studies compar- 
ing different RRT modalities in relation to transplan- 
tation outcome were based on small data sets16,22;

evaluated short-term, rather than long-term, out- 
come16,18,23,24; did not study combination of RRT 
modalities or were performed 10 to 20 years ago, 
before signiﬁcant changes in immunosuppressive 
regimens22-26; and most studies examined graft 
outcome only, not patient survival. In addition, 
most investigators evaluated the role of RRT modal- 
ity immediately before transplantation, rather than 
predominant modality, as a primary variable of 
interest. Patients who were on PD therapy for a 
number of years and were switched to HD therapy 
immediately before transplantation would be classi- 
ﬁed as HD in these studies, which introduced a 
signiﬁcant degree of misclassiﬁcation bias. As listed 
in Table 4, there is signiﬁcant discrepancy between 
RRT modality before transplantation and predomi- 
nant RRT modality in the USRDS data set. 
Previous studies of short-term transplantation 
outcome have yielded somewhat conﬂicting re- 
sults. A greater rate of early graft failure was 
associated with PD therapy, shown by27. In the 
report by Bleyer et al,18 the investigators evalu- 
ated delayed graft function after deceased donor 
transplantation based on dialysis modality imme- 
diately before and found an association between 
HD therapy and delayed graft function. Similar 
results were 
investiga- 
tors.16,17,27–29 Vanholder et al16 also showed the 
advantage of PD therapy for short-term outcome: 
patients on PD therapy had a reduced incidence 
of acute renal failure. PD therapy is recom- 
mended to be chosen as an initial modality in 
patients who plan kidney transplantation within 
2 to 3 years.30 

Although there was no association between 
dialysis modality and graft thrombosis in 1 re- 
port,31 several other studies reported an in- 
creased incidence of graft thrombosis associated 
with PD compared with HD.27,32-35 A greater 
rate of graft thrombosis in PD patients might 
occur because hypercoagulable states are not 
detected as readily in PD patients as in HD 
patients. A greater rate of acute rejection was 
associated with PD therapy16; however, in other 
reports, acute rejection rates were not different 
between patients on PD versus HD therapy be- 
fore transplantation.18,26,29,35 
PD was associated with a greater rate of post- 
transplantation infection compared with patients 
on HD therapy in some reports,36 but in others, 
infection rates between PD and HD patients were 
similar16,37 or lower in patients with pretransplan- 
tation PD therapy.38 
When long-term outcome (1 and 5 years) was 
studied, no difference between dialysis modali- 
ties was reported.26 Similarly, PD and HD showed 
similar 1-year outcome in a report by Donnelly et 
al24 in the mid-1980s. In a small case-control 
analysis, 1-year transplantation outcome in pa- 
tients on continuous ambulatory PD therapy was 
not signiﬁcantly different from that in HD pa- 
tients with similar clinical characteristics.22 Simi- 
lar long-term graft and patient survival was 
achieved independent of dialysis modality be- 
fore transplantation in a retrospective analysis of 
the ﬁrst cadaveric graft. Graft and patient sur- 
vival cases were identical in the HD and continu- 
ous ambulatory PD groups (5-year graft survival: 
continuous ambulatory PD, 67%; HD, 66%; 
5-year patient survival: continuous ambulatory 
PD, 88%; HD, 87%).25 
No difference in long-term outcome between 
patients treated with PD compared with HD was 
shown in other studies.23,29,39,40 Snyder et al27 
compared long-term transplant outcome between 
PD and HD patients and showed that, compared 


with pretransplantation HD, death-censored long- 
term graft failure was 15% greater in patients on 
PD therapy and short-term graft failure was 33% 
greater. Their analysis was based on 22,776 Medi- 
care beneﬁciaries with a kidney transplant. Com- 
pared with our analysis, the study by Snyder et 
al27 used a smaller number of patients and shorter 
follow-up (3 years), and some baseline character- 
istics of the study population were different from 
ours (pediatric patients and those with prior 
history of transplantation were excluded). Those 
investigators studied pretransplantation dialysis 
modality (based on a United Network for Organ 
Sharing form) adjusted for dialysis modality 
change as a binary variable, whereas we evalu- 
ated the role of both pretransplantation and pre- 
dominant dialysis modality, as well as number of 
modalities used and their combinations. 
In our study, compared with HD, PD therapy 
immediately before transplantation has a protec- 
tive effect on graft and recipient survival. Al- 
though the effect size associated with PD therapy 
is modest, we disprove previous reports claiming 
a greater long-term risk associated with PD 
therapy. We evaluated the role of predominant 
RRT modality during the ESRD course. PD, 
transplantation, and preemptive or very short- 
course dialysis therapy had a protective effect for 
graft and recipient survival. This approach again 
conﬁrmed an advantage for allograft and recipi- 
ent survival of PD over HD as a modality imme- 
diately before transplantation and as a predomi- 
nant modality during the ESRD course. Although 
statistically signiﬁcant, the effect size of dialysis 
modality is limited (HRs of 0.97 and 0.94 for 
graft and recipient survival for PD as an RRT 
modality immediately before transplantation and 
HRs of 0.97 and 0.96 for graft and recipient 
survival for PD as a predominant RRT modality 
compared with HD, respectively). For compari- 
son, the effect size of other predictors of graft 
and recipient survival evaluated in our analysis 
were as follows: recipient age (HR, 1.01; P (cid:4) 
0.001; HR, 1.04; P (cid:4) 0.001 per year of life for 
graft and recipient survival, respectively), recipi- 
ent history of diabetes (HR, 0.96; P (cid:1) 0.48; HR, 
1.11; P (cid:1) 0.107 for graft and recipient survival, 
respectively), recipient comorbidity score (HR, 
1.1; P (cid:4) 0.001; HR, 1.26; P (cid:4) 0.001 per unit 
increase in score for graft and recipient survival, 
respectively), living donor compared with de- 
ceased donor (HR, 0.68; P (cid:4) 0.001; HR, 0.67; 
P (cid:4) 0.001 for graft and recipient survival, respec- 
tively), donor age (HR, 1.01; P (cid:4) 0.001; HR, 
1.01; P (cid:4) 0.001 per year of life for graft and 
recipient survival, respectively), and number of 
HLA-matched antigens (HR, 0.94; P (cid:4) 0.001; 
HR, 0.96; P (cid:4) 0.001 per antigen matched for 
graft and recipient survival, respectively). 
Number of RRT modalities used during the 
ESRD course is a signiﬁcant predictor of graft 
failure and recipient death. Almost any single 
RRT modality or their combination was associ- 
ated with better graft and recipient outcome than 
HD only. 
The mechanism of the outcome observed in 
our analysis is not completely clear. Residual 
renal function that might be better preserved in 
patients on PD therapy may contribute to better 
preservation of kidney function after transplanta- 
tion.41 One can hypothesize that the degree of 
residual renal function is more important for 
graft and recipient outcome than either PD or HD 
modality. Unfortunately, we did not have informa- 
tion about residual renal function for the entire 
study population. Answering this question could 
be a subject of another research project. Further- 
more, body mass index and degree of hypervol- 
emia might be different in PD and HD patients 
and therefore confound results. The rate of post- 
transplantation infections associated with HD 
might be greater compared with PD.38 In addi- 
tion, there are some indications that HD mem- 
branes and vascular access might cause sensitiza- 
tion in transplant candidates.42 It has been shown 
that HD patients have elevated levels of natural 
killer cells43 and production of cytokines.44 Other 
immunologic differences might exist between 
HD and PD patients. It was postulated that PD 
modiﬁes the population of T-helper (TH) cells, 
with an increase in percentage of TH subtype 2 
(TH2) cells and normal percentage of TH1 cells.45 
TH2 cells produce interleukin 4 and interleukin 
10, which inhibit interferon (cid:2) secretion and cell 
immunity,46 and increased TH2 cell fraction may 
provide additional immunosuppression. 
Potential selection bias should be considered 
when interpreting results of this study. We specu- 
lated that the decision regarding dialysis modal- 
ity was made based on patient age, diabetic 
status, comorbidity, ability to learn the tech- 
nique, prior history of abdominal surgeries, dis- 


tance to the dialysis center, and status of the 
vascular access. Adjusting our multivariate mod- 
els for recipient age, diabetic status, comorbidity 
index, socioeconomic status (indicated by educa- 
tional level, primary source of pay for renal care, 
and citizenship), and duration of ESRD should 
considerably reduce the selection bias. We recog- 
nize that some factors not included in the models 
(eg, exhausted vascular access) might force selec- 
tion of the dialysis modality and confound re- 
sults. Although our models were adjusted care- 
fully for pertinent covariates, the HD and PD 
populations are different in our study, as well as 
in other reports. For example, it has been shown 
that PD patients are more likely to undergo 
transplantation than HD patients in the group of 
adults27 and, to a lesser extent, group of pediatric 
patients.47 One can speculate regarding the causes 
of this discrepancy, eg, demographic characteris- 
tics and potentially the more assertive personal- 
ity of PD patients versus HD patients might 
make them more aggressive in pursuing trans- 
plantation. In our study population, PD was a 
pretransplantation RRT modality in 21.8% and 
predominant RRT modality in 22.6% of patients, 
whereas in the dialysis population, PD patients 
comprise less than 15%.48 To explain this phe- 
nomenon, Snyder et al27 proposed that there is a 
perception among physicians that PD patients 
may be better candidates for transplantation16,30 
and therefore selection bias, in which potential 
transplantation candidates are more likely to be 
placed on PD therapy than HD. Other potential 
shortcomings should be considered in interpret- 
ing results of this retrospective data analysis. 
Retrospective analysis of a data registry shows 
the association (but not necessarily causative 
relationships) between the primary variables of 
interest and outcome. The sequence of PD and 
HD for patients receiving both has not been 
evaluated in this study and might be a subject of 
future research. 
In conclusion, our results suggest that com- 
pared with PD, HD as an RRT modality immedi- 
ately before transplantation or as a predominant 
RRT modality during the ESRD course, used 
alone or in combination with other RRT modali- 
ties, is associated with increased risk for graft 
failure and recipient death. Increased number of 
RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is 
associated with worsening of graft and recipient 
survival. PD is a reasonable choice of RRT and 
should not be avoided in transplantation candi- 
dates.
