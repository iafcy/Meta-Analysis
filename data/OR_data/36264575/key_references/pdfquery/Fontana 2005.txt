Delayed graft function (DGF) is a frequent complication of kidney transplanta- 
tion (KT) that may affect both short- and long-term graft outcome. It has been 
reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better 
recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. How- 
the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be 
ever, 
unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the 
potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric 
patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome 
parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pre- 
transplantation value [T1/2(SCr)], while DGF was deﬁned as a T1/2(SCr) >3 days 
after KT (n ¼ 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or 
DGF, this latter group showed a signiﬁcantly higher body weight (BW) on the 
day of KT (P ¼ 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P ¼ 0.005), warm ischemia 
time (WIT) (P ¼ 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and 
T1/2(SCr) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the ﬁrst 
24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and ﬂuid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate 
exponential correlation that was carried out between T1/2(SCr) and all the other 
variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R2 ¼ 
0.28 vs. R2 ¼ 0.04), BSA (R2 ¼ 0.29 vs. R2 ¼ 0.03), and SCr (R2 ¼ 0.51 vs. 
R2 ¼ 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T1/ 
2(SCr) as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold isc- 
hemia time (CIT) (P ¼ 0.027) but not PDM (P ¼ 0.195) reached signiﬁcance. 
In a Cox regression analysis carried out with T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable, 
neither CIT nor PDM gained signiﬁcance. This study suggests that PDM does 
not affect early graft function in pediatric kidney recipients. 

The need for dialysis and a delayed decrease of serum crea- 
tinine (SCr) are frequent complications of kidney trans- 
plantation (KT) 
[1,2]. A delay in recovery of graft 
function may persist for many months after KT, affecting 
graft survival [3,4]. Delayed graft function (DGF) may 
increase the risk for acute rejection (AR) in adult kidney 
recipients, and a combination of DGF and AR has been 
reported to cause a graft loss of up to 50% within the 
ﬁrst year after KT [5]. Moreover, DGF is able to decrease 
long-term survival of transplanted kidneys [6,7], and its 
negative impact on graft survival may be predicted by the 
evolution of SCr rather than by the need for dialysis [6]. 
Thus, the effort to identify the potential risk factors that 
impair the incidence and severity of DGF seems to be a 
remarkable target [8]. 
It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal 
dialysis (PD) was correlated with a better recovery of 
renal function and overall short-term graft outcome than 




hemodialysis (HD) in adult kidney recipients [8,9]. This 
ﬁnding may be related to a more stable ﬂuid status 
observed in adults patients submitted to PD [8]. How- 
ever, 
the impact of pretransplantation dialysis mode 
(PDM) on pediatric patients seemed to exert no clear 
effect on the graft outcome, suggesting the need for fur- 
ther investigation [10]. With this aim, 
in the present 
study the potential impact of PDM on the development 
of DGF was evaluated in a pediatric patient cohort. 

Patient selection criteria 
In our department, 257 pediatric patients underwent a 
ﬁrst KT from cadaveric donors between 1 June 1987 and 
30 September 2001. For this study, we preliminarily con- 
sidered only pediatric patients that were submitted to 
dialysis (PD or HD) for at least 3 months before KT, 
without switch from one dialysis modality to the other. 
Patient exclusion criteria were never-functioning grafts, 
acute renal failure (ARF) caused by vascular occlusion, 
obstructive nephropathy, biopsy-demonstrated hyperacute 
rejection, multiple-organ transplant, and incomplete pre- 
and/or post-transplantation data sets [8]. Following these 
criteria, clinical records of 174 pediatric patients (male/ 
female ¼ 97/77) were entered in the analyses. Kidney 
recipients were grouped for pretransplant dialysis (PD, 
n ¼ 79; HD, n ¼ 95) and early graft function. 

Pediatric kidney recipients enrolled in this study were in 
the following diagnostic categories: 
irreversible chronic 
renal failure (n ¼ 61; 35.05%), hereditary nephropathies 
(n ¼ 32; 18.39%), 
irreversible ARF (n ¼ 20; 11.49%), 
congenital disorders (n ¼ 18; 10.34%), metabolic disor- 
(n ¼ 3; 
ders 
tumors 
1.72%), 
requiring nephrectomy (n ¼ 1; 0.57%), other indications 
(n ¼ 30; 17.24%). 
(n ¼ 7; 4.02%), obstructive uropathies 
(n ¼ 2; 1.14%), 


The PDM (HD or PD) was chosen by each nephrology 
unit that had originally under treatment the pediatric 
patients in agreement with the dialysis modality decision 
guide originally proposed by Hamburger et al. [11]. 
Strong indications for PD included patient aged 0–5 years 
and obligate situations such as vascular access failure, 
congestive heart failure, and social situations (family pre- 
ference and living far from an in-center dialysis unit). The 
conditions where PD was preferred included age between 
6 and 16 years, bleeding diathesis, labile diabetes, chronic 
infections, needle anxiety, and active lifestyle. PD was not 
preferred for patients with obesity, multiple hernias, 
severe backache, multiple abdominal surgeries, impaired 
manual dexterity, blindness, 
less-than-ideal home situ- 
ation, and depression. Relative contraindications for PD 
included patients with severe malnutrition, multiple 
abdominal adhesions, ostomies, proteinuria >10 g/day, 
obstructive pulmonary disease, ascites, presence of a ven- 
triculo-peritoneal shunt, upper limb amputation with no 
help at home, poor hygiene, and dementia. PD is contra- 
indicated in patients with documented type II ultraﬁltra- 
tion failure, severe inﬂammatory bowel disease, active 
acute diverticulitis, abdominal abscess, active ischemic 
bowel disease, and severe active psychotic disorder/ 
marked intellectual disability. PD and HD have been 
equally preferred in patients with polycystic kidney dis- 
ease and diabetes mellitus [11]. 
Hemodialysis consisted of pressure–pressure monitored 
dialysis with bicarbonate dialysate. HD was carried out 
three times weekly, either with an unmodiﬁed cellulose 
membrane (cuprophane; Bellco-Sorin, Mirandola, Italy; 
Gambro 1.8L, Gambro, Lund, Sweden) or with a syn- 
thetic membrane (polysulfone; Bellco-Sorin). PD consis- 
ted in continuous exchanges of PD solution (at day: 
1000–1100 ml/m2; or at night, 1200–1400 ml/m2 in auto- 
mated PD). Patient hydratation during and immediately 
after KT was performed under guidance of central venous 
pressure and/or Swan-Ganz pulmonary wedge pressure. 
Furosemide was used to increase urine output if diuresis 
was below 1 ml/kg/h for more than 3 h. The immuno- 
suppressive drugs used in several combinations were 
methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg on day 0, 8 mg/kg on day 
1, 4 mg/kg on day 2, then prednisone 0.75 mg/kg on day 
3), cyclosporine A (4 mg/kg), FK506 (0.15 mg/kg/b.i.d.), 
and, starting from 1998, mycophenolate mofetil (300/ 
400 mg/m2). 

The following patient-related parameters were considered: 
age, BW on the day of KT, body weight gain (BWG) as 
the difference between BW on the day of KT and on day 
1 after KT, body mass index (BMI) calculated as [weight 
(kg)/height (m)2], body surface area (BSA) calculated fol- 
lowing the Mosteller formula [12], the total ﬂuid admin- 
istered during the ﬁrst 72 h after KT, urine volume (UV) 
collected by an indwelling bladder catheter in the ﬁrst 
24 hr after KT, early SCr measured on the day 1 after 
KT, the mean of central venous pressure (CVP) values 
continuously measured in the ﬁrst 24 h after KT. In addi- 
tion, pediatric patients were evaluated about virological 
assessment (CMV, EBV, HCV, anti-HBs) and the per- 
(£5 transfusions with 
forming of blood transfusions 




£2 units/transfusion) before KT. Cadaveric donor age, 
cold ischemia time (CIT), and warm ischemia time 
(WIT) were also collected. In view of the fact that actuar- 
ial graft and patients survival exceeded 90%, the primary 
outcome parameter was the days needed to reach a SCr 
level 50% below that before KT [T1/2(SCr)] [8]. ARF was 
deﬁned in the case of need for dialysis, while DGF was 
deﬁned as a T1/2(SCr) > 3 days after KT [8]. Patients 
undergoing dialysis after KT received HD even if they 
were on PD before KT. The need for post-transplant 
dialysis occurred in 21 patients with ARF, and in 10 
patients with DGF. Thirty patients had isolated DGF, 
without need for dialysis. 

Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation, median, conﬁdence interval (CI), lower quartile 
(LQ), and upper quartile (UQ). Categorical variables are 
expressed as the number of observations in each category 
[13], and analyzed for the difference between proportions 
from independent samples (expressed as a percentage) by 
chi-square test with Yates’ correction for continuity. Con- 
tinuous variables were compared by the Mann–Whitney 
test, univariate Pearson’s correlation and exponential 
regression. A series of multivariate regression analyses was 
carried out with T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable [8]. The 
forward stepwise method was used to evaluate the inde- 
pendent variables at each step, adding or deleting them 
from the models [14]. Survival analysis was carried out 
by using the Kaplan–Meier method, 
for 
curve comparison, and Cox regression, assuming T1/2(SCr) 
as the ‘time variable’. It should be noted that following 
this approach, relative risk (RR) >1 indicates a decreased 
risk for DGF, whereas RR <1 suggests an increased risk 

[8]. The statistical signiﬁcance was assumed at P < 0.05 
with a two-tailed null hypothesis. Statistical analyses were 
performed by using the software package statistica 6.1 
(StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA), MedCalc 7.5 (MedCalc Soft- 
ware, Mariakerke, Belgium), and a Cox regression calcula- 
tor by John Pezzullo (in http://members.aol.com/johnp71/ 
javastat.html). 


The overall pattern of continuous variables related to kid- 
ney recipients is shown in Table 1. The mean age of pedi- 
atric recipients was 14.47 ± 5.35 (Table 1), whereas the 
mean age of cadaveric donors was 13.84 ± 10.8 years 
(median 11.5; 95% CI from 12.22 to 15.46; LQ 7; UQ 
reached 
17). 
within the ﬁrst 3 days after KT. DGF was observed in 40 
patients (22.98%), and ARF in 26 patients (14.94%). No 
signiﬁcance was found in order to primary diseases of 
pediatric kidney recipients grouped for PDM (Table 2), 
as well as for virological assessment and the performing 
of blood transfusions before KT (Table 3). In the patients 
who received blood transfusions before KT, both DGF 
and ARF occurred in ﬁve cases each. 

After comparison of kidney recipients grouped for 
DGF, patients with DGF showed a signiﬁcantly higher 
BW (P ¼ 0.014), BSA (P ¼ 0.005), WIT (P ¼ 0.022), 
early post-transplant SCr 
and T1/2(SCr) 
(P < 0.001), whereas lower UV (P < 0.001) and ﬂuid load 
(P < 0.001) occurred (Table 4). No signiﬁcance was 
noted for BMI, CIT, BWG, and CVP (Table 4), as well as 
for residual renal function before KT expressed as creati- 
nine clearance (data not shown). In the ARF group (n ¼ 
26), higher values than in the normal kidney function 
group were found for SCr (P < 0.0001) and T1/2(SCr)

slope for BW, BSA, and SCr was around 53, 1.5, and 4 
respectively. 
A multivariate regression analysis was performed by 
entering T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable, and an organ 
preservation-related variable (CIT), 
the volume-related 
parameters (BWG, UV, ﬂuid load), and PDM as inde- 
pendent variables, following a forward stepwise method 
(Table 6). In model A (R2 ¼ 0.174; P < 0.001), in which 
CIT and the volume-related parameters were included, 
only CIT reached a statistical signiﬁcance (b ¼ 0.16; P ¼ 
0.022). When PDM was entered in the model, a slight 
increase in R2 was observed (0.182 vs. 0.174), although 
no signiﬁcance was noted for this variable (P ¼ 0.195). 
The b for CIT and dialysis mode did not show substantial 
changes when alternatively one of the three volume-rela- 
ted parameters was excluded from the model (Table 6, 
model C without UV; model D without BWG; model E 
without ﬂuid load). In each model, CIT but not PDM 
reached statistical signiﬁcance, suggesting that only CIT 
was a predictor for T1/2(SCr), independently of volume- 
related parameters. Conversely, although ﬂuid load and 
UV reached respectively statistical signiﬁcance when the 
either variable was alternatively excluded (model C and E, 
they lost any signiﬁcance when simulta- 
P < 0.0001), 
neously included in the other models. No statistical sig- 
niﬁcance was observed by testing other regression models 
that 
included volume-related parameters and variables 
such as BW, BSA, and WIT (data not shown).

Conversely, PDM was far from statistical signiﬁcance 
(b ¼0.18; P ¼ 0.548), although RR >1 was noted. In 
model B (v2 ¼ 6.60; P ¼ 0.158), in which the UV was 
left out, CIT showed an increased P-value (P ¼ 0.192), 
with only a minimal change in b ()0.05 vs. )0.04). In 
the other models, no signiﬁcance was found for CIT or 
volume-related parameters when one of these latter was 
left out (data not shown). 

A delay in functional recovery of transplanted kidneys 
may negatively affected short- and long-term graft out- 
come [3,4,7]. Pretransplantation PD was reported to 
inﬂuence positively the recovery of renal function after 
KT in adult recipients [8,9], and it was hypothesized that 
ﬂuid status might be implicated in this ﬁnding [8]. On 
the contrary, in patients over 60 years of age the long- 
term use of PD (>2 years) has been associated with 
increased mortality rates, irrespective of diabetic status or 
gender [15]. In pediatric patients, PD is strongly indica- 
ted for children aged 0–5 years, and should be preferred 
for those aged 6–16 years [11,16]. However, pretransplan- 
tation dialysis resulted to exert no clear effect on the graft 
outcome in pediatric kidney recipients [10], suggesting 
the need for further investigation. Theoretically, the most 
suitable approach to evaluate the effect of PDM on KT 
outcomes would be a prospective study. However, as 
Termorshuizen et al. [15] argued, conducting such a 
study in patients with end-stage renal diseases could be 
regarded as extremely difﬁcult, because of advantages and 
disadvantages associated with PDM choice for individual 
patients. Therefore, we retrospectively analysed pretrans- 
plantation PDM to evaluate its potential effects on early 
graft function in a cohort of pediatric patients, following 
rigorous patient selection criteria. HD or PD was chosen 
by each nephrology unit that had originally under treat- 
ment the pediatric patients, in agreement with the dialysis 
modality decision guide proposed by Hamburger et al. 
[11]. Although PD is the preferred dialysis treatment for 
children, a cross-sectional survey study has demonstrated 
that specialization of clinicians is able to inﬂuence treat- 
ment recommendations for children and adolescents with 
end-stage renal disease, being pediatric nephrologists 
more likely than adult nephrologists to recommend PD 
for identical patients [17]. In our patients, a strict link 
between pediatrics, nephrologists 
and surgeons has 
allowed the optimization of dialysis choice. Patients that 
switched from one dialysis modality to the other before 
KT were excluded from this study, differently from other 
series that enrolled patients treated with both PD and HD 
[18]. We adopted this exclusion criteria to obtain a more 
rigorous comparison between PD and HD. Considering 
that in our series both patient and graft survival exceeded 
90%, T1/2(SCr) was assumed as the primary outcome 
parameter, in agreement with Van Biesen et al. [8]. Dif- 
ferently from the study performed by Van Biesen’s group 
on adult kidney recipients [8], we made speciﬁc evalua- 
tion in pediatric patients for primary diseases, virological 
assessment and blood transfusions before KT. We did not 
ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences by grouping these parameters 
for PDM. Notably, almost all of our patients were EBV+, 
CMV+, and HCV), without occurrence of anti-HBs+. 
Although blood transfusions before KT might have a pos- 
itive effect in pediatric patients who received £5 transfu- 
sions [19], in our series only 17 patients received blood 
transfusions before KT, according to conservative transfu- 
sion policy adopted in southern Europe during the last 
decade [20]. 
In our series, although T1/2(SCr) was reached relatively 
earlier in pediatric patients who underwent PD, no sig- 
niﬁcant difference was observed after comparison of this 
time variable for PDM, in contrast with previous ﬁnd- 
ings in adult kidney recipients [6,8]. As expected, 
in 
both ARF and DGF patients an unfavourable difference 
for UV, ﬂuid load, SCr, and T1/2(SCr) was noted by com- 
paring them with patients who had no impaired post- 
transplant outcomes. The univariate correlation analysis 
for the continuous variables showed no signiﬁcant rela- 
tionship between ﬂuid load and BWG or CVP, as previ- 
ously reported for adult kidney recipients 
[8]. By 
performing exponential correlation between T1/2(SCr) and 
all 
the other continuous variables, we found a better 
value than the linear correlation for BW, BSA, and SCr. 
Interestingly, we did not observe signiﬁcance in the 
exponential correlation for CIT, in contrast with previ- 




ous ﬁndings in adult kidney recipients [8]. However, in 
a multivariate regression analysis that we carried out fol- 
lowing a forward stepwise method, CIT resulted in all 
models as a predictor for T1/2(SCr), independently from 
volume-related parameters. Conversely, although in some 
regression models UV and ﬂuid load contributed to 
T1/2(SCr), 
these variables were intermutually related, as 
resulted by the lack of signiﬁcance when both UV and 
ﬂuid load were entered in the same regression models. 
Notably, PDM did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in 
any multivariate regression model, 
suggesting a poor 
impact of this parameter on DGF in pediatric kidney 
recipients. On the contrary, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcance 
neither by a simple comparison of the PD versus HD 
patients within ARF or DGF groups, differently from a 
signiﬁcantly higher rate of DGF reported in HD adult 
patients [18]. Finally, in the Cox regression analysis UV 
and ﬂuid load conﬁrmed their intermutual relationship, 
whereas CIT did not reach signiﬁcance. 

Our ﬁndings in pediatric patients did not conﬁrm the 
results reported by Van Biesen et al. [8] in adult kidney 
recipients, where PDM revealed to be an independent 
predictor for T1/2(SCr). In that study, performed on 119 
patients, 
lower, and the 
authors suggested that their ﬁnding may be the result of 
a short CIT, being CIT median and UQ values in DGF 
and no-DGF group 22 and 30 h versus 19 and 23 h, 
respectively [8]. However, these CIT values, that did not 
reach full statistical signiﬁcance after intergroup com- 
parison [8], do not seem to diverge from those repor- 
ted in a study population carried out on the United 
States Renal Data System (USRDS), in which an overall 
CIT of 20.4 ± 8.5 h was observed in 13 486 adult renal 
transplant recipients [21]. In our series, the overall CIT 
value (15.23 ± 3.57 h) was lower than in the USRDS, 
and no signiﬁcant difference for this parameter occurred 
between DGF and no-DGF group. Although earlier stud- 
ies demonstrated that CIT may play a critical role on 
transplanted kidney outcome [22,23], and even if we 
found that CIT resulted in multivariate 
regression 
models as an independent predictor for T1/2(SCr), we 
failed to conﬁrm a statistical signiﬁcance for CIT in both 
exponential correlation and Cox regression models. Our 
short CIT supported these ﬁndings, differently from the 
results of Van Biesen et al. [8], where their longer CIT 
had a strong impact on the graft outcome in all analy- 
ses. Considering that a high incidence of DGF may be a 
product of long CIT [8], our results seem to substantiate 
that the evaluation of PDM impact on graft outcome 
has not been overwhelmed. Otherwise from ﬁndings 
reported in adult patients, this study suggests that PDM 
does not affect early graft function in pediatric kidney 
recipients.
