A comparison of transplant outcomes in peritoneal and hemo- 
dialysis patients. 
Background. Studies examining the effect of pre-transplant 
dialysis modality on graft and patient survival after kidney 
transplantation have produced conﬂicting results. Therefore, 
we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on 
outcomes in a large United States cohort. 
Methods. We compared rates of transplantation between 
peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 
1995 to 1998 in the United States (N (cid:1) 252,402) and outcomes 
after transplantation (N (cid:1) 22,776), using data from the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Results. In a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was ad- 
justed for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation 
was 1.39 (95% CI (cid:1) 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal 
dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P (cid:2) 0.0001). Over the entire 
follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft 
failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis 
vs. hemodialysis (P (cid:2) 0.05), but mortality and overall graft 
failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality 
did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a func- 
tioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox 
analyses restricted to the ﬁrst 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was 
associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early 
graft failure (P (cid:2) 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher 
risk for death-censored graft failure (P (cid:2) 0.001). Peritoneal 
dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence 
of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with 
data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more 
commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal 
dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis pa- 
tients, 30% (106/349), P (cid:2) 0.05. 
The role of pre-transplant dialysis modality in affect- 
ing transplant outcomes has been the subject of long- 
standing interest. Recent studies have reported that peri- 
toneal dialysis is associated with a lower incidence of 
post-transplant delayed graft function (DGF) compared 
to hemodialysis [1–5]. On the other hand, there have 
been reports that patients receiving peritoneal dialysis 
are more likely to have graft thrombosis compared to 
patients treated with hemodialysis [6–9]. Most previous 
studies have reported that graft survival is not affected 
by the modality of dialysis treatment prior to transplanta- 
tion [2, 9–14]. However, many of these studies were 
small, had a limited number of factors that were ad- 
dressed in the analysis and may have lacked adequate 
statistical power to determine whether dialysis treatment 
modality is independently associated with graft survival. 
Fundamental to assessing the relationship between di- 
alysis modality and post-transplant outcomes is the likeli- 
hood of receiving a renal transplant based on the choice 
of peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis as the initial treat- 
ment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the num- 
ber of factors that may be associated with the transplant 
process are considerable, we chose to study a large cohort 
of United States ESRD patients with information not 
only on their dialysis treatment period but also their 
proﬁle of transplant donor and recipient characteristics. 
This report summarizes our ﬁnding from data supplied 
by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS). 
Conclusions. Kidney transplantation is more frequent in peri- 
toneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplanta- 
tion in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated 
with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was 
less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential 
beneﬁt appears to be offset by other factors which are associated METHODS 
with early graft loss. Additional studies are needed to determine 
what factors may help understand this early risk of graft failure. 

Key words: kidney transplantation, delayed graft function, allograft 
survival, graft thrombosis.

We included Medicare beneﬁciaries who (1) were 18 
years old or older, (2) ﬁrst started therapy for ESRD 
between 1995 and 1998, and (3) had been on the same 
dialysis modality (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) 
for at least 60 days on day 90 of ESRD therapy [N (cid:1) 
252,402; hemodialysis (cid:1) 219,240 (87%); and peritoneal 
dialysis (cid:1) 33,162 (13%)]. In our study of the effects of 



dialysis modality on outcomes after kidney transplanta- 
tion, we included those patients described above who 
received a kidney-only transplant and had no prior his- 
tory of other organ transplantation (N (cid:1) 22,776). 

To determine the relative likelihood of peritoneal dial- 
ysis vs. hemodialysis patients to receive a kidney trans- 
plant, we used Cox proportional hazards analyses with 
kidney transplantation occurring before November 30, 
2000, as the end point. In two separate analyses we used 
both “intent-to-treat” based on dialysis modality on day 
90, and “on treatment” with patients censored at a change 
in dialysis modality (change of at least 60 days) or if lost 
to follow-up. For both of these analyses, patients were 
censored at death. These analyses were adjusted for age, 
gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity, year of ESRD initiation, 
body size measured as body surface area (BSA) calcu- 
lated from height and weight [15], obesity deﬁned as 
body mass index (BMI) greater than 29 kg/m2, estimated 
baseline glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) at dialysis initi- 
ation (as calculated from serum creatinine, age, gender, 
and race), diabetes as primary cause of renal failure, 
ability to work, and baseline co-morbidities. Baseline 
co-morbidities were determined from the CMS Medical 
Evidence Form (Form 2728, End-Stage Renal Disease 
Medical Evidence Report Medicare Entitlement and/or 
Patient Registration). Co-morbidities included cardio- 
vascular disease (congestive heart failure, ischemic heart 
disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiac 
dysrhythmia, and pericarditis), peripheral vascular dis- 
ease (PVD), and hypertension. In the end, both the “in- 
tent-to-treat” and “on treatment” analyses gave similar 
results, and therefore only the “intent-to-treat” results 
are presented. 
To determine the effect of pre-transplant dialysis mod- 
ality on graft survival, three different approaches were 
used: (1) the dialysis modality was determined on day 
90 of ESRD care and patients were assumed to be on 
this modality until the time of transplantation (similar 
to intent-to-treat); (2) for patients switching modality 
more the 60 days prior to transplantation and for a period 
of no less than 60 days, the new modality was taken as 
the pre-transplant dialysis modality; and (3) the pre- 
transplant dialysis modality was determined from the 
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Transplant 
Recipient Registration Form at the time of transplant. 
In the event this information was missing from the UNOS 
form, the last known modality based on Medicare data 
was used. In the end, the results did not differ signiﬁ- 
cantly between these three approaches, and therefore 
only the results from the third approach are presented. 
Separate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used 
to assess the relative risk of pre-transplant peritoneal 
dialysis vs. hemodialysis on patient survival, graft failure, 
including death, and return to dialysis or re-transplant 
(death-censored graft failure). Models were adjusted for 
dialysis exposure time, dialysis modality switch (whether 
a patient had switched modalities prior to transplanta- 
tion), the year of transplantation, gender, race, age at time 
of transplantation, Hispanic ethnicity, body size (BSA), 
obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more), baseline GFR, base- 
line co-morbidity, education level, ability to work, human 
lymphocyte antigens (HLA) mismatches, donor type, do- 
nor gender, donor age, donor race, panel reactive antibody 
(PRA), and cold ischemia time. Due to non-proportion- 
ality of the hazards over time, additional Cox models 
were run on outcomes in the ﬁrst 3 months post-transplant 
and conditional graft loss following the ﬁrst 3 months. All 
analyses used SAS version 8.2 (Cary, NC, USA). 


During the follow-up period, a greater proportion of 
peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients received a 
kidney transplant (Fig. 1). By 1, 3, and 5 years after 
starting dialysis for ESRD, the proportions of peritoneal 
dialysis and hemodialysis patients receiving a kidney 
transplant (by Kaplan-Meier analysis) were 9.2% (95% 
CI (cid:1) 8.8 to 9.5%) vs. 3.8% (3.7 to 3.9%), 23.6% (23.0 
to 24.1%) vs. 10.9% (10.7 to 11.0%), and 31.7% (30.9 
to 32.6%) vs. 15.7% (15.5-16.0%), respectively. Simi- 
larly, in unadjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, 
the relative likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant 
was 2.34 (2.28 to 2.41, P (cid:2) 0.0001) times greater for 
peritoneal dialysis than for hemodialysis patients. How- 
ever, most of this difference can be explained by differ- 
ences in the patients selected for peritoneal dialysis and 
hemodialysis. Indeed, after adjustments were made for 
differences in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis pa- 
tients, the relative likelihood of receiving a kidney trans- 
plant was only 1.39 (1.35 to 1.43, P (cid:2) 0.0001) times 
greater for peritoneal dialysis than for hemodialysis pa- 
tients (Table 1). 
The difference in the likelihood of transplantation be- 
tween peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients does 
not appear to be a result of differences in the likelihood 
of making it to the waiting list for cadaveric renal trans- 
plantation. In this population, 87% of hemodialysis pa- 
tients were listed and 86% of peritoneal dialysis patients 
were listed ((cid:3)2 P (cid:1) 0.4669). When only considering pa- 
tients who received a cadaveric transplant, 99.8% of both 
hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients had been 
listed ((cid:3)2 P (cid:1) 0.8018). Similarly, for patients who went 
on to receive a living donor transplant, 59% of both 
hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients had been 
listed ((cid:3)2 P (cid:1) 0.9877).

Pre-transplant dialysis modality was associated with 
differences in outcomes after transplantation. There 
were 5621 (25%) patients on peritoneal dialysis and 
17,155 (75%) patients on hemodialysis prior to trans- 
plantation. In unadjusted (Kaplan-Meier) analysis, mor- 
tality was less for those treated with peritoneal dialysis 
vs. hemodialysis (Fig. 2A), death-censored graft failure 
was more frequent for peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialy- 
sis patients (Fig. 2C), and there was no difference in 
overall graft failure in patients treated with peritoneal 
dialysis vs. hemodialysis (Fig. 2B). However, using a Cox 
proportional hazards model to adjust for multiple risk 
factors, peritoneal dialysis patients had similar rates of

death and graft failure, but a 15% increased risk of death- 
censored graft failure (Table 2). 
Most of the risk attributable to pre-transplant dialysis 
modality was manifest in the ﬁrst 3 months following 
transplantation (Fig. 2 B and C). In Cox proportional 
hazards analyses adjusted for multiple risk factors, but 
restricted to the ﬁrst 3 months of follow-up, peritoneal 
dialysis was clearly associated with a higher risk for graft 
failure and death-censored graft failure, but not mortal- 
ity (Table 3). On the other hand, in adjusted Cox analyses 
that included only patients whose grafts functioned for 
at least 3 months, there was little effect of dialysis mod- 
ality on outcomes, emphasizing that the increased risk 
in the peritoneal dialysis population occurs early in the 
post-transplant period (Table 3). 
The cause of graft failure was investigated for patients 
whose grafts failed within the ﬁrst 3 months post-trans- 
plant. Data on the cause of graft failure were available 
for only 1030 (33%) of hemodialysis patients and 401 
(38%) of peritoneal dialysis patients on the UNOS trans- 
plant recipient and follow-up forms. Of all of the causes 
examined, only graft thrombosis was more frequent in 
peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients [odds ratio (cid:1) 
1.59 (1.08 to 2.36), P (cid:1) 0.0192, Table 4]. 

We used logistic regression analysis to examine the 
associated role of dialysis modality on the incidence of 
delayed graft function (DGF), deﬁned by the need for 
dialysis during the ﬁrst week after transplantation. 
Among hemodialysis patients, 16% of patients had DGF, 
while only 12% of peritoneal dialysis patients had DGF. 
Pre-transplant peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 
lower risk for DGF, with the odds ratio (peritoneal dial-

0.0001) after adjustment for multiple covariates. For pa- 
tients whose graft survived at least 7 days, DGF was 
associated with a 2.8 (2.2 to 3.6, P (cid:2) 0.0001) times greater 
risk of death, a 2.9 (2.6 to 3.4, P (cid:2) 0.0001) times greater 
risk of graft failure, and a 2.9 (2.5 to 3.5, P (cid:2) 0.0001) times 
greater risk of death-censored graft failure, regardless of 
pre-transplant dialytic modality. The observed increased 
risk of graft failure and death-censored graft failure in 
the peritoneal dialysis population in the ﬁrst 3 months 
post-transplant is present despite the apparent beneﬁcial 
effects of a lower incidence of DGF in the peritoneal 
dialysis population. 

In our analysis, peritoneal patients were approxi- 
mately 50% more likely to undergo kidney transplanta- 
tion compared to hemodialysis patients. Few others have 
compared the rates of transplantation for peritoneal and 
hemodialysis patients. More than a decade ago, Held et 
al found that the rate of transplantation among 3393 
children was similar, albeit slightly higher, for peritoneal 
dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients [16]. These investiga- 
tors did not examine the rates of transplantation among 
adult peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients. 
We cannot discern from our analysis why peritoneal 
dialysis patients were more likely to receive a kidney trans- 
plant compared to hemodialysis patients. While many 
of the factors associated with increased transplant utiliza- 
tion may be more represented in the peritoneal dialysis 
population, the difference in transplant utilization per- 
sisted after adjusting the analysis for differences in pa- 
tient characteristics (Table 1). There may be a perception 
among patients and their physicians that peritoneal dial- 
ysis is the dialysis treatment modality of choice for trans- 
plant candidates [3, 17]. If placement of a peritoneal 
dialysis catheter is thought to cause less morbidity and 
mortality than placement of a hemodialysis access, then 
peritoneal dialysis may be selected more often than he- 
modialysis when it is perceived to be a better short-term 
bridge to kidney transplantation. On the other hand, if 
there is a perception that hemodialysis offers better long- 
term dialysis treatment, then patients less likely to un- 
dergo transplantation may be selected for hemodialysis 
more often than peritoneal dialysis. In any case, it is 
plausible that the observed difference in the likelihood 
for peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients to receive 
a kidney transplant could be due to a selection bias, 
whereby transplant candidates were more likely to be 
placed on peritoneal dialysis than hemodialysis. 
An important and surprising ﬁnding in this study is 
the higher rate of early graft failure in peritoneal dialysis 
compared to hemodialysis patients even after adjusting 
for multiple patient characteristics that may also inﬂu- 
ence outcomes. Most other studies have reported that 


pre-transplant dialysis modality has no effect on patient 
or graft survival [2, 9–14]. Similarly, most investigators 
found no difference in the rates of acute rejection in 
peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis [2, 4, 9, 13]. However, 
Vanholder et al reported a greater number of peritoneal 
dialysis patients developed acute rejection after trans- 
plantation compared to hemodialysis [3]. Most of these 
studies were smaller than the current investigation, and 
the investigators did not separately examine the effects 
of dialysis modality on short-term and long-term graft 
survival. This is an important issue since the hazard func- 
tions are not proportional over time. As a result, it is 
not surprising that others did not ﬁnd the association 
between dialysis modality and early graft failure that we 
report here. 
We could not determine how pre-transplant dialysis 
modality inﬂuenced early post-transplant graft failure. 
The result seems unlikely to be explained by a higher 
rate of infection in peritoneal dialysis patients, since this 
would be expected to have a greater effect on mortality 
than death-censored graft failure. In addition, previous 
studies comparing the rates of post-transplant infections 
between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients 
have produced conﬂicting results. Passalacqua et al found 
a higher incidence of infection in the ﬁrst 30 days post- 
transplant, and this higher rate of infection was associ- 
ated with rejection and longer hospital stays [18]. Binaut 
et al reported no overall difference in bacterial infec- 
tions, but a higher rate of sepsis was seen in peritoneal 
dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients [2]. Others have found 
no difference in the rate of post-transplant infections in 
peritoneal vs. hemodialysis patients [3, 19]. Still others 
have reported that hemodialysis patients have a higher 
rate of infections after transplantation [20]. Thus, it 
seems unlikely that a higher rate of infection in perito- 
neal dialysis patients could explain the association be- 
tween dialysis modality and early graft failure. 
In a subset of about one third of patients with data 
on the cause of graft failure, graft thrombosis was more 
common in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients 
(Table 4). Graft thrombosis has also been reported by 
others to be more common in peritoneal dialysis vs. 
hemodialysis patients [6–9]. Indeed, we found only one 
study that examined the incidence of graft thrombosis 
and failed to ﬁnd a difference in peritoneal dialysis vs. 
hemodialysis patients [21]. Thus, it is likely that early 
graft thrombosis contributed to the higher rate of early 
graft failure associated with pre-transplant peritoneal 
dialysis. However, our results should be interpreted cau- 
tiously, given that the large proportion of missing data 
on the cause of graft failure could bias the results. 
We found that DGF is less common in patients treated 
with peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis pre-transplant. 
This ﬁnding is consistent with those of others [1–5]. One 
explanation for a lower rate of DGF in peritoneal dialysis 
vs. hemodialysis patients is the possibility that residual 
native kidney function is better preserved in peritoneal 
dialysis than in hemodialysis [22–24]. The reduced early 
graft survival associated with peritoneal dialysis com- 
pared to hemodialysis is all the more remarkable given the 
lower incidence of DGF in peritoneal dialysis patients. 
We attempted to determine which dialysis modality 
patients with DGF were treated with by searching Medi- 
care Part B claims within 1 month of the transplant date. 
In this study population, DGF was indicated for 3533 
patients. Claims could only be reliably searched for 2626 
of these patients for whom Medicare appeared to be 
the primary payer. Of these patients, we were able to 
determine which modality patients were treated with 
for 1925 (73%) patients. For the 351 peritoneal dialysis 
patients, 166 (47%) were treated with peritoneal dialysis 
following transplantation. In the 1574 hemodialysis pa- 
tients, 1551 (99%) were treated with hemodialysis fol- 
lowing transplantation. These differences suggest it is 
possible that the effects of pre-transplant dialysis mod- 
ality on early graft failure may have been inﬂuenced by 
the effects of dialysis modality during DGF. Few studies 
have examined the effects of dialysis modality on the 
pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressive agents. In a re- 
cent study, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mo- 
fetil, mycophenolic acid, was found to be readily removed 
by peritoneal dialysis [25]. Thus, it is possible that rejec- 
tion rates in patients with DGF could be indirectly inﬂu- 
enced by pre-transplant dialysis modality, if levels of 
immunosuppressive medications are altered. More work 
in this area is needed to determine the possible risk factors 
and the associated complications post-transplant that 
may be amenable to interventions. 

In summary, this analysis demonstrated that the rate 
of transplantation is higher in patients treated with peri- 
toneal dialysis compared to patients treated with hemo- 
dialysis, and this difference could not be entirely explained 
by differences in the two patient populations. Interest- 
ingly, the rate of early, but not late, graft failure was higher 
in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis compared to 
hemodialysis prior to transplantation. Although we can- 
not determine the cause of this associated higher rate 
of graft failure, an analysis of a subset of patients with 
data on the cause of graft failure suggested that a higher 
rate of graft thrombosis might have contributed. Addi- 
tional studies are needed to better understand the slightly 
higher rate of early graft failure in the peritoneal dialysis 
population.
