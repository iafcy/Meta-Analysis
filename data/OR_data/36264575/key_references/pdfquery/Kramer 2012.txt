Abstract 
Background. Previous studies have found inconsistent 
associations between pre-transplant dialysis modality and 
subsequent post-transplant survival. We aimed to examine 
this relationship using the instrumental variable method 
and to compare the results with standard Cox regression. 
Methods. We included 29 088 patients (age >20 years) 
from 16 European national or regional renal registries 
who received a ﬁrst kidney transplant between 1 January 
1999 and 31 December 2008 and were on dialysis before 
transplantation for a period between 90 days and 10 years. 
Standard multivariable Cox regression examined the 
association of individually assigned pre-transplant dialysis 
modality with post-transplant patient and graft survival. 
To decrease confounding-by-indication through unmea- 
sured factors, we applied the instrumental variable 
method that used the case-mix adjusted centre percentage 
of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as predictor variable. 
Results. Standard analyses adjusted for age, sex, primary 
renal disease, donor type, duration of dialysis, year of 
transplantation and country suggested that PD before 
transplantation was associated with better patient [hazard 
ratio, HR (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.76–0.91)] and graft survival 
(HR (95% CI) 0.90 (0.84–0.96)) when compared with 
haemodialysis (HD). In contrast, the instrumental variable 
analysis showed that a 10% increase in the case-mix ad- 
justed centre percentage of patients on PD was neither 
associated with post-transplant patient survival [HR (95% 
CI = 1.00 (0.97–1.04)] nor with graft survival [HR (95% 
CI) = 1.01 (0.98–1.04)]. 
Conclusions. The instrumental variable method failed to 
conﬁrm the associations found in standard Cox regression 
between pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient and 
graft survival after transplantation. The lack of association 
in instrumental variable analysis may be due to better 
control of residual confounding.

While awaiting a donor kidney most end-stage renal 
disease patients need to initiate dialysis. There has been 
debate on whether the choice of dialysis modality may 
affect prognosis of these patients. Studies examining the 
association between dialysis modality, i.e. haemodialysis 
(HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), before kidney transplan- 
tation, and patient and graft survival after transplantation 
have shown conﬂicting results [1–8]. Goldfarb-Rumyant- 
zev et al. [1] studied the survival of 92 844 US kidney 
transplant recipients and concluded that patients on PD 
before transplantation had a 6% lower risk of death and a 
3% lower risk of (death-censored) graft failure than HD 
patients. In contrast, Snyder et al. [2] studied the survival 
of 22 776 US kidney transplant recipients and reported 
that dialysis modality prior to transplantation was not 
associated with patient survival after transplantation, but that 
PD patients had a 15% increased risk of death-censored 
graft failure. On the other hand, other much smaller, and 
therefore less powered, studies (up to 3464 patients) in 
different populations [3–8] reported that there was no associ- 
ation between dialysis modality prior to transplantation and 
the patient and graft survival after transplantation. 
However, any association between dialysis modality 
before transplantation and the survival after transplan- 
tation potentially suffers from confounding-by-indication, 
as patients may have been selected to start with HD or PD 
because of observed or unobserved prognostic factors [9]. 
For example, in many countries, patients on PD tend to 
be healthier than those on HD [10–12]. Previous studies 
addressed this problem by matching HD and PD patients

for age and gender [3, 4], or by adjusting for patient 
characteristics such as the presence of co-morbidities [1, 
2]. However, these methods may insufﬁciently account 
for differences in health status. In observational studies, 
the instrumental variable method is increasingly being 
used as an approach to reduce confounding-by-indication 
due to unmeasured factors [13–19]. Using this method, 
patients are grouped by organizational unit (the instru- 
mental variable), rather than by the treatment assigned to 
each individual patient. 
The aim of this study was to examine the association 
between pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient and 
graft survival after the ﬁrst kidney transplantation in a 
large cohort of living and deceased donor kidney trans- 
plant 
In addition to standard 
regression analyses, we also applied the instrumental vari- 
able method that used the case-mix adjusted centre per- 
centage of PD as predictor to minimize potential bias due 
to unmeasured confounders. 




Sixteen national or regional renal registries that annually submit individ- 
ual patient data to the European Renal Association−European Dialysis 
and Transplant Association (ERA–EDTA) Registry, and had data avail- 
able from 1999 to 2008, participated in this study, including the national 
registries of Austria, Denmark, England/Wales (UK), Finland, Greece, 
Norway, Scotland (UK), Sweden, the Netherlands, and the regional re- 
gistries of Dutch and French-speaking Belgium, and Asturias, Basque 
country, Cantabria, Catalonia and the Valencian region (together cover- 
ing 35% of Spain). The details of the database and the methods used for 
data collection and data processing have been reported previously [20]. 
Patients satisfying the following criteria were included in the study 
cohort: (i) being on dialysis before transplantation for at least 90 days 
and no longer than 10 years; (ii) receiving a ﬁrst kidney transplant from 
a living or deceased kidney donor between 1 January 1999 and 31 De- 
the time of ﬁrst 
cember 2008 and (iii) being >20 years of age at 
transplantation. 

The differences in patient characteristics between groups were examined 
using the Chi-square test (for categorical variables) and the Wilcoxon– 
Mann–Whitney test (for continuous variables). For both the analyses 
with patient survival and graft survival after transplantation, the date of 
transplantation was the starting point. For patient survival, death was the 
event studied, and reasons for censoring were loss to follow-up and the 
end of the follow-up period (31 December 2008 or 5 years after trans- 
plantation, whichever came ﬁrst). For the graft survival, 
the events 
studied were graft failure and patient death, and censored observations 
were loss to follow-up and the end of the follow-up period. 
Primary renal diseases were deﬁned according to the ERA–EDTA 
coding system [20] and classiﬁed into four groups. SAS 9.1 software 
was used for all statistical analyses. 
Standard analyses. Although in this paper we considered the instru- 
mental variable method as our primary analysis strategy, we ﬁrst ana- 
lysed the data using ‘standard’ multivariable regression analysis to 
facilitate comparison with results from previous studies. All patients 
were stratiﬁed into ‘HD patients’ and ‘PD patients’ according to their 
dialysis modality at 90 days after dialysis initiation. This ﬁrst dialysis 
modality was the primary predictor variable for survival after transplan- 
tation. We used the predominant dialysis modality (deﬁned as modality 
used for >50% of the time on dialysis before transplantation) and the 
last dialysis modality before transplantation (deﬁned as modality before 
transplantation that continued for at least 60 days) as additional predic- 
tor variables. Using Cox regression, the survival analyses were adjusted 
transplantation, sex, primary renal disease, duration of 
for age at 

dialysis before transplantation, year of transplantation, donor type and 
country. 

Instrumental variable analyses. The differences in patient survival 
between PD and HD patients may arise from unmeasured factors. To 
address the confounding-by-indication thereby introduced in the associ- 
ation between the pre-transplant dialysis modality and post-transplant 
patient and graft survival, we used an instrumental variable approach 
[13, 18, 21, 22]. Using this method one chooses a variable––the instru- 
mental variable––that can be considered to be allocated to a patient at 
random, 
individual patient characteristics. The 
random allocation of this variable can be considered as a ‘natural exper- 
iment’. In this study, we chose the percentage of PD patients in the 
patient’s treatment centre as the instrumental variable. In patients without 
speciﬁc preferences or contraindications for one of the dialysis modal- 
ities, the preference of the nephrologist/centre may inﬂuence the ﬁnal 
choice for PD or HD [23]. As patients tend to visit a treatment centre in 
the direct neighbourhood of their homes, in principle, the treatment 
centre can be considered to be allocated at random and serve as an in- 
strumental variable. However, as being treated by a particular centre may 
still not be fully at random, it is customary to nonetheless account for 
differences in case-mix between centres. Therefore, we adjusted the 
centre percentage of PD patients for centre case-mix. This required the 
following steps [13, 14]. First, a logistic regression model was developed 
to predict the chance of PD for each patient based on their age at the 
start of renal replacement therapy (RRT) sex, primary renal disease and 
country. Then for each centre, the expected percentage of patients on PD 
was calculated as the average of all individual predicted chances for PD. 
Thereafter, we calculated the ratio between the observed percentage of 
patients on PD and the expected percentage of PD for each centre. This 
ratio can be considered as a measure for how often PD is provided rela- 
tive to what would be expected based on the characteristics of the patient 
population in that centre. Thus, in centres with more PD than expected 
based on the patient population, this ratio was >1, and vice versa. This 
ratio was then multiplied by the overall percentage of patients on PD 
(34.8%), generating a case-mix adjusted percentage of patients on PD on 
Day 90 after the start of dialysis for each centre. We tested the assump- 
tions [21] related to the use of the instrumental variable method: (i) the 
instrumental variable must be related to the treatment individually as- 
signed; (ii) the instrumental variable must be unrelated to observed and 
unobserved prognostic factors and (iii) the instrumental variable must be 
unrelated to outcome, except through pathways that operate via the treat- 
ment individually assigned. 
Cox regression analyses were performed as described in the paragraph 
on standard analyses, except that the pre-transplant dialysis modality of 
each individual patient was substituted by the instrumental variable, i.e. 
the case-mix adjusted percentage of patients treated with PD on Day 90 
at the centre in which the patient was treated on Day 90. Thus, these 
analyses did not examine the dialysis modality at Day 90 for that indi- 
vidual patient per se, but instead they used the case-mix adjusted centre 
percentage of PD at Day 90 as a patient characteristic for all dialysis 
patients in that centre. Only patients on dialysis in countries from which 
we received centre identiﬁcation and patients from centres that had at least 
30 patients on dialysis and that had patients on both PD and HD were 
included in the instrumental variable analyses. Analyses were adjusted for 
patient’s individual age at transplantation, sex, primary renal disease, dur- 
ation of dialysis before transplantation, year of transplantation and donor 
type, and accounted for effects of facility clustering using robust standard 
error estimation techniques based on the sandwich estimator [24]. 
Additional analyses were performed stratiﬁed by year after transplan- 
tation to check whether the proportional hazards assumption was fulﬁlled. 
We also examined the presence of interaction between the kidney donor 
source (deceased/living), year of transplantation and dialysis modality in 
the association with patient and graft survival after transplantation. 

Standard analysis 
In total, 29 088 adults who received a ﬁrst kidney trans- 
plant from a living (N = 4947) or deceased kidney donor 
(N = 24 141) between 1999 and 2008 were included in the 

standard analyses. An overview of the baseline character- 
istics of these patients is shown in Table 1. Overall, 
34.8% of the patients were on PD on Day 90 after dialysis 
initiation. When compared with HD patients, patients on 
PD were younger at the start of dialysis and at the time of 
transplantation, 
they were more often female, had a 
slightly different primary renal disease distribution and 
their time spent on dialysis before transplantation was ∼1 
month shorter. 
Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted hazard 
ratios (HR) for patient and graft survival resulting from 
the standard Cox regression analyses with PD as pre- 
transplant dialysis modality. After adjustment for relevant 
confounders, the risk of post-transplant death on PD was 
17% lower than that for being on HD [HR (95% CI) = 
0.83 (0.76–0.91)] and the risk of graft failure was 10% 
lower for PD patients [adjusted HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.84– 
0.96)]. Similar results were obtained with PD as either the 
predominant dialysis modality before transplantation or as 
the last dialysis modality before transplantation. 



To address confounding-by-indication, in Cox regression 
analyses, we used the instrumental variable for patient 
characteristic, i.e. the case-mix adjusted percentage of PD 
patients at the centre in which the patient was treated on 
the individual patient’s dialysis 
Day 90, 
modality on Day 90. Analyses were restricted to patients 
from national and regional renal registries with centre data 
available and who were treated in centres with >30 
patients (N = 19 755). The patients who were excluded in 
this way (N = 9333) had similar patient characteristics 
when compared with those remaining in the analyses. In 
total, there were 228 centres with >30 dialysis patients 
which had patients both on HD and PD. The median (in- 
terquartile range) of the case-mix adjusted centre percen- 
tage of patients on PD at Day 90 was 43% [32–53%]. 
Table 3 provides an overview of the baseline character- 
istics of patients treated in centres with a case-mix ad- 
justed percentage of patients on PD above and below the 
median (43%). It shows that when compared according to

the case-mix adjusted centre percentage of PD, the patient 
groups were much more similar than when compared ac- 
cording to the individual patient’s dialysis modality (as in 
Table 1): those treated in centres with a case-mix adjusted 
percentage of PD above the median were about 1 year 
younger at the start of dialysis and at the time of trans- 
plantation and only had a slightly higher percentage of 
failure. This

as a ‘pseudo-randomizer’ [25].

patients treated in centres with a case-mix adjusted per- 
centage of patients on PD above versus below the median 
and HR comparing patients on dialysis in centres with a 
case-mix adjusted percentage of patients on PD in the

association with

transplantation. 


The ﬁrst assumption regarding instrumental variable 
analysis––stating that the instrumental variable must be 
related to the treatment individually assigned––was ful- 
ﬁlled: the median of the case-mix adjusted centre percen- 
tage of PD was higher in patients who were on PD at Day 
90 than in patients who were on HD at Day 90 (47% and 
39%, respectively, P < 0.001). The second assumption–– 
stating that the instrumental variable must be unrelated to 
observed and unobserved prognostic factors––was at least 
partially fulﬁlled: the differences in observed prognostic 
factors were substantially reduced if patients were com- 
pared on the basis of case-mix adjusted centre percentage 
of PD instead of on the basis of individual pre-transplant 
dialysis modality (Table 3 versus Table 1). The third as- 
sumption requires the case-mix adjusted centre percentage 
of PD to be unrelated to survival after transplantation, 
except through the individually assigned treatment under 
study. We have only few data to show that this is probably 
the case. However, the kidney donor source (living versus 
deceased) could be considered as centre characteristic. As 
kidney donor source was equally distributed in patients 
treated in centres with case-mix adjusted centre percen- 
tages below and above the median, we also assumed that 
other centre practices, such as the provision of immuno- 
suppressive regimens, followed a similar random distri- 
bution and are thus independent of the case-mix adjusted 
centre percentage of PD. 
The assessment of interaction showed that any effect of 
dialysis modality before transplantation was not different 
in deceased or living donor kidney recipients, in different 
years of transplantation, or in different years of follow-up. 

Previous reports suggested that dialysis modality before 
the ﬁrst kidney transplantation might 
inﬂuence both 
patient and graft survival after 
transplantation [1, 2] 
with effects ranging from a 6% lower to a 15% higher 
risk of death for PD patients. In this study which included 
29 088 patients from Europe, we examined the association 
of dialysis modality before the ﬁrst kidney transplantation 
with patient and graft survival after transplantation. In 
standard analyses, with the individual pre-transplant dialy- 
sis modality as a patient characteristic, PD before trans- 
plantation was associated with better patient survival and 
graft survival. However, this is potentially confounded by 
indication and standard analysis may fail to sufﬁciently 
account for differences in health status. In contrast, the in- 
strumental variable method using the case-mix adjusted 
centre percentage of PD failed to show a higher risk of 
death and graft failure for patients treated in centres with 

higher case-mix adjusted centre percentages of PD. This 
suggests that the results from standard analyses were con- 
founded by indication, and that there is likely no differ- 
ence in mortality and graft failure. 
Previous papers suggested reasons as to why dialysis 
modality before the ﬁrst kidney transplantation might 
inﬂuence both patient and graft survival after transplan- 
tation [1, 2]. However, for each of these potential reasons, 
the data in the literature are inconsistent. 

it has been hypothesized that residual 
renal function may be better preserved in PD patients [26, 
27], and consequently PD patients may have a higher 
glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) at the point of kidney 
transplantation. Nevertheless, two studies examining the 
the recipient’s own 
association of estimated GFR of 
kidney before transplantation with patient and graft survi- 
val after pre-emptive kidney transplantation did not ﬁnd 
any relationship [28, 29]. 
Also, it has been suggested that the occurrence of in- 
fections after transplantation may differ between PD and 
reported conﬂicting 
HD patients. Studies, however, 
results. Passalacqua et al. [30] concluded that PD patients 
had a higher risk of intra-abdominal, bloodstream and 
wound site infections after transplantation. On the other 
hand, Miemois-Foley et al. [31] reported less bacterial in- 
fections in PD patients after transplantation and Yang 
et al. [8] reported less hepatitis infections in PD patients 
after transplantation, and a similar rate of other infections 
in HD and PD patients. 
In addition, delayed graft function (DGF) after trans- 
plantation, which is a predictor of graft failure [32], was 
suggested to be higher for HD patients [33–35], possibly 
due to the worse hydration status of HD patients. 
However, other studies did not ﬁnd a difference between 
HD and PD patients with regard to the risk of DGF after 
transplantation [8, 36]. 
Furthermore, the development of post-transplant diabetes 
mellitus (PTDM) may be associated with the pre-transplant 
treatment modality due to the glucose load resulting from 
PD. However, results were also conﬂicting in this respect. 
Whereas Madziarska et al. [37] and Seiﬁ et al. [38] reported 
higher rates of PTDM in the former PD patients, Courivaud 
et al. [39] reported similar rates of PTDM between those 
who were on HD or PD before transplantation. 
Graft thrombosis has also been put forward as a poten- 
tial explanation. Both Ojo et al. [40] and Palomar et al. 
[41] reported a higher incidence of graft thrombosis after 
transplantation among PD patients. They proposed poss- 
ible mechanisms including increased levels of various 
coagulation factors in PD patients, as well as a higher risk 
of haemoconcentration in PD patients as opposed to HD 
patients. On the other hand, Pérez Fontán et al. [42] re- 
ported that PD is not a risk factor for graft thrombosis 
after transplantation. 
Finally, it has been speculated that immunologic differ- 
ences between HD and PD patients may play a role in 
graft survival after transplantation. It has been shown that 
HD patients have elevated levels of natural killer cells and 
production of cytokines [43, 44] although the mechanisms 
through which this could inﬂuence survival after trans- 
plantation are unclear. 


When considering the results of our standard analyses 
using individual pre-transplant dialysis modality as a 
patient characteristic, our results were in line with those 
from the largest US-based study (N = 92 844) by Gold- 
farb-Rumyantzev et al. [1], who found a patient survival 
beneﬁt (HR PD (95% CI) = 0.94 (0.91–0.97)) for trans- 
plant recipients who had PD as last dialysis modality 
before transplantation. On the other hand, another large 
US study (N = 22 776) by Snyder et al. [2] reported that 
dialysis modality prior to transplantation was not associ- 
ated with patient survival after transplantation [HR PD 
(95% CI) = 0.95 (0.85–1.06)]. Our patient-based analyses 
of graft survival using pre-transplant dialysis modality as 
a patient characteristic revealed a lower risk of graft 
failure for PD patients, which was in line with the results 
of Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. [1] [HR PD (95% CI) = 
0.97 (0.94–1.00)], but not with the results of Snyder et al. 
[2] who reported a higher risk of graft failure for PD 
patients [HR (95% CI) = 1.15 (1.04–1.26)]. However, a 
difference in the post-transplant outcome or any other 
outcome between HD and PD patients may result from 
confounding-by-indication as patients on PD tend to be 
healthier than those on HD [10–12]. The conﬂicting 
results of our standard analyses and instrumental variable 
analyses regarding patient survival suggest that the adjust- 
ment in the standard multivariable analyses for age at 
transplantation, sex, primary renal disease, donor type, 
duration of dialysis before transplantation, year of trans- 
plantation and country may have been insufﬁcient 
to 
largely eliminate differences in health status between 
patients on PD and HD. In comparison with our study, 
the studies of Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. [1] and Snyder 
et al. [2] were able to adjust their models for more vari- 
ables, like co-morbidity. Nevertheless, adjustment for con- 
founders in their standard analysis may not take away 
selection bias, because it is not possible to adjust for con- 
founders that are not measured (or even unknown) and for 
confounders that have been measured insufﬁciently. Only 
randomization of dialysis modality may fully prevent this 
form of selection bias, but randomization for dialysis 
modality is extremely difﬁcult [45], and information from 
randomized trials is currently not available. 

One way to simulate random assignment in observational 
studies is the use of an instrumental variable. In this 
study, we used the case-mix adjusted centre percentage of 
PD patients as instrumental variable. The allocation of a 
centre to a patient may be considered as a natural exper- 
iment, as patients tend to visit a centre in their direct 
neighbourhood. The case-mix adjusted centre percentage 
of PD may be viewed as a measure for how often PD is 
provided relative to what would be expected based on the 
characteristics of the patient population in that centre. 
Thus, subsequently, the allocation of a centre to a patient 
where PD is provided relatively frequently, and where the 
patient has a higher probability of starting dialysis with 
PD independent of the patient’s age, gender and primary 
renal disease, may be considered as random. In this way, 
the effects of confounding-by-indication may have been 
substantially reduced. 


The case-mix adjustment of the centre percentage of PD 
was based on relatively few variables. Patient co-morbid- 
ity for example could not be taken into account. A pre- 
vious study, however, has shown that once age, gender 
and primary renal disease are included in models for 
patient survival on RRT, co-morbidity may add relatively 
little to the variance in mortality [46]. As for other unob- 
served prognostic factors, the instrumental variable ap- 
proach has increased the likelihood that they were more 
evenly distributed between the patient groups. 
Nevertheless, the assumptions related to the instrumen- 
tal variable analysis may not entirely hold. When using 
the instrumental variable method, 
the differences in 
measured baseline characteristics for patients treated in 
centres with case-mix adjusted percentages of PD above 
or below the median were strongly reduced, but did not 
disappear completely for some variables. Furthermore, 
although the kidney donor source was equally distributed 
in patients treated in centres with case-mix adjusted centre 
percentages of PD below and above the median, we could 
not test this for other centre characteristics. Therefore, the 
possibility remains that the case-mix adjusted centre per- 
centage of PD may be associated with other patient 
socioeconomic status) and other 
characteristics 
centre practice patterns that could contribute to the risk of 
death and graft failure. Thus, the instrumental variable 
method seems to have taken away substantial residual 
confounding compared with standard Cox regression, but 
some residual confounding may have remained. 


Using instrumental variable analysis, a method that in ob- 
servational studies is used to approximate randomization 
of treatment, we found that patients on dialysis in centres 
where PD was provided more frequently had a similar 
patient and graft survival when compared with patients 
treated in centres in which PD was provided less fre- 
quently. This suggests that there is no association between 
the pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient and graft 
survival after transplantation. However, the instrumental 
variable method may still not fully correct for confound- 
ing-by-indication, and therefore, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that pre-transplant PD may affect survival after 
kidney transplantation. Nevertheless, we cannot think of 
any biological hypothesis as to why it would do so. We 
therefore conclude that previous studies as well as our 
own standard analyses using individual pre-transplant 
dialysis modality as a determinant for outcomes after 
transplantation may have suffered from confounding-by- 
indication, and that there is likely no association between 
the pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient and graft 
survival after transplantation.
