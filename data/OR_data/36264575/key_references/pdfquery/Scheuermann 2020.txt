Background: Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) profoundly improves the health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) of recipients. However, the influence of the pre-transplant dialysis modality on the success of the 
SPKT and post-transplant HRQoL remains unknown. 
Methods: We analyzed the surgical outcome, long-term survival, as well as HRQoL of 83 SPKTs that were performed in 
our hospital between 2000 and 2016. Prior to transplant, 64 patients received hemodialysis (HD) and nineteen patients 
received peritoneal dialysis (PD). Physical and mental quality of life results from eight basic scales and the physical and 
mental component summaries (PCS and MCS) were measured using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) survey. 
Results: Peri- and postoperative complications, as well as patient and graft survival were similar between the two groups. 
Both groups showed an improvement of HRQoL in all SF-36 domains after transplantation. Compared with patients who 
received HD before transplantation, PD patients showed significantly better results in four of the eight SF-36 domains: 
physical functioning (mean difference HD - PD: − 12.4 ± 4.9, P = < 0.01), bodily pain (− 14.2 ± 6.3, P < 0.01), general health (− 
6.3 ± 2.8, P = 0.04), vitality (− 6.8 ± 2.6, P = 0.04), and PCS (− 5.2 ± 1.5, P < 0.01) after SPKT. In the overall study population, graft 
loss was associated with significant worsening of the HRQoL in all physical components (each P < 0.01). 
Conclusions: The results of this analysis show that pre-transplant dialysis modality has no influence on the outcome and 
survival rate after SPKT. Regarding HRQoL, patients receiving PD prior to SPKT seem to have a slight advantage compared 
with patients with HD before transplantation.

Introduction 
Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) offers 
considerable survival benefits for patients with insulin- 
dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD), because it restores long-term glycemic control and 
can reduce secondary diabetic complications [1–6]. 
Due to organ shortage, most of these patients must

prior to SPKT. With hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal 
dialysis (PD), 
two efficient RRTs are available pre- 
transplant. However, both dialysis modalities substantially 
influence patients’ health, as well as their ability to work and 
participate in social activities. Conventional HD is usually 
performed intermittently three times a week in a dialysis 
center. During HD, uremic toxins are removed from the 
blood extracorporeally through a filter, which is generally 
considered as a stressful procedure, with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular diseases [7, 8]. By contrast, PD uses the peri- 
toneum as a filter through which substances are exchanged 
with the blood. In general, PD offers greater flexibility as it 
can be performed at different time points, almost always at 
home and independent of medical staff, although it carries 
the risk of metabolic complications related to systemic glu- 
cose absorption from the dialysate (e.g. hyperlipidemia and 
and catheter- 
decompensation of diabetes mellitus), 
associated complications. PD catheter infection can lead to 
subsequent peritonitis, which remains the major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in PD patients [7, 9]. 
Apart from mere graft and patient survival rates after 
transplantation, measuring the health-Related Quality of 
Life (HRQoL) has become an issue of further interest as 
it provides an overall view of the impact of the disease 
process on psychosocial status. Monitoring the HRQoL 
helps to define how disease symptoms affect the patient’s 
life, physical and mental functioning, and their ability to 
cope with the new life situation after transplantation. 
Recent studies have shown that patients generally ex- 
perience better quality of life after SPKT compared with 
dialysis patients [4, 10–13]. However, the influence of 
dialysis modality prior to SPKT on the surgical outcome 
and HRQoL after transplantation is less clear. Thus, the 
current study has sought to analyze the outcome and 
HRQoL in diabetic patients with ESRD undergoing 
SPKT regarding pre-transplant dialysis modality. 
Methods 
Study population 
Medical data from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus (type 1 or 2) and ESRD who received SPKT at the 
University Hospital of Leipzig between 2000 and 2016 were 
retrospectively analyzed. Our data source comprised a pro- 
spectively collected electronic database. Approval for this 
analysis was granted by the local ethics committee [AZ: Nr: 
111–16-14,032,016]. Patients undergoing pre-emptive trans- 
plantation, re-transplants, 
living donor kidney transplant- 
ation, those aged younger than 18 years, and those with 
missing data were excluded from the study. 
Outcome measures 
Special emphasis was placed on the outcome of dialysis 
modality before transplantation (HD versus PD), recipi- 
ent and donor characteristics, intra- and postoperative 
variables and complications such as patient, graft as well 
as HRQoL outcomes before (during dialysis) and after 
transplantation. Characteristics included age, gender, 
body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/height in m2), dur- 
ation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, duration of 
dialysis, and time on the waiting list. Cardiovascular dis- 
ease included information about peripheral arterial ob- 
structive disease and coronary heart disease (coronary 
artery bypass graft or stent). Peri- and post-transplant 
data included information on cold ischemia time of the 
kidney/pancreas, immunosuppressive therapy as well as 
patient and organ graft function. 
Furthermore, complications occurring during the first 3 
months after transplantation were analyzed. Surgical com- 
plications were defined as the need for relaparotomy 
within the first 3 months after transplantation. Intra- 
abdominal infections were defined as the development of 
infected fluid collection that required an intervention and/ 
or antibiotic drug therapy. Gastrointestinal bleedings were 
defined as bleedings requiring relaparotomy or endoscopy, 
or patients suffering from sudden anemia combined with 
either melena or hematemesis. Other bleedings compris- 
ing intra-abdominal hemorrhages, were diagnosed by CT 
scan or relaparotomy performed due to acute anemia. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
For measuring the HRQoL in this study, 
the most 
commonly-used and internationally-validated Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 
(SF-36) questionnaire was used. Patients were asked to 
evaluate their HRQoL before transplantation (undergo- 
ing dialysis), such as 1 year after transplantation. There- 
time 
fore, SF-36 forms were completed at different 
points after transplantation, but not earlier than 1 year 
after transplantation. 
HRQoL was evaluated in a second assessment through 
written HRQoL questionnaires (SF-36) sent to all pa- 
tients with an invitation to complete a quality-of-life sur- 
vey retrospectively. The SF-36 survey was sent by mail 
to patients’ home addresses. Additionally, patients were 
interviewed via telephone or during a clinical visit, as in- 
dicated. Return envelopes were included free of charge. 
A period of 2 weeks was envisaged for returning ques- 
tionnaires. All patients who had not returned the ques- 
tionnaire after 2 weeks were contacted a second time via 
mail or telephone within another 14 days. Altogether, 
patients had 4 weeks to submit their responses. Prior to 
the study, informed consent of all patients and the local 
ethics committee [AZ: Nr: 111–16-14,032,016] was ob- 
tained. Because the HRQoL assessment was performed 
separately, it was not possible to correlate HRQoL scores 
with all clinical data. The average time span between 
transplantation and completion of the questionnaires 
was 8.6 ± 2.9 years. 


The SF-36 has 36 questions (without specific one for 
renal failure or diabetes) that assess the ability to per- 
form vigorous activities and activities for daily living and 
participate in social, family and occupational activities. 
Eight scales/dimensions describe domains of physical 
functions (PF, ten items), role limitations due to physical 
problems (PR, four items), bodily pain (BP, two items), a 
general perception of health (GH, five items), energy and 
vitality (VIT, 
two 
items), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE, 
three items), and mental health (MH, five items). The 
subscales can be combined into two summation scales 
measuring the overall physical and mental HRQoL: a 
physical component 
summary (PCS = PF + PR + BP + 
GH) and a mental component summary (MCS = VIT + 
SF + RE + MH). Subscale scores were transformed to a 
0–100 scale, with 0 representing the least to 100 repre- 
senting the greatest well-being. 


Surgical techniques 
The pancreas and kidney grafts were procured according 
to the guidelines provided by Eurotransplant (ET) [14]. As 
described earlier, the pancreas was explanted in a no- 
touch technique [15]. An illiac y-graft was used for recon- 
struction of the superior mesenteric and the lienal artery. 
The pancreas was transplanted transabdominally using a 
standard technique with an intraperitoneal location in the 
right iliac fossa [16]. Exocrine drainage was carried out 
with a side-to-side duodenojejunostomy [3, 17]. Kidneys 
were transplanted transabdominally into the left iliacal 
fossa. The ureter was implanted into the bladder accord- 
ing to the Lich-Gregoir technique using a double J intra- 
ureteral splint [16]. 
Immunosuppression 
Immunosuppressive therapy comprised an induction 
therapy with the interleukin-2 receptor antagonist basi- 
liximab or antithymocyte globulin, followed by a triple 
maintenance immunosuppression consisting of calcine- 
urin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), and/or anti- 
metabolites (mycofenolate mofetil or sirolimus) and 
tapered steroids (prednisolone). 
Statistical analysis 
Baseline data are presented as mean values with the 
standard deviation (SD), minimum or maximum range 
such as the proportion percentage (%). Baseline data 
were compared with appropriate statistical significance 
test including the Student’s t–test, χ2, analysis of vari- 
ance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon–Mann– 
Whitney tests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was 
used to adjust the difference between the two groups 
after SPKT, with hemodialysis as one predictor and 
(before 
baseline measurements of HRQoL domains 

SPKT) as the other. Survival rates were calculated using 
the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test was ap- 
plied to test statistical significance. Graft survival was 
calculated as the time from initial transplant to graft fail- 
ure (re-start of dialysis), censoring for death with a func- 
tioning graft and grafts still 
time of 
analysis. Patient survival is defined as time from trans- 
plant to patient death, censoring for patients still alive at 
time of analysis. If a recipient was alive or lost to follow- 
up at time of last contact, then survival time was cen- 
sored at time of last contact. Multivariate Cox propor- 
tional hazards analysis was applied to assess independent 
predictors of patient death and pancreas graft failure, in- 
cluding clinically-relevant variables and/or those pre- 
senting P ≤ 0.15 in univariate analysis: recipient gender, 
BMI and age, dialysis modality (HD versus PD), time on 
dialysis, years of diabetes mellitus, concomitant cardio- 
vascular disease and surgical complications. SPSS soft- 
ware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA, version 21.0) 
was used for statistical analysis and graphs. A P value < 
0.05 was considered as statistically significant. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
The overall study population included 83 patients receiv- 
ing SPKT in our department between 2000 and 2016. At 
the time of transplantation, 64 patients obtained HD and 
nineteen patients used PD. Continuous ambulatory peri- 
toneal dialysis was used by fourteen patients (74%) and 
automatic peritoneal dialysis was used by five patients 
(26%) among the PD group. Recipient, donor and graft 
characteristics according to the different dialysis types 
prior to transplantation are summarized in Table 1. The 
two groups were similar for the majority of their pre- 
transplant characteristics, while the number of female 
recipients was higher in the PD group (P = 0.017), and a 
history of depression was more frequent in the HD 
group (P = 0.049). HLA mismatches, post-transplant im- 
munosuppressive regimes and lengths of hospital stay 
did not show significant differences between the two 
groups (data not shown). 
Outcome 
Complications 
There were no significant differences in the frequency of 
peri- and postoperative complications between HD and 
PD SPKT recipients (Table 2). The global relaparotomy 
rate was similar between the two groups (HD: 35% ver- 
sus PD: 36%; P = 0.77). 

transplantation, eighteen patients developed 
infections (HD: 20% versus PD: 26%; 
infections, two 
infections and eight cultured positive for both 
infections were 

intra-abdominal 
P = 0.577). There were eight bacterial 
fungal 
bacteria and fungi.

complicated with graft pancreatitis in nine cases (HD: 
10% versus PD: 11%; P = 0.89) and relaparotomy was ne- 
cessary in ten cases (HD: 13% versus PD: 11%; P = 0.76). 
Four out of nineteen PD patients had a history of peri- 
tonitis during their time on dialysis, including two pa- 
tients with two or more episodes of peritonitis. A history 


























































of peritonitis was not associated with an increased risk 
of complications after transplantation, whereby only one 
of these patients had an intra-abdominal infection and 
one patient developed pancreatitis post-transplant. 
Patient and graft survival 
The 3- and 5-year patient survival rates for patients after 
SPKT showed no significant differences between the HD 
and PD group (98.2 and 96.1% in HD versus 92.9 and 
92.9% in PD, respectively; P = 0.559). Similarly, the 1-, 3- 
and 5- year pancreas graft survival rates (94.6, 90.3 and 
85.8% in HD versus 88.2, 81.9 and 81.9% in PD, respect- 
ively; P = 0.901) and kidney graft survival rates (98.2, 
96.4 and 84.3% in HD versus 88.2, 88.2 and 80.2% in PD, 
respectively; P = 0.712) did not show any significant dif- 
ferences between the two groups (Fig. 1). 
As shown in Table 3, no significant differences were found 
between the type of pre-transplant dialysis modality and 
causes for patient death and graft failure. However, we noted 
a tendency of higher graft losses due to thrombosis in PD pa- 
tients (HD: 4.7% versus PD: 15.8%; P = 0.10). 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis of the total study 
population revealed that the presence of cardiovascular 
disease is an independent predictor of patient death. 
Moreover, the preoperative presence of cardiovascular 
disease, recipient age, BMI, duration of pre-transplant 
dialysis and surgical complications could be identified as 
independent predictors of pancreas and kidney graft loss 
(Table 4). 




Impact of pre-transplant dialysis modality Tables 5 
compares the HRQoL scores of SPKT recipients accord- 
ing to their dialysis modality before and after transplant- 
ation. Both groups showed an improvement of HRQoL 
in all SF-36 domains after transplantation. There were 
statistically significant improvements in six of the eight 
SF-36 domains in the HD group, and in seven of the 
eight SF-36 domains in the PD group. 
Before transplantation, benefits were seen for the PD 
patients, with statistically significant differences in terms 
functioning (P = 0.028), bodily pain (P = 
of physical 
0.034), and in the physical component summary (PCS)

(P = 0.013) compared with patients receiving HD prior 
to transplantation (Table 5). After SPKT, PD patients 
showed significantly better results in four of the eight 
SF-36 domains compared with HD patients: physical 
functioning (P < 0.01), bodily pain (P < 0.01), general 
health (P = 0.04), vitality (P = 0.04) and PCS (P < 0.01). 
Impact of demographical and clinical variables We 
separately analyzed the possible impact of three factors 
– age, gender and graft loss – on the HRQoL of the 
overall study population after SPKT (Table 6). Regarding 
patients’ age, there was a significant difference in phys- 
ical functioning (P = 0.04), general health (P < 0.01) and 
role limitations (P = 0.03). In the univariate analysis, pa- 
tients’ gender showed no influence on HRQoL after 
SPKT. Graft loss (kidney or pancreas) led to a significant 
decrease in all physical components (each P < 0.01) and 
mental health status (P = 0.01) of the SF-36. 
Discussion 
Post-transplant outcome and survival 
Infectious complications remain a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality after SPKT [3, 4, 6, 18]. A 
much-debated question is whether pre-transplant PD in- 
creases the risk for intra-abdominal 
infections after 
transplantation due to the risk of catheter-associated 
peritonitis. Binaut et al. showed a higher rate of parietal 
sepsis in PD patients after kidney transplantation alone 
(KTA) compared with patients who received HD prior 
to transplantation [19]. Martins et al. reported a signifi- 
cantly higher rate of pancreas loss due to infection 
among PD patients after SPKT (HD: 3.4% versus PD: 
12.8%; P = 0.042), whereas ten out of 39 (25.6%) PD pa- 
tients had peritonitis in their past [20]. By contrast, other 
studies have reported no difference in surgical outcome 
between HD and PD patients after SPKT [21–24]. Our 
analysis could not reveal significant differences in intra- 
abdominal infection rates after SPKT between the two 
groups, and there was no correlation between the inci- 
dence of pre-transplant peritonitis and post-transplant 
intra-abdominal infection. Besides dialysis modality, the 
incidence of intra-abdominal infection after SPKT may 
be related to other factors, namely surgical technique 
(especially pancreas-anastomosis), the length of hospital 
stays and the intensity of immunosuppression. 
In the literature, there are reports of an increased graft 
loss in PD patients compared with HD patients post- 
transplant. After KTA, an increased graft loss in PD pa- 
tients is reported, mainly due to renal vascular throm- 
bosis [25, 26]. In a study investigating outcomes after 
SPKT, Martins et al. reported a significantly higher rate 
of thrombosis-driven relaparotomy in PD patients com- 
pared with HD patients. Moreover, they recognized a 
near significant higher rate of renal graft loss due to 
thrombosis in PD patients compared with HD patients 
[20]. In our study, no correlations were found between 
pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient or graft sur- 
vival. Only the rate of pancreas graft failure due to 
thrombosis was non-significantly higher in the PD group 
(HD: 4.7% versus PD: 15.8%, P = 0.10). However, these 
data must be interpreted with caution, because other 
variables such as patient comorbidities (cardiovascular 
diseases, BMI), along with recipient age and time on dia- 
lysis might be additional factors that influence the out- 
come and survival. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
Pre-transplant HRQoL 
Most published studies evaluating dialysis patients wait- 
ing for KTA show inconclusive results related to pre-

83). Data are shown as mean ± SD 





























































































transplant HRQoL and dialysis modality [27]. Previous 
publications have used a broad range of measures to as- 
sess HRQoL and analyzed patients with different demo- 
graphic characteristics and medical history. Our findings 
indicate that PD is associated with a significantly better 
physical functioning and physical component summary 
before SPKT compared with patients receiving HD as a 
pre-transplant dialysis modality. Moreover, besides mental 
health, all other components of the SF-36 score were (al- 
though not significantly) higher in PD patients. The better 
reported quality of life among PD patients may stem from 
the positive effect of medical self-management through 
PD, which can be performed independently or with the 
help of a caregiver and develops a sense of personal con- 
trol, which positively correlates with features of HRQoL. 
By contrast, conventional HD is a stressful process and 
time spent on a dialysis ward can contribute to a lower 
quality of life, as the number of hours in HD hinders pro- 
fessional and social functioning. 
Post-transplant HRQoL 
The HRQoL of patients improved in both study groups 
after transplantation, which underlines the therapeutic 
success of SPKT, besides medical outcomes and object- 
ive clinical parameters. This is in line with most pub- 
lished studies showing a significant 
in 
patient-reported general HRQoL after SPKT and better 
diabetes-specific quality of life [4, 10–13]. 

Psychiatric disorders could influence the poor evalu- 
ation of the quality of life among HD patients [28]. HD 
carries the risk of vascular dehydration and hypotension 
following cerebellar hypoperfusion and may lead to cog- 
nitive impairment and cardiovascular diseases [29–31]. 
Sapilak revealed a strong negative correlation of HRQoL 
of HD patients with depression symptoms and anxiety 
[32]. In a study by Smith et al. evaluating 37 patients 
pre-transplant and 4 months after SPKT, approximately 
half of the patients showed an improvement of HRQoL, 
although one-third even experienced reduced HRQoL. 
The authors showed that pre-existing psychiatric disor- 
ders at the time of transplant were the only significant 
predictor of reduced quality of life following pancreas 
transplantation [33]. In line with these reports, in our 
study the rate of depression in patient history was sig- 
nificantly higher in the HD group (P = 0.049). However, 
with a small sample size and missing details about psy- 
chosocial status and longitudinal periodic assessment of 
depression disease, caution must be applied as the find- 
ings might not be representative. 
In the literature, the relative importance of patients’ 
gender on HRQoL after transplantation is debated. In a 
study by Rajkumar et al., 12 months after transplantation 
(KTA or SPKT) most HRQoL scores (seven out of eight) 
were better for women than for men. Moreover, HRQoL 
scores of female recipients were not statistically different 
from the control group in the general population [12]. 
The authors postulated that differences in expectations 
and appreciation of improvements in health after trans- 
plantation, differences in social network and emotional 
support may provide an explanation for these findings. 
Other reports have favored men and shown that female 
gender is a negative predictive factor of HRQoL after 
SPKT [10, 33]. In a study by Martin et al. evaluating 
HRQoL in 60 male and 66 female SPKT patients, no 
lower scores for female patients were observed [11]. Dif- 
ferent results in the literature may be explained by dif- 
ferent follow-up periods, study populations and study 
designs/questionnaires. In our analysis, the number of 
female recipients was significantly higher in the PD 
group (P = 0.017), although we did not observe gender- 
based differences in the overall study population. 
In the present study, we have shown that graft loss has a 
significant impact on HRQoL after SPKT due to a loss of 
independence from insulin therapy and freedom from dia- 
lysis. This is in line with previous publications in which 
graft loss has been associated with significant worsening 
of the HRQoL [4, 34, 35], and maintenance of two func- 
tioning grafts seems to be an independent predictor of 


higher post-transplant quality-of-life scores [11]. Further- 
more, the results of Sutherland et al. indicate that achiev- 
ing insulin independence improves QOL more than

Limitations 
There are some notable limitations of this study that 
should be mentioned, related to the data source and 
study design. The main limitations of the study are its 
retrospective nature, the heterogenous group size and 
the fact that all data collection was undertaken at one 
time, which make it difficult to evaluate the causality of 
the findings and associations. As such, there may be 
some amount of variation from year to year with 
changes in the outcome and level of HRQoL. Second, 
not only disease or dialysis modality determine one’s 
view of life quality, but also many non-disease factors 
(work, education, and other sociodemographic factors) 
play important additive role in the perception of 
HRQoL. The option for PD or HD normally depends on 
the patient’s condition (comorbid situations, vascular 
and peritoneal conditions), autonomy and convenience, 
as well as the health care system (dialysis center factors). 
Conclusions 
Both dialysis modalities are generally associated with 
good outcomes and an improvement of HRQoL after 
SPKT. PD prior to SPKT seems to offer a slight advan- 
tage compared with HD before transplantation. Further 
prospective, controlled and randomized studies are 
needed to evaluate sociodemographic factors with an 
impact on the outcome and HRQoL.
