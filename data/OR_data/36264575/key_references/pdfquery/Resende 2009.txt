Inﬂuence of Dialysis Duration and Modality on Kidney 
Transplant Outcomes 

ABSTRACT 
Background. The inﬂuence of pretransplantation dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes 
has been the subject of longstanding interest. Although increased time on dialysis prior to 
kidney transplantation is associated with decreased graft and patient survivals, analyses of 
the impact of dialysis modality on kidney allograft outcome have produced conﬂicting 
results. 
Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inﬂuence of dialysis duration 
and modality on the function and survival of renal allografts. 
Patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 421 adults who received ﬁrst 
kidney transplantations from cadaveric heart-beating donors performed in our unit from 
May 1989 to May 2007. Three hundred seventy-four patients (88.8%) were on hemodial- 
ysis (HD) prior to kidney transplantation, including 247 patients (58.7%) on treatment for 
at least 24 months. 
Results. Patients with a dialysis duration (cid:1)24 months were signiﬁcantly older (45.9 vs 
42.8 years; P (cid:1) .013). Renal function at 3, 12, 60, and 96 months was similar between the 
2 groups. Longer duration on dialysis was associated with poorer overall graft and patient 
survivals. No differences were observed in renal function or graft and patient survivals 
comparing HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Multivariate analysis conﬁrmed the lack of 
correlation between dialysis duration or modality and allograft failure. 
Conclusion. Longer dialysis duration inﬂuenced overall graft and patient survival. 
However, dialysis modality showed no inﬂuence on graft function or survival.

(ESRD), kidney transplantation is recognized as the 
therapy of choice, being superior to dialysis in terms of 
quality of life and long-term mortality risk.1 Several studies 
demonstrate that pre-emptive kidney transplantation is advan- 
tageous not only for graft survival but also for patient sur- 
vival.2– 4 However, not all patients have a potential living 
donor, and therefore undergo hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal- 
dialysis (PD) while awaiting a cadaveric donor kidney. 
Increased time on dialysis prior to transplantation has been 
shown to be a predictor of negative short-term outcomes5 
and transplant recipient survival.6 Regarding the type of 
pretransplantation renal replacement therapy (RRT), HD is 
associated with a greater incidence of delayed graft function 
(DGF) after kidney transplantation.7,8 An increased inci- 
dence of graft thrombosis has been associated with PD.9 A 
greater rate of acute rejection episodes was associated with 
PD in some studies;7 however, other reports note a similar 
occurrence between PD and HD.5 PD was also associated 
with a greater rate of posttransplantation infection com- 
pared with patients on HD therapy in some10 but not other 
studies, which suggest rates to be similar7,11 or lower12 
between PD and HD patients. Inﬂuence of pretransplanta- 
tion RRT on graft and patient survivals has produced 
conﬂicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
inﬂuence of dialysis duration and modality on the function 
and survival of renal allografts. 

Between May 1989 and May 2007, we performed 421 ﬁrst kidney 
transplantations from cadaveric heart beating donors in adults 
((cid:1)18 years). All patients were on either HD or PD prior to 
transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data: 
recipient age and gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, dialysis 
modality prior to the transplantation, last panel-reactive antibody 
(PRA), donor age and gender, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
mismatch, cold ischemia time, DGF (characterized as the need for 
dialysis on the ﬁrst week posttransplantation), acute rejection 
episodes (histological diagnosis or antirejection treatment), and 
renal function at 3, 12, 60, and 96 months. All patients were treated 
with a calcineurin inhibitor– based immunosuppressive regimen. 
Induction therapy with a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody was 
administered to 109 patients. Estimated glomerular ﬁltration rates 
(eGFR) were calculated using the 4-variable Modiﬁcation of Diet 
in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, based on serum 
creatinine level, age, gender, and race. 
Results were expressed as mean values (cid:2) SD. Univariate 
analysis was performed using the chi-square test and Student t test 
for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis was used to calculate actuarial graft survival and log-rank 
tests to compare survivals. Risk factors for graft failure were 
examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. 
All P values were two-tailed; a P value (cid:3).05 was considered 
signiﬁcant. 

Among 421 adult patients who underwent a ﬁrst cadaveric 
kidney transplantation at our institution from May 1989 to 
May 2007, 284 were males (67.5%) and the overall mean 
age at the time of transplantation was 44.6 (cid:2) 12.7 years. 
Prior to transplantation, 374 patients (88.8%) were on HD 
and 47 patients (11.2%) were on PD. The mean dialysis 
duration was 37.6 (cid:2) 30.2 months (minimum, 1 month; 
maximum, 172 months). Mean follow-up time was 73.1 (cid:2) 
52.7 months. 
Patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the 
dialysis duration (cid:3)24 months or (cid:1)24 months. Donor, 
recipient, and transplant characteristics are described in 
Table 1. Patients with a dialysis duration (cid:1)24 months were 
signiﬁcantly older (45.9 vs 42.8 years; P (cid:1) .013). No 
differences were observed in the occurrence of DGF, acute 
rejection episodes, or graft function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 
months. Kaplan- Meier analysis with survival censored for 
death with a functioning graft showed similar outcomes (P (cid:1) 
.922). Longer duration on dialysis was associated with 
poorer overall graft (P (cid:1) .047) and patient survivals (P (cid:1) 
.014; Fig 1). When comparing HD versus PD therapy, there 
were no differences in donor and recipient characteristics, 
occurrence of DGF, acute rejection episodes, or graft 
function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 months. On Kaplan-Meier 
analysis censored for death with a functioning graft (P (cid:1) 
.535), overall graft (P (cid:1) .675), and patient survival (P (cid:1) 
.981) rates were similar.

survival,7,8,13 whereas other reports did not show long-term 
graft and patient survivals to be affected by the dialysis 
modality.6 Our results showed no differences between PD 
and HD on short-term or long-term graft and patient 
survivals. However, the small number of patients on PD 
prior to kidney transplantation impaired statistical power 
when compared with subjects on HD prior to transplanta- 
tion. 
Our study supported the concept that dialysis duration 
inﬂuenced overall graft and patient survivals. The choice of 
a pretransplantation dialysis modality did not inﬂuence 
transplantation results.

comparing dialysis duration (cid:3)24 months with dialysis duration

dialysis (P (cid:1) .014; log-rank test). 
Multivariate analysis revealed that recipient age (cid:1)55 
years (Hazard Ratio [HR] (cid:1) 1.83; P (cid:1) .003; 95% conﬁ- 
dence interval [CI], 1.23–2.72), acute rejection episode 
(HR (cid:1) 1.96; P (cid:3) .0001; 95% CI; 1.38 –2.78), DGF (HR (cid:1) 
1.56; P (cid:1) .011; 95% CI, 1.10 –2.20), and PRA (cid:4)50% (HR (cid:1) 
2.43; P (cid:1) (cid:3).0001; 95% CI; 1.54 –3.85) showed adverse 
effects on allograft survival. The same analysis conﬁrmed a 
lack of correlation between dialysis duration (cid:1)24 months 
(HR (cid:1) 1.16; P (cid:1) .399; 95% CI; 0.82–1.65) or modality 
(HR (cid:1) 1.03; P (cid:1) .928; 95% CI; 0.58 –1.80) and allograft 
survival. 

Several studies demonstrated that increased time on dialy- 
sis prior to transplantation negatively predict short-term 
kidney allograft outcomes,5,13 acute rejection episodes,14 
and transplant recipient survival.6 In our study, 
longer 
dialysis duration was associated with poorer overall graft 
and patient survivals. No differences were noted in the 
occurrence of DGF, acute rejection episodes, or renal 
function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 months. 
Regarding the impact of dialysis modality on short-term 
outcomes, HD was associated with a greater incidence of 
DGF after kidney transplantation.7,8 A greater rate of acute 
rejection episodes has been associated with PD in some 
studies,7 but other showed a similar incidence as HD.8 
Some studies have reported a positive impact of PD on 
outcomes after transplantation and on long-term patient
