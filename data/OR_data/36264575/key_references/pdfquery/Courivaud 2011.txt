Abstract: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a well-known com- 
plication in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). While a number of risk 
factors for PTDM have been identiﬁed, the potential impact of pre-trans- 
plant dialysis modality on subsequent development of PTDM has not yet 
been explored. 
We performed a multicenter retrospective study on 2010 consecutive RTRs 
who did not have a history of diabetes prior to renal transplantation. 
PTDM was deﬁned as a need for anti-diabetic therapy in an RTR without a 
history of diabetes prior to transplantation. Analysis of the risk factors for 
development of PTDM was performed with respect to pre-transplant dial- 
ysis modality. 
A total of 137 (6.8%) patients developed PTDM; 7% in the hemodialysis 
group and 6.5% in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) group (p = 0.85). In the 
multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) 
(p < 0.001), use of tacrolimus (p = 0.002), and rejection episodes 
(p < 0.001) were identiﬁed as independent risk factors for development of 
PTDM. Patients in the PD group were younger (p = 0.004), had lower 
BMI (p = 0.07), and were less likely to have a history of hepatitis C 
(p = 0.007) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (p = 0.07). 
Adjustment for these variables did not modify the results. 
The results of this study suggest that pre-transplant dialysis modality does 
not have an impact on the subsequent development of PTDM in RTRs.

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) 
is a 
common complication of kidney transplantation 
and is associated with an increased risk of cardio- 
vascular morbidity and mortality (1, 2). It has been 
shown that PTDM is also associated with an 
increase in the risk of graft failure and death (2–5). 
Relative insulin deﬁciency, caused by increased 
insulin resistance and impaired insulin production, 
is thought to be the underlying pathophysiologic 
mechanism for PTDM (1). 
Several risk factors for development of PTDM 
have been identiﬁed: age, body mass index (BMI), 
ethnicity, hepatitis C infection, and certain immu- 
nosuppressive medications such as steroids and 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) 
(6). Steroids and 
reversal of the uremic state stimulate the appetite 

and increase food intake leading to post-transplant 
weight gain, which in turn results in relative insulin 
deﬁciency due to hepatic and peripheral insulin 
resistance. A signiﬁcant subset of renal transplant 
recipients (RTRs) experiences weight gain during 
the ﬁrst year after transplantation, potentially 
predisposing them to an abnormal glucose metab- 
olism (7). 
Based on a number of clinical observations, it is 
conceivable to hypothesize that pre-transplant 
renal replacement modality might aﬀect the risk 
of PTDM. Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the 
growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is a pep- 
tide hormone that is predominantly produced in 
the stomach and can signiﬁcantly increase food 
intake (8). A 2.8-fold higher ghrelin levels have 
been reported in patients with renal 
failure, 
suggesting that the kidney plays an important role 
in the clearance and/or degradation of this hor- 
mone (9). In a report by Ayala et al., one yr of 
peritoneal dialysis (PD) was associated with a 
signiﬁcant reduction in plasma ghrelin levels, while 
no changes were observed in hemodialysis (HD) 
patients (10). As previously reported by our group, 
higher levels of ghrelin in HD patients could be 
associated with a greater weight gain (7) and 
therefore a potential increase in the risk of PTDM. 
Inﬂammation is also considered a risk factor for 
PTDM (11). A number of studies have shown a 
signiﬁcant increase in inﬂammatory mediators in 
HD patients compared with PD patients (12, 13). 
The pro-inﬂammatory eﬀect of HD can therefore 
increase the risk of subsequent PTDM compared 
with those treated with PD. 
Therefore, pre-transplant 
replacement 

modalities are associated with distinct metabolic 
proﬁles that can potentially aﬀect 
the risk of 
subsequent development of PTDM. In this retro- 
evaluated the 
spective multicenter 
hypothesis that patients treated with HD are at 
higher 
risk for PTDM compared with those 
managed with PD. 



This study is a retrospective chart review of 2010 
patients who received a renal allograft between 
January 1995 and December 2005 in ﬁve renal 
transplant centers in France. This study was 
designed to evaluate the impact of pre-transplant 
dialysis modality on the subsequent development 
of PTDM with respect to other known risk factors. 
The data were reviewed and recorded until 
six months after transplantation. 


We included all patients with end-stage renal 
disease who received a renal allograft between 
January 1995 and December 2005 in university- 
aﬃliated medical centers in Nancy (n = 754), 
Reims 
(n = 372), Besanc¸ on (n = 327), Stras- 
bourg (n = 299), and Caen (n = 258). Patients 
with a history of pre-transplant diabetes mellitus 
were excluded. Clinical parameters such as age, 
gender, year of transplant, BMI, hepatitis C status, 
CNI agent (cyclosporine A [CsA] or tacrolimus), 
and dialysis modality (HD or PD) were recorded 
upon inclusion. Rejection episodes (either biopsy- 
proven or clinically suspected and treated), cyto- 
megalovirus (CMV) disease (identiﬁed through 
treatment by gancyclovir), and a history of auto- 
somal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD- 
PKD) were also considered as separate variables. 
The cumulative dose of steroids could not be 
compared because some centers had used steroid- 
in some patients with 
withdrawal protocols 
PTDM. 

PTDM was identiﬁed based on the need for insulin 
or oral anti-diabetic therapy for normalization of 
blood sugar levels. As the goal was to evaluate the 
potential eﬀect of pre-transplant dialysis modality, 
we only included cases of PTDM that were 
diagnosed over the ﬁrst six months after renal 
transplantation. 

The results were expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation. 

Univariate analyses were ﬁrst carried out 
to 
examine the relationship between PTDM and a 
number of potential independent variables. Cova- 
riates to enter multivariate analyses were the 
following: 
(i) continuous variables were tested 
using Student(cid:2)s t-test or Mann–Whitney(cid:2)s non- 
parametric test (ii) categorical variables were tested 
using Pearson(cid:2)s chi-square, or Fisher(cid:2)s exact test. 
The alpha threshold for covariate selection was 
0.20. Those variables linked to PTDM with p- 
values of less than 0.20 were retained for multi- 
variate analyses. Selected covariates were entered 
into logistic regression analysis. Results are ex- 
pressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% conﬁdence 
interval, with a p value testing the null hypothesis: 


RR = 1. Therefore, when p value is less than 0.05, 
RR is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1. 
Other characteristics were not signiﬁcantly diﬀer- 
ent between the two groups (see Table 1). 


This study included 2010 RTRs. All patients were 
Caucasians. Mean age was 46 ± 14 yr, and 62.3% 
were male. Mean BMI was 23.1 ± 4.2 kg/m2. 
Sixteen percent had ADPKD and 3.6% showed 
positive hepatitis C serology. CsA was used in 
68.3% patients and tacrolimus in 27.5%. Acute 
rejection and CMV disease were identiﬁed in 24% 
and 20.8%, respectively. Most episodes of acute 
rejection took place before PTDM (56%), whereas 
most cases of CMV disease occurred after PTDM 
(60.5%). 

There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribu- 
tion of dialysis modality between centers. Prior to 
transplantation, 1564 patients (77.8%) were on 
HD and 332 (16.5%) on PD. One hundred and 
fourteen patients (5.7%) had undergone pre-emp- 
tive transplant. PD patients were signiﬁcantly 
younger (p = 0.004), less likely to have a history 
of hepatitis C infection (p = 0.007) or ADPKD 
(p = 0.07), and had a lower BMI (p = 0.07).

PTDM was identiﬁed in 137 patients (6.8%); 7% in 
the HD group and 6.5% in the PD group 
(p = 0.85). The mean time of onset was 
30 ± 42.5 d after transplantation. Demographic 
and clinical characteristics of these patients are 
summarized in Table 2. 




In univariate analysis, older age (p < 0.0001), 
higher BMI 
use 
(p < 0.0001), CMV disease (p = 0.006), acute 
center 
rejection (p < 0.001), 
(p = 0.0002) were associated with development 
of PTDM (Table 2). Pre-transplant dialysis modal- 
ity did not alter the risk of PTDM (RR 1.08 [0.45– 
2.6], p = 0.86). To explore more precisely the 
potential 
interactions between dialysis modality 
and the subsequent risk of PTDM, we calculated 
RR estimates for PTDM derived from propor- 
tional hazards modelling with dialysis modality 
adjusted for age, BMI, ADPKD, hepatitis C 
infection, and transplant center. Adjustment for 
this variables did not modify the RR of PD for 
PTDM (RR 0.96 [0.6–1.6], p = 0.86) (Table 3).

In the multivariate model, no diﬀerence in 
statistical analysis was observed irrespective of 
whether CMV disease was considered or not (data 
unavailable in one center). Therefore, the data 
presented herein are from statistical analysis with- 
out considering CMV disease. Age (RR 1.04 [1.03– 
1.06] for each one yr increase, p < 0.0001), BMI 
(RR 1.14 [1.09–1.18] for each 1 kg/m2 increase, 
p < 0.0001), use of tacrolimus (RR 1.8 [1.25–

[1.96–4.44], p < 0.0001) were found to be inde- 
pendent risk factors for development of PTDM. 
Transplant center was independently associated 
with the risk of PTDM and there was a signiﬁcant 
interaction between transplant centers and the 
association between dialysis modality and PTDM 
(Table 4). Although, the diﬀerence in the incidence 
of PTDM between the dialysis modalities was not 
statistically signiﬁcant in any of the centers, p

1], p = 0.8 [center 2], p = 0.1 [center 3], p = 0.5 
[center 4], and p = 0.9 [center 5]). This might 
suggest that factors associated with the choice of 
PD or HD in some centers could have aﬀected the 
incidence of PTDM. 

PTDM, a well-known complication of renal trans- 
plantation, has been shown to be associated with 
lower graft and patient 
survival. Our group 
recently reported that it can also increase the risk 
of atherosclerotic events in RTRs (14). Pre-trans- 
plant identiﬁcation of patients at risk for PTDM 
and post-transplant monitoring are of utmost 
importance for timely implementation of preven- 
tive and therapeutic measures. Few European 
studies have so far focused on the incidence of 
PTDM in RTRs (15–19). Lack of a universally 
accepted deﬁnition for PTDM has likely contrib- 
uted to a signiﬁcant variation in the reported 
incident rates of this complication, ranging from 
2% to 53% (20). Recently, international consensus 
guidelines were published on the diagnosis and 
management of PTDM (6). These recommenda- 
tions are based on one of the common deﬁnitions 
of new-onset DM as well as the results of glucose 
tolerance test. However, most of the currently 
available studies on the impact of PTDM on 
transplant outcomes have used the ‘‘need for 
treatment’’ to identify these patients. Therefore, 
the clinical relevance of the consensus guidelines is 
yet to be established. Because of the design of our 
study, the recommended deﬁnition of the Ameri- 
can Diabetes Association (ADA) could not be 
applied; we used ‘‘the need for treatment’’ to 
identify patients with PTDM. We limited our 
analysis to the ﬁrst six months after transplanta- 
tion as the distinction between PTDM and type 2 
diabetes mellitus is diﬃcult to make after this 
period. Our results are consistent with previous 
reports from other European centers (15–19). 
In this study, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the 
incidence of PTDM among transplant centers 
persisted even after adjustment for other relevant 
parameters. Variation in demographic characteris- 
tics is unlikely to explain these diﬀerences as the 
study population was relatively homogeneous. 
Practice patterns are likely to explain, in part, the 
observed diﬀerence in the incidence of PTDM 
among centers. In fact, the management of mild- 
to-moderate elevation in fasting blood glucose level 
during the post-transplant period of tapering the 
steroids can be quite variable, especially if steroid 
withdrawal protocols are implemented. 


The lack of association between the pre-trans- 
plant dialysis modality and the risk of PTDM 
needs to be interpreted with caution. First, a type-I 
error cannot be excluded with certainty. Based on 
the incidence of PTDM and the proportion of the 
patients in each dialysis modality, our study had a 
power of 90% to detect a reduction of 40% in the 
incidence of PTDM in PD patients. To detect a 
more realistic diﬀerence of 20%, a study with more 
than 10 000 patients is needed. It is noteworthy 
that 
there was no trend observed towards a 
beneﬁcial or deleterious impact for each of the 
dialysis modalities. Second, only the latest dialysis 
modality prior to transplantation was considered; 
the switch between PD and HD that was not taken 
into account might have led to a bias in analysis. 
Finally, the reasons for each patient being treated 
with HD or PD may have created an unwanted 
selection bias. PD patients in our study were 
younger, had lower BMI, and were less likely to 
have a history of ADPKD or hepatitis C infection. 
There were also large discrepancies in the reparti- 
tion of PD and HD patients between centers. Even 
though these factors were taken into account in the 
logistic regression analysis, other unknown factors 
associated with the propensity of being on PD or 
HD could still have potentially aﬀected the results. 
We identiﬁed a number of clinical variables that 
are associated with PTDM. Higher BMI increased 
the risk of PTDM. This is consistent with the 
results of other studies that found an association 
between overweight and PTDM (21–23). Interest- 
ingly, the increased risk of PTDM in our study was 
not limited only to overweight or obese patients, 
but was also increased in patients with lower BMI 
compared with those with normal BMI (data not 
shown). Overweight is a potentially modiﬁable risk 
factor; and lifestyle changes might help reduce the 
risk of PTDM. Dietary advice, weight loss, and 
exercise should be an integral part of a compre- 
hensive pre- and post-transplant program. Age is 
also identiﬁed as an important risk factor for 
PTDM. Previous studies have consistently found 
PTDM to be more common in older patients 
compared with younger individuals (21, 24); it has 
been reported in <3% of children (25). 
Our study conﬁrms the results of previous 
observations on the association between tacrolimus 
and PTDM. In a meta-analysis by Webster et al., 
the RR of PTDM at six months, one yr, and 
three yr was found to be 2.56, 1.86, and 3.86, 
respectively (26). In a recently published study by 
Vincenti et al. (27), the authors observed an overall 
increased risk of PTDM or 
impaired fasting 
glycemia with CNI-based immunosuppression reg- 
imens; the risk was signiﬁcantly lower for CsA 

compared with tacrolimus. Acute rejection is also a 
risk factor for PTDM, which is likely due to the use 
of high doses of steroids for its management. 
This study has a number of limitations. Because 
of its retrospective design, the criteria for diagnosis 
and treatment of PTDM might have been diﬀerent 
among centers, and the observed incidence of 
PTDM could hence be dependent on the practice 
patterns of physicians in each center. Moreover, the 
impact of cumulative dose of steroids, a known risk 
factor for PTDM, could not be evaluated in our 
study. Early steroid withdrawal (i.e., during the 
ﬁrst month post-transplant) has been shown to 
decrease the risk of PTDM. As the steroid tapering 
protocols were very similar in the centers partici- 
pating in this study, the potential diﬀerence in the 
cumulative dose of steroids would mostly be related 
to the episodes of rejection and their therapy. 
In conclusion, our study does not ﬁnd any 
relationship between pre-transplant dialysis modal- 
ity and subsequent development of PTDM.
