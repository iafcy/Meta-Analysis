**survival outcome is not well understood. Methods: We studied allograft and recipient survival by using US Renal**
**Data System records from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999, with a follow-up period through December 31,**
**2000 (n �** **92,844; 60% males; 70% white; 23% black). Pretransplantation and predominant RRT modality during the**
**end-stage renal disease (ESRD) period and number and specific combinations of RRT modalities were evaluated.**
**_Results: Compared with hemodialysis (HD), a Cox model showed that peritoneal dialysis (PD) immediately before_**

**When predominant RRT modality was analyzed (modality used for > 50% of the ESRD time), PD (hazard ratio [HR],**

**associated with PD (HR, 0.96; P < 0.05). Increased number of RRT modalities during the ESRD course was**
**associated with increased risk for graft failure (HR, 1.04 per additional modality used; P < 0.005) and recipient death**

### The goal of the present project is to perform a retrospective analysis of US Renal Data System (USRDS) records to evaluate the role of renal replacement modalities, number of modalities used, and their combinations in allograft and recipient survival.

#### METHODS

### Data Set

Using the USRDS database, we collected data for all
kidney allograft recipients (both pediatric and adults) who
underwent kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation from
January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1999. Follow-up
data were collected through December 31, 2000.
For recipients of multiple transplants, the most recent one
was considered the target transplantation (transplant of interest). Patient records with missing information regarding
graft or patient survival were excluded from the study. A
total of 92,844 patients with a kidney transplant were identified. Records of patients with prior kidney transplants (n �
11,714) also were identified and analyzed separately.

### Outcome

There are 2 outcomes in this study. The first outcome is
time between the most recent kidney transplantation and
failure of the graft. The second outcome is time between the
most recent kidney transplantation and patient death. Both
outcomes were modeled by using continuous survival time
variables.
The graft failure definition did not include patient death
with a functioning graft, the latter determined in the USRDS
as a single binary variable. In case the value of this variable
was missing and the patient’s death date was equal to the
graft failure date, we assumed the patient died with a
functioning graft unless the cause of death was coded as one
of the following: 3200 (graft failure: primary failure), 3201
(graft failure: rejection), 3202 (graft failure: technical), 3299
(graft failure: other), or 3903 (miscellaneous: renal failure).
Allograft outcome was censored at the earliest of the
following events: loss to follow-up, patient death, or study
completion date (December 31, 2000) and analyzed as days
to graft failure or censor. Patient follow-up was censored at
the earliest of loss to follow-up or study completion date and
analyzed as day to recipient death or censor.

### Independent Variables

The primary variables of interest were those pertinent
to RRT from the USRDS database: RRT modality immediately before the current transplantation, predominant
RRT modality during the ESRD course (defined as modality used for �50% of the ESRD period; if none of the
modalities were used for �50%, the predominant modality was labeled “none”), number of different RRTs used,
combination of RRT modalities used (eg, peritoneal dialysis [PD] and hemodialysis [HD] and transplantation), and
time course during the pretransplantation period that the
patient was treated with a specific RRT modality. We
defined the use of a specific dialysis modality by using the


“60-day rule,” the convention adopted by the USRDS
stating that a dialysis modality must continue for at least
60 days to be considered stable and therefore constitute a
change in modality.
The final decision about which covariates to include into
final models was based primarily on known associations
between variables that could cause confounding of the
primary variables of interest; therefore, even variables with
no significant association with the outcome that were not
selected by the stepwise regression, but were deemed to be
clinically significant or represent potential confounding,
were included in the final model. Results of the stepwise
analysis were used only as a supportive tool. Covariates
included a recipient comorbidity score that used cardiovascular disease, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (similar to the Davis comorbidity index,[21] but limited to the comorbid conditions listed
that were collected at the time of transplantation); recipient
variables (age, sex, race, height, weight, history of hypertension, diabetes, history of prior transplant, total duration of
ESRD, total number of transplants, panel reactive antibody
levels [mean and peak], education level, primary source of
renal care payment, and citizenship); donor variables (heartbeating donor or not, age, sex, race, height, weight, number
of matched HLA antigens, and citizenship); and transplantation procedure variables (day of the week for the procedure,
season and year of the transplantation, and cold storage
time).
Other variables, delayed graft function, episodes of acute
rejection, and type of immunosuppressive medications were
not included in the models. Delayed graft function and acute
rejection may represent intermediate outcome, rather than
the confounding factor, and therefore we speculated that
adjusting for it might yield false-negative results (type 2
error: failure to reject null hypothesis).
Patients with a prior history of kidney transplantation
were analyzed separately and the following variables were
added to the analysis: donor type for the transplantation
immediately before the current transplantation, age at first
transplantation, age at first graft failure, age at transplantation immediately before the current transplantation and at
graft failure immediately before the current transplantation,
and time between last transplant failure and current transplantation. To reduce lead time bias, the models also were
adjusted for total duration of ESRD.

### Statistical Analysis

Categorical variables in the subgroups were compared
by using cross-tabulation. Continuous variables were summarized by using means and SDs. Kaplan-Meier graphs
and Cox regression models were used for survival analysis. To avoid collinearity between the primary variables of
interest, we analyzed them in separate Cox models. SAS
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for survival analysis
(Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models),
whereas S-Plus (Insightful, Seattle, WA) was used for
descriptive statistics and tree-based modeling for data
imputation.

#### RESULTS

### Baseline Characteristics The data set consisted of 92,844 records of patients receiving kidney or kidney-pancreas transplants starting January 1, 1990, and through December 31, 1999. Study population character- istics are listed in Table 1. Average age was 43.3 years, and 60% were male. The graft failed during the 11 years of the study period in 34.9% of patients. We compared some baseline charac- teristics in patients on HD and PD therapy as a predominant pretransplantation modality. Aver- age ages were 44.8 � 13.7 years in HD patients and 41.1 � 15.1 years in PD patients (P � 0.001), comorbidity scores were 0.86 � 0.81 in HD patients and 0.82 � 0.78 years in PD patients (P � 0.001), pretransplantation durations of ESRD were 2.63 � 2.86 years in HD patients and 2.11 � 1.96 years in PD patients (P � 0.001), total numbers of transplants before the current one were 1.08 � 0.31 in HD patients and 1.05 � 0.25 in PD patients (P � 0.001), and peak and mean panel reactive antibody levels were 12.01 � 21.89 and 5.15 � 14.83 for HD patients and 9.93 � 19.47 and 4.15 � 12.98 for PD patients, respectively (P � 0.001 for both). Numbers of matched HLA antibodies between recipient and donor were 1.80 � 1.52 in HD patients and 1.84 � 1.54 in PD patients (P � 0.001). Finally, donor ages were 34.72 � 15.64 years in HD patients and 33.81 � 15.41 years in PD patients (P � 0.001).

 RRT Modality Immediately Before Transplantation The Cox model using HD as a reference showed the following results. Having a transplant immedi- ately before the transplantation of interest without dialysis therapy in between was associated with increased risk for graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65; P � 0.001). PD as a modality immediately before transplantation predicts better graft outcome compared with HD (HR, 0.97; P � 0.05; Table 2). A similar association was found in the subgroup of patients with a previous history of kidney transplan- tation: having the transplantation as an RRT modal- ity before the last transplantation without going on dialysis therapy in between poses a greater risk for graft failure (HR, 1.99; P � 0.001) in this subgroup


### of patients (Table 3). The protective effect of PD therapy is not significant in this patient subgroup. In the analysis of recipient survival in the Cox model using HD as a reference, both prior trans- plantation (HR, 0.80; P � 0.005) and PD (HR, 0.94; P � 0.001) had a protective effect on recipient survival compared with HD. This asso- ciation was confirmed again in the subgroup of patients who had prior transplants, although the difference between PD and reference (HD) pa- tients was not statistically significant (Table 3).

 Predominant RRT Modality Predominant RRT modality, defined as RRT modality used for more than 50% of the entire ESRD period, was analyzed in a Cox model in relation to graft survival; both PD (HR, 0.97; P � 0.05) and transplantation (HR, 0.86; P � 0.001) had a protective effect for graft survival compared with HD. Absence of the predominant modality (each modality was used for � 50% of the duration of ESRD or no RRT was used) also was associated with lower risk for graft failure (HR, 0.90; P � 0.001; Table 2). These results were illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots (Fig 1A). In the Cox model, better recipient survival also was associated with both PD (HR, 0.96; P � 0.05) and transplantation (HR, 0.82; P � 0.001) as predominant pretransplantation RRT modali- ties. Patients who had no predominant modality during the ESRD course also had better survival compared with HD, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR, 0.921; P � 0.063). The worst patient outcome associated with HD is illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots (Fig 1B). The same trends for graft and recipient survival were found in the subgroup of patients with prior transplants (Table 3).

 Number of Different Modalities Used We calculated the number of different RRT modalities that a patient was exposed to during the ESRD course by using the 60-day rule, in which the change in dialysis technique is con- sidered stable if the patient remained on a new modality for 60 or more days (the 60-day rule does not apply to transplantation). We ana- lyzed the Cox model and showed that number of RRT modalities is a significant predictor of graft failure (HR, 1.04 per additional modality; P � 0.001) and recipient death (HR, 1.11 per

NOTE. The Cox model represents multivariate analysis of graft and recipient survival. To avoid colinearity between the
primary variables of interest, they were analyzed in separate Cox models. Only primary variables of interest are listed in the
table. All models also were adjusted for the following covariates: recipient variables: age, sex, race, height, weight, history of
hypertension, diabetes, comorbidity score, total duration of ESRD, total number of transplants, panel reactive antibody levels
(mean and peak), education level, primary source of renal care payment, and citizenship; donor variables: heart-beating
donor or not, age, sex, race, height, weight, number of matched HLA antigens, and citizenship; transplant procedure
variables: day of the week for the procedure, season and year of the transplantation, and cold storage time; parameters of
prior transplant(s): donor type for the transplant immediately before the current transplant, age at first transplantation, age at
first graft failure, age at transplantation immediately before the current transplantation and at graft failure immediately before
the current transplantation, and time between last transplant failure and current transplantation.

### RRT modality. Similarly, 0 modality used be- fore transplantation was associated with the best recipient survival, but increased number of modalities greater than 1 does not affect recipient survival (Fig 2B).


### Combination of Different RRT Modalities We considered 8 different combinations of RRT modalities during the ESRD course indepen- dent of the sequence and number of times a patient would return to a particular modality: PD

### only, HD only, transplantation only, PD plus HD, PD plus transplantation, HD plus transplanta- tion, all 3 modalities, and none. We define combi- nations of RRT modalities by using the 60-day rule described. In the Cox model (HD only was used as a reference group), any combination or single modality (except for transplantation only, PD plus HD, and none) was better than HD only (Table 2). In particular, PD only was associated with an HR of 0.93 (P � 0.001). PD plus HD and none were associated with a not statistically significant greater risk. When patient survival was evaluated, modality combinations showing the significant difference with the reference group (HD only) were PD only (HR, 0.90; P � 0.001) and none (HR, 0.81; P � 0.001) and also PD plus HD (HR, 1.10; P � 0.001). When patients with prior transplants were analyzed separately com

### pared with HD alone, PD alone was associated with lower risk for graft failure (HR, 0.60; P � 0.05); PD plus HD plus transplantation also was beneficial (HR, 0.79; P � 0.005), as well as HD plus transplantation (HR, 0.791; P � 0.005; Table 3). When recipient survival was used as an outcome, PD plus transplantation (HR, 0.73; P � 0.05), HD plus transplantation (HR, 0.74; P � 0.005), and transplantation only (HR, 0.62; P � 0.0005) were associated with lower mortality risk.

 Number of Years on Specific Dialysis Modality The Cox model discussed in this section was not adjusted for total duration of ESRD to avoid colinearity with the primary variables of interest. The duration of both dialysis modalities was associated with greater risk for graft failure.

### Each year of PD therapy is associated with an HR of 1.02 (P � 0.005), and each year of HD therapy is associated with an HR of 1.02 (P � 0.001). Conversely, number of years with a func- tioning graft in the past had a protective effect on current graft survival (HR, 0.98; P � 0.001). In the subgroup of patients with a prior transplant, the same trend is true, but the association be- tween duration of PD therapy and graft failure is not statistically significant (Table 2). We per- formed the same analysis for recipient survival and showed similar associations. The longer the patient was on HD (HR, 1.05; P � 0.0001) or PD therapy (HR, 1.04; P � 0.005), the greater the risk for dying, whereas number of years with a prior transplant did not make a significant differ- ence. Recipient survival in the subgroup of pa- tients with a prior transplant also was analyzed. Number of years on PD (HR, 1.05; P � 0.005) or


### HD therapy (HR, 1.04; P � 0.001) was associ- ated with greater risk for recipient mortality, whereas number of years with a functioning graft was not associated with a significant change (Table 2).

#### DISCUSSION

### Prediction of renal transplant recipient and graft survival presents an important clinical tool, espe- cially in view of the growing shortage of renal transplants. Almost half the transplant recipients die with a functioning graft. In the rest, the allograft fails because of chronic renal allograft dysfunction. Although many risk factors are known (as de- scribed), the role of pretransplantation RRT modal- ity in both graft and patient survival was not clear from the literature. In general, prior studies compar- ing different RRTmodalities in relation to transplan- tation outcome were based on small data sets[16,22];

### evaluated short-term, rather than long-term, out- come[16,18,23,24]; did not study combination of RRT modalities or were performed 10 to 20 years ago, before significant changes in immunosuppressive regimens[22-26]; and most studies examined graft outcome only, not patient survival. In addition, most investigators evaluated the role of RRTmodal- ity immediately before transplantation, rather than predominant modality, as a primary variable of interest. Patients who were on PD therapy for a number of years and were switched to HD therapy immediately before transplantation would be classi- fied as HD in these studies, which introduced a significant degree of misclassification bias.As listed in Table 4, there is significant discrepancy between RRT modality before transplantation and predomi- nant RRT modality in the USRDS data set. Previous studies of short-term transplantation outcome have yielded somewhat conflicting re- sults. A greater rate of early graft failure was associated with PD therapy, shown by[27]. In the report by Bleyer et al,[18] the investigators evalu- ated delayed graft function after deceased donor transplantation based on dialysis modality imme- diately before and found an association between HD therapy and delayed graft function. Similar results were shown by other investiga- tors.[16,17,27–29] Vanholder et al[16] also showed the advantage of PD therapy for short-term outcome: patients on PD therapy had a reduced incidence of acute renal failure. PD therapy is recom- mended to be chosen as an initial modality in patients who plan kidney transplantation within 2 to 3 years.[30]
 Although there was no association between dialysis modality and graft thrombosis in 1 re- port,[31] several other studies reported an in- creased incidence of graft thrombosis associated


### with PD compared with HD.[27,32-35] A greater rate of graft thrombosis in PD patients might occur because hypercoagulable states are not detected as readily in PD patients as in HD patients. A greater rate of acute rejection was associated with PD therapy[16]; however, in other reports, acute rejection rates were not different between patients on PD versus HD therapy be- fore transplantation.[18,26,29,35]
 PD was associated with a greater rate of post- transplantation infection compared with patients on HD therapy in some reports,[36] but in others, infection rates between PD and HD patients were similar[16,37] or lower in patients with pretransplan- tation PD therapy.[38]
 When long-term outcome (1 and 5 years) was studied, no difference between dialysis modali- ties was reported.[26] Similarly, PD and HD showed similar 1-year outcome in a report by Donnelly et al[24] in the mid-1980s. In a small case-control analysis, 1-year transplantation outcome in pa- tients on continuous ambulatory PD therapy was not significantly different from that in HD pa- tients with similar clinical characteristics.[22] Simi- lar long-term graft and patient survival was achieved independent of dialysis modality be- fore transplantation in a retrospective analysis of the first cadaveric graft. Graft and patient sur- vival cases were identical in the HD and continu- ous ambulatory PD groups (5-year graft survival: continuous ambulatory PD, 67%; HD, 66%; 5-year patient survival: continuous ambulatory PD, 88%; HD, 87%).[25]
 No difference in long-term outcome between patients treated with PD compared with HD was shown in other studies.[23,29,39,40] Snyder et al[27]
 compared long-term transplant outcome between PD and HD patients and showed that, compared

### with pretransplantation HD, death-censored long- term graft failure was 15% greater in patients on PD therapy and short-term graft failure was 33% greater. Their analysis was based on 22,776 Medi- care beneficiaries with a kidney transplant. Com- pared with our analysis, the study by Snyder et al[27] used a smaller number of patients and shorter follow-up (3 years), and some baseline character- istics of the study population were different from ours (pediatric patients and those with prior history of transplantation were excluded). Those investigators studied pretransplantation dialysis modality (based on a United Network for Organ Sharing form) adjusted for dialysis modality change as a binary variable, whereas we evalu- ated the role of both pretransplantation and pre- dominant dialysis modality, as well as number of modalities used and their combinations. In our study, compared with HD, PD therapy immediately before transplantation has a protec- tive effect on graft and recipient survival. Al- though the effect size associated with PD therapy is modest, we disprove previous reports claiming a greater long-term risk associated with PD therapy. We evaluated the role of predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course. PD, transplantation, and preemptive or very short- course dialysis therapy had a protective effect for graft and recipient survival. This approach again confirmed an advantage for allograft and recipi- ent survival of PD over HD as a modality imme- diately before transplantation and as a predomi- nant modality during the ESRD course.Although statistically significant, the effect size of dialysis modality is limited (HRs of 0.97 and 0.94 for graft and recipient survival for PD as an RRT modality immediately before transplantation and HRs of 0.97 and 0.96 for graft and recipient survival for PD as a predominant RRT modality compared with HD, respectively). For compari- son, the effect size of other predictors of graft and recipient survival evaluated in our analysis were as follows: recipient age (HR, 1.01; P � 0.001; HR, 1.04; P � 0.001 per year of life for graft and recipient survival, respectively), recipi- ent history of diabetes (HR, 0.96; P � 0.48; HR, 1.11; P � 0.107 for graft and recipient survival, respectively), recipient comorbidity score (HR, 1.1; P � 0.001; HR, 1.26; P � 0.001 per unit increase in score for graft and recipient survival, respectively), living donor compared with de

### ceased donor (HR, 0.68; P � 0.001; HR, 0.67; P � 0.001 for graft and recipient survival, respec- tively), donor age (HR, 1.01; P � 0.001; HR, 1.01; P � 0.001 per year of life for graft and recipient survival, respectively), and number of HLA-matched antigens (HR, 0.94; P � 0.001; HR, 0.96; P � 0.001 per antigen matched for graft and recipient survival, respectively). Number of RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is a significant predictor of graft failure and recipient death. Almost any single RRT modality or their combination was associ- ated with better graft and recipient outcome than HD only. The mechanism of the outcome observed in our analysis is not completely clear. Residual renal function that might be better preserved in patients on PD therapy may contribute to better preservation of kidney function after transplanta- tion.[41] One can hypothesize that the degree of residual renal function is more important for graft and recipient outcome than either PD or HD modality. Unfortunately, we did not have informa- tion about residual renal function for the entire study population. Answering this question could be a subject of another research project. Further- more, body mass index and degree of hypervol- emia might be different in PD and HD patients and therefore confound results. The rate of post- transplantation infections associated with HD might be greater compared with PD.[38] In addi- tion, there are some indications that HD mem- branes and vascular access might cause sensitiza- tion in transplant candidates.[42] It has been shown that HD patients have elevated levels of natural killer cells[43] and production of cytokines.[44] Other immunologic differences might exist between HD and PD patients. It was postulated that PD modifies the population of T-helper (TH) cells, with an increase in percentage of TH subtype 2 (TH2) cells and normal percentage of TH1 cells.[45]
 TH2 cells produce interleukin 4 and interleukin 10, which inhibit interferon � secretion and cell immunity,[46] and increased TH2 cell fraction may provide additional immunosuppression. Potential selection bias should be considered when interpreting results of this study. We specu- lated that the decision regarding dialysis modal- ity was made based on patient age, diabetic status, comorbidity, ability to learn the tech- nique, prior history of abdominal surgeries, dis

### tance to the dialysis center, and status of the vascular access. Adjusting our multivariate mod- els for recipient age, diabetic status, comorbidity index, socioeconomic status (indicated by educa- tional level, primary source of pay for renal care, and citizenship), and duration of ESRD should considerably reduce the selection bias. We recog- nize that some factors not included in the models (eg, exhausted vascular access) might force selec- tion of the dialysis modality and confound re- sults. Although our models were adjusted care- fully for pertinent covariates, the HD and PD populations are different in our study, as well as in other reports. For example, it has been shown that PD patients are more likely to undergo transplantation than HD patients in the group of adults[27] and, to a lesser extent, group of pediatric patients.[47] One can speculate regarding the causes of this discrepancy, eg, demographic characteris- tics and potentially the more assertive personal- ity of PD patients versus HD patients might make them more aggressive in pursuing trans- plantation. In our study population, PD was a pretransplantation RRT modality in 21.8% and predominant RRT modality in 22.6% of patients, whereas in the dialysis population, PD patients comprise less than 15%.[48] To explain this phe- nomenon, Snyder et al[27] proposed that there is a perception among physicians that PD patients may be better candidates for transplantation[16,30]
 and therefore selection bias, in which potential transplantation candidates are more likely to be placed on PD therapy than HD. Other potential shortcomings should be considered in interpret- ing results of this retrospective data analysis. Retrospective analysis of a data registry shows the association (but not necessarily causative relationships) between the primary variables of interest and outcome. The sequence of PD and HD for patients receiving both has not been evaluated in this study and might be a subject of future research. In conclusion, our results suggest that com- pared with PD, HD as an RRT modality immedi- ately before transplantation or as a predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course, used alone or in combination with other RRT modali- ties, is associated with increased risk for graft failure and recipient death. Increased number of RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is associated with worsening of graft and recipient


### survival. PD is a reasonable choice of RRT and should not be avoided in transplantation candi- dates.
