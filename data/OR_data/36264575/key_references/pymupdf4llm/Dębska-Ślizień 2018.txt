#### Abstract

 The impact of dialysis modality before transplantation (HD or PD) on outcomes is not clear.

 We retrospectively analyzed the impact of dialysis modality on post-transplantation follow up. To

 minimize the donor bias, a paired kidney analysis was applied. 133 pairs of peritoneal dialysis

 (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients transplanted in our center between 1994 and 2016 who

 received kidneys from the same donor were included.

 HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was

 similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to

 immunosuppressive protocols and the number of mismatches 2.96 vs 2.95.

 One-year patient (98% vs 96%) and graft (90% vs 93%) survival was similar in PDP and HDP

 group. The Kaplan-Meier curves of patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. DGF

 and AR occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting

 in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and in 4 HD (3%) patients (p>0.05). Creatinine serum

 concentration and eGFR (MDRD) one-month, one-year, and at last visit, did not differ.

 On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with graft loss were: graft vessels

 thrombosis, DGF, graft function one month after transplantation. On univariate analysis the age,

coronary heart disease, graft loss were associated with death. Amongst these factors only coronary heart

disease ("Model 1") and graft loss were significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.

#### Conclusion: Long-term outcome of renal transplantation is similar in patients coming from either

 PD or HD. Those groups of patients differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular

 thrombosis in PDP, and to DGF and AR in HDP.

INTRODUCTION

Renal transplantation remains the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage renal


disease (ESRD). Studies examining the association between dialysis modality, i.e. hemodialysis (HD) or

peritoneal dialysis (PD), and patient and graft survival after transplantation have shown ambiguous results.

Some studies reported that there was no association between dialysis modality and the patient and graft


outcome after transplantation [1-6]. However, Goldfarb-Rumyantzev et al. in 92,844 US ESRD patients,

observed that kidney transplant recipients on PD before transplantation had a lower risk of death, and a

lower risk of (death-censored) graft failure than HD patients [7]. Molmar et al. in 12,416 HD and 2,092

PD US patients found that PD recipients had lower mortality, but similar graft loss or delayed graft

function [8]. On the other hand, Snyder et al. in 22,776 US ESRD patients noticed that death censored

graft failure was 1.15 times higher in PD vs HD patients, but mortality and overall graft failure rates were

not different. In that study, transplantation in PD patients was more frequently associated with early, but

not late, graft failure. In those patients for whom data on the cause of early graft failure was available,

graft thrombosis was more frequent in PD patients [9]. Similar observations were also reported in the

studies of Ojo et al., Murphy et al. and van der Vliet et al. [10-12]. Vats et al. analyzing 1,090 PD and 780

HD children, found that graft loss resulting from vascular thrombosis was more common in children who

were on PD before transplantation [13]. Martins et al. in the most recent study, analyzing the impact of

dialysis modality on the outcome of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) in type 1

diabetic patients, found that transplantation in PD patients was more frequently complicated with intra
abdominal infection leading to pancreatic loss, and with renal thrombosis with an adverse impact on graft

survival [14]. The effect of dialysis modality on early post-transplant infections also remains

controversial. While some studies have noted a higher incidence of infections in PD patients in the first

month after transplant [15] others failed to show differences in the rate of post-transplant infections in PD

and HD patients [16].

The primary goal of this single-center study was to analyze short and long-term outcomes of

kidney transplantation in pre-transplant PD and HD patients. We also studied the incidence of

postoperative complications, with a focus on post-transplant vascular thrombosis, infectious complications

and delayed graft function. In order to minimize the impact of donor variability and bias, paired kidney


analysis was applied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Peritoneal dialysis patients (n=207) constituted 13.7% (207 from 1505) of all kidney transplantations

performed in Gdansk Transplantation Center between December 1994, when the first patient dialyzed by

means of PD was transplanted, and December 2016. 133 of those peritoneal dialysis patients (PDP) who

had a paired kidney recipient from the same donor, who was on hemodialysis (HDP) before

transplantation, were included in the analysis. Patients who sequentially underwent both dialysis

modalities were excluded from the study. Only patients receiving few hemodialysis sessions before

starting long-lasting PD were accepted. Patients receiving second and next KTx were excluded from the

study.

Statistical Analyses

Quantitative variables were presented as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with inter
quartile range (IQR). Qualitative data was shown as numbers and percentages.

Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, whereas chi
square test or Fisher’s exact test were applied for categorical variables.

Survival curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival between PD

group and HD group were compared using log-rank [17] test and Renyi’s test (supreme version of the

weighted log-rank test) [18]. The reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator [19] was used to evaluate median

follow-up. Univariate and multivariate models were based only on Cox proportional hazards regression

[20]. Results from the Cox regressions were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence

intervals (CIs).

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were built using the following strategies: only significant

variables (P value of 0.05 or less) with univariate models (model 1), and forward selection (model 2).

The assumption of proportionality hazards was evaluated by including time-dependent interactions of each


variable, and tested using Schoenfeld residuals [21].

In order to verify the linearity of continuous covariates, the martingale residuals [2022] with LOESS

(local polynomial regression) curve were plotted.


The goodness of fit of multiple regression was assessed using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The

2-tailed tests were carried out at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05.

All statistical analyses were performed using R package version 3.2.3.

RESULTS

Recipient Characteristics

The PDP group consisted of 133 (65 male, 68 female) patients aged between 12 and 71 (mean 44.42 ±

15.1) years. The HDP group also constituted 133 ( 86 male, 47 female) patients aged between 19 and 81

(mean 48.88 ± 15.5). The PDP patients were significantly younger (t-Student Test, p=0.04), but with

regard to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [23, 24] we found no differences in the number of

comorbidities between PDP and HDP patients (3.12 vs 3.46).

The underlying renal diseases in the PDP and HDP groups included chronic glomerulonephritis (38.5% vs

31.8%), chronic interstitial nephritis (6.2% vs 7.7%), diabetic nephropathy (14.6% vs 15.5%), cystic

kidney disease (7.7% vs 11.6%), hypertensive nephropathy (12.3% vs 14.0%), and not known and others

about 20% in both groups.

Dialysis time before transplantation was significantly shorter in PDP than in HDP group (20.35 ± 17 vs

33.55± 36 mo.; p<0.05).

The frequency of diabetes type 1 and 2 was equal in PDP and HDP (15/9; p>0.05). The time on the

waiting list for PDP recipients (mean 4.9 ± 5; range 1 day to 23 mo.) and HDP (mean 5.2 ± 8; range 1

#### 3

days to 45 mo.) was not different (P >0.05) – available data from years 2011-2016. The PDP and HDP

groups did not differ with respect to types of immunosuppressive protocols, mean total ischemia time


(14h 33' vs 14h 48') and panel reactive antibody titers (6.1/3.1% vs 4.6/1.2% historical and current,

respectively).

Patients characteristics were performed in Tab. 1.


Donor Characteristics

The donors for PDP and HDP recipients (87 male, 52 female) were aged between 15 and 74 (mean 43.3

±14) years. Their mean eGFR (Cockroft-Gault) level was 114.2 ± 45 mL/min/1.73 m[2]. The cause of donor

death was traumatic in 42%, cerebrovascular in 52% and other factors accounted for 6% of the deaths.

According to deceased-donor score (A,B,C,D) the categories of donors were as follows: A - 41; B - 50; C
36; D- 1; no data – 5 in the PDP group and A - 40; B - 49; C - 38; D- 1; no data - 5 for the HDP group.

The groups slightly differed due to the fact that in deceased-donor score, the number of mismatches

between donor and recipient is therefore also taken into account [25].

Post-transplantation follow-up in PDP and HDP Groups

The post-transplantation follow-up for the PDP and HDP groups is presented in Table 2. The groups (PDP

vs HDP) differ significantly with respect to the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). 28 (21.05%)

PDP patients, and 57 (42.86%) HDP patients experienced DGF (P< 0.05). DGF was defined as the need

for hemodialysis during the first week after transplantation. The incidences of acute rejection (AR) were

significantly fewer in the PDP (14.3% vs 32.3%) in PDP vs HDP, respectively; p<0.05). AR was not

always biopsy-proven, so the probability of mis-diagnosis of AR in patients suffering from DGF was

probable.

The most common complications were infections: urinary tract infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV),

and also new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). PDP and HDP had a similar rate of bacterial

infections (mostly urinary tract infection) (p>0.05), and the duration of the first hospitalization was

slightly longer in HDP group (24.1 vs 22.2 days, p>0.05). The number of cardiovascular complications

was small, and similar in both groups.


Among the surgical complications, the most common were lymphoceles, hematomas, urinary fistulas,

ureter obstructions and graft vessels thrombosis. The amount of early graft vessel thrombosis was higher

in PDP as compared to HDP: 6, 7.2%vs3% (p>0.05).


On univariate analysis PD was not a risk factor for graft vessel thrombosis (Tab. 3)

In multivariate “forward model“ analysis (Tab. 4). PD can be directed as an independent risk factor for

graft vessels thrombosis, the risk was almost 3 times higher than in HDP (p=0.09).

Comparison of graft function in the PDP and HDP Groups

A comparison of the concentration of serum creatinine and eGFR measured at a few time points after

transplantation (after 1 months, after 12 months, and during the last ambulatory control, was similar in

both groups, test P>0.05 – Tab. 5. During long-term follow-ups patients were losing their grafts mainly

due to IF/TA, and suspicion of non-compliance to medications.

Comparison of Patient Survival and Graft Survival

During the follow-up (0.5 to 23 years) 8 and 12 patients died in PDP and HDP groups, respectively.

Causes of death were mainly malignancy and cardiovascular diseases (Table 6).

The groups (PDP vs HDP) did not differ significantly from each other with respect to 1-year patient

survival (98% vs 96%) and 1-year death censored graft survival (90% vs 93%) and 1-year graft survival

(89% vs 90%). The Kaplan-Meier curves of patients and graft and death-censored graft survival did not

differ significantly (Fig 1,2,3).

### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


During follow-up there were a total of 20 death events - estimated median length of follow-up was 46

months (95% CI: 26-57) .


On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with death-censored graft loss were: DGF, graft

vessels thrombosis, infections (mainly UIT) and graft function one month after transplantation, the

independent predictors upon multivariate analysis were: DGF, graft vessels thrombosis and eGFR (Table

7, 8). DGF, graft vessels thrombosis, graft function one month after transplantation were independent

factors of graft loss (Table 9, 10). On univariate analysis the age, coronary heart disease, graft loss were

associated with death. Amongst these factors only coronary heart disease ("Model 1") and graft loss were

significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.

(Table 11, 12).

DISCUSSION

Previous single-center studies have brought contradictory results in estimation of the influence of

pre-transplant dialysis modality on transplantation outcome in recipients receiving grafts from the same

donor. Our study groups PDP and HDP were comparable in respect of comorbidities, gender and CCI,

mean age of HDP group was higher. Patients received kidneys from donors with excellent kidney function

and were given similar types of initial immunosuppressive protocols. Short and long-term medical care

was performed by the same transplant team. This methodological factor mitigates the confounding

influence of differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of donors, as well as different

transplant center surgical and medical protocols, on the results. The groups (PDP vs HDP) did not differ

significantly from each other with respect to 1-year patient survival and 1-year death censored graft

survival and 1-year graft survival.

While some studies have failed to find a difference in outcomes [1,2,3,4,5,6], others have found PD to

have some beneficial effects after renal transplantation compared to HD [7, 8, 9]. In our center, PDP had a

similar to HDP one-year patient survival (98% vs 96%), one-year death censored graft survival (90% vs

93%) and one-year graft survival (89% vs 90%). The Kaplan-Meier curves showing long-term follow-up


(0.5-23 years) patients and graft survivals did not differ significantly in PDP and HDP (Fig 1, 2, 3).

Cardiovascular, and most other, complications listed in table 2 were observed in similar frequency in PDP

and HDP; Infectious complication were equally common in both groups. Graft function in both groups did


not differ, both early and late, after transplantation. Similar numbers of patients died during the follow-up;

main causes of death (cardiovascular disease or neoplasm) were not different.

However, the studied groups have differed in certain aspects. Some studies have shown PDP to

experience fewer incidences of DGF (8, 9, 26, 27) the others have not (4). In our center, in quite well
matched groups, we confirmed that PDP experienced significantly less DGF. In PDP we also diagnosed a

significantly fewer number of ARs, although the diagnosis was usually based on clinical symptoms and

doppler US, and in HDP experiencing much more frequently DGF, the number of ARs could be

overestimated. On the other hand, DGF may predispose to rejection [20].

PD patients have been reported to be more likely to have allograft vascular thrombosis, compared to

patients treated with HD [10-14]. The incidence of vascular thrombosis at our center was higher in PDP as

compared to HDP but not significantly (multivariate “forward model“ analysis the risk in PDP was

almost 3 times higher than in HDP).

What is to be noticed is that among PDP were more individuals with type 1 diabetes (DM1) (11vs 7% in

PDP and HDP respectively), but none of patients with thrombosis suffered from DM 1. In HDP

thrombosis occurred in three patients, and none of them was diabetic. Martins et al. in his recent study

analyzing the impact of dialysis modality on the outcome of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation

(SPKT) in DM1 patients, found that transplantation in PD patients was more frequently complicated with

renal thrombosis with an adverse impact on survival [14]. There are several risk factors for vascular

thrombosis in solid organ transplantation; such as multiple vessels, technical problems during

anastomosis, very young pediatric donors or elderly donors, thrombocytosis, hemoconcentration,

hypotension and the existence of a previous transplant and hypercoagulable states [10,29]. Diabetes itself

has been considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis [30]. Controversies still exist whether PD by

itself predisposes to a thrombophilic state [10]. However, patients with vascular access problems are


referred more often to PD, possibly due to a pre-existing prothrombotic state in some of them. Robertson

et al. [31] and Scheffert et al. [29] reported potential beneficial effects of aspirin and low-dose heparin

started in the early post-operative period, at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding in PKT. Schenker et


al. have found better results using low molecular-weight heparin [32].

In our transplant center low molecular-weight heparin is a standard in post-operative protocols. However,

taking into consideration our, and other authors’, observations, both in kidney transplantation and PKT,

the use of small doses of aspirin could be conceivable.

Our results show that short and long-term patients and graft survival are independent of the pre-transplant

dialysis modality. Those groups of patients differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular

thrombosis in PDP, and to DGF and AR in HDP. As PD first strategy, besides pre-emptive

transplantation, in ESRD patients is advised, the risk of renal thrombosis should be taken into

consideration and appropriate measures undertaken.

```
A paired kidney analysis was applied to evaluate the impact of dialysis modality on
post-transplantation follow up in 133 pairs receiving grafts from the same donor. 
Long-term transplantation outcome is similar in patients coming from either PD or
HD. 
PD and HD groups differ in some aspects, such as susceptibility to vascular
thrombosis in PD, and to DGF and AR in HD.
