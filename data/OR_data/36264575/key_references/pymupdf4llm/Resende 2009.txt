 ABSTRACT Background. The influence of pretransplantation dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes has been the subject of longstanding interest. Although increased time on dialysis prior to kidney transplantation is associated with decreased graft and patient survivals, analyses of the impact of dialysis modality on kidney allograft outcome have produced conflicting results. Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of dialysis duration and modality on the function and survival of renal allografts. Patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 421 adults who received first kidney transplantations from cadaveric heart-beating donors performed in our unit from May 1989 to May 2007. Three hundred seventy-four patients (88.8%) were on hemodial- ysis (HD) prior to kidney transplantation, including 247 patients (58.7%) on treatment for at least 24 months. Results. Patients with a dialysis duration �24 months were significantly older (45.9 vs 42.8 years; P � .013). Renal function at 3, 12, 60, and 96 months was similar between the 2 groups. Longer duration on dialysis was associated with poorer overall graft and patient survivals. No differences were observed in renal function or graft and patient survivals comparing HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of correlation between dialysis duration or modality and allograft failure. Conclusion. Longer dialysis duration influenced overall graft and patient survival. However, dialysis modality showed no influence on graft function or survival.

##### OR SUITABLE patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation is recognized as the
# F
##### therapy of choice, being superior to dialysis in terms of quality of life and long-term mortality risk.[1] Several studies demonstrate that pre-emptive kidney transplantation is advan- tageous not only for graft survival but also for patient sur- vival.[2–4] However, not all patients have a potential living donor, and therefore undergo hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal- dialysis (PD) while awaiting a cadaveric donor kidney. Increased time on dialysis prior to transplantation has been shown to be a predictor of negative short-term outcomes[5]
 and transplant recipient survival.[6] Regarding the type of pretransplantation renal replacement therapy (RRT), HD is associated with a greater incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation.[7,8] An increased inci- dence of graft thrombosis has been associated with PD.[9] A greater rate of acute rejection episodes was associated with PD in some studies;[7] however, other reports note a similar occurrence between PD and HD.[5] PD was also associated with a greater rate of posttransplantation infection com- pared with patients on HD therapy in some[10] but not other studies, which suggest rates to be similar[7,11] or lower[12]
 between PD and HD patients. Influence of pretransplanta- tion RRT on graft and patient survivals has produced conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of dialysis duration and modality on the function and survival of renal allografts.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Between May 1989 and May 2007, we performed 421 first kidney
transplantations from cadaveric heart beating donors in adults
(�18 years). All patients were on either HD or PD prior to
transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data:
recipient age and gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, dialysis
modality prior to the transplantation, last panel-reactive antibody
(PRA), donor age and gender, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
mismatch, cold ischemia time, DGF (characterized as the need for
dialysis on the first week posttransplantation), acute rejection
episodes (histological diagnosis or antirejection treatment), and
renal function at 3, 12, 60, and 96 months. All patients were treated
with a calcineurin inhibitor–based immunosuppressive regimen.
Induction therapy with a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody was
administered to 109 patients. Estimated glomerular filtration rates
(eGFR) were calculated using the 4-variable Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, based on serum
creatinine level, age, gender, and race.
Results were expressed as mean values � SD. Univariate
analysis was performed using the chi-square test and Student t test
for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Kaplan-Meier
analysis was used to calculate actuarial graft survival and log-rank
tests to compare survivals. Risk factors for graft failure were
examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis.
All P values were two-tailed; a P value �.05 was considered
significant.

RESULTS

##### Among 421 adult patients who underwent a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at our institution from May 1989 to


##### May 2007, 284 were males (67.5%) and the overall mean age at the time of transplantation was 44.6 � 12.7 years. Prior to transplantation, 374 patients (88.8%) were on HD and 47 patients (11.2%) were on PD. The mean dialysis duration was 37.6 � 30.2 months (minimum, 1 month; maximum, 172 months). Mean follow-up time was 73.1 � 52.7 months. Patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the dialysis duration �24 months or �24 months. Donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients with a dialysis duration �24 months were significantly older (45.9 vs 42.8 years; P � .013). No differences were observed in the occurrence of DGF, acute rejection episodes, or graft function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 months. Kaplan- Meier analysis with survival censored for death with a functioning graft showed similar outcomes (P � .922). Longer duration on dialysis was associated with poorer overall graft (P � .047) and patient survivals (P � .014; Fig 1). When comparing HD versus PD therapy, there were no differences in donor and recipient characteristics, occurrence of DGF, acute rejection episodes, or graft function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 months. On Kaplan-Meier analysis censored for death with a functioning graft (P � .535), overall graft (P � .675), and patient survival (P � .981) rates were similar.

DIALYSIS DURATION AND MODALITY 839

##### survival,[7,8,13] whereas other reports did not show long-term graft and patient survivals to be affected by the dialysis modality.[6] Our results showed no differences between PD and HD on short-term or long-term graft and patient survivals. However, the small number of patients on PD prior to kidney transplantation impaired statistical power when compared with subjects on HD prior to transplanta- tion. Our study supported the concept that dialysis duration influenced overall graft and patient survivals. The choice of a pretransplantation dialysis modality did not influence transplantation results.

##### Multivariate analysis revealed that recipient age �55 years (Hazard Ratio [HR] � 1.83; P � .003; 95% confi- dence interval [CI], 1.23–2.72), acute rejection episode (HR � 1.96; P � .0001; 95% CI; 1.38–2.78), DGF (HR � 1.56; P � .011; 95% CI, 1.10–2.20), and PRA �50% (HR � 2.43; P �� .0001; 95% CI; 1.54–3.85) showed adverse effects on allograft survival. The same analysis confirmed a lack of correlation between dialysis duration �24 months (HR � 1.16; P � .399; 95% CI; 0.82–1.65) or modality (HR � 1.03; P � .928; 95% CI; 0.58–1.80) and allograft survival.

DISCUSSION

##### Several studies demonstrated that increased time on dialy- sis prior to transplantation negatively predict short-term kidney allograft outcomes,[5,13] acute rejection episodes,[14]
 and transplant recipient survival.[6] In our study, longer dialysis duration was associated with poorer overall graft and patient survivals. No differences were noted in the occurrence of DGF, acute rejection episodes, or renal function at 3, 12, 60, or 96 months. Regarding the impact of dialysis modality on short-term outcomes, HD was associated with a greater incidence of DGF after kidney transplantation.[7,8] A greater rate of acute rejection episodes has been associated with PD in some studies,[7] but other showed a similar incidence as HD.[8]
 Some studies have reported a positive impact of PD on outcomes after transplantation and on long-term patient
