Introduction
Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) offers
considerable survival benefits for patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease
(ESRD), because it restores long-term glycemic control and
can reduce secondary diabetic complications [1–6].
Due to organ shortage, most of these patients must
undergo long-term renal replacement therapy (RRT)

prior to SPKT. With hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal
dialysis (PD), two efficient RRTs are available pretransplant. However, both dialysis modalities substantially
influence patients’ health, as well as their ability to work and
participate in social activities. Conventional HD is usually
performed intermittently three times a week in a dialysis
center. During HD, uremic toxins are removed from the
blood extracorporeally through a filter, which is generally
considered as a stressful procedure, with an increased risk of
cardiovascular diseases [7, 8]. By contrast, PD uses the peritoneum as a filter through which substances are exchanged
with the blood. In general, PD offers greater flexibility as it
can be performed at different time points, almost always at
home and independent of medical staff, although it carries
the risk of metabolic complications related to systemic glucose absorption from the dialysate (e.g. hyperlipidemia and
decompensation of diabetes mellitus), and catheterassociated complications. PD catheter infection can lead to
subsequent peritonitis, which remains the major cause of
morbidity and mortality in PD patients [7, 9].
Apart from mere graft and patient survival rates after
transplantation, measuring the health-Related Quality of
Life (HRQoL) has become an issue of further interest as
it provides an overall view of the impact of the disease
process on psychosocial status. Monitoring the HRQoL
helps to define how disease symptoms affect the patient’s
life, physical and mental functioning, and their ability to
cope with the new life situation after transplantation.
Recent studies have shown that patients generally experience better quality of life after SPKT compared with
dialysis patients [4, 10–13]. However, the influence of
dialysis modality prior to SPKT on the surgical outcome
and HRQoL after transplantation is less clear. Thus, the
current study has sought to analyze the outcome and
HRQoL in diabetic patients with ESRD undergoing
SPKT regarding pre-transplant dialysis modality.

Methods
Study population
Medical data from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (type 1 or 2) and ESRD who received SPKT at the
University Hospital of Leipzig between 2000 and 2016 were
retrospectively analyzed. Our data source comprised a prospectively collected electronic database. Approval for this
analysis was granted by the local ethics committee [AZ: Nr:
111–16-14,032,016]. Patients undergoing pre-emptive transplantation, re-transplants, living donor kidney transplantation, those aged younger than 18 years, and those with
missing data were excluded from the study.

Outcome measures
Special emphasis was placed on the outcome of dialysis
modality before transplantation (HD versus PD), recipient and donor characteristics, intra- and postoperative


variables and complications such as patient, graft as well
as HRQoL outcomes before (during dialysis) and after
transplantation. Characteristics included age, gender,
body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/height in m[2]), duration of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, duration of
dialysis, and time on the waiting list. Cardiovascular disease included information about peripheral arterial obstructive disease and coronary heart disease (coronary
artery bypass graft or stent). Peri- and post-transplant
data included information on cold ischemia time of the
kidney/pancreas, immunosuppressive therapy as well as
patient and organ graft function.
Furthermore, complications occurring during the first 3
months after transplantation were analyzed. Surgical complications were defined as the need for relaparotomy
within the first 3 months after transplantation. Intraabdominal infections were defined as the development of
infected fluid collection that required an intervention and/
or antibiotic drug therapy. Gastrointestinal bleedings were
defined as bleedings requiring relaparotomy or endoscopy,
or patients suffering from sudden anemia combined with
either melena or hematemesis. Other bleedings comprising intra-abdominal hemorrhages, were diagnosed by CT
scan or relaparotomy performed due to acute anemia.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
For measuring the HRQoL in this study, the most
commonly-used and internationally-validated Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
(SF-36) questionnaire was used. Patients were asked to
evaluate their HRQoL before transplantation (undergoing dialysis), such as 1 year after transplantation. Therefore, SF-36 forms were completed at different time
points after transplantation, but not earlier than 1 year
after transplantation.
HRQoL was evaluated in a second assessment through
written HRQoL questionnaires (SF-36) sent to all patients with an invitation to complete a quality-of-life survey retrospectively. The SF-36 survey was sent by mail
to patients’ home addresses. Additionally, patients were
interviewed via telephone or during a clinical visit, as indicated. Return envelopes were included free of charge.
A period of 2 weeks was envisaged for returning questionnaires. All patients who had not returned the questionnaire after 2 weeks were contacted a second time via
mail or telephone within another 14 days. Altogether,
patients had 4 weeks to submit their responses. Prior to
the study, informed consent of all patients and the local
ethics committee [AZ: Nr: 111–16-14,032,016] was obtained. Because the HRQoL assessment was performed
separately, it was not possible to correlate HRQoL scores
with all clinical data. The average time span between
transplantation and completion of the questionnaires
was 8.6 ± 2.9 years.


-----

The SF-36 has 36 questions (without specific one for
renal failure or diabetes) that assess the ability to perform vigorous activities and activities for daily living and
participate in social, family and occupational activities.
Eight scales/dimensions describe domains of physical
functions (PF, ten items), role limitations due to physical
problems (PR, four items), bodily pain (BP, two items), a
general perception of health (GH, five items), energy and
vitality (VIT, four items), social functions (SF, two
items), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE,
three items), and mental health (MH, five items). The
subscales can be combined into two summation scales
measuring the overall physical and mental HRQoL: a
physical component summary (PCS = PF + PR + BP +
GH) and a mental component summary (MCS = VIT +
SF + RE + MH). Subscale scores were transformed to a
0–100 scale, with 0 representing the least to 100 representing the greatest well-being.

Surgical techniques
The pancreas and kidney grafts were procured according
to the guidelines provided by Eurotransplant (ET) [14]. As
described earlier, the pancreas was explanted in a notouch technique [15]. An illiac y-graft was used for reconstruction of the superior mesenteric and the lienal artery.
The pancreas was transplanted transabdominally using a
standard technique with an intraperitoneal location in the
right iliac fossa [16]. Exocrine drainage was carried out
with a side-to-side duodenojejunostomy [3, 17]. Kidneys
were transplanted transabdominally into the left iliacal
fossa. The ureter was implanted into the bladder according to the Lich-Gregoir technique using a double J intraureteral splint [16].

Immunosuppression
Immunosuppressive therapy comprised an induction
therapy with the interleukin-2 receptor antagonist basiliximab or antithymocyte globulin, followed by a triple
maintenance immunosuppression consisting of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), and/or antimetabolites (mycofenolate mofetil or sirolimus) and
tapered steroids (prednisolone).

Statistical analysis
Baseline data are presented as mean values with the
standard deviation (SD), minimum or maximum range
such as the proportion percentage (%). Baseline data
were compared with appropriate statistical significance
test including the Student’s t–test, χ2, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon–Mann–
Whitney tests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was
used to adjust the difference between the two groups
after SPKT, with hemodialysis as one predictor and
baseline measurements of HRQoL domains (before


SPKT) as the other. Survival rates were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test was applied to test statistical significance. Graft survival was
calculated as the time from initial transplant to graft failure (re-start of dialysis), censoring for death with a functioning graft and grafts still functioning at time of
analysis. Patient survival is defined as time from transplant to patient death, censoring for patients still alive at
time of analysis. If a recipient was alive or lost to followup at time of last contact, then survival time was censored at time of last contact. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to assess independent
predictors of patient death and pancreas graft failure, including clinically-relevant variables and/or those presenting P ≤ 0.15 in univariate analysis: recipient gender,
BMI and age, dialysis modality (HD versus PD), time on
dialysis, years of diabetes mellitus, concomitant cardiovascular disease and surgical complications. SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA, version 21.0)
was used for statistical analysis and graphs. A P value <
0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics
The overall study population included 83 patients receiving SPKT in our department between 2000 and 2016. At
the time of transplantation, 64 patients obtained HD and
nineteen patients used PD. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was used by fourteen patients (74%) and
automatic peritoneal dialysis was used by five patients
(26%) among the PD group. Recipient, donor and graft
characteristics according to the different dialysis types
prior to transplantation are summarized in Table 1. The
two groups were similar for the majority of their pretransplant characteristics, while the number of female
recipients was higher in the PD group (P = 0.017), and a
history of depression was more frequent in the HD
group (P = 0.049). HLA mismatches, post-transplant immunosuppressive regimes and lengths of hospital stay
did not show significant differences between the two
groups (data not shown).

Outcome
Complications
There were no significant differences in the frequency of
peri- and postoperative complications between HD and
PD SPKT recipients (Table 2). The global relaparotomy
rate was similar between the two groups (HD: 35% versus PD: 36%; P = 0.77).
After transplantation, eighteen patients developed
intra-abdominal infections (HD: 20% versus PD: 26%;
P = 0.577). There were eight bacterial infections, two
fungal infections and eight cultured positive for both
bacteria and fungi. Intra-abdominal infections were

Patient and graft survival
The 3- and 5-year patient survival rates for patients after
SPKT showed no significant differences between the HD
and PD group (98.2 and 96.1% in HD versus 92.9 and
92.9% in PD, respectively; P = 0.559). Similarly, the 1-, 3and 5- year pancreas graft survival rates (94.6, 90.3 and
85.8% in HD versus 88.2, 81.9 and 81.9% in PD, respectively; P = 0.901) and kidney graft survival rates (98.2,
96.4 and 84.3% in HD versus 88.2, 88.2 and 80.2% in PD,
respectively; P = 0.712) did not show any significant differences between the two groups (Fig. 1).
As shown in Table 3, no significant differences were found
between the type of pre-transplant dialysis modality and
causes for patient death and graft failure. However, we noted
a tendency of higher graft losses due to thrombosis in PD patients (HD: 4.7% versus PD: 15.8%; P = 0.10).
Multivariate Cox regression analysis of the total study
population revealed that the presence of cardiovascular
disease is an independent predictor of patient death.
Moreover, the preoperative presence of cardiovascular
disease, recipient age, BMI, duration of pre-transplant
dialysis and surgical complications could be identified as
independent predictors of pancreas and kidney graft loss
(Table 4).

eight SF-36 domains in the PD group.
Before transplantation, benefits were seen for the PD
patients, with statistically significant differences in terms

(P = 0.013) compared with patients receiving HD prior
to transplantation (Table 5). After SPKT, PD patients
showed significantly better results in four of the eight
SF-36 domains compared with HD patients: physical
functioning (P < 0.01), bodily pain (P < 0.01), general
health (P = 0.04), vitality (P = 0.04) and PCS (P < 0.01).

Impact of demographical and clinical variables We
separately analyzed the possible impact of three factors
– age, gender and graft loss – on the HRQoL of the
overall study population after SPKT (Table 6). Regarding
patients’ age, there was a significant difference in physical functioning (P = 0.04), general health (P < 0.01) and
role limitations (P = 0.03). In the univariate analysis, patients’ gender showed no influence on HRQoL after
SPKT. Graft loss (kidney or pancreas) led to a significant
decrease in all physical components (each P < 0.01) and
mental health status (P = 0.01) of the SF-36.

Discussion
Post-transplant outcome and survival
Infectious complications remain a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality after SPKT [3, 4, 6, 18]. A
much-debated question is whether pre-transplant PD increases the risk for intra-abdominal infections after
transplantation due to the risk of catheter-associated
peritonitis. Binaut et al. showed a higher rate of parietal
sepsis in PD patients after kidney transplantation alone
(KTA) compared with patients who received HD prior
to transplantation [19]. Martins et al. reported a significantly higher rate of pancreas loss due to infection
among PD patients after SPKT (HD: 3.4% versus PD:
12.8%; P = 0.042), whereas ten out of 39 (25.6%) PD patients had peritonitis in their past [20]. By contrast, other
studies have reported no difference in surgical outcome


between HD and PD patients after SPKT [21–24]. Our
analysis could not reveal significant differences in intraabdominal infection rates after SPKT between the two
groups, and there was no correlation between the incidence of pre-transplant peritonitis and post-transplant
intra-abdominal infection. Besides dialysis modality, the
incidence of intra-abdominal infection after SPKT may
be related to other factors, namely surgical technique
(especially pancreas-anastomosis), the length of hospital
stays and the intensity of immunosuppression.
In the literature, there are reports of an increased graft
loss in PD patients compared with HD patients posttransplant. After KTA, an increased graft loss in PD patients is reported, mainly due to renal vascular thrombosis [25, 26]. In a study investigating outcomes after
SPKT, Martins et al. reported a significantly higher rate
of thrombosis-driven relaparotomy in PD patients compared with HD patients. Moreover, they recognized a
near significant higher rate of renal graft loss due to
thrombosis in PD patients compared with HD patients

[20]. In our study, no correlations were found between
pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient or graft survival. Only the rate of pancreas graft failure due to
thrombosis was non-significantly higher in the PD group
(HD: 4.7% versus PD: 15.8%, P = 0.10). However, these
data must be interpreted with caution, because other
variables such as patient comorbidities (cardiovascular
diseases, BMI), along with recipient age and time on dialysis might be additional factors that influence the outcome and survival.

transplant HRQoL and dialysis modality [27]. Previous
publications have used a broad range of measures to assess HRQoL and analyzed patients with different demographic characteristics and medical history. Our findings
indicate that PD is associated with a significantly better
physical functioning and physical component summary
before SPKT compared with patients receiving HD as a
pre-transplant dialysis modality. Moreover, besides mental
health, all other components of the SF-36 score were (although not significantly) higher in PD patients. The better
reported quality of life among PD patients may stem from
the positive effect of medical self-management through
PD, which can be performed independently or with the
help of a caregiver and develops a sense of personal control, which positively correlates with features of HRQoL.
By contrast, conventional HD is a stressful process and
time spent on a dialysis ward can contribute to a lower
quality of life, as the number of hours in HD hinders professional and social functioning.

Post-transplant HRQoL
The HRQoL of patients improved in both study groups
after transplantation, which underlines the therapeutic
success of SPKT, besides medical outcomes and objective clinical parameters. This is in line with most published studies showing a significant improvement in
patient-reported general HRQoL after SPKT and better
diabetes-specific quality of life [4, 10–13].
Psychiatric disorders could influence the poor evaluation of the quality of life among HD patients [28]. HD
carries the risk of vascular dehydration and hypotension
following cerebellar hypoperfusion and may lead to cognitive impairment and cardiovascular diseases [29–31].
Sapilak revealed a strong negative correlation of HRQoL
of HD patients with depression symptoms and anxiety

[32]. In a study by Smith et al. evaluating 37 patients
pre-transplant and 4 months after SPKT, approximately
half of the patients showed an improvement of HRQoL,
although one-third even experienced reduced HRQoL.


The authors showed that pre-existing psychiatric disorders at the time of transplant were the only significant
predictor of reduced quality of life following pancreas
transplantation [33]. In line with these reports, in our
study the rate of depression in patient history was significantly higher in the HD group (P = 0.049). However,
with a small sample size and missing details about psychosocial status and longitudinal periodic assessment of
depression disease, caution must be applied as the findings might not be representative.
In the literature, the relative importance of patients’
gender on HRQoL after transplantation is debated. In a
study by Rajkumar et al., 12 months after transplantation
(KTA or SPKT) most HRQoL scores (seven out of eight)
were better for women than for men. Moreover, HRQoL
scores of female recipients were not statistically different
from the control group in the general population [12].
The authors postulated that differences in expectations
and appreciation of improvements in health after transplantation, differences in social network and emotional
support may provide an explanation for these findings.
Other reports have favored men and shown that female
gender is a negative predictive factor of HRQoL after
SPKT [10, 33]. In a study by Martin et al. evaluating
HRQoL in 60 male and 66 female SPKT patients, no
lower scores for female patients were observed [11]. Different results in the literature may be explained by different follow-up periods, study populations and study
designs/questionnaires. In our analysis, the number of
female recipients was significantly higher in the PD
group (P = 0.017), although we did not observe genderbased differences in the overall study population.
In the present study, we have shown that graft loss has a
significant impact on HRQoL after SPKT due to a loss of
independence from insulin therapy and freedom from dialysis. This is in line with previous publications in which
graft loss has been associated with significant worsening
of the HRQoL [4, 34, 35], and maintenance of two functioning grafts seems to be an independent predictor of


-----

higher post-transplant quality-of-life scores [11]. Furthermore, the results of Sutherland et al. indicate that achieving insulin independence improves QOL more than
becoming dialysis-free [4].

Limitations
There are some notable limitations of this study that
should be mentioned, related to the data source and
study design. The main limitations of the study are its
retrospective nature, the heterogenous group size and
the fact that all data collection was undertaken at one
time, which make it difficult to evaluate the causality of
the findings and associations. As such, there may be
some amount of variation from year to year with
changes in the outcome and level of HRQoL. Second,
not only disease or dialysis modality determine one’s
view of life quality, but also many non-disease factors
(work, education, and other sociodemographic factors)
play important additive role in the perception of
HRQoL. The option for PD or HD normally depends on
the patient’s condition (comorbid situations, vascular
and peritoneal conditions), autonomy and convenience,
as well as the health care system (dialysis center factors).

Conclusions
Both dialysis modalities are generally associated with
good outcomes and an improvement of HRQoL after
SPKT. PD prior to SPKT seems to offer a slight advantage compared with HD before transplantation. Further
prospective, controlled and randomized studies are
needed to evaluate sociodemographic factors with an
impact on the outcome and HRQoL.
