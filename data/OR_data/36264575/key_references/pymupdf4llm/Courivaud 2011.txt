Abstract: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a well-known complication in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). While a number of risk
factors for PTDM have been identified, the potential impact of pre-transplant dialysis modality on subsequent development of PTDM has not yet
been explored.
We performed a multicenter retrospective study on 2010 consecutive RTRs
who did not have a history of diabetes prior to renal transplantation.
PTDM was defined as a need for anti-diabetic therapy in an RTR without a
history of diabetes prior to transplantation. Analysis of the risk factors for
development of PTDM was performed with respect to pre-transplant dialysis modality.
A total of 137 (6.8%) patients developed PTDM; 7% in the hemodialysis
group and 6.5% in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) group (p = 0.85). In the
multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI)
(p < 0.001), use of tacrolimus (p = 0.002), and rejection episodes
(p < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for development of
PTDM. Patients in the PD group were younger (p = 0.004), had lower
BMI (p = 0.07), and were less likely to have a history of hepatitis C
(p = 0.007) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (p = 0.07).
Adjustment for these variables did not modify the results.
The results of this study suggest that pre-transplant dialysis modality does
not have an impact on the subsequent development of PTDM in RTRs.

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a
common complication of kidney transplantation
and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (1, 2). It has been
shown that PTDM is also associated with an
increase in the risk of graft failure and death (2–5).
Relative insulin deficiency, caused by increased
insulin resistance and impaired insulin production,


is thought to be the underlying pathophysiologic
mechanism for PTDM (1).
Several risk factors for development of PTDM
have been identified: age, body mass index (BMI),
ethnicity, hepatitis C infection, and certain immunosuppressive medications such as steroids and
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (6). Steroids and
reversal of the uremic state stimulate the appetite


-----

and increase food intake leading to post-transplant
weight gain, which in turn results in relative insulin
deficiency due to hepatic and peripheral insulin
resistance. A significant subset of renal transplant
recipients (RTRs) experiences weight gain during
the first year after transplantation, potentially
predisposing them to an abnormal glucose metabolism (7).
Based on a number of clinical observations, it is
conceivable to hypothesize that pre-transplant
renal replacement modality might affect the risk
of PTDM. Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the
growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is a peptide hormone that is predominantly produced in
the stomach and can significantly increase food
intake (8). A 2.8-fold higher ghrelin levels have
been reported in patients with renal failure,
suggesting that the kidney plays an important role
in the clearance and/or degradation of this hormone (9). In a report by Ayala et al., one yr of
peritoneal dialysis (PD) was associated with a
significant reduction in plasma ghrelin levels, while
no changes were observed in hemodialysis (HD)
patients (10). As previously reported by our group,
higher levels of ghrelin in HD patients could be
associated with a greater weight gain (7) and
therefore a potential increase in the risk of PTDM.
Inflammation is also considered a risk factor for
PTDM (11). A number of studies have shown a
significant increase in inflammatory mediators in
HD patients compared with PD patients (12, 13).
The pro-inflammatory effect of HD can therefore
increase the risk of subsequent PTDM compared
with those treated with PD.
Therefore, pre-transplant renal replacement
modalities are associated with distinct metabolic
profiles that can potentially affect the risk of
subsequent development of PTDM. In this retrospective multicenter study, we evaluated the
hypothesis that patients treated with HD are at
higher risk for PTDM compared with those
managed with PD.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study is a retrospective chart review of 2010
patients who received a renal allograft between
January 1995 and December 2005 in five renal
transplant centers in France. This study was
designed to evaluate the impact of pre-transplant
dialysis modality on the subsequent development
of PTDM with respect to other known risk factors.
The data were reviewed and recorded until
six months after transplantation.


Demographic and clinical characteristics

We included all patients with end-stage renal
disease who received a renal allograft between
January 1995 and December 2005 in universityaffiliated medical centers in Nancy (n = 754),
Reims (n = 372), Besanc¸ on (n = 327), Strasbourg (n = 299), and Caen (n = 258). Patients
with a history of pre-transplant diabetes mellitus
were excluded. Clinical parameters such as age,
gender, year of transplant, BMI, hepatitis C status,
CNI agent (cyclosporine A [CsA] or tacrolimus),
and dialysis modality (HD or PD) were recorded
upon inclusion. Rejection episodes (either biopsyproven or clinically suspected and treated), cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (identified through
treatment by gancyclovir), and a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) were also considered as separate variables.
The cumulative dose of steroids could not be
compared because some centers had used steroidwithdrawal protocols in some patients with
PTDM.

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus

PTDM was identified based on the need for insulin
or oral anti-diabetic therapy for normalization of
blood sugar levels. As the goal was to evaluate the
potential effect of pre-transplant dialysis modality,
we only included cases of PTDM that were
diagnosed over the first six months after renal
transplantation.

Statistical analysis

The results were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation.

Pre-transplant dialysis modality and PTDM

Univariate analyses were first carried out to
examine the relationship between PTDM and a
number of potential independent variables. Covariates to enter multivariate analyses were the
following: (i) continuous variables were tested
using Student�s t-test or Mann–Whitney�s nonparametric test (ii) categorical variables were tested
using Pearson�s chi-square, or Fisher�s exact test.
The alpha threshold for covariate selection was
0.20. Those variables linked to PTDM with pvalues of less than 0.20 were retained for multivariate analyses. Selected covariates were entered
into logistic regression analysis. Results are expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence
interval, with a p value testing the null hypothesis:


-----

RR = 1. Therefore, when p value is less than 0.05,
RR is significantly different from 1.

Results

Baseline data

This study included 2010 RTRs. All patients were
Caucasians. Mean age was 46 ± 14 yr, and 62.3%
were male. Mean BMI was 23.1 ± 4.2 kg/m[2].
Sixteen percent had ADPKD and 3.6% showed
positive hepatitis C serology. CsA was used in
68.3% patients and tacrolimus in 27.5%. Acute
rejection and CMV disease were identified in 24%
and 20.8%, respectively. Most episodes of acute
rejection took place before PTDM (56%), whereas
most cases of CMV disease occurred after PTDM
(60.5%).

Pre-transplant dialysis modality

There were significant differences in the distribution of dialysis modality between centers. Prior to
transplantation, 1564 patients (77.8%) were on
HD and 332 (16.5%) on PD. One hundred and
fourteen patients (5.7%) had undergone pre-emptive transplant. PD patients were significantly
younger (p = 0.004), less likely to have a history
of hepatitis C infection (p = 0.007) or ADPKD
(p = 0.07), and had a lower BMI (p = 0.07).

Other characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups (see Table 1).

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus

PTDM was identified in 137 patients (6.8%); 7% in
the HD group and 6.5% in the PD group
(p = 0.85). The mean time of onset was
30 ± 42.5 d after transplantation. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of these patients are
summarized in Table 2.

Risk factors

In univariate analysis, older age (p < 0.0001),
higher BMI (p < 0.0001), tacrolimus use
(p < 0.0001), CMV disease (p = 0.006), acute
rejection (p < 0.001), and transplant center
(p = 0.0002) were associated with development
of PTDM (Table 2). Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not alter the risk of PTDM (RR 1.08 [0.45–
2.6], p = 0.86). To explore more precisely the
potential interactions between dialysis modality
and the subsequent risk of PTDM, we calculated
RR estimates for PTDM derived from proportional hazards modelling with dialysis modality
adjusted for age, BMI, ADPKD, hepatitis C
infection, and transplant center. Adjustment for
this variables did not modify the RR of PD for
PTDM (RR 0.96 [0.6–1.6], p = 0.86) (Table 3).

suggest that factors associated with the choice of

Discussion

PTDM, a well-known complication of renal transplantation, has been shown to be associated with
lower graft and patient survival. Our group
recently reported that it can also increase the risk
of atherosclerotic events in RTRs (14). Pre-transplant identification of patients at risk for PTDM
and post-transplant monitoring are of utmost
importance for timely implementation of preventive and therapeutic measures. Few European
studies have so far focused on the incidence of
PTDM in RTRs (15–19). Lack of a universally
accepted definition for PTDM has likely contributed to a significant variation in the reported
incident rates of this complication, ranging from
2% to 53% (20). Recently, international consensus
guidelines were published on the diagnosis and
management of PTDM (6). These recommendations are based on one of the common definitions
of new-onset DM as well as the results of glucose
tolerance test. However, most of the currently
available studies on the impact of PTDM on
transplant outcomes have used the ‘‘need for
treatment’’ to identify these patients. Therefore,
the clinical relevance of the consensus guidelines is
yet to be established. Because of the design of our
study, the recommended definition of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) could not be
applied; we used ‘‘the need for treatment’’ to
identify patients with PTDM. We limited our
analysis to the first six months after transplantation as the distinction between PTDM and type 2
diabetes mellitus is difficult to make after this
period. Our results are consistent with previous
reports from other European centers (15–19).
In this study, the significant difference in the
incidence of PTDM among transplant centers
persisted even after adjustment for other relevant
parameters. Variation in demographic characteristics is unlikely to explain these differences as the
study population was relatively homogeneous.
Practice patterns are likely to explain, in part, the
observed difference in the incidence of PTDM
among centers. In fact, the management of mildto-moderate elevation in fasting blood glucose level
during the post-transplant period of tapering the
steroids can be quite variable, especially if steroid
withdrawal protocols are implemented.

In the multivariate model, no difference in
statistical analysis was observed irrespective of
whether CMV disease was considered or not (data
unavailable in one center). Therefore, the data
presented herein are from statistical analysis without considering CMV disease. Age (RR 1.04 [1.03–
1.06] for each one yr increase, p < 0.0001), BMI
(RR 1.14 [1.09–1.18] for each 1 kg/m[2] increase,

[1.96–4.44], p < 0.0001) were found to be independent risk factors for development of PTDM.
Transplant center was independently associated
with the risk of PTDM and there was a significant
interaction between transplant centers and the
association between dialysis modality and PTDM
(Table 4). Although, the difference in the incidence
of PTDM between the dialysis modalities was not
statistically significant in any of the centers, p

The lack of association between the pre-transplant dialysis modality and the risk of PTDM
needs to be interpreted with caution. First, a type-I
error cannot be excluded with certainty. Based on
the incidence of PTDM and the proportion of the
patients in each dialysis modality, our study had a
power of 90% to detect a reduction of 40% in the
incidence of PTDM in PD patients. To detect a
more realistic difference of 20%, a study with more
than 10 000 patients is needed. It is noteworthy
that there was no trend observed towards a
beneficial or deleterious impact for each of the
dialysis modalities. Second, only the latest dialysis
modality prior to transplantation was considered;
the switch between PD and HD that was not taken
into account might have led to a bias in analysis.
Finally, the reasons for each patient being treated
with HD or PD may have created an unwanted
selection bias. PD patients in our study were
younger, had lower BMI, and were less likely to
have a history of ADPKD or hepatitis C infection.
There were also large discrepancies in the repartition of PD and HD patients between centers. Even
though these factors were taken into account in the
logistic regression analysis, other unknown factors
associated with the propensity of being on PD or
HD could still have potentially affected the results.
We identified a number of clinical variables that
are associated with PTDM. Higher BMI increased
the risk of PTDM. This is consistent with the
results of other studies that found an association
between overweight and PTDM (21–23). Interestingly, the increased risk of PTDM in our study was
not limited only to overweight or obese patients,
but was also increased in patients with lower BMI
compared with those with normal BMI (data not
shown). Overweight is a potentially modifiable risk
factor; and lifestyle changes might help reduce the
risk of PTDM. Dietary advice, weight loss, and
exercise should be an integral part of a comprehensive pre- and post-transplant program. Age is
also identified as an important risk factor for
PTDM. Previous studies have consistently found
PTDM to be more common in older patients
compared with younger individuals (21, 24); it has
been reported in <3% of children (25).
Our study confirms the results of previous
observations on the association between tacrolimus
and PTDM. In a meta-analysis by Webster et al.,
the RR of PTDM at six months, one yr, and
three yr was found to be 2.56, 1.86, and 3.86,
respectively (26). In a recently published study by
Vincenti et al. (27), the authors observed an overall
increased risk of PTDM or impaired fasting
glycemia with CNI-based immunosuppression regimens; the risk was significantly lower for CsA


compared with tacrolimus. Acute rejection is also a
risk factor for PTDM, which is likely due to the use
of high doses of steroids for its management.
This study has a number of limitations. Because
of its retrospective design, the criteria for diagnosis
and treatment of PTDM might have been different
among centers, and the observed incidence of
PTDM could hence be dependent on the practice
patterns of physicians in each center. Moreover, the
impact of cumulative dose of steroids, a known risk
factor for PTDM, could not be evaluated in our
study. Early steroid withdrawal (i.e., during the
first month post-transplant) has been shown to
decrease the risk of PTDM. As the steroid tapering
protocols were very similar in the centers participating in this study, the potential difference in the
cumulative dose of steroids would mostly be related
to the episodes of rejection and their therapy.
In conclusion, our study does not find any
relationship between pre-transplant dialysis modality and subsequent development of PTDM.
