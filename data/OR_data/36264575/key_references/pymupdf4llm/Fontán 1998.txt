_.Objective:To_ find out if patients undergoing peritoneal
dialysis (PD) have an increased risk of primary vascular
thrombosis of the renal allograft, compared with patients on
hemodialysis (HD).
_.Design: Observational, retrospective cohort study._
_.Setting:Tertiary care hospital, covering an approximate_
population of 2000000. Extensive use of suboptimal donors
for renal transplantation.
_.Patients and Methods:The_ study included 827 patients
receiving a cadaveric renal transplantation (RTx) in our
center between 1988 and 1997 (700 on HD and 127 on PD).
We searched for a potential difference in the incidence of
graft thrombosis, according to the pretransplant dialysis
modality and taking into consideration the main reported risk
factors for this complication of RTx.
_.Results:_ The accumulated incidence of primary graft
thrombosis was 4.7% in PD patients, and 6.1% in HD patients (NS). Arterial and venous thrombosis were also similar in both groups. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that extremes of age of the donor, use of the right
kidney, protracted cold ischemia, delayed graft function, and
transplantation to a hypersensitized recipient independently
predicted graft thrombosis. Peritoneal dialysis was not
independently associated with the complication under study
(adjusted odds ratio HD/PD = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.8 7.7).
_.Conclusions:_ Peritoneal dialysis is not associated with an
increased risk of primary vascular thrombosis of the renal
allograft.

has been claimed that patients on PD present lower rates of
delayed graft function (9,10). Peritonitis and catheter-related
disorders may complicate the course ofRTx in PD patients,
but they do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the
overall results of therapy (1).

Vascular thrombosis (V cT) is one of the most feared
early complications ofRTx (11), its incidence oscillating
between 0.5 and 8% in different studies. It occurs
predominantly during the first 2 weeks after RTx, resulting
in graft failure in the vast majority of cases, although
sporadic, but well documented, cases of graft salvage have
been reported, especially after venous thrombosis (11).
Graft thrombosis is a natural endpoint in the course of
complications such as ongoing, irreversible acute rejection
or renal artery stenosis (11,12), but may also present as a
seemingly primary complication ofRTx. The list offactors
that have been associated with an increased risk of primary
V cT of the renal allograft is extensive, including
cyclosporine (CsA) (13) and OKT3 (14) therapy, and also
technical, immunological, and donor/recipient mismatchrelated factors (Table 1) (15-18). The role ofhypercoagulability syndromes (19) in the pathogenesis of this
complication has not yet been established, although it has
been suggested that thrombophilia may predispose to early
graft failure (20).
Recently, at least two studies have associated PD therapy
with an increased risk of primary graft thrombosis after RTx
(21,22). A preliminary survey, carried out in Spain in 1996
and specifically addressing this question (23), could not
confirm this association. We have performed an in-depth
analysis of the risk profile for early primary V cT of the
renal allograft in a wide population transplanted in our
center between 1988 and 1997, with the specific aim of
assessing the potential relation between this complication
and the pretransplant dialysis modality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

The study population included 827 cadaveric RTx
performed in our unit between January 1988 and July


-----

1997. Of these, 700 patients (84.6%) were treated with HD,
and 127 (15.4%) with PD. Immunosuppression was based
on CsA in all cases, although four different protocols were
used during the study period: CsA + prednisone (Pred)
(15.5%), CsA + Pred + azathioprine (66.3%), CsA + Pred +
mycophenolate mofetil (10.5%), and OKT3 (5 mg/day for
10 days) + CsA + Pred + aza thioprine (7. 7%). Our center
takes extensive advantage of suboptimal donors, including
non-heartbeating (12.6%), pediatric (5.4% 5 years old or
younger), and elderly (9.1% older than 60 years) donors.
Primary V cT of the renal allograft was diagnosed
according to standard criteria (11). Clinical evaluation,
isotopic scan, duplex-Doppler sonography and, in some
cases, arteriography were the usual steps in diagnosis.
Surgical exploration was carried out as soon as a
presumptive diagnosis was established. In spite of this,
graft salvage was not possible in any instance, and graft
nephrectomy specimens confirmed the di agnosis in all
cases. We excluded from the analysis cases of definite
secondary graft thrombosis (basically due to irreversible
rejection), and also episodes occurring beyond the first
month after RTx.
The following variables were considered for analysis:

Donor-related: age, sex, blood group, cause of death,
hemodynamic instability, non-heartbeating, multiorgan
involvement (versus renal), and serum creatinine.
Recipient-related: age, sex, blood group, basal disease, time

on dialysis, residual diuresis, basal hypertension
(antihypertensive drugs required), significant
atherosclerosis (clinical diagnosis), pretransplant blood
transfusions, degree of sensitization against the
lymphocyte pannel (current), first versus second/third
graft, and hematocrit, platelet count, and cholesterol and
albumin values at the time ofRTx.
Transplant-related: cold and warm ischemia, vascular

anomalies of the graft, need for vascular reconstructive
surgery, use of right/left kidney, HLA (human leukocyte
antigen) mismatches, immuno


suppression schedule, preservation fluid, recipient
instability during the peritransplant period [estimated by
performance of a hemodialysis session immediately
before RTx, peritransplant blood transfusion, first central
venous and systolic blood pressures after RTx surgery,
and severe complications (infections, bleeding) during
the first week after RTx], immediate versus delayed graft
function (dialysis required during the first week after
RTx), and CsA profile during the first days after RTx,
with special emphasis on delays in achieving therapeutic
CsA levels after RTx surgery.

STATISTIC

S

Univariate analysis was based on chi-square test,
Student's t-test (two-tailed, unpaired), and the MannWhitney test. Independent predictors of primary V cT were
identified using enter, forward, and stepwise logistic
regression analysis. Dialysis modality was included in the
general, best theoretical, and best-fit models, correcting for
confounding variables and significant interactions. Risk
measures are presented as odds ratios (OR), with 95%
confidence intervals (CI). The SPSS 6.1.3 software (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) was used for analysis.

**RESULTS**

There were 49 episodes of primary V cT of the renal
allograft (accumulated incidence 5.9%). Thrombosis was
arterial in 19 cases, venous in 28 cases, and arterial and
venous in 2 cases. As previously stated, graft nephrectomy
specimens confirmed the diagnosis of V cT in all cases.
However, in 13 cases associated rejection could not be
positively excluded, due to massive graft infarction and, in
2 other cases, findings were equivocal, disclosing mild
signs ofrejection, which were considered not to be severe
enough to establish a diagnosis of immunologic V cT.
Graft thrombosis was diagnosed a mean of 6.1 days after
RTx (range 1 30), 41% of the episodes occur

ring during the first 3 days, and 90% during the first 10
days, after surgery. Arterial thrombosis occurred later than
venous thrombosis (mean 7 vs 5 days, p = 0.015, MannWhitney). Twenty-four patients suffering V cT were
retransplanted later, and the complication recurred in only
one case (4.2%).

The accumulated incidence ofVcT was 4.7% in PD
patients (n = 6), and 6.1% in HD patients (n = 43) (NS).
Also, there was no significant difference in the incidence of
arterial (2.3% PD vs 2.3% HD) or venous thrombosis (2.4%
PD vs 3.6% HD) between both groups.
Table 2 shows the main differences between PD and HD
patients, regarding the variables studied. Table 3 presents
the main results of the univariate analysis of risk factors for
the complication under study.
There were 49 patients on PD (39%) who did not present
immediate graft function; 25 of these (51 %) were treated
with HD, and 20 (41 %) with PD, during the first days after
RTx, while in 4 cases (8%) irreversible graft failure was
diagnosed before posttransplant dialysis was initiated. Graft
V ct occurred in 4 patients (16%) while being treated with
HD, in 1 while being treated with PD (5%), and in 1 before
any dialysis was performed (NS). No instance ofVcT
affected initially functioning grafts in the PD group.
Multivariate analysis (Table 4) confirmed previous
reports on the association of graft thrombosis with factors
such as extremes of age of the donor, use of the right
kidney, protracted cold ischemia, or delayed graft function.
The excess risk detected in hypersensitized recipients may
indicate a role for undetected rejection in some cases of
apparently primary V cT.


Pretransplant poly transfusion and mycophenolate mofetilbased immunosuppression did not reach statistical
significance as independent predictors of VcT, but were
maintained in the final equation as confounding variables
because they improved the predictive power of the model
and influenced the regression coefficient of the study
variable (dialysis modality). Most importantly for this study,
PD was not an independent predictor of graft thrombosis. In
fact, the risk was somewhat, albeit not significantly, higher
in HD patients.

**DISCUSSION**

The results of our study do not support those of Murphy
_et al. (21) or van der Vliet et al. (22). Although we are not_
aware of other studies specifically addressing this question,
other groups have found a similar risk of graft thrombosis in
patients treated with PD and HD (18). The reasons for this
discrepancy are not clear. The study by Murphy _et al._ (21)
was carried out on a relatively small population, and a
multivariate statistical approach was not attempted, which
limits the reliability of their conclusions. Sample size and
statistic methodology provide more consistent support to the
results ofvan der Vliet _et al._ (22), although it is surprising
that pretransplant PD therapy was the only independent
predictor of graft V cT. Our study has taken into
consideration all factors commonly considered to playa
potential pathogenic role in graft thrombosis (Table 1), and
the multivariate approach did not detect even a minor trend
to a higher incidence ofVcT in our patients on PD.
Frequent transfusions before RTx exerted some
protection against graft VcT in our study (Table 3). This
may reflect a potential role for concealed rejection in the
genesis of some cases of so-called primary V cT of the renal
allograft. As patients on HD were more frequently
transfused (Table 2), this factor may have provided some
protection against V cT in this group. However, the
magnitude of the effect is probably small, and the
introduction of erythropoietin therapy has minimized the
differences in the transfusion rates between PD and HD
patients. On the other hand, and in agreement with previous
reports (18), we found that delayed graft function was
strongly associated with graft V cT. Peritoneal dialysis has
been associated with a lower incidence of acute renal failure
after RTx compared with HD (Table 2) (9,10). This could
confer on PD patients some advantage against VcT.
However, the pathogenic significance of this factor is
unclear because the relationship between delayed graft
function and V cT may be bidirectional. (Delayed function
could favor graft thrombosis, but the latter may also be a
cause of acute renal failure after RTx.)

Why should PD therapy induce an increased risk of graft
VcT? Nothing indicates that patients undergoing PD may
receive a more thrombogenic immunosuppression schedule
(with higher doses of CsA or


OKT3) (13,14), or present more technical or donorrecipient
mismatch problems, than their counterparts undergoing
HD. On the other hand, even if we exclude from analysis

acute rejection, immunologic events may yet playa role in
this complication, as suggested by the association of
seemingly primary VcT with factors such as pretransplant
blood transfusions, hypersensitization, or retransplant (17,
present study). However, it is now clear that, in
disagreement with earlier reports (2), the incidence of acute
rejection is not increased in patients on PD (1).
Does PD therapy result in a more thrombogenic
hemostatic pattern than HD? Hemostasis is, seemingly,
better preserved in PD than in HD patients. Peritoneal
dialysis therapy has been classically associated with a lower
spontaneous tendency to anemia and a higher degree of
hemoconcentration, as also with higher blood levels of
some procoagulant factors, such as fibrinogen and
apolipoprotein (a), compared with HD (24). However, the
real thrombogenic potential of these differences is unclear
and, moreover, some of them may have been eliminated or
minimized by the introduction of erythropoietin therapy
(25). Furthermore, blood levels of natural coagulation inhibi
tors may be higher in PD patients than in HD patients
(26,27) leading, theoretically, to a lower risk of thrombosis
in the former. Overall, there is no evidence linking PD to an
increased incidence of thrombotic events, compared with
HD.
We are not aware of studies showing differences in the
coagulation patterns of PD and HD patients after RTx. Even
if there were differences, the posttransplant dialysis
technique (in the case of delayed graft function) could have
at least as much impact on the post transplant hemostatic
pattern (and, eventually, on the risk of graft thrombosis) as
did the pre transplant mode of treatment. Our results do not
support this hypothesis; PD patients with delayed graft
function and treated temporarily with HD showed a trend to
suffer more V cT than those treated throughout with PD,
although the difference was not significant.
Hypercoagulability syndromes are not rare in the general
population, representing a significant risk factor for venous
and arterial thrombosis (28). Factor V Leiden mutation is
probably the most frequent of these disorders and has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of native renal artery
thrombosis (29). In dialysis patients, more attention has
been given to anti cardiolipin antibodies. These are frequently present in certain diseases, potentially causing renal
failure, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, but have
also been detected with increased frequency in the general
population on dialysis (30). The presence of anticardiolipin
antibodies has been associated with an increased risk of
thrombosis of the vascular access for HD (31). The role
ofhypercoagulability syndromes in the pathogenesis of renal
allograft thrombosis, and their comparative prevalence


in patients on PD and HD, have not yet been established. These
points may deserve consideration, because recurrent vascular
access thrombosis is a cause for switching from HD to PD, and
thus patients with hypercoagulability disorders could be
overrepresented in PD units. Given the small overall incidence of
graft thrombosis after RTx, a minor difference in the prevalence of
hypercoagulability syndromes between PD and HD could have a
significant impact on the comparative incidence ofVcT.
In conclusion, our results do not support the contention that
peritoneal dialysis is associated with an increased risk of primary
vascular thrombosis of the renal allograft.
