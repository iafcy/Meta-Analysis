Introduction: Individuals aged $65 years are increasingly prevalent on the waitlist for kidney transplantation, yet evidence on recipient and donor factors that define optimal outcomes in elderly patients
after kidney transplantation is scarce.

Methods: We used multivariable Cox regression modeling to determine the factors associated with allcause death, death with a functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft survival, using data
from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry.

Results: A total of 802 kidney transplant recipients aged $65 years underwent their first transplantation
between June 2006 and December 2016. Median age at transplantation was 68 years (interquartile range
¼
66 69 years). The 1-year and 5-year overall patient and graft survivals (95% confidence interval [CI]) were

95.1 (93.5 96.7) and 79.0 (75.1 82.9), and 92.9 (91.1 94.7) and 75.4 (71.3 79.5), respectively. Factors

associated with higher risks of all-cause death included prevalent coronary artery disease (adjusted hazard

graft ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03–1.09]), donor age (1.02 per year [1.01–1.03]), delayed graft function

Conclusion: Prevalent vascular disease and peritoneal dialysis as a pretransplantation dialysis modality
are risk factors associated with poorer outcomes in transplant recipients aged $65 years. Careful selection
and evaluation of potential candidates may improve graft and patient outcomes in older patients.

aged 45 to 64 years.[3] In Europe, approximately 56%
of all incident patients commencing KRT are aged
>65 years.[4] Kidney transplantation is a practical option
for older patients on dialysis. There is now indisputable evidence from observational studies suggesting
that kidney transplantation improves the quality of
life and survival for most patients with kidney failure,
even in elderly individuals.[5][�][7] Chronological age is no
longer a contraindication for kidney transplantation
because of the incremental gains in life-years and
quality-adjusted life-years experienced by older patients with functioning grafts compared to maintenance
dialysis.[8]

Elderly candidates represent an increasingly prevalent group on the waitlist for kidney transplantation.
However, age-related comorbidities such as ischemic
heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and frailty
are risk factors for premature death and postoperative
complications after transplantation.[9][�][13] The risk of


-----

early postoperative death is also high among recipients
aged $65 years, with an increased risk of death by 1.5
times during the perioperative period compared to
those remaining on dialysis.[6][,][7]

Careful selection of suitable candidates is therefore
central to attenuate the risk of postoperative complications and to ensure appropriate utilisation of the
precious resources. Yet knowledge of recipient- and
donor-related factors that contribute to optimal outcomes in older recipients after kidney transplantation
are unclear, because most studies that have included
patients aged $65 years are limited by small sample
size, without relevant listing data and hence with uncertain effects on patient-relevant outcomes.[14][�][16] In
this study, we aimed to determine the recipient-related
and donor-related factors that are associated with patient and graft survivals in a large cohort of kidney
transplant recipients aged $65 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
This observational study used linked data between the
Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant
(ANZDATA) registry and the National Organ Matching
System (NOMS). Data were collected through the calendar year by medical and nursing staff in each renal
unit in Australia and New Zealand and submitted
annually to the ANZDATA registry by the end of
March in the following year. We included all Australian patients who had commenced dialysis when
aged $65 years and were subsequently placed on the
deceased donor kidney transplant waitlist between 28
June 2006 and 31 December 2016 (inclusive), who then
received their first kidney transplant (living or
deceased donor) during this study period. This study
was approved by the Western Sydney Local Health
District ethics committee. We adhered to the
Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies
in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for conduct and
reporting (see Supplementary Material).

Data Collection
Baseline data on recipients included age, ethnicity, sex,
Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) score (with a
higher score indicating greater socioeconomic advantage), causes of primary renal disease, and comorbidities (including coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease,
diabetes mellitus) at the time of waitlisting and transplantation, and smoking status (at the time of renal
replacement therapy). We also collected data on the
date and cause of death. Transplantation data collected
included the date of the kidney transplantation, donor
details (age, sex, and total ischemic time in hours), data


on immediate graft function (with delayed graft
function” defined as “no immediate function and
dialysis required within 72 hours” and with “no
delayed graft function” defined as “spontaneous fall in
serum creatinine by 10% within 24 hours”, “spontaneous fall in serum creatinine by 10% first recorded
between 25 and 72 hours”, or “poor immediate function with no spontaneous fall in serum creatinine
within 72 hours but no dialysis required”), and date
and cause of graft failure. Data collected from NOMS
included dates of waitlisting and waitlisting status for
each recipient.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was overall patient survival,
defined as time from kidney transplantation to death,
censored for loss to follow-up or end of inclusion
period for the study (31 December 2016).
Secondary outcomes included death with a functioning graft (censored for graft failure, loss to followup, or end of the inclusion period), overall graft survival (censored for loss to follow-up and end of the
inclusion period), and death-censored graft survival
(censored for death, loss to follow-up, or end of the
inclusion period). Overall graft survival was defined as
the time from kidney transplantation until death with a
functioning graft or return to dialysis.

Covariates
Recipient factors that were analyzed as potential risk
factors were sex, age at transplantation, Socioeconomic
Index for Area (SEIFA) score, primary renal disease,
dialysis modality at time of transplantation (hemodialysis [HD], or peritoneal dialysis [PD]), ethnicity
(Caucasian, Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander, Asian,
Maori, Pacific and other), smoking status, comorbidities at time of transplantation (coronary artery disease,
peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease,
chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus), body mass
index at time of transplantation (kg/m[2]), state of residence at time of transplantation, year of transplantation, acute rejection (defined by ANZDATA as
rejection within the first 6 months posttransplantation),
delayed graft function (which we defined as “no immediate function and dialysis required within 72
hours” from the data available from the ANZDATA
Registry), and time on dialysis prior to transplantation.
The total time that a patient was not active on the
deceased donor waitlist was calculated as a proportion
of the total time from time of being waitlisted to
transplantation. Donor-related factors that were also
assessed as potential risk factors included the age of the
donor, sex, deceased versus living kidney donor status,
and ischemic time.

Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were summarized using means
and SDs for normally distributed variables, and medians and interquartile ranges for non�normally
distributed variables. Comparison of baseline characteristics between recipients who reached the primary
outcome of interest (i.e., death) and those who did not,
were made by the Student t test and c[2] test for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess
predictors of all-cause mortality, death with a functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft loss.
Kaplan�Meier curves were constructed to estimate
survival time until all-cause mortality, death with a
functioning graft, and overall and death-censored graft
loss. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Fine
and Gray competing risks models[17] for graft failure,
with death as a competing event, and death with graft
failure as a competing event.


Underwent transplanta�on


For each model, potential risk factors were first
assessed by univariable analysis. Variables with P
values <0.20 on univariable analysis were included in
the initial multivariable model. Backward stepwise
variable selection was applied, and variables with P
values <0.05 in the multivariable model were kept.
Acute rejection was modeled as a time-dependent covariate, with time without a prior rejection episode
considered “no previous rejection” and time after
experiencing any acute rejection episode counted as
“rejection.” We performed prespecified tests for effect
modification between patient age at transplantation and
sex and the other included covariates in the models.
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics v22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and R
version 3.6.0 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). A P
value of ˂0.05 was regarded as significant. The proportional hazard assumption was assessed in all models
using the coxph.zph function and graphically by

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Cohort
A total of 1324 patients commenced KRT aged $65
years and were listed on the deceased donor kidney
transplant waitlist between June 2006 and December
2016. Of these, 1267 had no prior transplants. In all,
802 received either a deceased or living donor transplant during this period (Figure 1).
Most transplant recipients were men (531, 66.2%).
Seven hundred five (87.9%) recipients received transplants from deceased donors. The median age at
transplantation was 68 years (interquartile range



[IQR]: 66�69 years). The median time on renal
replacement therapy was 37.9 months. The median
time from kidney replacement therapy to waitlisting
was 16.6 months (IQR: 8.7�31.7 months). The most
common causes of primary kidney disease were
glomerulonephritis (n ¼ 276, 34.4%), followed by
diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 (n ¼ 147, 18.3%) and
polycystic kidney disease (n ¼ 118, 14.7%). Median
ischemic time was 11 hours (IQR ¼ 7�15 hours).
Baseline characteristics of patients who received their
first kidney transplants are shown in Table 1.

Patient Survival
Over a follow-up time of 2707 patient-years, 136 patients (17% of total patients) died, and 111 patients
(81.6% of total deaths) died with a functioning graft.

and 79% (95% CI ¼ 75.1%�82.9%) respectively
(Figure 2a). The 1-year and 5-year survivals with a

Factors Associated With All-Cause Death and
Death With a Functioning Graft
Factors associated with all-cause death (adjusted HR

[95% confidence interval]) included pretransplantation
dialysis modality as peritoneal dialysis (1.71 [1.17–


2.51]), prevalent coronary artery disease (1.47 [1.03–
2.11]), prevalent cerebrovascular disease (1.99 [1.26–
3.16]), total ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03–1.09]),
increasing donor age (1.02 per year [1.01–1.03]), and
delayed graft function (1.64 [1.13�2.39]). Factors
associated with all-cause death and death with a
functioning graft (discussed below) are represented in
Figure 4.
Factors associated with death with a functioning
graft (adjusted HR [95%] were pretransplantation

(1.05 per 1-hour increase [1.02�1.09], P ¼ 0.004). In
the sensitivity analysis, similar estimates were found
for the association between death and pretransplantation dialysis modality (PD) (1.69

(with graft loss considered as a competing risk event)
(Supplementary Table S4).

Graft Survival
Overall, 51 patients (6.4%) lost their allografts. Causes
of graft loss are shown in Figure 5. The 1-year and 5year overall graft survivals were 92.9% (95% CI ¼


91.1%�94.7%) and 75.4% (95% CI ¼ 71.3%�79.5%)
(Figure 2c), respectively. The 1-year and 5-year deathcensored graft survivals were 96.8% (95% CI ¼
95.4%�98.2%) and 92% (95% CI ¼ 89.8%�94.2%)

Increasing proportion of inactive time on the waitlist
was not associated with adverse patient and graft
outcomes after transplantation (adjusted HR [95%

For patients who were on hemodialysis prior to
transplantation, the median time from KRT to waitlisting was 18.4 months (IQR ¼ 9.7–37.4 months), and
median time on KRT prior to transplantation was 42.1

DISCUSSION

In this selected cohort of elderly transplant recipients,
our study findings suggest that overall patient and
graft survival rates may be comparable to those in
younger recipients, with 5-year patient and deathcensored graft survivals exceeding 75%. These patient and graft survivals are higher than what has been
previously reported in older transplant recipients
(aged $65 years). Such discrepant findings may be
attributed to the younger donor ages observed in our
study and also recipients from different transplantation
eras. A single prior study has focused on recipients
who received their first transplant largely in the last
decade (2002–2012).[18] Apart from the known recipientrelated risk factors for death including coronary artery
disease and cerebrovascular disease,[14][,][19] we have
shown that dialysis modality prior to transplantation is
a risk factor for adverse outcomes after transplantation.
Patients on peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation
experienced an excess risk of death by 1.5-fold
compared to patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
On the contrary, prior work indicated pretransplant dialysis modality was not a risk factor for
patient survival.[19][�][26] However, most of the published
data included younger populations, with a mean age
of recipients under 50 years.[19][,][20][,][26] Given the observational nature of the analyses, participants were not
randomly assigned to the initial type of dialysis.
Inherent biases including selection, confounding, and
indication biases may exist; therefore, causality cannot
be established. Patients on PD typically have lower
hemoglobin and serum albumin levels compared to
patients with pretransplantation HD,[20] and this may
have contributed to the increased risk of death.
Consistent with previous literature,[27] in our cohort,
those patients on HD had a higher prevalence of
coronary artery disease (Supplementary Material).
However, 1 recent paper[27] showed that despite this
higher prevalence, there was no difference in survival
between patients receiving HD and those receiving
PD, but there was a trend toward increased mortality
in those aged $65 years who were receiving PD with
a dialysis vintage of over 3 years. This is also applicable to many of the patients on PD prior to transplantation in our cohort, who had a mean dialysis
vintage of more than 3 years, and may partly explain
our finding. Further investigation into the role of
dialysis-related factors and its impact on elderly kidney transplant recipients is warranted.


Although preferential allocation of older donors to
older recipients is not an explicit criteria for the
deceased donor organ allocation in Australia, as is
currently implemented in the Eurotransplant Program[28] and the US Kidney Allocation System,[28] there
is evidence to suggest that an “old-for-old” standard
has been applied implicitly in the Australian
deceased donor allocation system. Given the persistent shortage of donor organs and the advancing age
of the end-stage kidney disease population, balancing
utility (allocation of organs to those who derive the
greatest benefit) against justice (equal access to
transplantation for all age groups) is a critical element
for consideration of an equitable deceased donor
allocation algorithm within Australia.[29] Transplantation of an elderly recipient with an older
kidney still offers a survival benefit over dialysis,[6]

and reduces waiting time for transplantation,[30] but
these advantages need to be carefully weighed
against the known risk of increased graft loss and
mortality compared to those in recipients of deceased
donor kidneys with higher kidney donor profile index (KDPI).[30]

The most common cause of death in our study was
infectious complications, which is consistent with prior
literature in the elderly kidney transplantation population.[31][�][33] A single study suggested that reduction of
immunosuppression in elderly patients aged $60
years[34] was associated with improved patient and graft
outcomes, but current guidelines do not consider the
adverse effects such as catastrophic infections that are
unique and important to older recipients.[35] Evidence
on recommended immunosuppressive regimens is
derived mainly from trials in which where elderly
patients were either excluded or a minority.[36] Any
reduction of immunosuppression must balance the
risks and implications of increased rejection. Rejection
episodes in the elderly transplant recipient may have a
disproportionately higher adverse impact on graft loss
compared to that in younger recipients.[37] Further
comparative studies on the optimal immunosuppression regimen in this population is warranted.
One of the strengths of this study was the large and
complete cohort, which included all elderly kidney
transplant recipients in Australia and New Zealand
during the study period, with few missing values, good
follow-up data points, and involvement in all transplantation centers, thus enhancing external validity.
However, our study has focused on a highly selected
cohort of elderly patients, and these findings may not
be generalizable to all patients of this age group on
maintenance dialysis.
Our study also has several limitations. Residual
confounding effects may exist, as details pertaining to


-----

the parameters of dialysis adequacy prior to transplantation and the reasons for the choice of pretransplantation dialysis modality were not collected
routinely. Furthermore, frailty is a risk factor for poor
outcomes posttransplantation,[9] and markers of frailty
are not routinely collected by the registry. Other information such as the severity of disease are not
routinely collected, and prior treatment or interventions of vascular comorbidities are also not reported within the registry. Similarly, details regarding
the stage and histological types of prior cancers were
also missing. As such, we were unable to quantify the
impact of these co-existing comorbidities as potential
prognostic factors on death.
Although the relative risk of mortality is increased
in the elderly transplant recipient compared to younger
transplant recipients,[38] it is reassuring to note that the
absolute rates of death 1 year and 5 years posttransplantation among older recipients remains low.
Pre-existing vascular disease is a major risk factor for
adverse outcomes after transplantation, and careful
evaluation and selection of the appropriate candidates
is necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes and use
of this scarce resource.
In conclusion, in this selected cohort of elderly
kidney transplant recipients, 5-year patient and graft
survivals exceeded 75%. Results from this study have
identified several factors associated with death and
graft failure, which may be critical to inform the selection and to identify targets of opportunity to
improve outcomes in elderly dialysis patients for future
kidney transplantation.
