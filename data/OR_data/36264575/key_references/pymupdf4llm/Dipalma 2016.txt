**_Abstract_** (200 words): Previous studies have reported contradictory results regarding the effect of pre
transplant dialysis modality on the outcomes after kidney transplantation (KT). To minimize the confounding

effect of donor-related variables, we performed a donor-matched retrospective comparison of 160 patients

that received only one modality of pre-transplant dialysis (peritoneal dialysis [PD] and hemodialysis [HD] in

80 patients each) and that subsequently underwent KT at our center between January 1990 and December

2007. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between pre-transplant dialysis modality

and primary study outcomes (death-censored graft survival and patient survival). To control for imbalances

in recipient-related baseline characteristics, we performed additional adjustments for the propensity score

(PS) for receiving pre-transplant PD (versus HD). There were no significant differences according to pre
transplant dialysis modality in death-censored graft survival (PS-adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.65; 95%

confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.25-1.68) or patient survival (aHR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.13-2.68). There were no

differences in 10-year graft function or in the incidence of post-transplant complications either, except for a

higher risk of lymphocele in patients undergoing PD (odds ratio: 4.31; 95% CI: 1.15-16.21). In conclusion,

pre-transplant dialysis modality in KT recipients does not impact short- or long-term graft outcomes or patient

survival.

**Introduction**

A key factor in the choice between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) in patients with end-stage

renal disease (ESRD) is the potential impact exerted by dialysis modality on the success of an eventual

kidney transplant (KT) procedure. Unfortunately, conflicting results have been reported on the effect of pre
transplant dialysis modality on graft and patient survival. Several studies have reported an association

between the use of PD and poorer outcomes due to an increased incidence of graft thrombosis (1-7), new
onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) (8), infection (9) or acute graft rejection (10-12), leading to a


lower short-term graft survival (5,10). In contrast, other studies have found better outcomes in patients

receiving PD, including lower rates of delayed graft function (DGF) (5,12-19) or shorter time on dialysis

(13,15,20,21). Finally, some authors have reported no significant differences between both dialysis

modalities in terms of the risk of DGF (22-24), acute tubular necrosis (22,24-26), graft rejection (22-25),

infection (22), thrombosis (22), NODAT (27), or graft and patient survival (18,22-26,28-31).

These inconsistent results may be due to factors that are unrelated to dialysis modality, such as donor

characteristics or differences in methodological design (i.e., registry-based or single-center studies). In all of

them the patients compared according to the dialysis modality had received grafts from different donors, thus

hampering an accurate adjustment for imbalances in donor-related characteristics. In addition, some authors

included patients that had received both PD and HD in a sequential manner. To date, no study has

compared outcomes in pairs of patients with ESRD treated with different, single pre-transplant dialysis

modalities who subsequently received kidney grafts from the same donors.

We hypothesized that dialysis modality could influence the short- and long-term post-transplant outcomes. In

order to precisely control for donor-related variables, the present study was aimed at analyzing the impact of

pre-transplant dialysis modality (PD or HD) by using a large cohort of donor-matched KT recipients.

**Methods**

_Study population and design_

This retrospective cohort study was performed at the University Hospital "12 de Octubre" (Madrid, Spain).

Overall, 2,081 patients underwent KT at our institution between January 1990 and December 2007. The key

inclusion criterion was that one of the two grafts from a given donor was transplanted into a patient who had

received only PD during the pre-transplant period and that the second graft was transplanted into a patient

who had received only HD. Patients who sequentially underwent both dialysis modalities were excluded, as

well as those receiving a double KT, a double-organ transplantation or an organ from a living donor. On the

basis of these criteria, and through a computer-aided search into our institutional transplant database, we

selected 160 donor-matched patients: 80 received only pre-transplant PD (PD group) and 80 received only

pre-transplant HD (HD group). The modality of pre-transplant dialysis was not formally accounted for in the

manual allocation process. The functions of Transplant Coordinator were performed by the same person

throughout the entire study period (A.A.). In addition, the same surgical team performed both types of

procedures. A number of pre-transplant, peri-operative and post-transplant variables were retrospectively

recorded for each patient by using a dedicated data collection form. The need for specific informed consent

was waived by the Institutional Review Board due to the retrospective and non-interventional nature of the


investigation.

_Study outcomes and definitions_

The primary study outcomes were death-censored graft survival and patient survival. Graft loss was defined

as return to dialysis or retransplantation. _Secondary outcomes included long-term graft function (as_

assessed by estimated glomerular filtrate rate [eGFR] through different post-transplant points), DGF (defined

as the need for dialysis within the first week after transplantation) and primary graft non-function (defined as

permanent absence of graft function starting immediately post-transplant). Other post-transplant

complications were also analyzed: biopsy-proven acute graft rejection, infection (only episodes requiring

hospitalization and intravenous therapy were considered), surgical reintervention, vascular complications

(including arterial or venous graft thrombosis and renal artery stenosis), urinary complications (including

symptomatic urinary leakage and ureteral stricture), NODAT, cardiovascular events (including coronary

artery disease, stroke and other forms of cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease leading to

critical ischemia of the lower limbs), lymphocele (defined as the presence of a peri-graft fluid collection with a

diameter >5 cm diagnosed beyond the first week after transplantation), and _de novo malignancy._

Dyslipidemia was defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >100 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein

cholesterol <40 mg/dL in men or <45 mg/dL in women, and/or triglycerides >150 mg/dL (32). The eGFR was

estimated through the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (33).

_Immunosuppression and prophylaxis regimens and dialysis catheter management_

All recipients of organs from donors after circulatory death underwent induction therapy with intravenous (IV)

rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (ATG-Fresenius, 1.25 mg/Kg daily for 5-7 days), with the delayed

introduction of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) from day 6 post-transplant due to the high incidence of delayed

graft function among these patients. Recipients at high immunological risk ⎯peak panel-reactive antibody

(PRA) level >50%, second KT in case the first graft was lost due to rejection within the previous two years,

or those receiving a third or fourth kidney graft⎯ also received ATG induction at the same dose for 1-3 days

with the early initiation of the CNI from day 0. Induction therapy with basiliximab (20 mg on days 0 and 4)

was used in patients at high risk of CNI-related nephrotoxicity due to advanced age or certain pre-transplant

comorbidities (i.e., diabetes), with the delayed introduction of the CNI from day 5 post-transplant. If a patient

also fulfilled the criteria for high immunological risk, induction therapy was based on ATG for 3 days.

Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A (2.5 mg/Kg daily, adjusted to a target trough

level of 200-300 ng/mL during the first month and 100-150 ng/mL thereafter) or tacrolimus (0.1 mg/Kg daily,


adjusted to a target trough level of 10-15 ng/mL for the first month and 5-10 ng/mL thereafter);

mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1,000 mg twice daily) or mycophenolic acid (MPA) (720 mg twice daily); and

prednisone (1 mg/Kg daily with progressive tapering). MMF/MPA was replaced with azathioprine (1.5

mg/Kg/day) in patients with impaired wound healing or early occurrence of urinary leakage. Conversion from

CNI- to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor-based immunosuppression was reserved to

patients developing with post-transplant _de novo malignancy, severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, or_

unacceptable CNI-related toxicity.

All patients received a single dose of IV cefazolin as peri-operative prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for

_Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg three times weekly) was_

given for 9 months. In patients at high-risk for CMV disease (donor/recipient mismatch or induction therapy

with ATG), either IV ganciclovir (5 mg/Kg daily) or oral valganciclovir (900 mg daily) were administered for 3

months.

The catheter used for pre-transplant PD was removed at the end of the transplant procedure, in an attempt

to decrease the risk of catheter-related peritonitis. If required due to the development of DGF, these patients

received HD through a newly inserted central venous catheter. In those patients in which no arteriovenous

fistula could be created or the fistula was non-functioning, the catheter used for pre-transplant HD was

usually removed during the first weeks post-transplantation, once the graft function had stabilized.

_Statistical analysis_

Quantitative data were shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or the median with interquartile ranges

(IQR). Qualitative variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. Categorical variables were

compared using the χ[2] test, whereas Student’s T test or U Mann-Whitney test were applied for continuous

variables, as appropriate. Paired Student’s T test was used for comparison between paired grafts obtained

from the same donor. Correlations were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Survival curves were

plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between groups were compared with the log-rank test.

Multivariate Cox regression models with backward stepwise variable selection were used to evaluate the

association between the pre-transplant dialysis modality and study outcomes. Some clinically relevant

factors (i.e., recipient and donor age, peak PRA or pre-transplant dialysis vintage) were also forced into the

multivariate models irrespective of their univariate statistical significance. Cox regression models were

stratified by matched pairs. Results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals

(CIs).

To partially overcome the limitation posed by the non-randomized design of our study, we calculated the


propensity score (PS) for receiving PD as pre-transplant dialysis modality (versus HD) according to a given

patient’s features. The PS-based methodology takes into account the predicted probability of treatment

assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics, aiming at analyzing an observational study in a

way that mimics to some extent the nature of a randomized controlled trial (34). Conditional on the PS

derived from the fitted regression model, the distribution of baseline covariates should be similar between

patients treated with PD or HD. The PS was based on the covariates selected by a conditional logistic

regression analysis that included those baseline (pre-transplant) variables that differed between PD and HD

groups with univariate P-values <0.1. The fit of the resulting model was assessed by means of the Hosmer
Lemeshow test and the area under the receiving operator characteristics curve (auROC). The estimated PS

was then entered in the different multivariate models in which the remaining explanatory covariates were

retained in order to adjust for potential confounding due to factors associated with the choice of the type of

dialysis (34). The impact of the pre-transplant dialysis modality on the risk of specific post-transplant

complications (secondary outcomes) was assessed through logistic regression, with results expressed as

odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. All the significance tests were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed

with SPSS v. 15.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences Inc., Chicago, IL), and graphics were generated

with Prism v. 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

**Results**

_Baseline characteristics and post-transplant immunosuppression_

The demographics and clinical characteristics of the 80 donors providing the 80 graft pairs are depicted in

**Table 1. Most of them were young males with brain death following head trauma that required vasoactive**

drug support. On the other hand, Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the 160 recipients analyzed.

Most variables were well balanced between both groups. However, as compared to those who received HD,

patients in the PD group had shorter dialysis vintage, higher prevalence of pre-transplant dyslipidemia, lower

number of pre-transplant blood product transfusions, higher residual urine output, lower immunological risk

—as reflected by both peak and current PRA levels— and lower baseline values of hemoglobin and serum

albumin. After entering these eight variables into the conditional logistic regression model, the following

covariates were selected to construct the PS: pre-transplant dyslipidemia, residual urine output, and baseline

serum albumin (Table S1). The resulting PS showed a goodness-of-fit to the data (Hosmer-Lemeshow test

_P-value = 0.377; auROC: 0.871; 95% CI: 0.812-0.930)._

There were no significant differences between both groups regarding peri-transplant variables, type of

induction therapy, or primary or maintenance immunosuppression (Table 3). The cold ischemia times were


roughly equal between the paired grafts from the same donor (1,222.0 ± 269.4 versus 1,235.5 ± 261.5

minutes for kidney #1 and kidney #2, respectively; _P-value = 0.499) and the correlation between both_

variables was high (Pearson’s r = 0.635; _P-value = 0.000). There were no significant differences in the_

duration of immediate post-transplant oliguria (i.e. total daily urine output <500 mL) between both grafts

either (mean duration: 3.6 versus 3.2 days for kidney #1 and kidney #2; P-value = 0.111).

_Post-transplant outcomes_

The median follow-up for the overall cohort was 73.0 months (IQR: 36-99.8). Death-censored graft loss

occurred in 13 (16.2%) and 15 (18.8%) patients in the PD and HD groups, respectively. There were no

differences in death-censored graft survival between both groups, with 1-, 5- and 10-year rates of 94%, 84%

and 78% in patients receiving PD compared to 92%, 82% and 77% in those receiving HD (log-rank test P
value = 0.722) (Figure 1). We found no significant differences in patient survival either (1-, 5- and 10-year

survival rates of 97%, 87% and 74% in the PD group compared to 97%, 92% and 67% in the HD group; log
rank test P-value = 0.954) (Figure 2). This lack of association persisted after adjusting by Cox regression for

clinical covariates (patient and donor age, pre-transplant comorbidities, type of underlying ESRD, peak PRA,

pre-transplant dialysis vintage, occurrence of DGF or acute graft rejection), as well as after adding the PS for

receiving pre-transplant PD into these models (Table 4).

There were no significant differences in the rate of primary graft non-function or DGF between patients

receiving PD or HD, as detailed in **Table 5. Long-term graft function, as measured by eGFR at different**

points throughout the first 10 post-transplant years, was also similar in both groups (Figure 3).

_Other post-transplant complications_

Finally, we found no differences in the occurrence of early (i.e., during the post-transplant hospitalization

period) or long-term post-transplant complications according to the pre-transplant dialysis modality (Table 5),

except for the higher incidence of lymphocele in the PD group compared to the HD group (17.3% [13/80]

versus 3.9% [3/80], respectively; _P-value = 0.007). The independent impact of pre-transplant PD on the_

development of lymphocele persisted in a logistic regression model adjusted for recipient age, dialysis

vintage, serum albumin level at transplantation and induction with ATG (OR: 4.31; 95% CI: 1.15-16.21; _P-_

value = 0.031).

**Discussion**

In order to assess whether pre-transplant dialysis modality plays a role on the expected benefits derived


from KT, we have analyzed the short- and long-term outcomes in two groups of recipients undergoing only

PD or HD who received paired grafts from the same deceased donors. In addition, in view of the differences

in some recipient-related baseline variables between both groups, we performed a PS-based multivariate

analysis that provided further adjustment for confounding bias. By using these approaches we found no

significant differences in either the primary ⎯death-censored graft survival and all-cause mortality⎯ or

secondary outcomes ⎯which included the 10-year evolution of the graft function. The effect of pre-transplant

PD only became evident for the risk of developing lymphocele but not for other post-transplant

complications.

Previous studies analyzing the influence of pre-transplant dialysis modalities on short- and long-term kidney

graft outcome have yielded controversial results (summarized in Table 6). This may be due to differences in

study design, including dissimilar donor-related characteristics or unequal numbers of patients analyzed

within each group (18,23,26,30,35). In addition, several studies included patients who had received both PD

and HD in a sequential manner (3,5,19,21) that were further categorized according to the modality used for

the longest period (21) or at the time of transplantation (5). Repeated thrombosis of the vascular access is

one of the most common reasons for changing from HD to PD, a circumstance that could partially account

for the higher incidence of graft thrombosis associated to pre-transplant PD in some studies (3).

Interestingly, by including patients who had received only one pre-transplant dialysis modality, we found no

differences in the occurrence of graft thrombosis between both groups.

The study by Kramer et al (30), which included more than 29000 patients from 16 European registries,

reported opposing results depending on the statistical analysis performed. In an attempt to decrease the risk

of confounding by indication the authors applied an instrumental variable method, which is used to

approximate randomization in observational studies. Although standard Cox regression model showed a

potential benefit from pre-transplant PD in terms of graft and patient survival, such association was not

confirmed in the instrumental analysis (30). The findings of the present study, although based on an

alternative methodological approach (PS-adjusted analysis), confirm those reported by Kramer et al.

In previous studies the grafts transplanted into patients receiving pre-transplant PD or HD had been obtained

from different donors, which may also influence the inconsistent findings in the literature. In line to other

authors (36-42), we designed our study to minimize the effect of donor-related characteristics by means of a

donor-matched approach that ensured that graft pairs were extracted and preserved under identical

conditions and transplanted by the same surgical team with comparable surgical procedures and post
operative care management. In addition, the single-center nature of our study obviates any potential inter

center confounding. Thus, we were able to adjust for the quality of the transplanted graft and to focus

exclusively on graft- and patient-specific functional outcomes.

In our experience, patients receiving pre-transplant PD spent shorter time on dialysis than those who

underwent HD. Such finding has been also reported in previous studies (5,13) and is not totally unexpected,

since in many centers PD constitutes the modality preferentially offered to the best transplant candidates

whereas HD is usually reserved to those patients who are deemed less suitable for KT (5). Accordingly,

there were no significant differences in other baseline characteristics ⎯such as the number of pre-transplant

comorbidities⎯ that could account for the between-group imbalance observed in the dialysis vintage.

Hypervolemia, better blood pressure control, shorter cold ischemia time and larger residual urine output

have been proposed as protective factors associated with a shorter time to the recovery of graft function in

patients previously receiving PD as compared to HD (12,13,16). We have found no significant differences in

cold ischemia time or baseline mean blood pressure between both groups whereas, as expected, the

residual urine output was higher among patients treated with PD. Although this variable has been shown to

be beneficial in other studies (12,13,16), in our experience it was not associated to a better graft outcome in

the PD group, as evidenced by the similar rates of primary graft non-function and DGF and the comparable

numbers of days of oliguria and of post-transplant dialysis sessions. Not surprisingly, the number of blood

product transfusions was higher among patients undergoing HD, since blood losses are more common with

this modality than with PD. In accordance to this, the immunological risk was higher in the HD group, a

finding that may be also explained by the numerically higher rate of second transplants in these patients.

Nevertheless, the incidence of acute graft rejection was similar irrespective of the pre-transplant dialysis

modality, likely due to the more frequent use of ATG as induction therapy in the HD group.

We found no apparent impact of the modality of dialysis on the incidence of early (i.e., during the post
transplant hospitalization period) or long-term complications either. The most common difference reported in

previous studies was a higher risk of graft thrombosis in patients receiving PD (1-6), an association that has

been explained by the presence of hypercoagulability states (43,44) and obesity (45) in this group. Our study

did not confirm this finding and, in addition, we found no significant differences in baseline body mass index

(BMI) between patients receiving PD or HD. Therefore, the association observed by other authors may have

been due to certain donor characteristics or to the presence of undiagnosed prothrombotic conditions in the

recipient, which would have in turn led to a change from pre-transplant HD to PD following vascular access

thrombosis. Although it has been reported a higher incidence of post-transplant infection in KT recipients

receiving pre-transplant PD (9), in our experience there were no differences in the occurrence of such event.


Lymphocele constitutes the only post-transplant complication whose incidence was found to be significantly

higher in patients who received PD. Lymphocele ⎯a collection of lymph fluid in a cavity that is not covered

by an epithelial membrane⎯ occurs in 0.6% to 49% of KT recipients, mainly due to the surgical injury to the

iliac or renal hilar lymphatic vessels. Differences in diagnostic criteria underlie the broad variability in the

reporting frequency of this complication across different series (21,46-48). A higher incidence of lymphocele

and peri-graft fluid collection has been correlated by some authors with the presence of acute graft rejection

and obesity (46) and with the type of immunosuppression used, mainly those including mTOR inhibitors (46
48). Two studies have evaluated the occurrence of lymphocele after KT according to the pre-transplant

dialysis modality, with conflicting results (22,49). Caliskan et al. did not find significant differences between

patients receiving PD or HD; however, it was not clear whether the definition of lymphocele included only the

presence of lymphatic fluid or also other forms of peri-graft fluid collection (22). On the other hand, Kitada et

al. reported a higher occurrence of ascites among living-donor KT recipients who had received PD as

compared to those who underwent HD (49). Of note, the association found in our study between pre
transplant PD and lymphocele was independent of the baseline BMI, the use of mTOR inhibitors or the

occurrence of acute graft rejection. It could be hypothesized the role of changes in the lymphatic circulation

due to pre-transplant peritoneal stress ⎯such as that associated to PD⎯ or post-transplant alterations in

mesothelial cells due to the intra-operative administration of large volumes of fluids (49).

Some limitations to the present study should be noted, including its retrospective nature and relatively small

sample size, which might compromise the stability of the multivariate analyses. It is conventionally assumed

that Cox models should be used with a minimum of 10 events per predictor variable, as the results are

subject to increasing bias and variability, unreliable confidence interval coverage and problems with model

convergence when this ratio declines below such threshold (50). Moreover, it should not be ruled out that the

observed absence of differences in outcome might reflect a type 2 statistical error, particularly if attempts to

extrapolate our results to specific subpopulations of patients (i.e., those with pre-transplant diabetes) are

made. Although the analysis of paired kidneys constitutes a well-established methodological approach in the

literature to reduce the confounding effect of donor-related characteristics (36-42), we cannot guarantee that

the functions of both grafts harvested from the same donor were strictly comparable. In an attempt to control

for certain imbalances found in the baseline characteristics between patients undergoing different pre
transplant dialysis modalities (i.e., dialysis vintage or immunological risk), we performed an additional

adjustment through a PS-based analysis. However, propensity analysis can only adjust for known measured

variables, so we are unable to exclude the potential effect of other confounders. In that sense, there was a


non-significant trend towards an increased presence of dyslipidemia at baseline ⎯a cardiovascular risk

factor that was found to be associated to mortality⎯ within the PD group. However, about half of the patients

in both groups were given statins, suggesting the implementation of an intensive lipid-lowering strategy

during the post-transplant period that was even more evident among patients undergoing HD, likely due to

their higher prevalence of established cardiovascular disease. Testing for donor-specific antibodies (DSA)

was not systematically performed during the study period, thus preventing us from assessing the impact of

this variable on graft outcome. Finally, the generalizability of our results to the contemporary transplant

practices may be limited due to the long time period spanned by the study (i.e., our patients had mean age

and BMI values at transplantation lower than those usually reported in more recent series).

In conclusion, our study of donor-matched KT recipients that underwent only one modality of pre-transplant

dialysis did not find significant differences in either short- or long-term graft or patient outcomes, including

death-censored graft survival or all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that both PD and HD are equally

valid options for patients with ESRD on the waiting list for KT, as it is likely that donor- and graft-related

variables may well play a larger role than the pre-transplant dialysis modality in determining post-transplant

outcomes. Future multicenter studies with a similar donor-matched and PS-adjusted design that includes

post-transplant DSA monitoring should be carried out to corroborate these results in a larger and more

contemporary cohort of patients.

Resende et al (23) N = 421 [PD: 47, HD: 374] 8 years No differences in the incidence of
DGF and acute rejection, graft and
patient survival, and graft function


Satoh et al (11) N = 38 [PD: 16, HD: 22] 30
months


Higher incidence of acute rejection in
the PD group


Snyder et al (5) N = 252402 [PD: 33162, HD:
219240]


5 years Higher probability of receiving KT
transplantation, lower incidence of
DGF, and higher incidence of sortterm graft failure and graft
thrombosis in the PD group


Tomura et al (44) N = 34 [PD: 17, HD: 17] NA Higher presence of
hypercoagulability state and higher
incidence of cardiovascular events in
the PD group


Van Biesen et al
(14)


N = 119 [PD: 40, HD: 79] NA Lower incidence of DGF and acute
renal failure in the PD group


van der Vliet et al (6) N = 915 [PD: 303, HD: 612] NA Higher incidence of graft thrombosis
in the PD group


Vanholder et al (12) N = 234 [PD: 117, HD: 117] 6
months


Higher incidence of acute graft
rejection and lower incidence of DGF
in the PD group


ATN: acute tubular necrosis; DGF: delayed graft function; HD: hemodialysis; NA: not available; NODAT: new-onset
diabetes mellitus after transplantation; PD: peritoneal dialysis.
