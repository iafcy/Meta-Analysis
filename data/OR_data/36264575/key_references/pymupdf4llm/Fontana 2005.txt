Introduction


Summary

Delayed graft function (DGF) is a frequent complication of kidney transplantation (KT) that may affect both short- and long-term graft outcome. It has been
reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better
recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be
unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the
potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric
patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome
parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T1/2(SCr)], while DGF was defined as a T1/2(SCr) >3 days
after KT (n ¼ 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or
DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the
day of KT (P ¼ 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P ¼ 0.005), warm ischemia
time (WIT) (P ¼ 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and
T1/2(SCr) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first
24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate
exponential correlation that was carried out between T1/2(SCr) and all the other
variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R[2] ¼
0.28 vs. R[2] ¼ 0.04), BSA (R[2] ¼ 0.29 vs. R[2] ¼ 0.03), and SCr (R[2] ¼ 0.51 vs.
R[2] ¼ 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T1/

2(SCr) [as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold isc-]
hemia time (CIT) (P ¼ 0.027) but not PDM (P ¼ 0.195) reached significance.
In a Cox regression analysis carried out with T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable,
neither CIT nor PDM gained significance. This study suggests that PDM does
not affect early graft function in pediatric kidney recipients.


The need for dialysis and a delayed decrease of serum creatinine (SCr) are frequent complications of kidney transplantation (KT) [1,2]. A delay in recovery of graft
function may persist for many months after KT, affecting
graft survival [3,4]. Delayed graft function (DGF) may
increase the risk for acute rejection (AR) in adult kidney
recipients, and a combination of DGF and AR has been
reported to cause a graft loss of up to 50% within the


first year after KT [5]. Moreover, DGF is able to decrease
long-term survival of transplanted kidneys [6,7], and its
negative impact on graft survival may be predicted by the
evolution of SCr rather than by the need for dialysis [6].
Thus, the effort to identify the potential risk factors that
impair the incidence and severity of DGF seems to be a
remarkable target [8].
It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal
dialysis (PD) was correlated with a better recovery of
renal function and overall short-term graft outcome than

hemodialysis (HD) in adult kidney recipients [8,9]. This
finding may be related to a more stable fluid status
observed in adults patients submitted to PD [8]. However, the impact of pretransplantation dialysis mode
(PDM) on pediatric patients seemed to exert no clear
effect on the graft outcome, suggesting the need for further investigation [10]. With this aim, in the present
study the potential impact of PDM on the development
of DGF was evaluated in a pediatric patient cohort.

Patients and methods

Patient selection criteria
In our department, 257 pediatric patients underwent a
first KT from cadaveric donors between 1 June 1987 and
30 September 2001. For this study, we preliminarily considered only pediatric patients that were submitted to
dialysis (PD or HD) for at least 3 months before KT,
without switch from one dialysis modality to the other.
Patient exclusion criteria were never-functioning grafts,
acute renal failure (ARF) caused by vascular occlusion,
obstructive nephropathy, biopsy-demonstrated hyperacute
rejection, multiple-organ transplant, and incomplete preand/or post-transplantation data sets [8]. Following these
criteria, clinical records of 174 pediatric patients (male/
female ¼ 97/77) were entered in the analyses. Kidney
recipients were grouped for pretransplant dialysis (PD,
n ¼ 79; HD, n ¼ 95) and early graft function.

Primary diseases

Pediatric kidney recipients enrolled in this study were in
the following diagnostic categories: irreversible chronic
renal failure (n ¼ 61; 35.05%), hereditary nephropathies
(n ¼ 32; 18.39%), irreversible ARF (n ¼ 20; 11.49%),
congenital disorders (n ¼ 18; 10.34%), metabolic disorders (n ¼ 7; 4.02%), obstructive uropathies (n ¼ 3;
1.72%), toxic nephropathies (n ¼ 2; 1.14%), tumors
requiring nephrectomy (n ¼ 1; 0.57%), other indications
(n ¼ 30; 17.24%).

Pediatric patient management

The PDM (HD or PD) was chosen by each nephrology
unit that had originally under treatment the pediatric
patients in agreement with the dialysis modality decision
guide originally proposed by Hamburger et al. [11].
Strong indications for PD included patient aged 0–5 years
and obligate situations such as vascular access failure,
congestive heart failure, and social situations (family preference and living far from an in-center dialysis unit). The
conditions where PD was preferred included age between
6 and 16 years, bleeding diathesis, labile diabetes, chronic


infections, needle anxiety, and active lifestyle. PD was not
preferred for patients with obesity, multiple hernias,
severe backache, multiple abdominal surgeries, impaired
manual dexterity, blindness, less-than-ideal home situation, and depression. Relative contraindications for PD
included patients with severe malnutrition, multiple
abdominal adhesions, ostomies, proteinuria >10 g/day,
obstructive pulmonary disease, ascites, presence of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, upper limb amputation with no
help at home, poor hygiene, and dementia. PD is contraindicated in patients with documented type II ultrafiltration failure, severe inflammatory bowel disease, active
acute diverticulitis, abdominal abscess, active ischemic
bowel disease, and severe active psychotic disorder/
marked intellectual disability. PD and HD have been
equally preferred in patients with polycystic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus [11].
Hemodialysis consisted of pressure–pressure monitored
dialysis with bicarbonate dialysate. HD was carried out
three times weekly, either with an unmodified cellulose
membrane (cuprophane; Bellco-Sorin, Mirandola, Italy;
Gambro 1.8L, Gambro, Lund, Sweden) or with a synthetic membrane (polysulfone; Bellco-Sorin). PD consisted in continuous exchanges of PD solution (at day:
1000–1100 ml/m[2]; or at night, 1200–1400 ml/m[2] in automated PD). Patient hydratation during and immediately
after KT was performed under guidance of central venous
pressure and/or Swan-Ganz pulmonary wedge pressure.
Furosemide was used to increase urine output if diuresis
was below 1 ml/kg/h for more than 3 h. The immunosuppressive drugs used in several combinations were
methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg on day 0, 8 mg/kg on day
1, 4 mg/kg on day 2, then prednisone 0.75 mg/kg on day
3), cyclosporine A (4 mg/kg), FK506 (0.15 mg/kg/b.i.d.),
and, starting from 1998, mycophenolate mofetil (300/
400 mg/m[2]).

Parameters

The following patient-related parameters were considered:
age, BW on the day of KT, body weight gain (BWG) as
the difference between BW on the day of KT and on day
1 after KT, body mass index (BMI) calculated as [weight
(kg)/height (m)[2]], body surface area (BSA) calculated following the Mosteller formula [12], the total fluid administered during the first 72 h after KT, urine volume (UV)
collected by an indwelling bladder catheter in the first
24 hr after KT, early SCr measured on the day 1 after
KT, the mean of central venous pressure (CVP) values
continuously measured in the first 24 h after KT. In addition, pediatric patients were evaluated about virological
assessment (CMV, EBV, HCV, anti-HBs) and the performing of blood transfusions (£5 transfusions with

£2 units/transfusion) before KT. Cadaveric donor age,
cold ischemia time (CIT), and warm ischemia time
(WIT) were also collected. In view of the fact that actuarial graft and patients survival exceeded 90%, the primary
outcome parameter was the days needed to reach a SCr
level 50% below that before KT [T1/2(SCr)] [8]. ARF was
defined in the case of need for dialysis, while DGF was
defined as a T1/2(SCr) > 3 days after KT [8]. Patients
undergoing dialysis after KT received HD even if they
were on PD before KT. The need for post-transplant
dialysis occurred in 21 patients with ARF, and in 10
patients with DGF. Thirty patients had isolated DGF,
without need for dialysis.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation, median, confidence interval (CI), lower quartile
(LQ), and upper quartile (UQ). Categorical variables are
expressed as the number of observations in each category

[13], and analyzed for the difference between proportions
from independent samples (expressed as a percentage) by
chi-square test with Yates’ correction for continuity. Continuous variables were compared by the Mann–Whitney
test, univariate Pearson’s correlation and exponential
regression. A series of multivariate regression analyses was
carried out with T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable [8]. The
forward stepwise method was used to evaluate the independent variables at each step, adding or deleting them
from the models [14]. Survival analysis was carried out
by using the Kaplan–Meier method, log-rank test for
curve comparison, and Cox regression, assuming T1/2(SCr)
as the ‘time variable’. It should be noted that following
this approach, relative risk (RR) >1 indicates a decreased
risk for DGF, whereas RR <1 suggests an increased risk



[8]. The statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05
with a two-tailed null hypothesis. Statistical analyses were
performed by using the software package statistica 6.1
(StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA), MedCalc 7.5 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium), and a Cox regression calculator by John Pezzullo (in http://members.aol.com/johnp71/
javastat.html).

Results

The overall pattern of continuous variables related to kidney recipients is shown in Table 1. The mean age of pediatric recipients was 14.47 ± 5.35 (Table 1), whereas the
mean age of cadaveric donors was 13.84 ± 10.8 years
(median 11.5; 95% CI from 12.22 to 15.46; LQ 7; UQ
17). In 108 patients (62.06%), T1/2(SCr) was reached
within the first 3 days after KT. DGF was observed in 40
patients (22.98%), and ARF in 26 patients (14.94%). No
significance was found in order to primary diseases of
pediatric kidney recipients grouped for PDM (Table 2),
as well as for virological assessment and the performing
of blood transfusions before KT (Table 3). In the patients
who received blood transfusions before KT, both DGF
and ARF occurred in five cases each.
After comparison of kidney recipients grouped for
DGF, patients with DGF showed a significantly higher
BW (P ¼ 0.014), BSA (P ¼ 0.005), WIT (P ¼ 0.022),
early post-transplant SCr (P < 0.001), and T1/2(SCr)
(P < 0.001), whereas lower UV (P < 0.001) and fluid load
(P < 0.001) occurred (Table 4). No significance was
noted for BMI, CIT, BWG, and CVP (Table 4), as well as
for residual renal function before KT expressed as creatinine clearance (data not shown). In the ARF group (n ¼
26), higher values than in the normal kidney function
group were found for SCr (P < 0.0001) and T1/2(SCr)

slope for BW, BSA, and SCr was around 53, 1.5, and 4
respectively.
A multivariate regression analysis was performed by
entering T1/2(SCr) as dependent variable, and an organ
preservation-related variable (CIT), the volume-related
parameters (BWG, UV, fluid load), and PDM as independent variables, following a forward stepwise method
(Table 6). In model A (R[2] ¼ 0.174; P < 0.001), in which
CIT and the volume-related parameters were included,
only CIT reached a statistical significance (b ¼ 0.16; P ¼
0.022). When PDM was entered in the model, a slight
increase in R[2] was observed (0.182 vs. 0.174), although
no significance was noted for this variable (P ¼ 0.195).
The b for CIT and dialysis mode did not show substantial
changes when alternatively one of the three volume-rela

ted parameters was excluded from the model (Table 6,
model C without UV; model D without BWG; model E
without fluid load). In each model, CIT but not PDM
reached statistical significance, suggesting that only CIT
was a predictor for T1/2(SCr), independently of volumerelated parameters. Conversely, although fluid load and
UV reached respectively statistical significance when the
either variable was alternatively excluded (model C and E,
P < 0.0001), they lost any significance when simultaneously included in the other models. No statistical significance was observed by testing other regression models
that included volume-related parameters and variables
such as BW, BSA, and WIT (data not shown).

Discussion

A delay in functional recovery of transplanted kidneys
may negatively affected short- and long-term graft outcome [3,4,7]. Pretransplantation PD was reported to
influence positively the recovery of renal function after
KT in adult recipients [8,9], and it was hypothesized that
fluid status might be implicated in this finding [8]. On
the contrary, in patients over 60 years of age the longterm use of PD (>2 years) has been associated with
increased mortality rates, irrespective of diabetic status or
gender [15]. In pediatric patients, PD is strongly indicated for children aged 0–5 years, and should be preferred
for those aged 6–16 years [11,16]. However, pretransplantation dialysis resulted to exert no clear effect on the graft
outcome in pediatric kidney recipients [10], suggesting
the need for further investigation. Theoretically, the most
suitable approach to evaluate the effect of PDM on KT
outcomes would be a prospective study. However, as
Termorshuizen et al. [15] argued, conducting such a
study in patients with end-stage renal diseases could be
regarded as extremely difficult, because of advantages and
disadvantages associated with PDM choice for individual
patients. Therefore, we retrospectively analysed pretrans

plantation PDM to evaluate its potential effects on early
graft function in a cohort of pediatric patients, following
rigorous patient selection criteria. HD or PD was chosen
by each nephrology unit that had originally under treatment the pediatric patients, in agreement with the dialysis
modality decision guide proposed by Hamburger et al.

[11]. Although PD is the preferred dialysis treatment for
children, a cross-sectional survey study has demonstrated
that specialization of clinicians is able to influence treatment recommendations for children and adolescents with
end-stage renal disease, being pediatric nephrologists
more likely than adult nephrologists to recommend PD
for identical patients [17]. In our patients, a strict link
between pediatrics, nephrologists and surgeons has
allowed the optimization of dialysis choice. Patients that
switched from one dialysis modality to the other before
KT were excluded from this study, differently from other
series that enrolled patients treated with both PD and HD

[18]. We adopted this exclusion criteria to obtain a more
rigorous comparison between PD and HD. Considering
that in our series both patient and graft survival exceeded
90%, T1/2(SCr) was assumed as the primary outcome
parameter, in agreement with Van Biesen et al. [8]. Differently from the study performed by Van Biesen’s group
on adult kidney recipients [8], we made specific evaluation in pediatric patients for primary diseases, virological
assessment and blood transfusions before KT. We did not
find significant differences by grouping these parameters
for PDM. Notably, almost all of our patients were EBV+,
CMV+, and HCV), without occurrence of anti-HBs+.
Although blood transfusions before KT might have a positive effect in pediatric patients who received £5 transfusions [19], in our series only 17 patients received blood
transfusions before KT, according to conservative transfusion policy adopted in southern Europe during the last
decade [20].
In our series, although T1/2(SCr) was reached relatively
earlier in pediatric patients who underwent PD, no significant difference was observed after comparison of this
time variable for PDM, in contrast with previous findings in adult kidney recipients [6,8]. As expected, in
both ARF and DGF patients an unfavourable difference
for UV, fluid load, SCr, and T1/2(SCr) was noted by comparing them with patients who had no impaired posttransplant outcomes. The univariate correlation analysis
for the continuous variables showed no significant relationship between fluid load and BWG or CVP, as previously reported for adult kidney recipients [8]. By
performing exponential correlation between T1/2(SCr) and
all the other continuous variables, we found a better
value than the linear correlation for BW, BSA, and SCr.
Interestingly, we did not observe significance in the
exponential correlation for CIT, in contrast with previ

ous findings in adult kidney recipients [8]. However, in
a multivariate regression analysis that we carried out following a forward stepwise method, CIT resulted in all
models as a predictor for T1/2(SCr), independently from
volume-related parameters. Conversely, although in some
regression models UV and fluid load contributed to
T1/2(SCr), these variables were intermutually related, as
resulted by the lack of significance when both UV and
fluid load were entered in the same regression models.
Notably, PDM did not reach statistical significance in
any multivariate regression model, suggesting a poor
impact of this parameter on DGF in pediatric kidney
recipients. On the contrary, we did not find significance
neither by a simple comparison of the PD versus HD
patients within ARF or DGF groups, differently from a
significantly higher rate of DGF reported in HD adult
patients [18]. Finally, in the Cox regression analysis UV
and fluid load confirmed their intermutual relationship,
whereas CIT did not reach significance.
Our findings in pediatric patients did not confirm the
results reported by Van Biesen et al. [8] in adult kidney
recipients, where PDM revealed to be an independent
predictor for T1/2(SCr). In that study, performed on 119
patients, the incidence of DGF was lower, and the
authors suggested that their finding may be the result of
a short CIT, being CIT median and UQ values in DGF
and no-DGF group 22 and 30 h versus 19 and 23 h,
respectively [8]. However, these CIT values, that did not
reach full statistical significance after intergroup comparison [8], do not seem to diverge from those reported in a study population carried out on the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS), in which an overall
CIT of 20.4 ± 8.5 h was observed in 13 486 adult renal
transplant recipients [21]. In our series, the overall CIT
value (15.23 ± 3.57 h) was lower than in the USRDS,
and no significant difference for this parameter occurred
between DGF and no-DGF group. Although earlier studies demonstrated that CIT may play a critical role on
transplanted kidney outcome [22,23], and even if we
found that CIT resulted in multivariate regression
models as an independent predictor for T1/2(SCr), we
failed to confirm a statistical significance for CIT in both
exponential correlation and Cox regression models. Our
short CIT supported these findings, differently from the
results of Van Biesen et al. [8], where their longer CIT
had a strong impact on the graft outcome in all analyses. Considering that a high incidence of DGF may be a
product of long CIT [8], our results seem to substantiate
that the evaluation of PDM impact on graft outcome
has not been overwhelmed. Otherwise from findings
reported in adult patients, this study suggests that PDM
does not affect early graft function in pediatric kidney
recipients.
