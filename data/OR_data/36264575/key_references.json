Extensive use of suboptimal donors for renal transplantation.\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe study included 827 patients receiving a cadaveric renal transplantation (RTx) in our center between 1988 and 1997 (700 on HD and 127 on PD). We searched for a potential difference in the incidence of graft thrombosis, according to the pretransplant dialysis modality and taking into consideration the main reported risk factors for this complication of RTx.\n## RESULTS\nThe accumulated incidence of primary graft thrombosis was 4.7% in PD patients, and 6.1% in HD patients (NS). Arterial and venous thrombosis were also similar in both groups. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that extremes of age of the donor, use of the right kidney, protracted cold ischemia, delayed graft function, and transplantation to a hypersensitized recipient independently predicted graft thrombosis. Peritoneal dialysis was not independently associated with the complication under study (adjusted odds ratio HD/PD = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.8-7.7).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPeritoneal dialysis is not associated with an increased risk of primary vascular thrombosis of the renal allograft.\n",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to compare outcomes in the immediate posttransplant period for hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal (PD) dialysis patients who received cadaveric renal transplantation. Data were obtained from the United Network of Organ Sharing on all cadaveric graft recipients who were dialysis-dependent at the time of transplantation between April 1994 and December 1995. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups, and multivariate logistic regression was performed with outcome measures including urine production in the first 24 h posttransplantation (U24), requirement for dialysis in the first week posttransplant (FWDIAL), and treatment for acute rejection during the initial hospitalization. The odds of oliguria (not producing urine in the first 24 h) were 1.49 (1.28 to 1.74) times higher in HD versus PD patients. After adjustment for other comorbid conditions including age, gender, race, HLA mismatch, time on dialysis, panel-reactive antibodies, and cold and warm ischemia time, the odds of oliguria were 1.60 (1.14 to 2.25) times higher in black HD patients compared with PD patients and 1.29 (1.06 to 1.57) times higher in white HD patients. In a similar manner, after adjustment for significant comorbid conditions, the odds of requiring dialysis in the first week were 1.56 (1.22 to 2.0) times higher in black HD patients versus PD patients and 1.40 (1.21 to 1.60) times higher in white HD patients. The rate of acute rejection was similar during the first hospitalization. These results suggest that there is an association between hemodialysis and delayed graft function. Differences in biocompatibility between the two modalities could potentially be responsible.\n",

Although a plethora of risk factors has been identified, a large proportion of cases of RVT is unexplained. Uremic coagulopathy and dialysis modality may predispose to RVT. We investigated the impact of the pretransplant dialysis modality on the risk of RVT in adult renal transplant recipients.\n## METHODS\nRenal transplant recipients (age 18 years or more) who were enrolled in the national registry between 1990 and 1996 (N = 84,513) were evaluated for RVT occurring within 30 days of transplantation. Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001). Change in dialysis modality was an independent predictor of RVT: switching from HD to PD (OR = 3.59, P < 0.001) and from PD to HD (OR = 1.62, P = 0.047). Compared with primary transplant recipients on HD (OR = 1.00), the highest odds of RVT were in repeat transplant recipients treated with PD (OR = 12.95, P < 0.001) and HD (OR = 4.50, P < 0.001). Other independent predictors of RVT were preemptive transplantation, relatively young and old donor age, diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus as causes of end-stage renal disease, recipient gender, and lower panel reactive antibody levels (PRAs).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe strongest risk factors for RVT were retransplantation and prior PD treatment. Prevention of RVT with perioperative anticoagulation should be studied in patients who have a constellation of the identified risk factors.\n",

Peritoneal dialysis as pretransplantation dialysis modality was reported to influence favorably the recovery of renal function immediately after kidney transplantation. It has been hypothesized that fluid status was the factor explaining this better outcome. This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001). A multivariate model with CIT (P<0.001), PD as pretransplantation dialysis mode (P=0.01), urinary output in the first 24 hr (P=0.001), BWG (P=0.05), and fluid load (P=0.01) resulted in an R2 of 0.32 (P<0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, the relative risk for a prolonged T1/2(SCr) increased with 4%/hr CIT (P=0.01) and with 1%/kg BWG (P=0.02). Fluid load decreased the relative risk with 5%/liter (P<0.001) and PD as pretransplantation modality favorably modified the relative risk by a factor of 1.6 (P=0.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nPD as pretransplantation dialysis modality can reduce the incidence and the severity of delayed recovery of renal function after renal transplantation. This protective effect was independent from CIT, and fluid status, two other major influencing factors.\n",

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss. Additional studies are needed to determine what factors may help understand this early risk of graft failure.\n",

Concerning graft survival, only preemptive transplantation had a significant impact, being associated to a decreased risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P= 0.005). Conclusion.

It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the day of KT (P = 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P = 0.005), warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and T(1/2(SCr)) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first 24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate exponential correlation that was carried out between T(1/2(SCr)) and all the other variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R(2) = 0.28 vs. R(2) = 0.04), BSA (R(2) = 0.29 vs. R(2) = 0.03), and SCr (R(2) = 0.51 vs. R(2) = 0.28). In a multivariate regression analysis performed by entering T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable and following a forward stepwise method, cold ischemia time (CIT) (P = 0.027) but not PDM (P = 0.195) reached significance. In a Cox regression analysis carried out with T(1/2(SCr)) as dependent variable, neither CIT nor PDM gained significance.

Mortality or graft failure and delayed graft function risks were estimated by Cox regression (hazard ratio) and logistic regression (odds ratio), respectively.\n## RESULTS\nRecipients treated with peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation had lower (21.9/1000 patient-years [95% confidence interval: 18.1-26.5]) crude all-cause mortality rate than those recipients treated with hemodialysis (32.8/1000 patient-years [30.8-35.0]). Pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 43% lower adjusted all-cause and 66% lower cardiovascular death. Furthermore, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 17% and 36% lower unadjusted death-censored graft failure and delayed graft function risk, respectively. However, after additional adjustment for relevant covariates, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis modality was not a significant predictor of death-censored graft failure delayed graft function, respectively. Similar trends were noted on analyses using a propensity score matched cohort of 2092 pairs of patients.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCompared with hemodialysis, patients treated with peritoneal dialysis before transplantation had lower mortality but similar graft loss or delayed graft function. Confounding by residual selection bias cannot be ruled out.\n",

In this study we retrospectively analyzed the impact of dialysis modality on posttransplant follow-up.\n## METHODS\nTo minimize donor bias, a paired kidney analysis was applied. One hundred thirty-three pairs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients were transplanted at our center between 1994 and 2016. Those who received kidneys from the same donor were included in the study. HD patients were significantly older (44 vs 48 years), but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar (3.12 vs 3.46) in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to immunosuppressive protocols and number of mismatches (2.96 vs 2.95).\n## RESULTS\nOne-year patient (98% vs 96%) and graft (90% vs 93%) survival was similar in the PD and HD patient groups. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the patients and graft survival did not differ significantly. Delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) occurred significantly more often in the HD recipients. Graft vessel thrombosis resulting in graft loss occurred in 9 PD (6.7%) and 4 HD (3%) patients (P > .05). Serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease guidelines) showed no difference at 1 month, 1 year, and at final visit. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with graft loss were graft vessel thrombosis, DGF, and graft function 1 month after transplantation. On univariate analysis, age, coronary heart disease, and graft loss were associated with death. Among these factors, only coronary heart disease (model 1) and graft loss were significant predictors of death on multivariate analysis.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe long-term outcome for renal transplantation is similar in patients with PD and HD. These groups differ in some aspects, however, such as susceptibility to vascular thrombosis in PD patients, and to DGF and AR in HD patients.\n",

Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the HR of the dialysis modality on graft failure and all-cause mortality. The primary outcomes were long-term post-transplant death-censored allograft failure and all-cause mortality started after 90 days of kidney transplantation until the end of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were events during kidney transplantation and post-transplant de novo diseases adjusted by propensity score in log-binomial model.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 1812 patients included in our cohort, among which 1209 (66.7%) and 603 (33.3%) recipients received pretransplant HD and PD, respectively. Recipients with chronic HD were generally older and male, had higher risks of developing post-transplant de novo ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis and hepatitis C after adjustment. Pretransplant HD contributed to higher graft failure in the multivariate analysis (HR 1.38, p<0.05) after adjustment for the recipient age, sex, duration of dialysis and pretransplant diseases. There was no significant between-group difference in overall survival.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPretransplant HD contributed to higher risks of death-censored allograft failure after kidney transplantation when compared with PD.\n",
