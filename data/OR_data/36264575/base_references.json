            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Peritoneal dialysis is a generally accepted method for the treatment of patients with end-stage renal failure. The laparoscopic placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters is a well-established technique and offers some advantages, such as a safer placement of the catheter, less post-operative complications, and a longer functional survival, compared to the conventional open technique. The aim of this study was to describe our implantation technique and to determine the results of our approach.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Between January 2000 and February 2006, 47 patients with end-stage chronic renal failure underwent a laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion procedure. Perioperative and follow-up data were collected prospectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean operating time was 35 minutes (range, 16-100). There was no perioperative morbidity. Nine (19.1%) patients experienced 10 mechanical complications: fluid leakage in 6 (12.8%) patients, acute hydrothorax in 1 (2.1%), catheter tip migration in 2 (4.3%), and catheter obstruction in 1 (2.1%) patient. Episodes of peritonitis were observed in 5 (10.6%) patients. One (2.1%) patient developed a catheter infection. In 3 (6.4%) patients, a port site hernia occurred that required surgical repair, 5 (10.6%) patients underwent laparoscopic revisions owing to mechanical complications, 9 (19.1%) patients underwent renal transplantation, and 6 (12.8%) patients died during the later follow-up. After a mean follow-up time of 17 months (range, 2-76), 30 (63.8%) catheters are still in use for dialysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The functional outcome of the dialysis catheters was satisfactory in the majority of patients in this study. The described technique for catheter implantation is simple and safe, and in our opinion, the laparoscopic technique should be considered as the method of choice in patients with end-stage chronic renal failure."

Using comprehensive data on a well-defined patient cohort, we therefore investigated the association of dialysis modality with survival on chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) and whether this association varies between subgroups of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Survival analyses included all adult patients entering chronic RRT in Finland between 2000 and 2009 and used information obtained from the Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases and the Finnish Kidney Transplant Registry. In our primary intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we calculated relative risk of death according to dialysis modality on Day 91 from RRT start, comparing peritoneal dialysis (PD) to haemodialysis (HD). Relative risks were adjusted for putative confounders. Interactions between treatment groups and other variables were estimated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the total 4463 patients, 42% died during the 10 years of follow-up. Median survival time was 5.2 years. In unadjusted ITT analysis, relative risk of death of PD patients was 0.65 (95% CI 0.58-0.73, P < 0.001) compared with HD patients. With adjustment for 26 variables, the corresponding relative risk of death was 1.07 (95% CI 0.94-1.22, P = 0.33). When censoring at time of kidney transplantation, the result was similar with a relative risk of death of 1.09 (95% CI 0.95-1.25, P = 0.24) on PD compared with HD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      PD is associated with several factors generally related to good prognosis.

The quality of life of 766 patients who experienced one of the following therapies for at least one year are compared: a successful transplant performed in the 1970's (N = 82), a successful transplant performed in 1980-1984 (N = 91), in-center hemodialysis (N = 83, 8 centers), and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialyses (CAPD) (N = 510, 185 centers). All patients were aged 19-56 and nondiabetic. Survey questionnaires were administered containing measures of physical, emotional and social well-being, vocational rehabilitation, and sexual adjustment. Case-mix differences were controlled, insofar as possible, with an Analysis of Covariance; adjusted means were compared. Findings indicate that the quality of life for successful transplant patients exceeds that of both dialysis groups for almost all variables (p less than 0.05 for 9/11 measures). This advantage persists when transplant patients are compared to dialysis patients who have experienced no prior, failed therapies."

Peritoneal dialysis as pretransplantation dialysis modality was reported to influence favorably the recovery of renal function immediately after kidney transplantation. It has been hypothesized that fluid status was the factor explaining this better outcome. This hypothesis was tested in this study by multivariate analysis, also including other factors related to DGF and ARF.\n## METHODS\nThe records of peritoneal dialysis (PD; n=40) and hemodialysis (HD; n=79) patients receiving a first cadaveric kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Gent were analyzed.\n## RESULTS\nDGF and ARF were observed in 33 (27 HD and 6 PD, P=0.03) and 14 (14 HD and 0 PD, P=0.01) patients, respectively. The number of days needed to reach a serum creatinine 50% below that before transplantation (T1/2(SCr)), was correlated with cold ischemia time (CIT) (P<0.001) and body weight gain (BWG) (P<0.01) and was inversely correlated with urinary output in the first 24 hr (P<0.001), fluid load (P<0.001), and central venous pressure (P<0.001). A multivariate model with CIT (P<0.001), PD as pretransplantation dialysis mode (P=0.01), urinary output in the first 24 hr (P=0.001), BWG (P=0.05), and fluid load (P=0.01) resulted in an R2 of 0.32 (P<0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, the relative risk for a prolonged T1/2(SCr) increased with 4%/hr CIT (P=0.01) and with 1%/kg BWG (P=0.02). Fluid load decreased the relative risk with 5%/liter (P<0.001) and PD as pretransplantation modality favorably modified the relative risk by a factor of 1.6 (P=0.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nPD as pretransplantation dialysis modality can reduce the incidence and the severity of delayed recovery of renal function after renal transplantation. This protective effect was independent from CIT, and fluid status, two other major influencing factors.\n"

We aimed to investigate the prognosis and clinical outcomes of HTx patients who required RRT during the perioperative period. The Korean Organ Transplant Registry (KOTRY) is a nationwide organ transplant registry in Korea. A total of 501 HTx patients had been prospectively enrolled in the KOTRY registry during 2014-2018. Among the 501 patients, 13 underwent combined heart and kidney transplantation (HKTx). The 488 patients who underwent isolated HTx were grouped according to their pre- and postoperative RRT status. The primary outcome was progression to dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after HTx. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality after HTx. The median follow-up was 22 months (9-39 months). Patients who needed preoperative RRT but were free from postoperative RRT showed comparable overall survival and renal outcome to patients who were free from both pre- and postoperative RRT. In multivariable analysis, preoperative RRT was not associated with progression to ESRD or all-cause mortality after HTx; however, postoperative RRT was a significant predictor for both progression to ESRD and all-cause mortality after HTx. Preoperative creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were not predictive of progression to ESRD after HTx. The present analysis suggests that preoperative RRT requirement does not indicate irreversible renal dysfunction in patients waiting for HTx.

Patients on CAPD stated a preference for salty items, whereas control subjects preferred the less salty items despite similar estimated sodium intakes. It thus appears that the ability to perceive various salt tastes may not be impaired in patients on renal replacement therapy.

Operations that caused a huge strain on the patients in the past and led to immense costs for society because of the patient's lost working time and extensive rehabilitation, have lost their fear thanks to this technique. The physical strain is lower, the cosmetic effect is considerable and the costs for society might be reduced due to the significantly shorter duration of convalescence. Despite its known advantages, which have been reported in numerous studies, minimally invasive surgery has recently gained increased interest because of the installation of new accounting systems as well as strict budgeting and restricted resources.

            "abstract": "Regulatory requirements to demonstrate the efficacy of novel antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as monotherapy differ between Europe and the United States. European regulators require a comparison with an established, optimally dosed AED, typically using a noninferiority design, whereas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demands demonstration of superiority versus a comparator. Because placebo cannot be used as sole therapy and it is unrealistic to expect that a new AED will be more efficacious than established agents at full dosages, superiority monotherapy trials in epilepsy have traditionally relied on inclusion of controls treated with a suboptimal (low-dose) comparator. In the most common design, refractory patients are randomized to conversion to monotherapy with a full dose of the investigational agent or a low-dose active control, and are required to exit the trial if seizures deteriorate. Efficacy is demonstrated when exit rates are lower in the full-dose group than in controls. Although this design is efficient in demonstrating superiority, the use of suboptimal treatments has been increasingly criticized on ethical grounds. A meta-analysis has now demonstrated that patients randomized to suboptimal treatments in all previous trials had similar outcomes, thereby allowing the build up of a dataset of historical controls against which response to investigational AEDs can be compared in future trials. Use of historical controls has been accepted by the FDA, subject to compliance with rigorous methodologic requirements. Although the avoidance of suboptimal treatments in future trials is a welcome development, the conversion-to-monotherapy design is still far from being fully satisfactory and is not exempt from methodologic concerns."

            "abstract": "Cost-effectiveness analysis compared four treatments of end-stage renal disease in Brazil: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), in-center hemodialysis (HD), cadaver donor transplantation (CD-Tx), and living related donor transplantation (LR-Tx). After 2 years, the costs per year of survival were CAPD, $12,134; HD, $10,065; CD-Tx, $6,978; and LR-Tx, $3,022. The HD cost was lower than CAPD partially because of the reuse of hemodialyzers in Brazil. Although less cost-effective, both dialysis treatments yielded more years of survival after 2 years. This analysis reveals a trade-off between cost per year of survival and years of survival."

            "abstract": "This study sought to determine if low doses of ciclosporin (CS) designed to give fasting serum levels of 50-100 ng/ml achieve effective immunosuppression when used from the early postoperative period after renal transplantation. Ninety-four primary renal transplant recipients were studied. Group 1 patients were treated with CS 100 ng/ml and prednisone (0.15 mg/kg/day). Group 2 patients received CS 50 ng/ml, prednisone (0.15 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (1 mg/kg/day). These patients were compared to a control group of 26 patients (group 3) maintained on only prednisone and azathioprine. CS-treated patients suffered significantly fewer rejection episodes than control subjects (rejection episodes per patient in first year: group 1: 0.3 +/- SD 0.6; group 2: 0.7 +/- SD 0.7; group 3: 1.3 +/- SD 1.1, p less than 0.005). In addition, a greater number of CS-treated patients were completely free of rejection episodes during the first year posttransplant (group 1: 63%; group 2: 64%; group 3: 19%, p less than 0.005). Patient and graft survival were similar in all groups after 1 year (group 1: 92 and 92% respectively; group 2: 95 and 87% respectively; group 3: 96 and 85% respectively). These data suggest that the dose of CS required for effective immunosuppression in vivo is lower than has been previously thought."

            "abstract": "To determine the effect of pretransplant liver function on survival following orthotopic liver transplantation and to quantify the effects of cyclosporine administration on long-term renal function in patients undergoing liver transplant, we performed an analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Data from 569 consecutive patients undergoing liver transplantation alone who were treated with CsA for immunosuppression were used for this study. Actuarial graft and patient survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Glomerular filtration rates, serum creatinine, and the use of various immunosuppressives were analyzed for this study. The initial analysis demonstrated that patients presenting for liver transplant with hepatorenal syndrome have a significantly decreased acturial patient survival after liver transplant at 5 years compared with patients without hepatorenal syndrome (60% vs. 68%, P < 0.03). Patients with hepatorenal syndrome recovered their renal function after liver transplant. Patients who had hepatorenal syndrome were sicker and required longer stays in the intensive care unit, longer hospitalizations, and more dialysis treatments after transplantation compared with patients who did not have hepatorenal syndrome. The incidence of end-stage renal disease after liver transplantation in patients who had hepatorenal syndrome was 7%, compared with 2% in patients who did not have hepatorenal syndrome. To more fully examine the effect of pretransplant renal function on posttransplant survival, the non-hepatorenal syndrome patients were divided into quartiles depending upon their pretransplant renal function. The patients with the lowest pretransplant renal function had the same survival as the patients with the highest pretransplant renal function. In addition, there was no increased incidence of acute or chronic rejection in any of the groups. The patients with the lower pretransplant renal function were treated with more azathioprine to maintain renal function and had a negligible decrease in glomerular filtration rate following transplant. Conversely, patients with the highest level of renal function pretransplant had a 40% decline in renal function in the first year, but maintained stable renal function up to 4 years after transplant. We conclude that pretransplant renal function other than hepato-renal syndrome has no effect on patient survival after orthotopic liver transplant. Renal function after liver transplant is stable after an initial decline, despite continued administration of CsA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that influence peak VO2 in renal transplant candidates receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy. We included 22 chronic renal failure patients (12 men, 10 women; ages 29.64 +/- 8.29 years; CAPD duration, 37.35 +/- 7.15 months) in this study. Pulmonary function tests and symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise tests were administered to all patients. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests were performed on a cycle ergometry at the same time of day for all patients. We analyzed the exercise duration, maximum work rate, and peak VO2 level during cycle ergometry. Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, prealbumin, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, ferritin, sodium, potassium, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels were analyzed from samples. Mean values of exercise duration (6.86 +/- 1.56 minutes), peak VO2 (17.20 +/- 4.91 mL/min/kg), and maximum work rate (77.09 +/- 26.09 watts) were lower when we compared them with predicted values for a healthy population. Peak VO2 was well correlated with serum phosphorus levels (4.51 +/- 1.28 mg/dL, r = .592, P = .004). Test duration was correlated with peak VO2 (r = .489, P = .025) and serum phosphorus levels (r = .530, P = .024). There were no significant correlations with other factors. As a component of ATP, phosphorus is at the hub of the energy-related mechanisms operative in muscles of the respiratory and musculoskeletal systems. Therefore, we suggest that low exercise capacity might be related to low serum phosphorus levels, and that optimal control of serum phosphorus therapy would increase exercise capacity, exercise duration, and oxygen consumption resulting in a decrease of postoperative mortality in renal transplantation candidates."

The aim of the study was to investigate the case characteristics and the long-term outcomes in this patient group. Patient ages ranged from 8 to 16 years (mean, 14.9 +/- 2.2 years). Sixty (82.1%) children were on hemodialysis, and 12 (16.4%) on peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation. Pre-emptive transplantation was performed for one (1.4%) patient. Fifty-nine transplantations used organs from live donors (78.7%) and 16 cadaver transplants (21.3%). The mean cold ischemia time for the cadaveric transplantations was 38.6 hours (range, 23-56 hours). All recipients were placed on a low-dose immunosuppressive regimen. One graft was lost due to hyperacute rejection. Twenty-one patients (28.8%) experienced a total of 24 acute rejection episodes. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 190 months (mean, 44.1 +/- 31.8 months). Concerning postoperative complications, four patients (5.5%) developed a lymphocele; there were two cases each (2.7% each) of distal ureteral stricture, perirenal hematoma, or renovascular stenosis; and one patient (1.4%) developed a urine leakage. Two patients (2.7%) developed Kaposi's sarcoma at 17 and 3 months after transplantation. Six recipients died (mortality 8%), four of whom had a functioning graft. Two patients (2.7%) underwent retransplantation at 4 and 2 years after the initial operation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates for living-related transplantations were 92%, 81%, and 70%, and the corresponding patient survival rates were 98%, 93%, and 92%, respectively.

For dichotomous outcomes (death, all causes), requirement for dialysis, adverse effects) the risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and summary statistics estimated using the random effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used (glomerular filtration rate (GFR), weight), these data were analysed as the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified an additional six studies to include 17 studies with 2996 analysed participants (range 19 to 840). Four larger multicentre studies were subdivided according to interventions so that the review included 21 separate data sets. Mean duration of participant follow-up ranged from 12 to 50 months.Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were considered at low risk of bias in eleven and nine studies respectively. All studies were considered at high risk for performance bias as they were open-label studies. We assessed detection bias for outcome assessment for GFR and ESKD separately. As GFR measurement was a laboratory outcome all studies were assessed at low risk of detection bias. For ESKD, nine studies were at low risk of detection bias as the need to commence dialysis was determined by personnel independent of the study investigators. Five studies were assessed at high risk of attrition bias with eleven studies at low risk. Ten studies were at high risk for reporting bias as they did not include data which could be included in a meta-analysis. Eight studies reported funding from government bodies while the remainder did not report on funding.Ten studies compared a low protein diet with a normal protein diet in participants with CKD categories 3a and b (9 studies) or 4 (one study). There was probably little or no difference in the numbers of participants who died (5 studies 1680 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 13 fewer deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). A low protein diet may make little or no difference in the number of participants who reached ESKD compared with a normal protein diet (6 studies, 1814 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.53; 7 more per 1000 reached ESKD; low certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a low protein diet compared with a normal protein intake impacts on the outcome of final or change in GFR (8 studies, 1680 participants: SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.38; very low certainty evidence).Eight studies compared a very low protein diet with a low protein diet and two studies compared a very low protein diet with a normal protein diet. A very low protein intake compared with a low protein intake probably made little or no difference to death (6 studies, 681 participants: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.54; 10 more deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). However it probably reduces the number who reach ESKD (10 studies, 1010 participants: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; 165 per 1000 fewer reached ESKD; moderate certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a very low protein diet compared with a low or normal protein intake influences the final or change in GFR (6 studies, 456 participants: SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.52; very low certainty evidence).Final body weight was reported in only three studies. It is uncertain whether the intervention alters final body weight (3 studies, 89 participants: MD -0.40 kg, 95% CI -6.33 to 5.52; very low certainty evidence).Twelve studies reported no evidence of protein energy wasting (malnutrition) in their study participants while three studies reported small numbers of participants in each group with protein energy wasting. Most studies reported that adherence to diet was satisfactory. Quality of life was not formally assessed in any studies.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review found that very low protein diets probably reduce the number of people with CKD 4 or 5, who progress to ESKD. In contrast low protein diets may make little difference to the number of people who progress to ESKD. Low or very low protein diets probably do not influence death. However there are limited data on adverse effects such as weight differences and protein energy wasting. There are no data on whether quality of life is impacted by difficulties in adhering to protein restriction. Studies evaluating the adverse effects and the impact on quality of life of dietary protein restriction are required before these dietary approaches can be recommended for widespread use."

            "abstract": "The number of diabetic ESRD patients has increased and death rates of diabetic patients on hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (RT) have remained higher than the death rate of non-diabetic patients. An attempt was made to compare the clinical characteristics, patients' cumulative survival, and technical survival among the three groups retrospectively according to the mode of renal replacement therapy(RRT), and to analyze the risk factors associated with mortality. A total of 229 diabetic ESRD patients diagnosed between 1986 and 1995 at the Severance Hospital who began dialysis or who underwent a kidney transplant were included and their medical charts were reviewed. Hypertension was the most common co-morbid disease in all study groups. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was the only co-morbid condition that was significantly different among the three groups, which was highest in the PD group (24.4%) and lowest in the RT group (8%). In the analysis of a patient's cumulative survival rate not adjusted for age and sex, the RT group had the highest survival rate, and the cumulative survival rate of the HD and PD group were similar. The 5-year survival rate of the patients treated with HD, PD and RT was 28.8%, 19.8%, and 72.0%, respectively. No differences were observed in the patient's cumulative survival rate between the HD and PD patients even when it was adjusted for age. When adjusted for age, sex and risk factors, the relative death rate of the RT group was significantly lower in male patients younger than 60 years of age. With the exception of male patients younger than 60 years of age, the PD group showed a slightly lower relative death rate although it was not significant. The multiple Cox regression analysis of patient survival showed that age, serum albumin, BUN, mean hospital days, the presence of cardiovascular disease at the initiation of RRT were associated with mortality. The analysis of the technique survival rate revealed a better result in the HD group compared to PD group, but a limitation in being able to investigate the AVF function disturbed the accuracy of the analysis of technical survival rate. In conclusion, the survival rate between the PD and HD patients was not different and the RT group had the best survival rate. Therefore, kidney transplantation in diabetic ESRD patients should be considered positively if no other contraindicated condition for RT exit."

When patients were divided according to their fasting lipid levels in normolipidemics and hyperlipoproteinemics, no difference was found for Lp(a) levels in any group. Mechanisms underlying the increase in Lp(a) levels in these patients are not known. It is possible to suggest an active role of the kidney in the Lp(a) metabolism or that uremic plasma contains some factors affecting Lp(a) metabolism."

Unrecognised and/or unmanaged comorbidities often contribute to presence of uncontrolled asthma. Abnormalities in breathing pattern are termed dysfunctional breathing and are not only common in asthma but also lead to asthma-like symptoms and reduced QoL, and, in keeping with this, improvement with breathing normalisation. Evidence-based guidelines recommend breathing retraining interventions as an adjuvant treatment in uncontrolled asthma. Physiotherapy-based breathing pattern modification interventions incorporating relaxation have been shown to improve asthma-related QoL in primary care patients with impaired asthma control. Despite anecdotal reports, effectiveness of breathing retraining in patients referred to secondary care with incomplete asthma control has not been formally assessed in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).

Medications can be used as prophylaxis or rescue medicines, but are costly and not always effective. A range of psychological interventions have been developed to manage migraine.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from their inception until July 2018, and trials registries in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand for randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention for adults with migraine.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a psychological therapy for people with chronic or episodic migraine, with or without aura. Interventions could be compared to another active treatment (psychological or medical), an attention-placebo (e.g. supportive counselling) or other placebo, routine care, or waiting-list control. We excluded studies where fewer than 15 participants completed each arm.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted study characteristics and outcome data at post-treatment and the longest available follow-up. We analysed intervention versus control comparisons for the primary outcome of migraine frequency. We measured migraine frequency using days with migraines or number of migraine attacks measured in the four weeks after treatment. In addition, we analysed the following secondary outcomes: responder rate (the proportion of participants with a 50% reduction in migraine frequency between the four weeks prior to and the four weeks after treatment); migraine intensity; migraine duration; migraine medication usage; mood; quality of life; migraine-related disability; and proportion of participants reporting adverse events during the treatment. We included these variables, where available, at follow-up, the timing of which varied between the studies. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We found 21 RCTs including 2482 participants with migraine, and we extracted meta-analytic data from 14 of these studies. The majority of studies recruited participants through advertisements, included participants with migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and those with and without aura. Most intervention arms were a form of behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy. The majority of comparator arms were no treatment, routine care or waiting list. Interventions varied from one 20-minute session to 14 hours of intervention. No study had unequivocally low risk of bias; all had at least one domain at high risk of bias, and 20 had two to five domains at high risk. Reporting of randomisation procedures and allocation concealment were at high or unclear risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of evidence for outcomes to very low, due to very serious limitations in study quality and imprecision. Reporting in trials was poor; we found no preregistrations stipulating the outcomes, or demonstrating equivalent expectations between groups. Few studies reported our outcomes of interest, most only reported outcomes post treatment; follow-up data were sparse.Post-treatment effectsWe found no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions for migraine frequency in number of migraines or days with migraine (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.13; 4 studies, 681 participants; very low-quality evidence).The responder rate (proportion of participants with migraine frequency reduction of more than 50%) was greater for those who received a psychological intervention compared to control: 101/186 participants (54%) with psychological therapy; 37/152 participants (24%) with control (risk ratio (RR) 2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.98; 4 studies, 338 participants; very low-quality evidence). We found no effect of psychological therapies on migraine intensity (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.02; 4 studies, 685 participants). There were no data for migraine duration (hours of migraine per day). There was no effect on migraine medication usage (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.24; 2 studies, 483 participants), mood (mean difference (MD) 0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.49; 4 studies, 432 participants), quality of life (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; 4 studies, 565 participants), or migraine-related disability (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.00; 6 studies, 952 participants). The proportion of participants reporting adverse events did not differ between those receiving psychological treatment (9/107; 8%) and control (30/101; 30%) (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 7.85; 2 studies, 208 participants). Only two studies reported adverse events and so we were unable to draw any conclusions.We rated evidence from all studies as very low quality.Follow-upOnly four studies reported any follow-up data. Follow-ups ranged from four months following intervention to 11 months following intervention. There was no evidence of an effect on any outcomes at follow-up (very low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review identified 21 studies of psychological interventions for the management of migraine. We did not find evidence that psychological interventions affected migraine frequency, a result based on four studies of primarily brief treatments. Those who received psychological interventions were twice as likely to be classified as responders in the short term, but this was based on very low-quality evidence and there was no evidence of an effect of psychological intervention compared to control at follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on medication usage, mood, migraine-related disability or quality of life. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on migraine frequency in the short-term or long-term. In terms of adverse events, we were unable to draw conclusions as there was insufficient evidence. High and unclear risk of bias in study design and reporting, small numbers of participants, performance and detection bias meant that we rated all evidence as very low quality. Therefore, we conclude that there is an absence of high-quality evidence to determine whether psychological interventions are effective in managing migraine in adults and we are uncertain whether there is any difference between psychological therapies and controls."

            "abstract": "Appropriate control group selection in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a critical factor in generating results, which are both interpretable and generalizable. Control groups ideally encompass and realistically reflect prevailing medical practices. This goal can be challenging in investigations of standard therapies that are routinely titrated. To eliminate the heterogeneity in clinical practice from the trial design, recent investigations of titrated therapies have randomized patients to fixed-dose regimens. Although this approach may produce statistically significant differences, the results may not be interpretable or generalizable. In this trial design, randomization disrupts the normal relationship between clinically important characteristics and therapy titration, thereby creating subgroups of patients within each study arm that receive levels of therapy inconsistent with current practices outside of the clinical study. These misaligned subgroups may have worse outcomes than usual care. Practice misalignments can occur in any clinical trial of a preexisting therapy that is typically adjusted based on severity of illness or other patient characteristics. In this study, we review three recent RCTs to demonstrate how practice misalignments can affect the safety, results, and conclusions of RCTs. Furthermore, we discuss methods to prospectively identify potentially important relationships between therapy titration and patient- and disease-specific characteristics. Finally, we review trial design options that may minimize the occurrence and impact of practice misalignments. Because these designs may limit the feasibility of a clinical trial, a thorough characterization of usual care is necessary to determine whether one of these designs should be used to protect patient safety."

The majority are non-psychotic (e.g. depression, anxiety and phobias). For some people, art therapy may provide more profound and long-lasting healing than more standard forms of treatment, perhaps because it can provide an alternative means of expression and release from trauma. As yet, no formal evaluation of art therapy for non-psychotic mental health disorders has been conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      This review aimed to evaluate evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of art therapy for non-psychotic mental health disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Comprehensive literature searches for studies examining art therapy in populations with non-psychotic mental health disorders were performed in major health-related and social science bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) from inception up to May 2013. A quantitative systematic review of clinical effectiveness, a qualitative review to explore the acceptability, relative benefits and potential harms, and a cost-utility analysis of studies evaluating cost-effectiveness of art therapy were conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the quantitative review, 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included (n = 777). Meta-analysis was not possible because of clinical heterogeneity and insufficient comparable data on outcome measures across studies. A narrative synthesis reports that art therapy was associated with significant positive changes relative to the control group in mental health symptoms in 10 out of the 15 studies. The control groups varied between studies but included wait-list/no treatment, attention placebo controls and psychological therapy comparators. Four studies reported improvement from baseline but no significant difference between groups. One study reported that outcomes were more favourable in the control group. The quality of included RCTs was generally low. In the qualitative review, 12 cohort studies were included (n = 188 service users; n = 16 service providers). Themes relating to benefits of art therapy for service users included the relationship with the therapist, personal achievement and distraction. Areas of potential harms were related to the activation of emotions that were then unresolved, lack of skill of the art therapist and sudden termination of art therapy. The quality of included qualitative studies was generally low to moderate. In the cost-effectiveness review, a de novo model was constructed and populated with data identified from the clinical review. Scenario analyses were conducted allowing comparisons of group art therapy with wait-list control, group art therapy with group verbal therapy, and individual art therapy versus control. Art therapy appeared cost-effective compared with wait-list control with high certainty, although generalisability to the target population was unclear. Verbal therapy appeared more cost-effective than art therapy but there was considerable uncertainty and a sizeable probability that art therapy was more clinically effective.

A decision analysis model that incorporates patient preferences regarding various outcomes, as well as cost, may be particularly informative in patients with type I diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Such a model that includes pancreas transplantation as a treatment choice has not been performed and is presented in this study. The decision tree consisted of a choice between four possible treatment strategies: dialysis, kidney-alone transplant from a cadaver (KA-CAD) or living donor (KA-LD), and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant. The analysis was based on a 5-year model, and the measures of outcome used in the model were cost and cost adjusted for quality of life. The measure of preference for quality of life was obtained using the \"Standard Reference Gamble\" method in 17 SPK transplant recipients who underwent transplantation between January, 1992 and June, 1996 at our center. The measures for various outcome states (mean +/- 1 SD) were dialysis-free/insulin-free = 1, dialysis-free/insulin-dependent = 0.6 (0.4 to 0.8), dialysis-dependent/insulin-free = 0.5 (0.36 to 0.64), dialysis-dependent/insulin-dependent = 0.4 (0.21 to 0.59), and death = 0. The expected 5-year costs for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $216,068; KA-CAD transplant, $214,678; KA-LD transplant, $210,872; and SPK transplant, $241,207. The expected cost per quality-adjusted year for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $317,746; KA-CAD transplant, $156,042; KA-LD transplant, $123,923; and SPK transplant, $102,422. SPK transplantation remained the optimal strategy after varying survival probabilities, costs, and utilities over plausible ranges by means of one-way sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, according to the 5-year cost-utility model presented in this study, SPK transplantation is the most cost-effective treatment strategy for a patient with type I diabetes and ESRD. From a policy standpoint, looking at the cost alone of pancreas transplantation is deceiving. In these patients, who may view various outcome states differently, it would be important to take into account cost adjusted for quality of life when evaluating this procedure."

A non-randomised comparison was made of the outcome of grafting in patients who had been treated before transplantation with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with that in patients treated with haemodialysis. During the five years, 1979-84, after continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was introduced to Newcastle upon Tyne 220 patients have received transplants after either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (61 patients) or haemodialysis (159 patients). During follow up no significant differences occurred in survival of patients or grafts between the two treatment groups. One year after transplantation the percentages of survivors who had received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis were 88% and 91% respectively, and overall graft survival was 66% and 72%, respectively. A multiple regression model was used to allow for differences among patients--for example, duration of dialysis and number of preoperative transfusions--on the survival of grafts. When only first cadaver grafts were considered (in 152 patients) graft survival (non-immunological failures excluded) was not significantly different between the patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is not a risk factor in renal transplantation, and its continued use in treatment of potential renal graft recipients is recommended."

QOL measures are subjective or objective, functional or satisfaction-based, and generic or disease-specific. Treatment of end-stage renal disease with transplantation and treatment of anemia with erythropoietin in patients with CKD have been associated with dramatic improvements of QOL. Other factors such as age, ethnic or national background, stage of CKD, modality of dialytic therapy, exercise interventions, sleep disturbances, pain, erectile dysfunction, patient satisfaction with care, depressive affect, symptom burden, and perception of intrusiveness of illness may be associated with differential perception of QOL. Recent studies showed an association between assessment of QOL and morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients, suggesting the measures do matter. Further studies are necessary in patients with early stages of CKD and in children. QOL measures should include validated psychosocial measures of depressive affect, perception of burden of illness, and social support. The challenge for the next decade will be to continue to devise interventions that meaningfully increase the QOL of patients with CKD at all stages."

In this study, we analyzed 417 files of 223 hemodialysis (HD) and 194 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients starting renal replacement therapy between 1979 and 1996, to evaluate the effect of such an approach. Analysis was done for survival of patients on their first modality, for intention-to-treat survival (counting total time on renal replacement therapy, but with exclusion of time on transplantation), and for total survival. Log rank analysis was used and correction for risk factors was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression. Intention-to-treat survival and total survival were not different between PD and HD patients (log rank, P > 0.05). Technique success was higher in HD patients compared to PD patients (log rank, P = 0.01), with a success rate after 3 yr of 61 and 48%, respectively. Thirty-five patients were transferred from HD to PD and 32 from PD to HD. Transfer of PD patients to HD was accompanied by an increase in survival compared to those remaining on PD (log rank, P = 0.001), whereas, in contrast, transfer of patients from HD to PD was not (log rank, P = 0.17). Survival of patients remaining more than 48 mo on their initial modality was lower for PD patients (log rank, P < 0.01). A matched-pair analysis between patients who started on PD and who were transferred to HD later (by definition called integrative care patients), and patients who started and remained on HD, showed a survival advantage for the integrative care patients. These results indicate that patient outcome is not jeopardized by starting patients on PD, at least if patients are transferred in a timely manner to HD when PD-related problems arise."

Data were collected from the records of patients who received CAPD therapy from 1995 to 2007 in the Department of Nephrology, Saitama Medical University. During that time, 473 patients were introduced onto CAPD therapy and the PD catheter was removed from 63 patients. Catheters were removed in 30 patients (47%) because of peritoneal infection, in 11 (17%) because of dialysis failure, in 8 (13%) because of neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, in 6 (10%) because of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, in 2 (3%) because of laceration of PD catheter, and in 3 each (5%) because of transplantation and home hemodialysis therapy. Duration of CAPD was 5.6 +/- 1.2 years. In patients who experienced peritoneal infection, causative organisms were Staphylococcus (mainly methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Candida, Pseudomonas, and non tuberculous Mycobacterium. Failure to continue PD therapy related to dialysis deficiency. All patients were examined for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) by computed tomography (CT) enhanced using contrast material. In 9 cases in which the CT findings indicated EPS, treatment with oral prednisolone (20 mg daily) was started; the dose was then gradually reduced over 1 year. After removal of the PD catheter, no patient developed EPS. All removed catheters were examined using electron microscopy. The catheters from patients who experienced PD peritonitis revealed biofilm formation; however, no biofilm formation was found in PD catheters removed from patients without infection. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, peritoneal infection remains the major cause of PD catheter removal. Biofilm formation might be an obstacle to PD continuation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Up to 75% of women diagnosed with breast cancer report chemotherapy-related cognitive changes (CRCC) during treatment, including decreased memory, attention, and processing speed. Though CRCC negatively impacts everyday functioning and reduces overall quality of life in women diagnosed with breast cancer, effective interventions to prevent and/or manage CRCC are elusive. Consequently, women seldom receive advice on how to prevent or manage CRCC. Aerobic exercise is associated with improved cognitive functioning in healthy older adults and adults with cognitive impairments. Accordingly, it holds promise as an intervention to prevent and/or manage CRCC. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting a beneficial effect of aerobic exercise on CRCC is limited. The primary aim of the ACTIVATE trial is to evaluate the impact of supervised aerobic exercise on CRCC in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The ACTIVATE trial is a two-arm, two-centre RCT. Women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer and awaiting neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy are recruited from hospitals in Ottawa (Ontario) and Vancouver (British Columbia), Canada. Recruits are randomized to the intervention group (aerobic exercise during chemotherapy) or the wait-list control group (usual care during chemotherapy and aerobic exercise post-chemotherapy). The primary outcome is cognitive functioning as measured by a composite cognitive summary score (COGSUM) of several neuropsychological tests. Secondary outcomes are self-reported cognitive functioning, quality of life, and brain structure and functioning (measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/functional MRI and electroencephalography). Assessments take place pre-chemotherapy (pre-intervention), mid-way through chemotherapy (mid-intervention/mid-wait period), end of chemotherapy (post-intervention/post-wait period; primary endpoint), 16-weeks post-chemotherapy, and at 1-year post-baseline.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Aerobic exercise is a promising intervention for preventing and/or managing CRCC and enhancing quality of life among women diagnosed with breast cancer. The ACTIVATE trial tests several novel hypotheses, including that aerobic exercise can prevent and/or mitigate CRCC and that this effect is mediated by the timing of intervention delivery (i.e., during versus post-chemotherapy). Findings may support prescribing exercise during (or post-) chemotherapy for breast cancer and elucidate the potential role of aerobic exercise as a management strategy for CRCC in women with early-stage breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      The trial was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database ( NCT03277898 ) on September 11, 2017."

A questionnaire was mailed to patients which covered demographic daily illness severity; the quality of life (satisfaction with life in general, general health, and sexual, family and social relationships); a 28-item general-health questionnaire; a life-event schedule; and a locus-of-control scale. The response rate was 88%. Data were obtained on 138 subjects of whom half (69 subjects) were renal-transplant recipients. The other 69 patients were divided between those who underwent haemodialysis at home (24 patients); those who underwent haemodialysis in a hospital centre (24 patients); and those who underwent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (21 patients). The study showed that while transplant recipients rated highest in the various aspects of quality of life, that of patients who underwent haemodialysis at home was nearly equivalent. Although patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were ranked third in terms of their quality of life, this clearly exceeded that of the group that underwent haemodialysis in a hospital centre, which generally shared very-similar demographic characteristics. Contrary to general expectations, no clear difference was found across the four treatment modalities in the proportion of patients who were disturbed psychologically or who had a history of treatment for \"nervous\" problems. The results confirm the superiority of renal transplantation in the treatment of end-stage renal disease but highlights the role of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis as a well-tolerated alternative in the treatment of end-stage renal disease."

Their knowledge about their condition also improved compared with that of the controls. The duration of stay in hospital for respiratory reasons in the group visited by a respiratory health worker was longer than that of control patients. This was explained by their being scored as more ill than the controls on admission. Fewer patients died in the group visited by a respiratory health worker than in the control group (p = 0.11).

Although the prognosis of patients who have diabetes and are receiving RRT has greatly improved, survival and medical rehabilitation rates continue to be significantly worse than those of nondiabetic patients, mainly because of preexisting severely compromised cardiovascular conditions. The most common RRT modality in patients with diabetes is still hemodialysis, but it gives rise to a number of clinical problems, in particular difficulties in the management of the vascular access and high frequency of intradialytic hypotension. However, patients who have diabetes and are on peritoneal dialysis have to face a progressive increase in peritoneal permeability, loss of ultrafiltration, and peritoneal fibrosis, all phenomena being accelerated in patients with diabetes and ultimately leading to an increased technique failure. The results of observational studies and national registries, although conflicting, suggest that these two dialytic modalities are somehow comparable in terms of outcomes, whereas accumulating evidence shows that both survival and medical rehabilitation of patients with diabetes are significantly better after renal transplantation, which should be the first-choice option for patients who have diabetes and reach ESRD but unfortunately still accounts for only a limited proportion of RRT treatments in these patients."

The contribution of the different treatment modalities (haemodialysis, continuous peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation) to the survival of patients according to geographical region is also shown. Survival on renal replacement therapy, irrespective of treatment modality and of primary renal disease, was best in the 10-14-year-old patients, with 58% at 10 years and 52% at 15 years, and decreased with rising age to 28% at 10 years and 16% at 15 years in patients aged 45-54 when they commenced therapy in 1970-1974. When comparing the 0-4-year-old with the 10-14-year-old cohort of the paediatric patients, 5-year survival rates for patients starting renal replacement therapy in the early eighties declined from 85% to 70% with decreasing age. Treatment policy, as reflected by the proportion of patients on different modes of therapy, varied markedly between European regions but affected survival to a small extent only. The large population with diabetic nephropathy incurred annual mortality rates 2-3 times greater than those observed in patients with 'standard' primary renal diseases. Haemodialysis and continuous peritoneal dialysis, although not comparable because of important differences in selection policy, yielded similar survival rates. Patients and graft survival rates have improved markedly when comparing patients starting renal replacement therapy in the early seventies with the eighties; particularly for cadaveric transplantation. Patient survival after second grafting was similar to that after first grafting, with 83% at 5 years after second cadaveric grafting in the 15-44-year-old cohort, vs 85% after first cadaver transplantation in 1980-1984. Second cadaveric graft survival was superior to average first-graft survival for those recipients whose first graft had been functioning for more than 1 year. However, second-graft survival in rapid rejectors of a first graft as well as third cadaveric graft survival were curtailed by the large number of early losses, with only 52% of third grafts functioning at 1 year. For living related donor transplantation, parents were mostly used in children whilst identical siblings predominated in adults older than 45. In the early eighties, patient survival was 92% at 5 years for recipients younger than 15, 87% for the 15-45 year old cohort and 72% for those aged 45 or older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Compared with healthy individuals, patients with sarcoma frequently scored lower in physical and psychological HRQoL domains and experienced higher rates of self-image issues, depression, and suicide. However, outcomes for patients with sarcoma were relatively comparable to those with other malignancies. Anxiety symptoms were more common in the diagnosis phase, while depressive symptoms were more common in the treatment phase. Patients who are older, female, and socially isolated often reported lower HRQoL. As a sarcoma-specific HRQoL instrument is not available, and all studies have used generic instruments, key issues may have been omitted.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There are few studies reporting data for HRQoL, psychosocial issues, or unmet health needs in this population.

            "abstract": "The past three decades have seen enormous conceptual advances in understanding the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Increasing evidence points to important genetic determination of the renal risk, i.e. the propensity to develop diabetic nephropathy, in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. We are also further along the path to understanding the abnormalities of renal hemodynamics that underly these patients' propensity to develop diabetic glomerulosclerosis, i.e. afferent arterial vasodilation and increased glomerular pressure, identified in elegant experimental studies. Another important advance is the recognition that increased urinary albumin excretion is not only an extremely sensitive marker, but also an important player in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, the concept of the toxicity of hyperglycemia (\"glucotoxicity\") has been carried to the molecular level, so that pathomechanisms such as activation of protein kinase C and cellular damage by advanced glycation endproducts (AGE), to name only two, have been elucidated. Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal failure (ESRF) in Western countries, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Three treatment modalities are available: (i) hemodialysis,(ii) CAPD and (iii) transplantation, meaning kidney transplantation, combined pancreas and kidney transplantation or - still in a very preliminary stage - islet cell transplantation. The ideal is to have all three modalities available to meet each patient's individual needs. Treatment outcome continues to be considerably worse, however, in diabetic than non-diabetic patients. This highlights the importance of prevention. Progression to ESRF in diabetic nephropathy is preventable, at least to a large extent."

The most important of these are the selection of appropriate procedures for evaluation, the choice of meaningful outcomes, the comparison of outcomes among groups of patients who are really comparable to one another, the unbiased assessment of outcomes, the assessment of a number of patients sufficient to provide adequate statistical power for the detection of meaningful differences, and the generalizing of results. In evaluating perioperative prophylaxis, investigators often strive to identify small absolute differences among the risks of infections with different prophylactic regimens. For many specific procedures and drug regimens, such evaluations are limited by the difficulty of studying a sufficient number of individuals.

In many clinical areas, integrated care pathways are utilised as structured multidisciplinary care plans that detail essential steps in caring for patients with specific clinical problems. In particular, care pathways for the dying have been developed as a model to improve care of patients who are in the last days of life. The care pathways were designed with an aim of ensuring that the most appropriate management occurs at the most appropriate time, and that it is provided by the most appropriate health professional. Since the last update, there have been sustained concerns about the safety of implementing end-of-life care pathways, particularly in the United Kingdom (UK). Therefore, there is a significant need for clinicians and policy makers to be informed about the effects of end-of-life care pathways via a systematic review.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of end-of-life care pathways, compared with usual care (no pathway) or with care guided by another end-of-life care pathway across all healthcare settings (e.g. hospitals, residential aged care facilities, community).In particular, we aimed to assess the effects on symptom severity and quality of life of people who are dying, or those related to the care, such as families, carers and health professionals, or a combination of these.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, review articles, trial registries and reference lists of relevant articles.

We judged the study to be at a high risk of bias overall, mainly due to a lack of blinding and rates of attrition. Only 34% of the participants (range 14% to 75% on individual wards) were cared for in accordance with the care pathway as planned. However, these issues were to be expected due to the nature of the intervention and condition. The study population was all cancer patients in their last days of life. Participants were allocated to care using the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP-I, Italian version of a continuous quality improvement programme of end-of-life care) or to standard care. The primary outcomes of this review were physical symptom severity, psychological symptom severity, quality of life, and any adverse effects. Physical symptom severity was assessed as overall control of pain, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. There was very low quality evidence of a difference in overall control of breathlessness that favoured the Liverpool Care Pathway group compared to usual care: the study reported an odds ratio (OR) of 2.0 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.1 to 3.8. Very low quality evidence of no difference was found for pain (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.6, P = 0.461) and nausea and vomiting (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 3.2, P = 0.252). None of the other primary outcomes were assessed by the study. Limited data on advance care planning were collected by the study authors, making results for this secondary outcome unreliable.

However, the failure of translation of both this compound and many others from preclinical studies to the clinic indicates that new approaches must be used in drug discovery so that animal models become more reflective of the clinical situation, and studies using animal models of stroke mimic the design of studies performed in humans, as far as possible. In this review, we suggest that a fundamental paradigm shift is needed away from performing preclinical studies in individual laboratories to performing them in an organised group of independent laboratories. Studies should be run by a steering committee and should be supported by a coordinating centre, external data monitoring committee and outcome adjudication committee. This structure will mimic the practice of multicentre clinical trials. By doing so, future studies will minimise potential sources of bias including randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding of surgery and outcome assessment and ensure publication of all data. It is likely that individual studies will involve increased heterogeneity and therefore will need to be larger. However, regular independent monitoring of data will allow development of interventions to be ceased immediately if neutral or negative data are obtained. The additional costs involved should be seen as reasonable when compared with the resources that would have been expended in running a clinical trial that subsequently proved negative."

Nevertheless, the number of studies in pediatric populations is limited and some important aspects of kidney function after HSCT have only been elucidated in adults. The incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) immediately after HSCT in pediatric patients is between 25% and 50%, with 5%-10% of children requiring renal replacement therapy. Doubling of serum creatinine is associated with a twofold increase in mortality. However, the need for dialysis leads to a further increase in mortality rates to 80%-90%. Specific renal syndromes appear at different times following HSCT, revealing a similar pattern in children and adult patients. In both children and adults, impaired renal function associated with liver impairment (hepatorenal syndrome) is the most important cause for ARF. Therapeutic approaches have not been able to reduce the frequency or to improve outcome so far. In adults surviving long term, bone marrow transplant (BMT) nephropathy is the most frequent renal complication, although a considerable variation in incidence (up to 70%) has been published, partly due to various definitions and manifestations. Little is known about the long-term outcome of renal function in patients treated with HSCT in childhood. However, chronic renal failure has been reported in 0%-28%, but no end-stage renal failure has been published so far. Tubular function following HSCT is rarely investigated, although its impact on long-term survivors of BMT in childhood might be of some importance, especially for growth and bone metabolism."

For example, the CAPD population included 21 patients with major cardiovascular diseases versus only three in the HHD group. The demographic characteristics of both populations including race, sex, age, income, place of residence, marital status, and education were similar. At the time of this study there is no direct evidence showing that healthy patients otherwise able to perform HHD may be maintained with less morbidity for a prolonged period utilizing CAPD. Therefore, we suggest that HHD is the home method of choice for patients able to proceed with this technique. CAPD may be indicated for patients in whom the period of home dialysis is expected to be relatively short and who would be otherwise unable to carry out home dialysis, for example, patients awaiting transplantation and those unable to be maintained on hemodialysis because of impaired cardiac function. To fully evaluate CAPD as a long-term maintenance therapy, a prospective trial must be performed."

            "abstract": "Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice in children with end-stage renal failure. Limitations in patient anatomy or a short donor renal vein may necessitate intraoperative inversion of the kidney. There is little evidence to support the use of this surgical technique, and no evidence in the pediatric population. This study identifies the perioperative and post-operative outcomes of inverted renal transplants in pediatric patients. We reviewed all patients having a renal transplant between January 2012 and December 2016 and collected short- and long-term outcomes of patients who received an inverted allograft. Early graft function was defined as the time to reach creatinine nadir. During this time, our hospital performed 81 transplants, and 50 (62%) were from deceased donors, including the 6 (12%) patients who received inverted renal grafts. Half (3/6) were female, 5/6 (83%) were dialysis-dependent, and the median age at surgery was 13 years (range 9-16 years). There was no significant difference in mean creatinine nadir values (P = 0.518) and the time to creatinine nadir mean values (P = 0.190) between the upright and inverted renal transplant groups. There were also no significant differences in rates of post-operative complications between the upright and inverted allograft recipients. Inversion of renal allografts in pediatric patients is a viable surgical technique to compensate for shortcomings in patient anatomy or in special cases of renal transplantation involving a short donor renal vein. Future research should focus on outcomes of a larger group of pediatric inverted renal transplant patients."

Peroperative hypotension occurred more often in diabetics (NS). All operating parameters including cold ischaemia were comparable. Kidney function started immediately in 14/24 in the DM group and 13/24 in the NDM group and was delayed in 10/24 and 11/24, respectively. One diabetic patient rejected the transplant as did two non-diabetic patients. Postoperatively diuretics could be discontinued more often in the DM than in the NDM group (p < 0.05). Antihypertensives had to be started in the NDM more often (NS) than in the DM group.

This is influenced by the negative effects of the disease and the treatment of childhood cancer. Exercise training for adult cancer patients has frequently been reported to improve physical fitness. In recent years, literature on this subject has also become available for children and young adults with cancer, both during and after treatment. This is an update of the original review that was performed in 2011.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effect of a physical exercise training intervention on the physical fitness (i.e. aerobic capacity, muscle strength, or functional performance) of children with cancer within the first five years from their diagnosis (performed either during or after cancer treatment), compared to a control group of children with cancer who did not receive an exercise intervention.To determine whether physical exercise within the first five years of diagnosis has an effect on fatigue, anxiety, depression, self efficacy, and HRQoL and to determine whether there are any adverse effects of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the electronic databases of Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro; ongoing trial registries and conference proceedings on 6 September 2011 and 11 November 2014. In addition, we performed a handsearch of reference lists.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that compared the effects of physical exercise training with no training, in people who were within the first five years of their diagnosis of childhood cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently identified studies meeting the inclusion criteria, performed the data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias using standardized forms. Study quality was rated by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Apart from the five studies in the original review, this update included one additional RCT. In total, the analysis included 171 participants, all during treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).The duration of the training sessions ranged from 15 to 60 minutes per session. Both the type of intervention and intervention period varied in all the included studies. However, the control group always received usual care.All studies had methodological limitations, such as small numbers of participants, unclear randomization methods, and single-blind study designs in case of one RCT and all results were of moderate to very low quality (GRADE).Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the 9-minute run-walk test, timed up-and-down stairs test, the timed up-and-go time test, and the 20-m shuttle run test. Data of the 9-minute run-walk test and the timed up-and-down stairs test could be pooled. The combined 9-minute run-walk test results showed significant differences between the intervention and the control groups, in favour of the intervention group (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.35). Pooled data from the timed up-and-down stairs test showed no significant differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD -0.54; 95% CI -1.77 to 0.70). However, there was considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 84%) between the two studies on this outcome. The other two single-study outcomes, 20-m shuttle run test and the timed up-and-go test, also showed positive results for cardiorespiratory fitness in favour of the intervention group.Only one study assessed the effect of exercise on bone mineral density (total body), showing a statistically significant positive intervention effect (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.66). The pooled data on body mass index showed no statistically significant end-score difference between the intervention and control group (SMD 0.59; 95% CI -0.23 to 1.41).Three studies assessed flexibility. Two studies assessed ankle dorsiflexion. One study assessed active ankle dorsiflexion, while the other assessed passive ankle dorsiflexion. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group with the active ankle dorsiflexion test; however, in favour of the intervention group, they were found for passive ankle dorsiflexion (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.25). The third study assessed body flexibility using the sit-and-reach distance test, but identified no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group.Three studies assessed muscle strength (knee, ankle, back and leg, and inspiratory muscle strength). Only the back and leg strength combination score showed statistically significant differences on the muscle strength end-score between the intervention and control group (SMD 1.41; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.11).Apart from one sub-scale of the cancer scale (Worries; P value = 0.03), none of the health-related quality of life scales showed a significant difference between both study groups on the end-score. For the other outcomes of fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events (all assessed in one study), there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group.None of the included studies evaluated activity energy expenditure, time spent on exercise, anxiety and depression, or self efficacy as an outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The effects of physical exercise training interventions for childhood cancer participants are not yet convincing. Possible reasons are the small numbers of participants and insufficient study designs, but it can also be that this type of intervention is not as effective as in adult cancer patients. However, the first results show some positive effects on physical fitness in the intervention group compared to the control group. There were positive intervention effects for body composition, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (cancer-related items). These were measured by some assessment methods, but not all. However, the quality of the evidence was low and these positive effects were not found for the other assessed outcomes, such as fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events. There is a need for more studies with comparable aims and interventions, using a higher number of participants that also include diagnoses other than ALL."

Survey data.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      Studies were selected and assessed. A survey of ICD centres was carried out. Basic data were obtained from two major implanting centres including 535 patients (approximately 10% of overall UK activity) implanted between 1991 and 2002, and retrieval of fuller data, on patient characteristics, management and resource use, from patient notes for a sample of 426 patients was attempted. A cross-sectional survey collected HRQoL data (using the Nottingham Health Profile, Short Form 36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, EuroQoL 5 Dimensions and disease-specific questions) on a sample of 229 patients. A Markov model combined UK patient data with data from published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate incremental costs per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      None of the economic analyses in the studies found could be directly applied to the UK. The multiple sources of routine data available (including the national ICD database) provide an imperfect picture of the need for and use of ICDs. Implantation rates have been rising to a rate of around 20 per million population. Mean age is increasing and most ICDs are implanted into men aged 45-74 years. There is significant geographical variation. A survey of 41 UK centres provided additional evidence, particularly of variation in level of activity and resourcing. Most detailed data were obtained for 380 patients (89%). The postal survey produced a 73% response rate. Demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to ICD recipients in the UK as a whole and patients included in secondary prevention RCTs. Mean actuarial survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 92%, 86% and 71%, respectively. Patient age at implantation and functional status significantly affected survival. Levels of most of the HRQoL measures were lower than for a UK general population. There was no evidence of a change with time from implantation. Patients who had suffered ICD shocks had significantly poorer HRQoL. Most patients nevertheless expressed a high level of satisfaction with ICD therapy. Mean initial costs of implantation showed little variation between centres (23,300 pounds versus 22,100 pounds) or between earlier and more recent implants. There appeared to be greater variation between patients presenting along different pathways. Postdischarge costs (tests, medications and follow-up consultations) and costs of additional hospitalisations were also calculated. Using the Markov model it was found that over a 20-year horizon, mean discounted incremental costs were 70,900 pounds (35,000-142,400 pounds). Mean discounted gain was 1.24 years (0.29-2.32) or 0.93 QALYs. Cost-effectiveness was most favourable for men aged over 70 years with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 35%. If the treatment effect were to continue, then the cost per life-year over a lifetime might fall to around 32,000 pounds. Five RCTs of ICDs, a meta-analysis and, a cost-effectiveness analysis of ICDs used in primary prevention, and a meta-analysis of ICDs in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy have been published recently. These trials provide confirmation of survival benefit of ICDs used in primary prevention in both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy patients. Costs per QALY ranged from US$34,000 in older trials to controls being both less expensive and more effective (CABG Patch, DINAMIT). More recent trials estimated cost per QALY between $50,300 and $70,200. The inconsistency in evidence for a HRQoL benefit has not been resolved and further work on risk stratification is necessary.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence of short- to medium-term patient benefit from ICDs is strong but cost-effectiveness modelling indicates that the extent of that benefit is probably not sufficient to make the technology cost-effective as used currently in the UK. One reason is the high rates of postimplantation hospitalisation. Better patient targeting and efforts to reduce the need for such hospitalisation may improve cost-effectiveness. Further cost-effectiveness modelling, underpinned by an improved ICD database with reliable long-term follow-up, is required. The absence of a robust measure of the incidence of sudden cardiac death is noted and this may be an area where further organisational changes with improved data collection would help."

Numerous studies were carried out trying to solve problems of treatment of patients with LN. Increased risk of infections, disease recurrence in renal allograft, undefined criteria for follow-up of disease activity after transplantation, as well as higher inci- dence of rejection episodes and thrombotic events are well known risks which have postponed and restricted access to transplantation for patients with LN for long-time. However, numerous studies have demonstrated similar long-term survival in patients treated with haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, with clear superiority of renal transplantation regarding the prolonged survival and better quality of life for SLE patients. Many questions are still waiting for answers. Close cooperation between nephrologists and immunologists provides the best treatment for SLE patients with end-stage renal disease."

Conservative treatment consisting of intra-articular corticosteroid infiltrations and physiotherapy are considered appropriate for most patients. However, with a conservative strategy, patients experience a prolonged rehabilitation period with a considerable amount of pain and disabilities in daily life. Also, at long term, a residual amount of pain and restriction of range of motion is frequently reported. Manipulation under anesthesia is a short and relative simple procedure with the potential to rapidly reduce symptoms and restore the range of motion. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of MUA followed by a PT program compared to a PT program alone, in the treatment of patients with a stage two FS.

Patients allocated to the PT group are given advice and education and receive a written protocol to hand out to their physical therapist based on the recent guideline of the Dutch Shoulder Network for the treatment of frozen shoulders. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample size, patients demographics, presence of diabetes mellitus, range of motion, duration of symptoms till randomization and will be presented for each treatment group.

Peritoneal dialysis has been advancing in terms of technique, new exchange systems, and a new generation of solutions. A survival advantage for PD patients has been noted over the first 1 - 2 years after the onset of the dialysis. Most patients may need both dialytic modalities in time, and therefore the sequence of the treatment options is important. Compared with hemodialysis patients, PD patients seem much more satisfied in most of the studies that evaluate quality of life during treatment. A preference for PD may be more advantageous in the pre-transplantation period. Moreover, much lower doses of erythropoietin have been shown to be sufficient for PD patients.

Eighty-eight RTCs received vaccine, and 84 received placebo. Results were analyzed according to the prevaccination serologic status (anti-CMV antibody titer) of the recipient (R- or R+) and the donor (D- or D+). The overall incidence of CMV disease was highest in the R-D+ group and almost absent in the R-D- group.

Neither is it explained by race, severity of CVD, transfer to hemodialysis, transplantation, or an estimate of compliance.

Both paired and unpaired studies were eligible for inclusion.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The results of the literature search were screened and a standard data extraction form was used to collect data. Both of these steps were performed by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous scales of measurement were expressed as a mean difference (MD). Random effects models were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was incidence of DGF. Secondary outcomes included: one-year graft survival, incidence of primary non-function (PNF), DGF duration, long term graft survival, economic implications, graft function, patient survival and incidence of acute rejection.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      No studies reported on NMP, however one ongoing study was identified.Sixteen studies (2266 participants) comparing HMP with SCS were included; 15 studies could be meta-analysed. Fourteen studies reported on requirement for dialysis in the first week post-transplant (DGF incidence); there is high-certainty evidence that HMP reduces the risk of DGF when compared to SCS (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; P = 0.0006). HMP reduces the risk of DGF in kidneys from DCD donors (7 studies, 772 participants: RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87; P = 0.0002; high certainty evidence), as well as kidneys from DBD donors (4 studies, 971 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; P = 0.006; high certainty evidence). The number of perfusions required to prevent one episode of DGF (number needed to treat, NNT) was 7.26 and 13.60 in DCD and DBD kidneys respectively. Studies performed in the last decade all used the LifePort machine and confirmed that HMP reduces the incidence of DGF in the modern era (5 studies, 1355 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91; P = 0.002; high certainty evidence). Reports of economic analysis suggest that HMP can lead to cost savings in both the North American and European settings.Two studies reported HMP also improves graft survival however we were not able to meta-analyse these results. A reduction in incidence of PNF could not be demonstrated. The effect of HMP on our other outcomes (incidence of acute rejection, patient survival, hospital stay, long-term graft function, duration of DGF) remains uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      HMP is superior to SCS in deceased donor kidney transplantation. This is true for both DBD and DCD kidneys, and remains true in the modern era (studies performed in the last decade). As kidneys from DCD donors have a higher overall DGF rate, fewer perfusions are needed to prevent one episode of DGF (7.26 versus 13.60 in DBD kidneys).Further studies looking solely at the impact of HMP on DGF incidence are not required. Follow-up reports detailing long-term graft survival from participants of the studies already included in this review would be an efficient way to generate further long-term graft survival data.Economic analysis, based on the results of this review, would help cement HMP as the standard preservation method in deceased donor kidney transplantation.RCTs investigating (sub)NMP are required."

We describe the experimental implementation of a collaborative, stepped-care model for the treatment of late-life depression (GermanIMPACT trial) in the German primary care context. GermanIMPACT was developed as an adaptation of a successful and widely used American model. The aim of the study is to evaluate the model's applicability to the German primary care setting and its cost-effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study will be conducted as a cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing the development of depressive symptoms in primary care patients who either receive treatment as usual (control arm) or treatment according to the GermanIMPACT model (intervention arm). In two German cities (Freiburg and Hamburg), a total of 60 general practice offices will be selected and randomized. Each general practice office will be asked to enroll five patients into the trial who are 60 years of age or older and who show moderate depressive symptoms in the scope of a diagnosed depressive episode, recurrent depressive disorder, or dysthymia. General practices in the control arm will provide treatment as usual; general practices in the intervention arm will work closely with a specially trained care manager and a supervising mental health specialist. Evidence-based elements of the treatment plan manual include patient education, identification and integration of positive activities into the daily routine, relapse prevention, and training of problem-solving techniques as needed. The intervention period per patient will be one year. Data will be collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Primary outcome is the patient-reported change of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes include measures of quality of life, anxiety, depression-related behavior, problem-solving skills, resilience, and an overall economic evaluation of the program.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The GermanIMPACT trial will provide evidence about the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of collaborative stepped care in treating late-life depression in German primary care.

The duration of treatment ranged from two to 34 months (median, 8.0 months). The technique failed in seven patients, in four because of peritonitis and in three because of catheter complications. Nine patients received renal transplants and one died while on CAPD. Dialysis was very effective with good biochemical control and excellent control of hypertension. Haemoglobin concentrations rose in 28 of the 31 patients (mean at 12 months, 2.0 g/L in 12 patients). Rehabilitation was comparable to that of home haemodialysis patients and superior to that of patients on hospital haemodialysis.

Diagnostic or prognostic evidence is given by studies with different designs, rather than RCTs. Given the structural design that a RCT must present to be valid--discussed in previous issues of the Journal--one major question is the applicability of trial results to populations or individual patients that are different from those analyzed in that trial. In other words, how does the cardiologist know whether to apply a specific treatment--whose efficacy and risk profile have been defined in a good quality RCT, i.e. one with valid and important results--to his/her individual patient? The simplest solution would be found in the answer to the question: \"Could my patient have been enrolled in the study by satisfying its inclusion and exclusion criteria?\" If the answer is \"yes\", then it would be sound to apply the study results to the patient, so long as it is done carefully. If the answer is \"no\" (because the patient presents different demographic features or serious comorbidities not found in the trial subjects, for example), then transfer of the therapeutic results from the trial would be seriously compromised. The evaluation of these questions is complex and, due to its importance, deserves a systematic approach. In this article we will present some practical guidelines on whether to reject the applicability of RCT results to patients who are different from those included in the trial."

At present, approximately 800 Dutch patients are registered on the active waiting list of Eurotransplant. The waiting time in the Netherlands for a kidney from a deceased donor is on average between 3 and 4 years. During this period, patients are fully dependent on dialysis, which replaces only partly the renal function, whereas the quality of life is limited. Mortality among patients on the waiting list is high. In order to increase the number of kidney donors, several initiatives have been undertaken by the Dutch Kidney Foundation including national calls for donor registration and providing information on organ donation and kidney transplantation. The aim of the national PROCARE consortium is to develop improved matching algorithms that will lead to a prolonged survival of transplanted donor kidneys and a reduced HLA immunization. The latter will positively affect the waiting time for a retransplantation. The present algorithm for allocation is among others based on matching for HLA antigens, which were originally defined by antibodies using serological typing techniques. However, several studies suggest that this algorithm needs adaptation and that other immune parameters which are currently not included may assist in improving graft survival rates. We will employ a multicenter-based evaluation on 5429 patients transplanted between 1995 and 2005 in the Netherlands. The association between key clinical endpoints and selected laboratory defined parameters will be examined, including Luminex-defined HLA antibody specificities, T and B cell epitopes recognized on the mismatched HLA antigens, non-HLA antibodies, and also polymorphisms in complement and Fc receptors functionally associated with effector functions of anti-graft antibodies. From these data, key parameters determining the success of kidney transplantation will be identified which will lead to the identification of additional parameters to be included in future matching algorithms aiming to extend survival of transplanted kidneys and to diminish HLA immunization. Computer simulation studies will reveal the number of patients having a direct benefit from improved matching, the effect on shortening of the waiting list, and the decrease in waiting time."

It is uncertain whether information or education interventions as part of a complex intervention reduce patient anxiety and depression due to very low-certainty evidence.One study (175 carer participants) reported fewer carer participants with poor comprehension among those given information (risk ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53), but again this finding is uncertain due to very low-certainty evidence.Two studies (487 carer participants) reported little or no difference in carer satisfaction; it is uncertain whether information or education interventions as part of a complex intervention increase carer satisfaction due to very low-certainty evidence. Adverse effects were reported in only one study: one participant withdrew because of deterioration in mental health on completion of anxiety and depression questionnaires, but the study authors did not report whether this participant was from the intervention or comparison group.We downgraded certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations, and limited data from few small studies.No studies reported severity of PTSD, or health-related quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We are uncertain of the effects of information or education interventions given to adult ICU patients and their carers, as the evidence in all cases was of very low certainty, and our confidence in the evidence was limited. Ongoing studies may contribute more data and introduce more certainty when incorporated into future updates of the review."

            "abstract": "Although current dialysis techniques have transformed acute and chronic renal failure from uniformly fatal clinical disorders into treatable diseases, these therapies replace only the water and solute clearance function of the kidney and have reached a point where little further therapeutic improvement can be anticipated. In addition to their metabolic and endocrine functions, renal tubule cells presumably play an important role in the systemic inflammatory balance by participating in the complex and dynamic network of leukocyte action and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Loss of this function may result in a propensity to develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction, and a high risk of death in acute kidney injury (AKI), and may relate to chronic inflammatory state in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A renal tubule cell assist device (RAD) containing animal or human renal tubule cells has been recently developed with the purpose of integrating the functions of tubule cells with the filtration function of current dialysis to offer a more complete renal replacement therapy. The viability and functionality of this device were confirmed in in vitro experiments and large animal studies, and recently the RAD's clinical therapeutic benefit was demonstrated with a series of FDA-approved human trials. Another novel synthetic membrane extracorporeal device that binds and inhibits circulating leukocytes has been developed with the purpose of reducing microvascular damage promoted primarily via activated circulating leukocytes in AKI and SIRS. This device, called a selective cytopheretic inhibitory device, mimics immunomodulation and duplicates RAD efficiency in preliminary studies. Both devices may become comprehensive treatments, replacing full renal function and correcting inflammatory imbalance in patients with acute and chronic renal disorders."

In contrast, no such widely accepted guidelines are recognized for standardization of an essential, if unacknowledged, element of all such studies: the concomitant provision of at least a minimal form of psychosocial treatment. Standardized provision of psychosocial treatments in pharmacotherapy trials will foster replicability of findings and address several common problems (e.g., attrition, medication noncompliance, reduction of error variance, and ethical issues associated with placebo controls). Careful selection and standardization of the psychosocial context in which medications are delivered will improve the validity, precision, and power of pharmacotherapy efficacy research, and should be considered a virtual requirement in research design."

Since little is known regarding the clinical benefits of transplantation relative to dialysis in this age group, this study compares transplantation and dialysis among the elderly with respect to patient survival. Data utilized in this investigation were obtained from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR). The study population consisted of the 6400 patients aged 60 and over at registration, diagnosed between 1987 and 1993, for whom data on comorbid conditions were available. Survival probability, death rates, age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox regression analysis were employed to evaluate the survival experience among the transplant and dialysis groups. Transplant recipients were matched (by age, underlying diagnosis leading to ESRD, and number of comorbid conditions) to 2 randomly selected patients who did not undergo transplantation. Using Cox regression, the time-dependent hazard ratio for transplantation versus dialysis patients was estimated at 0.47 (P < 0.0001), indicating that even after adjusting for other known prognostic factors, elderly patients who received a transplant experienced significantly greater survival probability than those who remained on dialysis. When transplant patients were matched to randomly selected dialysis patients with the constraint that the corresponding dialysis patient have at least as much follow-up time as the transplant patient had waiting time, five-year survival rates were 81% and 51% for the transplant and dialysis groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). These results support the potential advantage of transplantation among the elderly, and may have important implications for renal care in this age group."

The main aims of therapeutic management are to reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life. Self-management interventions are potentially important for empowering people with bronchiectasis to manage their condition more effectively and to seek care in a timely manner. Self-management interventions are beneficial in the management of other airways diseases such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and have been identified as a research priority for bronchiectasis.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and adverse effects of self-management interventions for adults and children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register of trials, clinical trials registers, reference lists of included studies and review articles, and relevant manufacturers' websites up to 13 December 2017.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included all randomised controlled trials of any duration that included adults or children with a diagnosis of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis assessing self-management interventions delivered in any form.

Primary outcomes were, health-related quality of life, exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were the number of participants admitted to hospital on at least one occasion, lung function, symptoms, self-efficacy and economic costs. We used a random effects model for analyses and standard Cochrane methods throughout.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Two studies with a total of 84 participants were included: a 12-month RCT of early rehabilitation in adults of mean age 72 years conducted in two centres in England (UK) and a six-month proof-of-concept RCT of an expert patient programme (EPP) in adults of mean age 60 years in a single regional respiratory centre in Northern Ireland (UK). The EPP was delivered in group format once a week for eight weeks using standardised EPP materials plus disease-specific education including airway clearance techniques, dealing with symptoms, exacerbations, health promotion and available support. We did not find any studies that included children. Data aggregation was not possible and findings are reported narratively in the review.For the primary outcomes, both studies reported health-related quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), but there was no clear evidence of benefit. In one study, the mean SGRQ total scores were not significantly different at 6 weeks', 3 months' and 12 months' follow-up (12 months mean difference (MD) -10.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -45.15 to 24.61). In the second study there were no significant differences in SGRQ. Total scores were not significantly different between groups (six months, MD 3.20, 95% CI -6.64 to 13.04). We judged the evidence for this outcome as low or very low. Neither of the included studies reported data on exacerbations requiring antibiotics. For serious adverse events, one study reported more deaths in the intervention group compared to the control group, (intervention: 4 of 8, control: 2 of 12), though interpretation is limited by the low event rate and the small number of participants in each group.For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of benefit in terms of frequency of hospital admissions or FEV1 L, based on very low-quality evidence. One study reported self-efficacy using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy scale, which comprises 10 components. All scales showed significant benefit from the intervention but effects were only sustained to study endpoint on the Managing Depression scale. Further details are reported in the main review.

A literature search was completed on databases with citation tracking using key words. Two reviewers completed data extraction and quality assessment independently by using modified scales for historical cohorts and case control studies as well as the PEDro scale for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials. This search identified nine articles of low to medium quality. Four reported a significant reduction in LOS associated with additional OBH physiotherapy, with two articles reporting overall significance and two reporting only for specific subgroups. Two studies reported significant reduction in pulmonary complications for two different patient groups in an intensive care unit (ICU) with additional OBH physiotherapy. Three studies accounted for discharge destination and/or discharge mobility status with no significant difference reported. Quality of life, adverse events, and mortality were not reported in any studies. Cost savings were considered in three studies, with two reporting a cost saving. This systematic review was unable to conclude that the provision of additional OBH physiotherapy made significant improvement to patient outcomes for all subgroups of inpatients. One study in critical care reported that overnight physiotherapy decreased LOS and reduced pulmonary complications of patients in the ICU. However, the studies in the area of orthopaedics, neurology, postcardiac surgery, and rheumatology, which all considered additional daytime weekend physiotherapy intervention, did not provide strong evidence to indicate effective reduction in patient LOS or improving patient discharge mobility status or discharge destination.

Home dialysis (PD and HHD) is a feasible and sustainable modality for patients with ESRD after NRSOT. Home dialysis offers several potential benefits, such as improved haemodynamic and metabolic control, which may be important in the NRSOT population. Home dialysis in patients who develop ESRD after NRSOT should be actively considered for this cohort."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe influence of pretransplantation dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes has been the subject of longstanding interest. Although increased time on dialysis prior to kidney transplantation is associated with decreased graft and patient survivals, analyses of the impact of dialysis modality on kidney allograft outcome have produced conflicting results.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of dialysis duration and modality on the function and survival of renal allografts.\n## PATIENTS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 421 adults who received first kidney transplantations from cadaveric heart-beating donors performed in our unit from May 1989 to May 2007. Three hundred seventy-four patients (88.8%) were on hemodialysis (HD) prior to kidney transplantation, including 247 patients (58.7%) on treatment for at least 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nPatients with a dialysis duration > or =24 months were significantly older (45.9 vs 42.8 years; P = .013). Renal function at 3, 12, 60, and 96 months was similar between the 2 groups. Longer duration on dialysis was associated with poorer overall graft and patient survivals. No differences were observed in renal function or graft and patient survivals comparing HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of correlation between dialysis duration or modality and allograft failure.\n## CONCLUSION\nLonger dialysis duration influenced overall graft and patient survival. However, dialysis modality showed no influence on graft function or survival.\n"

Haemodialysis via a catheter in the subclavian vein meets these needs. Our experience with 67 patients over two years confirmed the safety and reliability of this means of access.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Short (or small) saphenous vein (SSV) varices occur as a result of an incompetent sapheno-popliteal junction, where the SSV joins the popliteal vein, resulting in reflux in the SSV; they account for about 15% of varicose veins. Untreated varicose veins may sometimes lead to ulceration of the leg, which is difficult to manage. Traditionally, treatment was restricted to surgery or conservative management. Since the 1990s, however, a number of minimally invasive techniques have been developed; these do not normally require a general anaesthetic, are day-case procedures with a quicker return to normal activities and avoid the risk of wound infection which may occur following surgery. Nerve injury remains a risk with thermal ablation, but in cases where it does occur, the injury tends to be transient.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To compare the effectiveness of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) versus conventional surgery in the treatment of SSV varices.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched 17 March 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EVLA, endovenous RFA or UGFS with conventional surgery in the treatment of SSV varices for inclusion.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We independently reviewed, assessed and selected trials that met the inclusion criteria; any disagreements were resolved by discussion. We extracted data and used the Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. When the data permitted, we performed either fixed-effect meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or random-effects meta-analyses where there was moderate to significant heterogeneity.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified three RCTs, all of which compared EVLA with surgery; one also compared UGFS with surgery. There were no trials comparing RFA with surgery. The EVLA versus surgery comparison included 311 participants: 185 received EVLA and 126 received surgery. In the UGFS comparison, each treatment group contained 21 people. For several outcomes in the EVLA comparison, only a single study provided relevant data; as a result, the current review is limited in its ability to demonstrate meaningful results for some planned outcomes. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was moderate to low for the outcome measures in the EVLA versus surgery comparison, but low for the UGFS versus surgery comparison. Reasons for downgrading in the EVLA versus surgery comparison were risk of bias (for some outcomes, the outcome assessors were not blinded; and in one study the EVLA-surgery allocation of 2:1 did not appear to be prespecified); imprecision (data were only available from a single small study and the CIs were relatively wide); indirectness (one trial reported results at six months rather than one year and was inadequately powered for SSV varices-only analysis). Reasons for downgrading in the UGFS versus surgery comparison were imprecision (only one trial offered UGFS and several participants were missing from the analysis) and a limitation in design (the study was inadequately powered for SSV participants alone).For the EVLA versus surgery comparison, recanalisation or persistence of reflux at six weeks occurred less frequently in the EVLA group than in the surgery group (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.22; I2 = 51%; 289 participants, 3 studies, moderate-quality evidence). Recurrence of reflux at one year was also less frequent in the EVLA group than in the surgery group (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.77; I2 = 0%; 119 participants, 2 studies, low-quality evidence). For the outcome clinical evidence of recurrence (i.e. presence of new visible varicose veins) at one year, there was no difference between the two treatment groups (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.75; 99 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence). Four participants each in the EVLA and surgery groups required reintervention due to technical failure (99 participants, 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference between the two treatment groups for disease-specific quality of life (QoL) (Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire) either at six weeks (mean difference (MD) 0.15, 95% CI -1.65 to 1.95; I2 = 0%; 265 participants, 2 studies, moderate-quality evidence), or at one year (MD -1.08, 95% CI -3.39 to 1.23; 99 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence). Main complications reported at six weeks were sural nerve injury, wound infection and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (one DVT case in each treatment group; EVLA: 1/161, 0.6%; surgery 1/104, 1%; 265 participants, 2 studies, moderate-quality evidence).For the UGFS versus surgery comparison, there were insufficient data to detect clear differences between the two treatment groups for the two outcomes recanalisation or persistence of reflux at six weeks (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.10; 33 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence), and recurrence of reflux at one year (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.92; 31 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence). No other outcomes could be reported for this comparison because the study data were not stratified according to saphenous vein.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Moderate- to low-quality evidence exists to suggest that recanalisation or persistence of reflux at six weeks and recurrence of reflux at one year are less frequent when EVLA is performed, compared with conventional surgery. For the UGFS versus conventional surgery comparison, the quality of evidence is assessed to be low; consequently, the effectiveness of UGFS compared with conventional surgery in the treatment of SSV varices is uncertain. Further RCTs for all comparisons are required with longer follow-up (at least five years). In addition, measurement of outcomes such as recurrence of reflux, time taken to return to work, duration of procedure, pain, etc., and choice of time points during follow-up should be standardised such that future trials evaluating newer technologies can be compared efficiently."

The only difference between interventions is whether phantom movements are actually performed (PME) or just imagined (PMI). Complete evaluations are conducted at baseline and at intervention completion, as well as 1, 3 and 6 months later using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Changes in PLP measured using the Pain Rating Index between the first and last session are the primary measure of efficacy.

However, accounting methods may obscure the true economic costs of providing the different type of dialysis treatments such as hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. In this study, a multiproduct, statistical cost function approach to obtain cost estimates was used. Results obtained in this study show that the average cost and marginal cost of hemodialysis treatments are generally in line with current reimbursement rates, whereas the average and marginal costs of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis treatments may be below this rate. For in-center hemodialysis, which is the mainstay of all dialysis units, the authors found evidence of decreasing economies of scale at the mean facility size, but found constant returns to scale for other modalities. Some evidence of economies of scale from chain ownership of dialysis centers was discovered. Finally, the analysis indicates that the Medicare reimbursement formula may be outdated, and further research that could lead to the design of more \"rational\" payment rules is suggested."

A P<0.05 was considered significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred twenty children with a mean age of 47.6 months were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The most frequent cause of renal failure was hereditary-metabolic-cystic disease. One hundred eighty-two peritoneal dialysis catheters were inserted surgically. The median first catheter exchange was 0.74 year (95%CI: 0.5 - 0.98). The most frequent cause of catheter replacement was catheter outflow failure due to displacement, adhesion, and infection (persistent peritonitis or tunnel infection). The mean patient survival was 1.22 years (95%CI: 0.91 - 1.53). The mortality rate was 55% before 1997, and 60% between 1998 and 2001, which declined to 23% after 2002 (P<0.05). Young age (<24 months) was the only independent factor that predicted mortality (P<0.05). The outcome of children was as follows: recovery of renal function (6.7%), renal transplantation (8.3%), switch to hemodialysis (16.7%), still on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (23.3%), death (43.3%), and lost to follow-up (1.7%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The mortality is still high among Iranian children on peritoneal dialysis. Young age is the most important factor influencing on survival and mortality."

However, information regarding the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has not been comprehensively or systematically covered in these reviews, despite its frequent use in the patient community.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to systematically review and evaluate the current literature related to alternative and complementary treatments for ME/CFS and FM. It should be stressed that the treatments evaluated in this review do not reflect the clinical approach used by most practitioners to treat these illnesses, which include a mix of natural and unconventionally used medications and natural hormones tailored to each individual case. However, nearly all clinical research has focused on the utility of single CAM interventions, and thus is the primary focus of this review.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Several databases (e.g., PubMed, MEDLINE,((R)) PsychInfo) were systematically searched for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials of alternative treatments and nonpharmacological supplements. Included studies were checked for references and several experts were contacted for referred articles. Two leading subspecialty journals were also searched by hand. Data were then extracted from included studies and quality assessments were conducted using the Jadad scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Upon completion of the literature search and the exclusion of studies not meeting criterion, a total of 70 controlled clinical trials were included in the review. Sixty (60) of the 70 studies found at least one positive effect of the intervention (86%), and 52 studies also found improvement in an illness-specific symptom (74%). The methodological quality of reporting was generally poor.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Several types of alternative medicine have some potential for future clinical research. However, due to methodological inconsistencies across studies and the small body of evidence, no firm conclusions can be made at this time. Regarding alternative treatments, acupuncture and several types of meditative practice show the most promise for future scientific investigation. Likewise, magnesium, l-carnitine, and S-adenosylmethionine are nonpharmacological supplements with the most potential for further research. Individualized treatment plans that involve several pharmacological agents and natural remedies appear promising as well."

In 1998, the St. Elisabeth Hospital started a unique trans-Atlantic collaboration with the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and the Eurotransplant Foundation. The partnership aimed to achieve a structured transplantation program for patients in the Dutch Caribbean, who otherwise would need lifelong dialysis. This study is an analysis of the 10-yr transplantation results of this trans-Atlantic program. In 41 consecutive transplantations performed between January 1998 and April 2007, one-yr graft survival and complication rates were retrospectively studied. Twenty-four men and 17 women with a median age of 54 were transplanted. The median dialysis period prior to transplantation was 6.8 yr. The one-yr graft survival rate was 69% (95% confidence interval: 52-80%). Initially 28 grafts functioned (68%); four grafts showed primary non-function (10%) and delayed graft function developed in nine patients (22%). Ten recipients had 16 post-operative complications. Our trans-Atlantic program affords patients with end-stage renal failure, who otherwise would need lifelong dialysis, a chance to be transplanted."

This study examines the pharmacokinetics of MPA and MPAG in patients with end-stage renal failure who were on hemodialysis (N = 10) or peritoneal dialysis (N = 10) treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After an overnight fast, a single oral dose of 1 g MMF was given. Plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG were measured from 0 (predose) to 36 hours after administration, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 36 hours was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean (+/- SD) AUC for MPA was 55.7 +/- 32.6 mg/L.h for hemodialysis patients and 44.7 +/- 14.7 mg/L.h for peritoneal dialysis patients, which is similar to expected values for subjects with normal renal function. The mean (+/- SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for MPA was lower than would be expected for subjects with normal renal function (16.01 +/- 10.61 mg/L for hemodialysis, 11.48 +/- 4.98 mg/L for peritoneal dialysis). MPAG clearance was prolonged with AUC approximately five times what would be expected in subjects with normal renal function (1565 +/- 596 mg/L.h for hemodialysis, 1386 +/- 410 mg/L.h for peritoneal dialysis). There was no significant difference for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters between subjects on hemodialysis and those on peritoneal dialysis. Plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG did not fall significantly during hemodialysis. No MPA was detectable in hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis fluid, but small amounts of MPAG were detected in hemodialysis fluid in 1 out of 10 subjects and in peritoneal dialysis fluid in 3 out of 10 subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The accumulation of MPAG may be responsible for the poor gastrointestinal tolerance of this drug in dialysis patients and probably limits the maximum dose of MMF that can be tolerated."

Participants are community dwellers with criteria for VCI without dementia or who have had previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Patients may be self-referred or referred from a medical appointment. After confirming the inclusion criteria, a run-in period of 1 month is conducted to access adherence; only after that are subjects randomly assigned (using a computerised program blinded to clinical details) to two groups (intervention group and best practice usual care group). The intervention consists of three physical activity sessions of 60 min each (two supervised and one unsupervised) per week.

            "abstract": "Despite technological advances in radiation therapy (RT) and cancer treatment, patients still experience adverse effects. Proton therapy (PT) has emerged as a valuable RT modality that can improve treatment outcomes. Normal tissue injury is an important determinant of the outcome; therefore, for this review, we analyzed 2 databases: (1) clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and (2) the literature on PT in PubMed, which shows a steady increase in the number of publications. Most studies in PT registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with results available are nonrandomized early phase studies with a relatively small number of patients enrolled. From the larger database of nonrandomized trials, we listed adverse events in specific organs/sites among patients with cancer who are treated with photons and protons to identify critical issues. The present data demonstrate dosimetric advantages of PT with favorable toxicity profiles and form the basis for comparative randomized prospective trials. A comparative analysis of 3 recently completed randomized trials for normal tissue toxicities suggests that for early stage non-small cell lung cancer, no meaningful comparison could be made between stereotactic body RT and stereotactic body PT due to low accrual (NCT01511081). In addition, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, a comparison of intensity modulated RT with passive scattering PT (now largely replaced by spot-scanned intensity modulated PT), PT did not provide any benefit in normal tissue toxicity or locoregional failure over photon therapy. Finally, for locally advanced esophageal cancer, proton beam therapy provided a lower total toxicity burden but did not improve progression-free survival and quality of life (NCT01512589). The purpose of this review is to inform the limitations of current trials looking at protons and photons, considering that advances in technology, physics, and biology are a continuum, and to advocate for future trials geared toward accurate precision RT that need to be viewed as an iterative process in a defined path toward delivering optimal radiation treatment. A foundational understanding of the radiobiologic differences between protons and photons in tumor and normal tissue responses is fundamental to, and necessary for, determining the suitability of a given type of biologically optimized RT to a patient or cohort."

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the use of exercise versus waiting list control groups in the treatment of anxiety and also to assess the benefit of high intensity exercise vs low intensity exercise. Long term follow up scores were also analysed. We included patients who met diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders or had clinically raised anxiety levels on a validated rating scale and performed a subgroup analysis of the outcomes between the two groups.

The standard osmotic agent was, and continues to be dextrose, an agent that is not ideal as it is readily absorbed. The development of icodextrin-containing dialysis fluid has allowed a long dwell time to provide more effective ultrafiltration. The development of a smaller, more easily used automated cycler, led to an increase in the proportion of patients on the cycler as opposed to CAPD. Recently, new cyclers with better teaching tools and ease of use and communication with the training team have come on the market; data on outcomes using these cyclers are not yet available. Peritonitis continues to be a serious complication of PD although improvements in connectology and research on Staphylococcus aureus carriage have decreased peritonitis risk. Peritonitis rates continue to vary tremendously from one program to another, which may be in part due to failure to follow best demonstrated practices in training, care of the l catheter exit site, and prevention of peritonitis. Peritonitis rates should be expressed as episodes per year at risk and as organism-specific rates to allow comparisons from one program to another, from one period to another and from a program to the published literature. The term technique failure is misused in PD. Patients leave PD for a host of reasons including transplantation. Transfer from PD to hemodialysis can be planned and have an excellent outcome or can be delayed or done emergently and have a less optimal outcome. The life plan of the patient with ESRD needs to be not only considered but also periodically revised as circumstances and patient wishes change."

The characteristics of both HD and PD incident patients changed according to current European epidemiology (increasing age and prevalence of diabetes and nephroangiosclerosis). There were significant differences between PD and HD incident populations, PD patients being significantly older and having a higher prevalence of diabetic nephropathy and baseline comorbidities, probably reflecting different inclusion policies. The estimated overall survival of RRT patients in Romania was 90.6% at 1 year [confidence interval (CI) 89.4 - 91.8] and 62.2% at 5 years (CI 59.4 - 65.0). The initial treatment modality did not significantly influence patients' survival. There was no difference in unadjusted technique survival during the first 2 years; afterwards, there was a clear advantage for HD, with more patients being transferred from PD to HD. Several factors seemed to significantly and negatively influence PD patients' survival (Cox regression analysis): male gender, lack of predialysis erythropoietin treatment, and initial comorbidities. Stratified analysis to discover the influence of these factors on patients' survival revealed that HD was associated with an increased risk of death in the younger nondiabetic end-stage renal disease population, regardless of other coexisting comorbid conditions. However, in older patients (>65 years) and in diabetics, regardless of the presence or absence of associated comorbid conditions, there was no significant difference in death rates between HD and PD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We report an impressive quantitative and qualitative development of CAPD in one of the rapidly growing Central and Eastern Europe countries.

We implemented cmRCT in a clinical breast cancer setting by creating UMBRELLA-a large prospective cohort of breast cancer and DCIS patients/survivors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For all participants, clinical data and patient-reported outcomes (PROs, i.e., quality of life, fatigue, anxiety and depression, physical activity, work ability, and cosmetic satisfaction) are being collected at regular time-intervals for a period of 10 years. These data are being used both for observational and randomized studies. For each intervention to be tested against standard care, a subcohort of eligible patients is identified within UMBRELLA. From this subcohort, a random sample of patients is offered the intervention. Their outcomes are compared to the outcomes of patients receiving standard care.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      So far, between October 2013 and July 2016, we have recruited 1308 participants. In this period, 1308/1486 (88%) patients who were invited for participation in UMBRELLA consented to cohort participation. Of these patients, 1138 (87%) gave broad consent for randomization to future interventions. Return rate for PROs at baseline were 80%, and varied from 67 to 74% during follow-up. Several observational studies-and the first randomized intervention study-are currently ongoing.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results from UMBRELLA show that this novel study design is feasible and acceptable to patients in a clinical breast cancer setting. We invite researchers who are interested in conducting randomized or observational studies within the UMBRELLA cohort to contact the UMBRELLA scientific advisory board."

            "abstract": "1. Leptin is thought to be an inhibitor of appetite. As the kidney helps clear several polypeptide hormones, plasma leptin may accumulate in end-stage renal disease. 2. Plasma immunoreactive leptin was measured in four groups of subjects: haemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and renal transplant patients and a group of healthy controls. Leptin was also measured before and after a single dialysis session. 3. There was a strong correlation between plasma immunoreactive leptin and body mass index in all groups except female haemodialysis patients. Leptin was higher in females than in males in all groups when controlled for body mass index. Mean plasma leptin [mean (SD)] was significantly higher in all renal groups [haemodialysis, 15.1 (3.6) ng/ml; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, 25.4 (4.3) ng/ml; transplants, 11.6 (2.6) ng/ml] compared with controls [5.3 (2.3) ng/ml]. There was a significant difference in the regression equations relating leptin and body mass index (dialysis > transplants > controls), even when controlled for gender. Leptin correlated modestly with serum creatinine in non-dialysis subjects. Plasma leptin immunoreactivity was slightly reduced by haemodialysis, but post-dialysis leptin was still significantly higher than that found in controls. 4. Chromatographic characterization of the high level of leptin immunoreactivity found in haemodialysis subjects showed a single elution peak corresponding to that of the highly purified human leptin standard. 5. In conclusion, leptin is higher than expected for body mass index in end-stage renal disease. Hyperleptinaemia could contribute to the anorexia and poor nutritional status commonly seen in renal failure."

This study aimed to assess the quality and variability in outcome reporting in immunosuppression trials following renal transplantation. All randomized controlled trials comparing immunosuppressive interventions in renal transplant recipients published over a 5-year period were included. Outcomes reported in these studies were extracted, along with data regarding completeness of reporting and whether a clear definition of the method used to measure the outcome was provided. A total of 4760 outcomes were identified from 182 studies. Overall, 90.3% outcomes were completely reported; the remainder had missing data that would preclude use in meta-analysis; 31.5% manuscripts did not define a primary endpoint. Efficacy outcomes were more likely to be clearly defined than safety outcomes (OR: 0.022, P<.001) or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) (OR: 0.014, P<.001). PROMs were reported in less than half of manuscripts, and only five reported quality-of-life data using a validated tool. There was significant variability in the way that common efficacy and safety outcomes were defined. Variability in the way that endpoints are selected and reported in trials in renal transplantation makes interpretation and comparison between studies difficult."

            "abstract": "Patients on dialysis and recipients of renal transplants have higher mortality than individuals without kidney disease. In this study we evaluated the possible impact of dialysis therapy before transplantation on patient survival after the transplant. This analysis includes all of the patients who received a cadaveric renal transplant at The Ohio State University from 1984 to 1991 and who remained alive with functioning grafts for at least six months after the transplant (N = 523). After a follow-up of 84 +/- 14 months, 28% of the patients died and 23% lost their grafts. By multivariate analysis, reduced patient survival (censored at the time of graft loss) correlated with these pre-transplant variables: Older age (P < 0.0001), the presence of diabetes (P = 0.0002), smoking (P = 0.009), and the length of time on dialysis (P = 0.0002). Thus, 7% of patients who were never dialyzed, 23% of those dialyzed for less than three years, and 44% of patients dialyzed for > or = three years died post-transplant. By Cox regression, patient survival months correlated with time on dialysis pre-transplant (P = 0.0003). The type of dialysis (CAPD vs. hemodialysis) did not correlate with patient survival. Graft survival, censored for patient death, did not correlate with any of these pre-transplant variables. The relationship between time on dialysis and patient mortality is due to at least two factors: (1) transplant recipients who had dialysis for > or = 3 years had higher mortality due to infections (22%) than those who had dialysis for < 3 years (3%, P = 0.01 by X2); and (2) increasing time on dialysis increases the prevalence of both left ventricular hypertrophy (P = 0.008) and cardiomegaly (P = 0.004), and these relationships are statistically independent of other factors that also correlate with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, increased time on dialysis prior to renal transplantation is associated with decreased survival of transplant recipients."

An economic model [Birmingham Sensitivity Analysis paediatrics (BSAp)] was produced based on an adaptation of a model previously developed for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of immunosuppressants in adults following renal transplant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For the addition of basiliximab, one unpublished paediatric randomised control trial (RCT), reported that the addition of basiliximab to tacrolimus-based triple therapy (BTAS) failed to significantly improve 6-month biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft function, graft loss and all-cause mortality. No significant difference between groups was seen in 6-month or 1-year or longer graft loss, all-cause mortality and side-effects. In a meta-analysis of adult RCTs, the addition of basiliximab to a ciclosporin, azathioprine and steroid regimen (CAS) significantly reduced short-term BPAR. There was no significant difference in short- or long-term graft loss, all-cause mortality or side-effects. One adult RCT was included for the addition of daclizumab to CAS, which reported reduced 1-year BPAR, although no difference between groups was seen in either 1- or 3-year graft loss, all-cause mortality and side-effects. For tacrolimus versus ciclosporin, one unpublished paediatric RCT found that a regimen of tacrolimus, azathioprine and a steroid (TAS) reduced 6-month BPAR and improved graft function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR)] compared with CAS. This improvement in BPAR with tacrolimus was as shown in the meta-analysis of adult RCTs. There was evidence, particularly in children, that in comparison with ciclosporin, tacrolimus may reduce long-term graft loss, although there is no benefit on total mortality. The total level of withdrawal in children was reduced in children receiving tacrolimus. Adult RCTs showed an increase in post-transplant diabetes mellitus with tacrolimus. For MMF versus azathioprine, a meta-analysis of adult RCTs showed MMF [regimen of ciclosporin, MMF and a steroid (CMS)] to reduce 1-year BPAR compared with azathioprine (CAS). There was evidence, particularly in children, that in comparison with azathioprine, tacrolimus may reduce long-term graft loss, although there is no benefit on total mortality. There was an increase in the level of cytomegalovirus infection with MMF, although the overall level of withdrawal due to adverse events was not different to that of azathioprine-treated adults. No study comparing MPS with azathioprine (CAS) was identified. In an adult RCT comparing MMF with MPS, there was no significant difference between groups in 1-year efficacy or side-effects. One unpublished paediatric RCT assessed the addition of sirolimus to CAS. BPAR, graft loss and all-cause mortality were not reported. In two adult RCTs, compared with azathioprine, sirolimus reduced 1-year BPAR, reduced graft function (as assessed by an increased serum creatinine) and increased the level of hyperlipidaemia. No significant differences were seen in other efficacy and side-effect outcomes. On an adult RCT comparing sirolimus with ciclosporin, there were no significant differences between groups in 1-year efficacy or side-effects with the exception of an increased level of hyperlipidaemia with sirolimus substitution. Both the assessment group and drug companies assessed the cost-effectiveness of the newer renal immunosuppressants currently licensed in children using an adaptation (BSAp) of the Birmingham Sensitivity Analysis (BSA) model. This model is based on a 10-year extrapolation of 1-year BPAR results sourced from paediatric RCTs or adult RCTs (where paediatric RCTs were not available). The addition of basiliximab and that of daclizumab to CAS was found to increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and decreased overall costs, a finding that was robust to sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of replacing ciclosporin with tacrolimus was highly sensitive to the selection of the hazard ratio for graft loss from acute rejection, dialysis costs and the incorporation (or not) of side-effects. The ICERs for tacrolimus versus ciclosporin ranged from about 46,000 pounds/QALY to about 146,000 pounds/QALY. Although sensitive to varying the hazard ratio for graft loss with acute rejection, the ICER for replacing azathioprine with MMF remained in excess of 55,000 pounds/QALY.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In general, compared with a regimen of ciclosporin, azathioprine and steroid, the newer immunosuppressive agents consistently reduced the incidence of short-term biopsy-proven acute rejection. However, evidence of the impact on side-effects, long-term graft loss, compliance and overall health-related quality of life is limited. Cost-effectiveness was estimated based on the relationship between short-term acute rejection levels from RCTs and long-term graft loss. Both the addition of daclizumab and that of basiliximab were found to be dominant strategies, that is, regarding cost savings and increased QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin was highly sensitive to key model parameter values and therefore may well be a cost-effective strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of MMF compared with azathioprine, although also sensitive to model parameter, was unattractive. There is a particular need for RCTs to assess the use of MMF, MPS and daclizumab for renal transplantation in children where no such evidence currently exists. Future comparative studies need to report not only on the impact of the newer immunosuppressants on short- and long-term clinical outcomes but also on side-effects, compliance, healthcare resource, costs and health-related quality of life."

A random-effects model was used to analyse clinical effectiveness data (odds ratios for binary data and mean differences for continuous data). Network meta-analyses were undertaken within a Bayesian framework. A new discrete time-state transition economic model (semi-Markov) was developed, with acute rejection, graft function (GRF) and new-onset diabetes mellitus used to extrapolate graft survival. Recipients were assumed to be in one of three health states: functioning graft, graft loss or death.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of variable quality, were included. For induction therapy, no treatment appeared more effective than another in reducing graft loss or mortality.

For maintenance therapy, no treatment was better for all outcomes and no treatment appeared most effective at reducing graft loss.

Non-acupoints are generally recommended but the definite locations should be identified with caution. For studies using single sham acupoints on hands or legs, it is suggested to apply identical acupressure devices on the same acupoint as in the active intervention without any stimulation.

            "abstract": "A prospective randomized double-blind study comprising 118 patients was performed to evaluate the effects of doxycycline as a prophylactic antimicrobial in elective colonic surgery. Fifty-eight patients were treated and 60 were controls. 200 mg of active substance or placebo was given 4-6 hours before operation and 100 mg daily for the next five postoperative days. Levels of doxycycline in serum and tissues were determined and related to the MIC-values of the contaminants. A significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis, intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%). The positive effects were most pronounced in the non-contaminated cases, and especially in the cases with negative wound culture at operation. In order to evaluate the effect of prophylaxis in clinical routine an open study comprising 182 patients was carried out. In the group of patients receiving adequate prophylaxis (159 patients) the abdominal wound sepsis rate was 8.1%. 11 other patients who had received doxycycline preoperatively for some time because of intra-abdominal infection developed wound sepsis in 63.4%. In 12 patients where incomplete or no prophylaxis was given, the wound sepsis rate was 33.2%. The frequency of abdominal septic complications did not differ between non-contaminated, 10.9%, and contaminated operations, 13.8%, partly because of the topical application of ampicillin in some of the patients belonging to the latter category. Preoperative treatment with doxycycline because of some intra-abdominal was evidently the single risk factor associated with a high septic complication rate. No adverse ecological effects were seen during the 19 months study."

            "abstract": "In patients with diabetic renal failure plasma advanced glycosylation end-products (AGE) levels are reported to be elevated and dialyzer of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is usually used with a high glucose concentration. Here, an immunohistochemical study on human AGE accumulation in vascular beds and peritonea of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) or those on CAPD was undertaken. Further, the influence of aging was studied using AGE-specific monoclonal antibody. 1. AGE accumulation was observed in radial arterial walls (from vascular intima to smooth muscle layer) of diabetic patients with CRF. Even in some non-diabetic patients with CRF (n = 3/6), especially in those with a long history of CRF and dialysis treatment, similar positive staining was seen in vascular walls. No AGE staining was observed in any renal tissue of age-matched control subjects including tissue from patients with acute renal failure. 2. Although AGE accumulation was not seen in the peritonea of CRF patients with no prior CAPD therapy, it was seen in the mesothelial layers and in adjacent coarse connective tissues of peritonea from patients on CAPD (n = 6), even from as early as only 3 months of CAPD therapy. 3. AGE accumulation was observed in the vascular bed of the non-diabetic aged kidney with normal function, but not in that of the young kidney. Thus, AGE accumulation in the vascular bed may depend on the degree and term of renal impairment and on aging in addition to diabetes. AGE accumulation in the peritonea became positive following CAPD treatment, indicating that it might affect the efficiency of CAPD."

            "abstract": "Women with advanced breast cancer often develop bone metastases that are associated with skeletal-related events (SREs), which reduce quality of life and increase the risk of death. Because patients who experience one SRE are more likely to experience subsequent events, the goal of therapy is to preserve quality of life by delaying the onset of the first SRE and reducing the incidence of subsequent SREs. Bisphosphonates are used for clinical management of malignant bone disease, and data suggest that early treatment (e.g., before bone pain) may confer additional clinical benefit. Furthermore, data from subsets of zoledronic acid trials suggest that long-term bisphosphonate therapy may provide sustained clinical benefit throughout the disease course. Bisphosphonates are generally safe and well tolerated; adverse events are more often mild and transient. Zoledronic acid has proven efficacy for reducing risk of SREs, and ongoing studies are under way to evaluate customized treatment schedules."

            "abstract": "Studies of outcomes associated with dialysis therapies have yielded conflicting results. Bloembergen et al showed that prevalent patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) had a 19% higher mortality risk than hemodialysis patients, and Fenton et al, analyzing Canadian incident patients, found a 27% lower risk. Attempting to reconcile these differences, we evaluated incident Medicare patients (99,048 on hemodialysis, 18,110 on CAPD/CCPD) from 1994 through 1996, following up to June 30, 1997. Patients were followed to transplantation, death, loss to follow-up, 60 days after modality change, or end of the study period. For each 3-month survival period, we used an interval Poisson regression to compare death rates, adjusting for age, gender, race, and primary renal diagnosis. A Cox regression was used to evaluate cause-specific mortality, and proportionality was addressed in both regressions by separating diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The Poisson regressions showed CAPD/CCPD to have outcomes comparable with or significantly better than hemodialysis, although results varied over time. The Cox regression found a lower mortality risk in nondiabetic CAPD/CCPD patients (women younger than 55 years: risk ratio [RR] = 0. 61; Cl, 0.59 to 0.66; women age 55 years or older: RR = 0.87; Cl, 0. 84 to 0.91; men younger than 55 years: RR = 0.72; Cl, 0.67 to 0.77; men age 55 years or older: RR = 0.87; Cl, 0.83 to 0.92) and in diabetic CAPD/CCPD patients younger than 55 (women: RR = 0.88; Cl, 0. 82 to 0.94; men: RR = 0.86; Cl, 0.81 to 0.92). The risk of all-cause death for female diabetics 55 years of age and older, in contrast, was 1.21 (Cl, 1.17 to 1.24) for CAPD/CCPD, and in cause-specific analyses, these patients had a significantly higher risk of infectious death. We conclude that, overall, within the first 2 years of therapy, short-term CAPD/CCPD appears to be associated with superior outcomes compared with hemodialysis. It also appears that patients on the two therapies have different mortality patterns over time, a nonproportionality that makes survival analyses vulnerable to the length of follow-up. Further investigation is needed to evaluate both the potential explanations for these findings and the use of more advanced statistical methods in the analysis of mortality rates associated with these dialytic therapies."

Furthermore, they have been exposed to prolonged immunosuppression.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The present study aimed to establish the clinical outcomes of patients returning to peritoneal dialysis (PD) with failing allografts [survival, technique survival, longitudinal residual renal function (Kt/V(R)), peritoneal membrane function (solute transport), and plasma albumin] and to compare those outcomes with outcomes in new, contemporary patients.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      The study was conducted in a single center where prospective collection of data now known to be important in determining outcome on peritoneal dialysis (age, comorbidity, albumin, Kt/V(R), and solute transport) has been performed since 1989.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      All patients commencing PD between 1989 and 2001 after failure of an allograft that had functioned for more than 6 months were identified. Outcomes in that group were compared to outcomes in all new PD patients and in all dialysis patients with failed grafts who were returning to hemodialysis (HD) in the same period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study identified 45 patients with failed allografts: 28 were commencing PD treatment, and 17 were commencing HD treatment.Those patients were significantly younger than the 469 new patients commencing PD [FailedTx-->PD 41.2 years, FailedTx-->HD 38.9 years, NewPD 54.7 years; analysis of variance (ANOVA): p < 0.001]. We saw no significant difference in the survival of failed transplant patients commencing PD as compared with those commencing HD (log rank: p = 0.11). Kaplan-Meier plots of patient survival were better for failed transplant patients as compared with all new PD patients. When corrected using Cox regression, the survival advantage was seen to be due to age and comorbidity at start of PD. Pure technique failure (excluding death) was not different between the groups. Compared with all new PD patients, patients with failed allografts had similar longitudinal plasma albumin and a tendency toward an earlier increase in solute transport, but a more rapid loss of Kt/V(R), (p < 0.05 at 6-48 months).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Peritoneal dialysis would appear to be a good option for patients with failing allografts. Comorbidity is the predominant determinant of survival. That finding underlines the need for attention to factors that might prevent accrual of cardiovascular risk during the post-transplantation period. The earlier loss of Kt/V(R) in those patients might be prevented by developing strategies of continued immunosuppression after commencement of dialysis, although infection risk is an important issue."

In 22 patients (15%), PD was started after RT. Residual renal function was not significantly different between patients who started PD as their first option and those who started after RT, either at baseline or after 1 year on PD. Baseline dialysate-to-plasma creatinine was also similar between those groups. Transfer from HD was the single significant predictor of baseline anuria [odds ratio (OR): 6.3; p < 0.001).

One hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to treatment with cyclosporine and prednisone, and 149 to control immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine and prednisone, with or without antilymphocyte globulin). At three years graft survival was 69 percent in the cyclosporine-treated patients and 58 percent in the controls (P = 0.05). The number of episodes of graft rejection was similar in the two groups, but the severity of rejection was significantly worse among the controls. Patients survival after three years was 90 percent in the cyclosporine group and 82 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Acute tubular necrosis was an important risk factor for graft loss in both groups. Risk factors for death included diabetes and older age of the recipient. Renal function as indicated by the serum creatinine concentration or creatinine clearance was poorer in the cyclosporine-treated patients than in the controls, but has remained stable in both groups since the sixth month after transplantation. We conclude that, among recipients of cadaveric renal transplants, those treated with cyclosporine, despite having poorer (but stable) renal function, have better graft and patient survival at three years than those treated with alternative forms of immunosuppressive therapy."

            "abstract": "The past decade has seen substantial improvements in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) outcomes, especially mortality, in the United States. Incidence rates for treated ESRD have doubled for most age groups, probably because of improved survival among high-risk populations, such as patients with diabetes and hypertension. The ESRD patient population is becoming older and has a greater incidence of diabetes because of changes in the types of patients starting treatment. The number of patients added to the waiting list each year for transplants has increased dramatically, whereas the number of transplantations performed annually has remained relatively constant. Although transplantation is consequently less available than before, transplant survival, both of the patient and the graft, has improved dramatically. Length of stay for hospitalizations has decreased. Both dialysis mortality and all ESRD mortality have decreased. It is important to monitor such statistics to try and modify adverse trends in outcomes for patients with ESRD. The ability to monitor patient outcomes through national databases has improved greatly during the last decade. Large-scale population-based studies of practices and outcomes for patients with ESRD offer a potent addition to the previously available arsenal of research tools, which was previously dominated by studies from single or few institutions and more expensive randomized clinical trials."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPrevious studies have found inconsistent associations between pre-transplant dialysis modality and subsequent post-transplant survival. We aimed to examine this relationship using the instrumental variable method and to compare the results with standard Cox regression.\n## METHODS\nWe included 29 088 patients (age >20 years) from 16 European national or regional renal registries who received a first kidney transplant between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2008 and were on dialysis before transplantation for a period between 90 days and 10 years. Standard multivariable Cox regression examined the association of individually assigned pre-transplant dialysis modality with post-transplant patient and graft survival. To decrease confounding-by-indication through unmeasured factors, we applied the instrumental variable method that used the case-mix adjusted centre percentage of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as predictor variable.\n## RESULTS\nStandard analyses adjusted for age, sex, primary renal disease, donor type, duration of dialysis, year of transplantation and country suggested that PD before transplantation was associated with better patient [hazard ratio, HR (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.76-0.91)] and graft survival (HR (95% CI) 0.90 (0.84-0.96)) when compared with haemodialysis (HD). In contrast, the instrumental variable analysis showed that a 10% increase in the case-mix adjusted centre percentage of patients on PD was neither associated with post-transplant patient survival [HR (95% CI = 1.00 (0.97-1.04)] nor with graft survival [HR (95% CI) = 1.01 (0.98-1.04)].\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe instrumental variable method failed to confirm the associations found in standard Cox regression between pre-transplant dialysis modality and patient and graft survival after transplantation. The lack of association in instrumental variable analysis may be due to better control of residual confounding.\n"

If the patient has not yet experienced the treatments, then the information provided regarding the options plays a crucial role in the patient's choice. The authors interviewed 43 people who are intimately involved with the treatments for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (ten physicians, 11 nurses, and 22 patients) with a view to determining what information needs to be considered when choosing between the various treatment options for this illness. They compared the three groups based on the items obtained from the interviews to determine whether the inclusion of patients in the process changed the content of the treatment descriptions. They were also interested in determining whether the use of the frequency with which an item is mentioned in the interviews is a valid measure of its relative importance to other items. 1,269 relevant items were obtained from the interviews and categorized into 51 areas of concern (subject domains). The health professionals (physicians and nurses) were found to have mentioned seven subject domains more often than the patients, and no domain was mentioned more often by the patients than by the health professionals. The frequency that an item was mentioned was correlated (r = 0.55) with direct measures of its importance. These results imply that careful consultation with health professionals to determine the content of a decision analysis or informational materials that address treatment choice is sufficient to address patient concerns and that items can be chosen for inclusion based on the relative frequencies with which they are mentioned."

As in drug trials, the use of PROs in device evaluation has several methodological challenges, ranging from general concerns about interpretation, to more specific issues related to study design and regulatory approval (use of PROs as primary end points, incorporation in labeling, and product promotion). Successful approaches for integrating PROs into device evaluation trials include the careful selection of appropriate, interpretable PRO end points, accounting for possible confounding factors, and the use of alternatives to placebo-controlled trial designs, such as single-arm pre-post, observational, and registry studies, when the use of placebo control groups is not feasible.

Where possible, meta-analyses were performed. Risk ratio (RRs) or hazard ratio (HRs) were reported for dichotomous outcomes or lymphoedema incidence, and mean differences (MDs) for range of motion and patient-reported outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Ten trials involving 1205 participants were included. The duration of patient follow-up ranged from 2 days to 2 years after the intervention. Overall, the quality of the evidence generated by these trials was low, due to risk of bias in the included trials and inconsistency in the results. Manual lymph drainageIn total, four studies used manual lymph drainage (MLD) in combination with usual care or other interventions. In one study, lymphoedema incidence was lower in patients receiving MLD and usual care (consisting of standard education or exercise, or both) compared to usual care alone. A second study reported no difference in lymphoedema incidence when MLD was combined with physiotherapy and education compared to physiotherapy alone. Two other studies combining MLD with compression and scar massage or exercise observed a reduction in lymphoedema incidence compared to education only, although this was not significant in one of the studies. Two out of the four studies reported on shoulder mobility where MLD combined with exercise gave better shoulder mobility for lateral arm movement (shoulder abduction) and forward flexion in the first weeks after breast cancer surgery, compared to education only (mean difference for abduction 22°; 95% confidence interval (CI) 14 to 30; mean difference for forward flexion 14°; 95% CI 7 to 22). Two of the studies on MLD reported on pain, with inconsistent results. Results on HRQoL in two studies on MLD were also contradictory. Exercise: early versus delayed start of shoulder mobilising exercisesThree studies examined early versus late start of postoperative shoulder exercises. The pooled relative risk of lymphoedema after an early start of exercises was 1.69 (95% CI 0.94 to 3.01, 3 studies, 378 participants). Shoulder forward flexion was better at one and six months follow-up for participants who started early with mobilisation exercises compared to a delayed start (two studies), but no meta-analysis could be performed due to statistical heterogeneity. There was no difference in shoulder mobility or self-reported shoulder disability at 12 months follow-up (one study). One study evaluated HRQoL and reported difference at one year follow-up (mean difference 1.6 points, 95% CI -2.14 to 5.34, on the Trial Outcome Index of the FACT-B). Two studies collected data on wound drainage volumes and only one study reported higher wound drainage volumes in the early exercise group. Exercise: resistance trainingTwo studies compared progressive resistance training to restricted activity. Resistance training after breast cancer treatment did not increase the risk of developing lymphoedema (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13, two studies, 358 participants) provided that symptoms are monitored and treated immediately if they occur. One out of the two studies measured pain where participants in the resistance training group reported pain more often at three months and six months compared to the control group. One study reported HRQoL and found no significant difference between the groups. Patient education, monitoring and early interventionOne study investigated the effects of a comprehensive outpatient follow-up programme, consisting of patient education, exercise, monitoring of lymphoedema symptoms and early intervention for lymphoedema, compared to education alone. Lymphoedema incidence was lower in the comprehensive outpatient follow-up programme (at any time point) compared to education alone (65 people). Participants in the outpatient follow-up programme had a significantly faster recovery of shoulder abduction compared to the education alone group.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on the current available evidence, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions containing MLD. The evidence does not indicate a higher risk of lymphoedema when starting shoulder-mobilising exercises early after surgery compared to a delayed start (i.e. seven days after surgery). Shoulder mobility (that is, lateral arm movements and forward flexion) is better in the short term when starting shoulder exercises earlier compared to later. The evidence suggests that progressive resistance exercise therapy does not increase the risk of developing lymphoedema, provided that symptoms are closely monitored and adequately treated if they occur.Given the degree of heterogeneity encountered, limited precision, and the risk of bias across the included studies, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution."

            "title": "Pretransplant peritoneal dialysis and graft thrombosis following pediatric kidney transplantation: a NAPRTCS report.",
            "abstract": "Graft thrombosis is a common cause of graft failure in pediatric renal transplantation. Several previous studies, including a North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS) review of pretransplant dialysis status and graft outcomes, have described a potential correlation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and graft thrombosis. This issue is of particular concern for pediatric transplant programs as more than 65% of children with end stage renal disease are treated with PD. We reviewed 7247 pediatric renal transplants performed between 1987 and 2001. Thrombosis was the cause of graft loss in 2.7% (199) of all the transplants performed. Among failed transplants, thrombosis was the third most common cause of graft loss in both index (11.6%) and subsequent transplants (14.5%). Thrombosis becomes the most common cause of graft failure (21%, 61/294) if one looks at transplants in the later cohort, from 1996 to 2001. This change is primarily because of a decrease in the incidence of acute rejection. In the PD group, 3.4% of all grafts were lost as a result of thrombosis. This compares with 1.9% in the hemodialysis group, 2.4% in the pre-emptive transplant group, and 4.1% among patients who received both dialysis modalities. There was a statistically significant difference in thrombosis failure risk in the different dialysis groups (p = 0.005) with those who received only peritoneal dialysis having the highest risk. Additional significant risk factors for graft thrombosis included; cadaver donor source (p < 0.001), cold ischemia time >24 h (p < 0.001), history of prior transplant (p < 0.001), donor age <6 yr (p < 0.001), and >5 pretransplant blood transfusions (p = 0.02). Using stepwise proportional hazards modeling, only pretransplant peritoneal dialysis, >24 h cold ischemia time, prior transplant, and donor age <6 yr were simultaneously associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. We conclude that pretransplant PD is associated with an increased risk of graft thrombosis. Special precautions should be undertaken in pediatric renal transplant patients who have received PD, especially infants and young children."

We still found low-quality evidence that manual therapy did not benefit the patients in the global perceived effect (RD: 0.12 [95%CI -0.12 to 0.36]), and in terms of quality of life. In addition, the risks of patients in the manual therapy group was 0.13 times higher than that in the controls (RD: 0.13 [95%CI -0.05 to 0.31]) in the low-quality evidence studies.

Greater understanding of the association between symptom and/or functioning scales was developed by identifying physical, psychological, and gastrointestinal clusters.

Compared to the general population, patients with endstage renal failure experienced a lower quality of life. Many factors contributed to this, but uncertainty about the future and lack of energy emerged as key components. Transplant recipients reported better HRQOL than dialysis patients, they reported fewer problems with physical mobility, self-care, social and personal relationships and usual activities. They also experienced significantly less distress, while dialysis patients reported problems with depression, anxiety, pain and uncertainty about the future.

The present retrospective study reports our experience with PP in this respect over a 5 year period. Twenty-three chronic hemodialysis patients with circulating panel reactive antibodies (> or = 50%) and previous kidney graft rejections were treated with 12 PP each. In addition to this, immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone were administered on the first day of PP and after tapering continued until transplantation. HLA-antibodies, as measured by the panel reactive antibodies and the antibody titer, decreased from about 70% to 30% (p < 0.001) and 5 steps of titerdilution, respectively with PP and immunosuppressive drugs; Twenty-two patients were transplanted with cadaveric grafts. Eight grafts were lost due to irreversible rejection, and one due to the patient's death 2 months after transplantation. The cumulative five-year graft survival at the time of follow-up was 59%. Adequate kidney function (serum creatinine mean 150 mumol/l) was observed in all grafts (n = 3) still functioning 60 months posttransplant. We conclude that pretransplantation plasmapheresis together with immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide and prednisolone) is useful in the removal of HLA antibodies in immunized patients awaiting kidney transplantation.

Application of appropriate methods is needed to make valid inferences when such treatment or selection effects are present.

The primary causes of renal disease were not significantly different in men and women except for glomerulonephritis, which was twice as common in men as in women. Life-table analysis showed that the younger transplant recipients had the highest survival rate, but that the prognosis was almost as good among the much older patients who received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Probably because they tended to be younger and their renal disease was caused by less threatening conditions, men survived longer than women. The survival rates were significantly related to the primary cause of the renal disease; patients with diabetes or systemic disease had the worst prognosis. Overall, these results compare well with those obtained in major university centres."

The first and most productive decade was characterized by case series, each with a small number of patients. These trials used nonstandardized clinical observation as outcomes and seldom had a comparison group. The crossover design became widely used to examine acute psychiatric treatments in the 1950s and 1960s. Although this strategy provided comparison data, it introduced problems in study implementation and interpretation. In 1962, the US Food and Drug Administration began to require \"substantial evidence of effectiveness from adequate and well-controlled studies.\" Subsequent decades saw remarkable advances in clinical trial design, assessment, and statistical analyses. Standardized instruments were developed and parallel groups, double-blinding, and placebo controls became the benchmark. Sample sizes increased and data analytic procedures were developed that could accommodate the problems of attrition. Randomized withdrawal designs were introduced in the 1970s to examine maintenance therapies. Ethical principles for research became codified in the United States at that time. A wave of regulatory approvals of novel antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants came in the 1980s and 1990s, each based on data from randomized double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

            "abstract": "A total of 173 patients who received live donor or cadaveric primary or secondary renal transplants at five British hospitals were entered into a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial of equine antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) administered prophylactically to prevent rejection. The ALG was prepared in the early 1970s and used cultured human lymphoblasts as antigen. Following transplantation all patients were treated with a standard immunosuppressant regimen of steroids and azathioprine and, in addition, were given either 30 mg/kg ALG or placebo daily for 10 days by intravenous infusion. In comparison with more recently produced materials, the ALG employed in this study was of moderate potency in prolonging skin graft survival in monkeys. Primary graft failure occurred in 27 patients (15/86 ALG and 12/87 placebo). At three to five years after transplantation 50 of the remaining patients had died, almost all from diseases relating to their renal condition, and 25 more had suffered complete graft failure. No significant differences were found between patients treated with ALG and placebo in the numbers with functioning grafts during the 3 years following transplantation, in the time between transplantation and the first rejection episode, or in the number of episodes during the first six months after transplantation. This applied whether live or cadaveric grafts were employed. Within the first 6 months of operation, infection was given as a major contributory cause of death in 12 patients treated with ALG and in 5 who received placebo (P greater than 0.1). Infections were also slightly more common during the two weeks following transplantation in those receiving ALG (13/86 ALG, 10/87 placebo). As expected, graft survival was significantly better in patients who received live donor grafts (P = 0.001) and in patients with the least donor-recipient histocompatibility mismatches (P = 0.008). The results of this multicenter trial show no therapeutic benefit to renal graft recipients from the administration of ALG, and suggest that the risks of fatal infection may have been aggravated. Use of such equine ALG in similar dose regimens is therefore, not, justified in renal transplantation, especially if some part of the apparent effects on fatal infections is real. It is stressed that these findings are relevant only to the equine ALG used in this study, which was raised with cultured human lymphoblasts as the antigen, and to ALG prepared in a similar way and of similar potency. It should not be inferred that these results are applicable to ALG prepared in other ways."

Concerning graft survival, only preemptive transplantation had a significant impact, being associated to a decreased risk of graft failure (RR 0.46, P= 0.005). Conclusion.

Patient-specific factors were varied systematically in written case vignettes, which were mailed to physician and nonphysician practitioners who treated ESRD patients in Canada and Michigan. Respondents were asked to indicate for each vignette: a preferred treatment and all other acceptable treatments. Overall patterns of choice were analyzed; the clear preferences shown for certain treatment modalities (e.g., for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis over home hemodialysis) have planning implications. The apparent receptivity to new ESRD treatments may affect the success of government policies aimed at encouraging greater use of home hemodialysis. The impact of each patient-specific variable on treatment choice was also examined. Factors such as the patient's age proved to be major determinants both of the preferred treatment modalities and of the number of alternatives considered acceptable. The research method allowed areas of medical consensus to be distinguished from those 'grey areas' in which patient characteristics alone could not explain treatment selection.

The objective of the present analysis is to consider the cost-effectiveness of MP relative to SCS based on clinical data from this Brazilian cohort. A decision tree model was constructed to simulate a population of 1000 kidney transplant recipients based on data derived from this Brazilian multicenter clinical trial. The model accounts for different health state utilities to estimate the cost-effectiveness of deceased donor kidney transplantation in Brazil comparing 2 kidney preservation methods: MP and SCS. The model accounts for 3 possible graft outcomes at 1 year post-transplantation: success (an immediate functioning kidney), failure (primary nonfunction requiring a return to dialysis), or DGF 1 year post-transplant. MP provided 612 total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.61 QALYs per patient) as compared to SCS (553 total QALYs, 0.55 QALYs per patient). MP was cost effective relative to SCS (US$22,117/QALY, R$70,606/QALY). The use of MP also resulted in more functioning grafts than SCS (821 vs 787), leading to a cost per functioning graft of US$38,033 (R$121,417). In conclusion, this analysis indicates that, despite the initial added cost associated with MP, the use of MP results in more functioning grafts (821 vs 787) and higher patient quality of life relative to SCS in Brazil."

One traditional treatment approach, the long-term use of opiate medications, has recently come under intense scrutiny for problems with complications, diversion, abuse, addiction, and lack of efficacy. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized that overprescribing opiates has enabled an overdose crisis, and written guidelines that are intended to limit their use.

The last 10 years has brought tremendous advances in the field of neuromodulation. Today, several treatment modalities exist for SCS requiring the physician to be able to critically evaluate and interpret the literature and determine which modality has the strongest evidence. When evaluating clinical trial data of patients with chronic back pain, emphasis must be placed on well designed, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up producing level I evidence.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) provides significant symptomatic benefit for patients with intermittent claudication (IC), it remains an underutilized tool. Widespread implementation of SET is restricted by lack of facilities and funding. Structured home-based exercise therapy (HBET) with an observation component (e.g., exercise logbooks, pedometers) and just walking advice (WA) are alternatives to SET. This is the second update of a review first published in 2006.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective was to provide an accurate overview of studies evaluating effects of SET programs, HBET programs, and WA on maximal treadmill walking distance or time (MWD/T) for patients with IC. Secondary objectives were to evaluate effects of SET, HBET, and WA on pain-free treadmill walking distance or time (PFWD/T), quality of life, and self-reported functional impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (December 16, 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, Issue 11). We searched the reference lists of relevant studies identified through searches for other potential trials. We applied no restriction on language of publication.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials comparing SET programs with HBET programs and WA in participants with IC. We excluded studies in which control groups did not receive exercise or walking advice (maintained normal physical activity). We also excluded studies comparing exercise with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bypass surgery, or drug therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Three review authors (DH, HF, and LG) independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trials for risk of bias. Two other review authors (MvdH and JT) confirmed the suitability and methodological quality of trials. For all continuous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants, mean outcome, and standard deviation for each treatment group through the follow-up period, if available. We extracted Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 outcomes to assess quality of life, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire outcomes to assess self-reported functional impairment. As investigators used different scales to present results of walking distance and time, we standardized reported data to effect sizes to enable calculation of an overall standardized mean difference (SMD). We obtained summary estimates for all outcome measures using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      For this update, we included seven additional studies, making a total of 21 included studies, which involved a total of 1400 participants: 635 received SET, 320 received HBET, and 445 received WA. In general, SET and HBET programs consisted of three exercise sessions per week. Follow-up ranged from six weeks to two years. Most trials used a treadmill walking test to investigate effects of exercise therapy on walking capacity. However, two trials assessed only quality of life, functional impairment, and/or walking behavior (i.e., daily steps measured by pedometer). The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials were small with respect to numbers of participants, ranging from 20 to 304.SET groups showed clear improvement in MWD/T compared with HBET and WA groups, with overall SMDs at three months of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.62; P = 0.004; moderate-quality evidence) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; P < 0.00001; high-quality evidence), respectively. This translates to differences in increased MWD of approximately 120 and 210 meters in favor of SET groups. Data show improvements for up to six and 12 months, respectively. The HBET group did not show improvement in MWD/T compared with the WA group (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.05; P = 0.43; moderate-quality evidence).Compared with HBET, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T but had no effect on quality of life parameters nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with WA, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life parameters (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and HBET had no effect.Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to SET was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with HBET. Only limited adherence data were available for WA groups.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that SET provides an important benefit for treadmill-measured walking distance (MWD and PFWD) compared with HBET and WA, respectively. Although its clinical relevance has not been definitively demonstrated, this benefit translates to increased MWD of 120 and 210 meters after three months in SET groups. These increased walking distances are likely to have a positive impact on the lives of patients with IC. Data provide no clear evidence of a difference between HBET and WA. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life parameters nor in self-reported functional impairment between SET and HBET. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring SET over WA, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. Future studies should focus on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up."

            "abstract": "Sclerosing peritonitis (SP) is an uncommon but serious complication of CAPD with various suggested etiology. We have documented 14 cases of SP in 18 CAPD patients using chlorhexidine in alcohol (ChA) in the connection procedure; 13 died. Nine of the 14 patients had been transferred to haemodialysis or renal transplantation, yet all still developed symptoms of SP within a few months after transfer even though 5 of them were originally asymptomatic. The main symptoms of SP were peritoneal ultrafiltration failure, exudative bloody ascites and intestinal obstruction. They present at around 5 years (30-80 months) after commencement of CAPD. Four other patients with a comparable duration of ChA exposure were continued on CAPD with a Travenol Spike System (TSS) without further exposure to ChA. They were all asymptomatic of SP after 9-12 months. Comparing the 2 groups of asymptomatic patients at 9 months after transfer, those transferred to TSS have a much better outcome than those transferred to HD or renal transplantation (P = 0.0476). We concluded that ChA is the main cause of SP in our patients and continuing CAPD without further exposure to ChA is a better alternative than stopping CAPD in preventing the progression of SP."

There were 18 trials that used a sham manual SMT procedure for their placebo control intervention; the most common approach was with an SMT setup but without the application of any thrust. One small pilot study used an unequivocally indistinguishable placebo, two trials used placebos that had been validated as inert a priori, and eight trials reported on the success of subject blinding. Risk of bias was high or unclear, for all included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Imperfect placebos are ubiquitous in clinical trials of LP-SMT, and few trials have assessed for successful subject blinding or balanced expectations of treatment success between active and control group subjects. There is thus a strong potential for unmasking of control subjects, unequal non-specific effects between active and control groups, and non-inert placebos in existing trials. Future trials should consider assessing the success of subject blinding and ensuring inertness of their placebo a priori, as a minimum standard for quality."

Transition from one treatment modality to another is common, and the astute clinician should be aware of a wide array of observational data regarding the advantages and disadvantages of certain modalities around these transition points. In this paper, we explore data that informs lifelong care of the ESRD patient. The discussion focuses on the impact of dialysis modality on the likelihood of transplantation, and then moves to short-term and long-term outcomes after transplantation. Large observational studies indicate that peritoneal dialysis patients may experience increased rates of graft thrombosis and early (3-month) graft failure. Importantly, however, compared to their HD counterparts PD patients enjoy advantages in shorter time to transplantation, decreased rates of delayed graft function (DGF), and enhanced long-term transplant survival."

In this review, some of the major studies performed in patients with different stages of renal failure are presented. The most used instrument for measuring HRQoL is the Short form health survey questionnaire (SF-36). Patients with predialysis CKD had higher SF-36 scores than a large cohort of hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, but lower scores than those reported for the adult population. Kidney transplantation offers better HRQoL than dialysis. Hemoglobin level predicted both physical and mental domain scores of the SF-36. HRQoL of HD and PD patients were compared in only a few studies, mostly because these studies are difficult to interpret. PD patients generally have lower comorbidity scores at the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), independent of other factors influencing modality selection. Comorbid medical conditions are common in patients with ESRD, and are an important contributing factor to clinical outcomes and quality of life. Depression occurs in about 20-30% of dialysis patients. This is important because of the negative impact depression has on quality of life, but also because depression is now established as a factor that can significantly affect morbidity and mortality in ESRD patients. Sexual life satisfaction showed marked deterioration in all age groups. Patients aged over 65 scored significantly better than younger patients on dialysis stress scales, and were generally more satisfied with life. Longitudinal studies are needed to define periods at risk for decline in HRQoL during progression of CKD."

            "title": "Recent clinical trials of pain control: impact on quality of life.",
            "abstract": "The understanding and treatment of pain is one of the oldest challenges for physicians, scientists and philosophers. Much of our present rationale of pain control is based on the Cartesian idea that pain mostly originates from external or internal noxious stimuli, which are transmitted to and interpreted in the brain. Consequently, removal (blocking) of the stimuli and modification of cerebral awareness have been the prime targets of analgesic interventions. Only recently has the relationship between pain and other physical, psychological and social aspects of illness been considered in the overall management plan. Most of the literature on pain control reveals the physical bias of measurement. Apart from simple but reliable tools such as visual analogue scales and Likert-type verbal scales, more sophisticated measures such as multidimensional pain inventories have also been used when it is necessary to characterise pain more specifically. In clinical studies, it is usual to ask the patient to report on his own pain, although proxy measures such as mobility, performance status and analgesic consumption are also often used. The hospice concept of \"total pain\", in which the psychological, social, spiritual and other aspects are emphasised, has been influential in our new approach to pain measurement. Particularly when it is chronic and related to advancing disease as in metastatic cancer, pain can interact significantly with many facets of daily living. A holistic model of quality of life in such patients should, therefore, include a multidimensional or modular assessment of these areas. Medical interventions themselves can affect quality of life in both positive and negative ways. Some side-effects may be so common as to be accepted as \"normal\", e.g. constipation or sedation with opioids: it is only by their careful evaluation, when comparing opioids with essentially similar analgesic potentials, that differential toxicities may be revealed. Simple recording of physical side-effects of drugs is really not sufficient, because analgesics as well as other therapies may be associated with mood changes and broader consequences for quality of life. Only in the past few years has quality of life been seriously addressed in palliation research. For example, standardised quality of life scales are now included almost routinely in oncological studies involving radiotherapy or chemotherapy by the Medical Research Council (MRC) of Great Britain. Trials of the new biphosphonates, which can reduce bone pain in metastatic cancer, have been enhanced by incorporating quality of life measures. Based on the experience from earlier efficacy/safety studies with the new transdermal route of drug delivery for the opioid fentanyl, important areas of life such as sleep and cognitive function have been addressed. Randomised controlled trials of analgesics which include quality of life endpoints are still rare, but should be encouraged as these represent the most rigorous way of evaluating new therapies. The current preoccupation with quality assurance in healthcare is directed, ultimately, to the delivery of a better quality of care, which should also be more cost-effective, for large populations. An important intermediate step towards that ideal is the collection of data on pain and other symptoms, but also validated quality of life parameters on well-defined groups. Only by widening the scope of analgesic studies to include these dimensions can we hope to define appropriate strategies for more rational healthcare."

            "abstract": "Between 1985 and 1988, there were 3,393 children (Medicare insured) under age 20 who began treatment for chronic ESRD. Patterns of modality use, modality switch, mortality rates, and various aspects of transplantation were analyzed for different age and incident groups of this pediatric cohort. The pediatric cohort as a whole exhibited a distinct pattern of modality use when compared to adults in general, a point evidenced most clearly by their substantially higher rates of transplantation. Furthermore, notable differences were found within the pediatric cohort when the younger than 5, 5-9, 10-14, and 15- to 19-year-old age groups were analyzed separately. Younger pediatric patients, particularly those younger than 5 years, received peritoneal dialysis as initial ESRD therapy more frequently than their older pediatric counterparts. This result would be expected given vascular access problems often associated with very young patients. In addition, those patients younger than 5 years who began RRT with some form of hemodialysis had the highest likelihood of switching to CAPD/CCPD within the first year of therapy. Conversely, older pediatric patients were most likely to begin RRT therapy with some form of hemodialysis. By day 91, slightly over half of the 15- to 19-year-old age group was utilizing center hemodialysis; the CAPD/CCPD, other peritoneal, and functioning transplant modalities each contained about 10% of the patients with the remainder falling into the death and unknown dialysis categories. The overall pattern of switching to transplantation during the first year of RRT was similar for pediatric patients initiating RRT with center hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/CCPD), but differed by age group within each dialysis type. Pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis were somewhat more likely to receive a transplant during the first year of ESRD compared to hemodialysis, although the difference was small. Mortality rates during the first year for patients who began treatment with center hemodialysis versus CAPD/CCPD were similar. The well-documented dominance of transplantation as a method of RRT for pediatric patients was further verified by this study. Results show that transplantation was implemented rapidly during the initial months of ESRD. Nearly 50% of surviving pediatric patients had a functioning transplant at 1 year following onset and 64% at 3 years. These percentages were exceeded for the 5- to 9-year-old age group, of which 74% had a functioning graft 3 years following onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is believed to improve the immune competence of end-stage renal failure patients and to increase the risk of graft rejection following subsequent renal transplantation. At this centre, 220 consecutive renal transplants have been studied in patients treated by either CAPD or haemodialysis (HD). Patient and graft survival was not significantly different for the two treatment groups over a five year follow-up. When only first cadaver recipients were considered (152 grafts) one-year graft survival (non-immunological failures excluded) was 77 per cent for CAPD and 79 per cent for HD patients (P greater than 0.05). Time on dialysis and number of pre-operative transfusions were significantly greater for the HD patients (P less than 0.05). A group of HD and CAPD patients were identified as being matched for age, sex, HLA, A, B, DR antigen matches, pre-operative transfusions and time-on dialysis. One-year graft survival of the CAPD patients was 82 per cent and for the HD patients 61 per cent. Studies of patient lymphocyte function and plasma suppressive activity in vitro revealed no differences between CAPD and HD treated patients. CAPD is not an immunological risk factor in renal transplantation and its continued use in the preparation of patients for transplantation is recommended."

            "abstract": "Conventional blind randomized trials involve obtaining consent for treatment prior to randomization into control or treatment groups. When the trial is of necessity an open one, obtaining consent to treatment and then assigning the patient to a control group may lead to undesirable consequences. When consent is required prior to randomization, inability to obtain it diminishes both control and treatment numbers. Obtaining consent after randomization enhances the power of the study since refusal affects only treatment numbers thus making more efficient use of patient material. We propose to analyze the outcome of patients allocated to treatment, but refusing experimental therapy, as a separate group. Comparison of this group with the control population will permit validation of the efficacy of the randomization process and allow testing of the hypothesis that refusers of consent react the same as the control population. If no difference occurs we propose that the refuser and control groups be combined and compared with those patients who receive experimental treatment."

Ltd Patient Support Program database, comprising an inception cohort commencing PD between 1 January 2005 and 13 August 2015. We used time-dependent cause-specific Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risks (kidney transplantation, change to hemodialysis) models to estimate relative mortality risk between APD and CAPD.

Several reports have suggested the potential benefit of beginning haemodialysis less frequently and incrementally increasing the dose as the residual renal function decreases. However, all the data published so far are from observational studies. Thus, this clinical trial avoids any potential selection bias and will assess the possible benefits that have been observed in observational studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This report describes the study protocol of a randomized prospective multi-centre open-label clinical trial to evaluate whether starting renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly haemodialysis sessions preserves residual renal function better than the standard thrice-weekly regimen. We also explore other clinical parameters, such as concentrations of uremic toxins, dialysis doses, control of anaemia, removal of medium-weight uremic toxins, nutritional status, quality of life, hospital admissions and mortality. Only incident haemodialysis patients who can maintain a urea clearance rate KrU ≥ 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 are eligible. Patient recruitment began on 1 January 2017 and will last for 2 years or until the required sample size has been recruited to ensure the established statistical power has been reached.

It has been calculated that 44 patients should be recruited into each group to achieve a power of 80% in a two-sided comparison of means with a usual significance level of 0.05. A time-to-event analysis will estimate the probability of kidney function survival in both groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves will be compared with log-rank tests.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life-threatening complications, including bleeding (haemorrhage) from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal bleeding commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Therefore, prevention is important. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in adults is the established standard of care because of the results of numerous randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of non-selective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation in decreasing the incidence of variceal bleeding. In children, band ligation, beta-blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding. However, it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase Elsevier, and two other registers in February 2019.

We searched four registries for ongoing clinical trials. There were no language or document type restrictions.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status assessing sclerotherapy versus sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard Cochrane methodology to perform this systematic review. We used the intention-to-treat principle to analyse outcome data, and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We found only one randomised clinical trial that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial included 108 Brazilian children with median age of 4.3 years (range 11 months to 13 years). Fifty-six children were randomised to prophylactic sclerotherapy (ethanolamine oleate 2%) and 52 children to no intervention (control). Children were followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Eight children (six from the sclerotherapy group versus two from the control group) dropped out before the end of the trial. The follow-up was from 18 months to eight years. Mortality was 16% (9/56 children) in the sclerotherapy group versus 15% (8/52 children) in the control group (risk ration (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 21% (12/56) of the children in the sclerotherapy group versus 46% (24/52) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.83; very low-certainty evidence). There were more children with congestive hypertensive gastropathy in the sclerotherapy group than in the control group (14% (8/56) versus 6% (3/52); RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.69 to 8.84; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gastric varices was similar between the sclerotherapy group and the control group (11% (6/56) versus 10% (5/52); RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.43; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of bleeding from gastric varices was higher in the sclerotherapy group than in the control group (4% (3/56) versus 0% (0/52); RR 6.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 123.06; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess health-related quality of life. Oesophageal variceal bleeding occurred in 5% (3/56) of the children in the sclerotherapy group versus 40% (21/52) of the children in the control group (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.42; very low-certainty evidence). The most prevalent complications (defined as non-serious) were pain and fever after the procedure, which promptly resolved with analgesics. However, numerical data on the frequency of these adverse events and their occurrences in the two groups were lacking. No funding information was provided. We found no ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence, obtained from one randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias, is very uncertain on whether sclerotherapy has an influence on mortality and if it may decrease first upper gastrointestinal or oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. The evidence is very uncertain on whether sclerotherapy has an influence on congestive hypertensive gastropathy, incidence on gastric varices, and incidence of bleeding from gastric varices. Health-related quality of life was not measured. There were no serious events caused by sclerotherapy, and analysis of non-serious adverse events could not be performed due to lack of numerical data. The GRADE assessment of each outcome showed a very low-certainty evidence. The results of the trial need to be interpreted with caution. Larger randomised clinical trials, following the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements, assessing the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are needed. The trials should include important clinical outcomes such as death, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events."

Of these, 427 (30%) had high-risk tumors (pN + or pT greater than 30 mm) and were included in a concurrent randomized comparison of postoperative radiotherapy versus adjuvant polychemotherapy. The mean follow-up time was 61/2 years. Tamoxifen improved the recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P less than .01), but the overall survival difference in favor of the tamoxifen-allocated patients was not significant. Data on estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) content were available in 750 patients. Their mean follow-up time was 41/2 years. The effect of tamoxifen was significantly related to ER level (P less than .01). No benefit with tamoxifen was observed among ER-negative patients. The relation to PgR level was of borderline significance (P = .06). Multivariate analysis indicated that most of the interaction between treatment and receptor content was explained by the interaction with ER (P less than .01). The PgR status appeared to modify the effect of tamoxifen among the ER-positive patients and the greatest effect was observed among patients who were positive for both receptors. However, the additional predictive information provided by the PgR assay did not help to identify an unresponsive subgroup of patients."

This observation suggests that antihypertensive treatment might be beneficial. Results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program Pilot Study (SHEP-PS) indicated the feasibility of a full-scale clinical trial on the efficacy of drug treatment of ISH. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the primary objective of assessing the effect of drug treatment of ISH--systolic pressure 160-219 mmHg and diastolic pressure less than 90--on occurrence of fatal and nonfatal stroke. This multicenter clinical trial has a sample size of 4736 participants, with high statistical power to detect a reduction of 32% or more in the study's primary end point during the 4-6 year period of treatment and follow-up. Low dosage chlorthalidone is the main study drug. Further features of the design of SHEP and the trial's organization are described."

            "abstract": "A proportion of patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome (NS) due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) often require long-term hospitalization, which results in the loss of quality of life (QOL) of the patients. An-11-year-old girl was brought to a regional hospital with an 8-day history of generalized edema. Laboratory studies revealed massive proteinuria without hematuria and marked hypoalbuminemia associated with hyperlipidemia. A percutaneous renal biopsy revealed lesions characteristic of FSGS. Although methylprednisolone pulse therapy was administered followed by oral prednisolone combined with cyclosporine A, heavy proteinuria persisted for the next 4 months. The patient was referred subsequenthy to our hospital for further examinations. High-dose intermittent mizoribine pulse therapy, LDL-apheresis, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy proved to be partially effective. As a result, long-term hospitalization and intravenous administration of albumin, diuretics and immunoglobulin was required for this patient. Also, she developed severe steroid toxicity such as obesity, cataract and osteoporosis. A third renal biopsy revealed an advanced stage of FSGS lesions, suggesting subsequent development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the patient suffered from long-term hospitalization over 3 years and significant loss of QOL, we therefore proposed early initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD), as in cases of congenital NS, in order to preserve the patient's general condition without intravenous drug administrations and for the preparation of a future renal transplantation. After obtaining informed consent from the patient and her family, the initiation of PD was performed at the age of 15 years before the ESRD state(serum creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL). The patient was successfully free from intravenous drug administrations and hospitalization, and the QOL was significantly improved thereafter. We, therefore, suggest that early initiation of PD might be a treatment of choice for elected patients with severe refractory nephrotic syndrome such as this presented case."

Use of placebos may also be justified to assure blinding of physicians and patients regarding treatment assignment so as to minimize bias in assessment of study end points. If a trial meets these methodologic criteria, it must then fulfill additional criteria to be considered ethical.

The exponential increase in anticancer treatments and the high number of patients living longer with advanced disease have accentuated this. Internationally, there is now a persuasive argument that introducing PC early during anticancer treatment in patients with advanced disease has beneficial effects on symptoms, psychological distress, and survival.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a national cluster-randomized trial (C-RCT) in 12 Norwegian hospitals. The trial investigates effects of early, systematic integration of oncology and specialized PC in patients with advanced cancer in six intervention hospitals compared with conventional care in six. Hospitals are stratified on the size of local catchment areas before randomization. In the intervention hospitals, a three-part complex intervention will be implemented. The backbone of the intervention is the development and implementation of patient-centered care pathways that contain early, compulsory referral to PC and regular and systematic registrations of symptoms. An educational program must be completed before patient inclusion. A total of 680 patients with advanced cancer and one caregiver per patient are included when patients come for start of last line of chemotherapy, defined according to national treatment guidelines. Data registration, clinical variables, and patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes take place every 2 months for 1 year or until death. The primary outcome is use of chemotherapy in the last 3 months of life by comparing the proportion of patients who receive this in the intervention and control groups. Primary outcome is use of chemotherapy in the last 3 months before death, i.e. number of patients. Secondary outcomes are initiation, discontinuation and number of cycles, last 3 months of life, administration of other medical interventions in the last month of life, symptom burden, quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with information and follow-up, and caregiver health, QoL, and satisfaction with care.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Results from this C-RCT will be used to raise the awareness about the positive outcomes of early provision of specialized palliative care using pathways for patients with advanced cancer receiving medical anticancer treatment.

Both expressive helping and neutral writing involve four brief writing sessions, beginning immediately after randomization and ending approximately 4 weeks after hospital discharge.

Following a short titration period, maintenance therapy with metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. or placebo was continued for up to 1 year. Enrollment was prematurely terminated because of a progressive and marked decline in patient accession; it was not feasible to reach the original goal of 3200 patients in a practical period of time.

            "abstract": "One hundred and eleven cases of children with end-stage renal failure prior to 4 years of age were collected from a survey of the French Pediatric Nephrology Club. Clinical and epidemiological data stress the importance of certain etiologies such as 40 cases of renal hypoplasia. The necessity of planning extracorporeal dialysis from the first year of life in 37% of patients demonstrates the importance of difficulties to be overcome. The treatments used for the 82 treated children show the interest of conservative management. However, peritoneal dialysis remains the first treatment of choice (52 times). Besides the problems of hemodialysis vascular approach, related to the small caliber of vessels, the complications of the clearance techniques did not appear to be more frequent than in older children. Use of transplantation is not negligible as 25% of transplanted patients were under 4 years of age; however none was under one year or weighted less than 8 kg. Transplantation remains ultimate treatment, even more so as the actuarial survival at 5 years is clearly worse for children submitted to hemodialysis (68%) than to transplantation (91%) (p less than 0.05)."

Other potential causes (infection, malignancy, hepatitis, etc.) of these symptoms were ruled out following an exhaustive etiological work-up. A final diagnosis of sclerosing peritonitis was made, and the patient was started on corticosteroid therapy. Both morphological and functional alterations of the peritoneal membrane associated with long term PD and the detection of such alterations in everyday practice are reviewed here, along with possible etiological factors and therapeutic measures discussed in the literature. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mecHanisms underlying these alterations would make it possible to develop preventive measures, such as more biocompatible dialysates."

Eighteen transplants have been performed in 16 patients, ages 6 to 57 years, undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis over the past 4 years. Sixteen were from cadaver donors, and two were from living related donors (LRD). The patients had been undergoing intermittent peritoneal dialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) using permanent silastic catheters, from five days to 4 years. No patient had clinical evidence for peritonitis at the time of transplantation. The peritoneal catheter was removed at the time of transplant in all cadaver donor recipients without complication. One recipient of a LRD kidney had the catheter removed two days prior to transplant. Cultures of the catheter were sterile in 16 cases. Two patients had positive peritoneal catheter cultures at the time of transplant but were treated with appropriate antibiotics and never developed clinical peritonitis. Fourteen transplants had postoperative fevers. No definite source was found in 13; one had fever in relation to acute graft rejection. The fevers resolved in all patients either spontaneously or subsequent to therapy. Other complications were similar to those seen in patients transplanted from hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was performed as needed pretransplant and posttransplant using a temporary femoral vein catheter or arteriovenous fistula without complication. Nine patients are alive with a functioning kidney 1 to 36 months posttransplant (mean 17 months). Six transplants rejected (five patients), and one failed secondary to renal vein thrombosis. Two patients died posttransplant, one after a cerebrovascular accident, and one due to an unknown cause 1 month postnephrectomy for rejection. In conclusion, patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis can be successfully transplanted without a significant incidence of complications related to their peritoneal dialysis."

Median age at transplantation was 68 years (interquartile range = 66-69 years). The 1-year and 5-year overall patient and graft survivals (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 95.1 (93.5-96.7) and 79.0 (75.1-82.9), and 92.9 (91.1-94.7) and 75.4 (71.3-79.5), respectively. Factors associated with higher risks of all-cause death included prevalent coronary artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.47 [1.03-2.11]), cerebrovascular disease (1.99 [1.26-3.16]), increasing graft ischemic time (1.06 per hour [1.03-1.09]), donor age (1.02 per year [1.01-1.03]), delayed graft function (1.64 [1.13-2.39]), and peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation (1.71 [1.17-2.51]).\n## CONCLUSION\nPrevalent vascular disease and peritoneal dialysis as a pretransplantation dialysis modality are risk factors associated with poorer outcomes in transplant recipients aged ≥65 years.

Such trials involve instruments for measuring health status whose reliability, validity and responsiveness need to be understood by clinicians and policy-makers in interpreting trial results. Deciding whether a treatment is clinically efficacious requires prior determination, based on empirical evidence, of what constitutes a minimal important difference (MID) between active treatment and control groups in the change in health status between study start and end. This MID should be used to calculate the sample size that will confer adequate power to detect a treatment effect if it truly exists. Many trials assessing health status have major methodological flaws: use of inappropriate or psychometrically unsound measurement instruments, lack of specification of MID, assumption that statistically significant results represent clinically significant treatment effects, and statement of conclusions inconsistent with observed results. This article provides guidance to clinicians in interpreting results of such trials in regard to clinical decision-making."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that prevent dry weight achievement in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in renal replacement therapy through the change in their body weight after kidney transplant (KT) compared with 1 week before KT. The study included 188 ESRD patients of diverse etiology who received living kidney transplantation with normal immediate graft function, 62.2% were male, age 29 ± 11 years old. All patients were on renal replacement therapy for at least 1 month before KT with either hemodiafiltration (N = 106), hemodialysis (N = 25), or peritoneal dialysis (N = 57). Based on body weight difference (after transplant-before transplant), patients with body weight difference ≤2 kg were considered as being close to their dry weight (Group 1, N = 112), whereas patients with body weight difference >2 kg were considered as being overhydrated (Group 2, N = 76). Clinical and biochemical characteristics were obtained from the medical records at three periods of time: time of ESRD initiation (baseline), 1 week before undergoing KT, and 1 week after KT. The mean time (± standard deviation) from renal replacement therapy initiation to the week before KT was 9.2 ± 5 months. Group 2 had a higher proportion of men, antihypertensive use, peritoneal dialysis, and higher urine output during all periods. Before KT, Group 2 had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures than Group 1. After KT, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased in Group 2, whereas no change occurred in Group 1. Before KT, Group 2 had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, and phosphorous compared with Group 1. Compared with baseline, Group 1 had more optimal blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid parameters before KT than Group 2. After KT, all parameters improved with respect to baseline in both groups. Hemoglobin, albumin, and sodium were similar between groups, except for higher hemoglobin in Group 2 than Group 1 after KT. Multivariate regression analysis showed that male sex, peritoneal dialysis, and systolic blood pressure before KT were independent risk factors for overhydration. In conclusion, high systolic blood pressure and peritoneal dialysis were two independent modifiable variables associated with overhydration before KT. Assessment of the body weight change after KT is a useful tool to evaluate dry weight, in addition to identifying variables associated with poor volume control. This could allow adjustment of clinical and dialysis parameters in future patients."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Observational studies using routinely collected data are faced with a number of potential shortcomings that can bias their results. Many methods rely on controlling for measured and unmeasured confounders. In this work, we investigate the use of instrumental variables (IV) and quasi-trial analysis to control for unmeasured confounders in the context of a study based on the retrospective Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics (ESME) database, which compared overall survival (OS) with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab or paclitaxel alone as first-line treatment in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC).\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Causal interpretations and estimates can be made from observation data using IV and quasi-trial analysis. Quasi-trial analysis has the same conceptual basis as IV, however, instead of using IV in the analysis, a \"superficial\" or \"pseudo\" randomized trial is used in a Cox model. For instance, in a multicenter trial, instead of using the treatment variable, quasi-trial analysis can consider the treatment preference in each center, which can be informative, and then comparisons of results between centers or clinicians can be informative.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the original analysis, the OS adjusted for major factors was significantly longer with paclitaxel and bevacizumab than with paclitaxel alone. Using the center-treatment preference as an instrument yielded to concordant results. For the quasi-trial analysis, a Cox model was used, adjusted on all factors initially used. The results consolidate those obtained with a conventional multivariate Cox model.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Unmeasured confounding is a major concern in observational studies, and IV or quasi-trial analysis can be helpful to complement analysis of studies of this nature."

            "abstract": "The socioeconomic statuses of Asian countries are diverse and government reimbursement policies for renal replacement programs vary greatly from one country to another. Both factors affect not only the availability of treatment but also the choice of dialysis modality. Despite the economic growth of Hong Kong over the past three decades, the resources spent by our government on health services are less than other developed countries. The National Health Service, which is run on a tight budget, supports almost 95% of the patients on renal replacement programs. Due to the cost-effectiveness and reimbursement from the government, 79% of patients with end-stage renal failure in Hong Kong are treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). All new patients entering the renal replacement program run by the National Health Service are offered CAPD as the first-line dialytic treatment. Due to budgetary constraint, over the past 10 years dialysis centers in Hong Kong have adopted a small-volume regime of 3 x 2-L daily exchanges as the initial dialysis prescription. This dialysis prescription will be considered to be suboptimal by Western standards, but the survival of these patients was comparable to, or even better than, other areas despite a lower Kt/V. These preliminary studies suggest small-volume dialysis may be an acceptable compromise in Asian populations with their smaller body size, given the financial constraints. These issues are especially important in Asia, where financial resources for renal replacement therapy are still limited in most countries and many patients have to continue working to pay for their renal replacement treatment. Using this small-volume dialytic regime, more patients may be treated with the limited financial resources. Furthermore, our experience raises the question of the importance of nutritional status in patient survival."

Retention rates (90%) and analysis of patient satisfaction showed good acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. The EG (n = 8) had a higher reduction on pain interference than the CG (n = 10) (d = -0.267). A higher improvement on HRQoL (EQ-5D index: d = 0.334; EQ-5D VAS: d = 1.437) and a tendency towards better haemophilia-related quality-of-life (A36-Hemofilia QoL) were also evident in the EG.

Psychological and social support are potential treatments for depression, although a Cochrane review in 2005 identified zero eligible studies. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2005.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effect of using psychosocial interventions versus usual care or a second psychosocial intervention for preventing and treating depression in patients with ESKD treated with dialysis.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Register of Studies up to 21 June 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias' tool and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty. We estimated treatment effects using random-effects meta-analysis. Results for continuous outcomes were expressed as a mean difference (MD) or as a standardised mean difference (SMD) when investigators used different scales. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios. All estimates were reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 33 studies enrolling 2056 participants. Twenty-six new studies were added to this 2019 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2005 review were included as they met the updated review eligibility criteria, which have been expanded to include RCTs in which participants did not meet criteria for depression as an inclusion criterion. Psychosocial interventions included acupressure, cognitive-behavioural therapy, counselling, education, exercise, meditation, motivational interviewing, relaxation techniques, social activity, spiritual practices, support groups, telephone support, visualisation, and voice-recording of a psychological intervention. The duration of study follow-up ranged between three weeks and one year. Studies included between nine and 235 participants. The mean study age ranged between 36.1 and 73.9 years. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in eight and one studies respectively. One study reported low risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators, and outcome assessment was blinded in seven studies. Twelve studies were at low risk of attrition bias, eight studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 21 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Cognitive behavioural therapy probably improves depressive symptoms measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (4 studies, 230 participants: MD -6.10, 95% CI -8.63 to -3.57), based on moderate certainty evidence. Cognitive behavioural therapy compared to usual care probably improves HRQoL measured either with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form or the Quality of Life Scale, with a 0.5 standardised mean difference representing a moderate effect size (4 studies, 230 participants: SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.83) , based on moderate certainty evidence. Cognitive behavioural therapy may reduce major depression symptoms (one study) and anxiety, and increase self-efficacy (one study). Cognitive behavioural therapy studies did not report hospitalisation. We found low-certainty evidence that counselling may slightly reduce depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3 studies, 99 participants: MD -3.84, 95% CI -6.14 to -1.53) compared to usual care. Counselling reported no difference in HRQoL (one study). Counselling studies did not measure risk of major depression, suicide, or hospitalisation. Exercise may reduce or prevent major depression (3 studies, 108 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81), depression of any severity (3 studies, 108 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.87) and improve HRQoL measured with Quality of Life Index score (2 studies, 64 participants: MD 3.06, 95% CI 2.29 to 3.83) compared to usual care with low certainty. With moderate certainty, exercise probably improves depression symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3 studies, 108 participants: MD -7.61, 95% CI -9.59 to -5.63). Exercise may reduce anxiety (one study). No exercise studies measured suicide risk or withdrawal from dialysis. We found moderate-certainty evidence that relaxation techniques probably reduce depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (2 studies, 122 participants: MD -5.77, 95% CI -8.76 to -2.78). Relaxation techniques reported no difference in HRQoL (one study). Relaxation studies did not measure risk of major depression or suicide. Spiritual practices have uncertain effects on depressive symptoms measured either with the Beck Depression Inventory or the Brief Symptom Inventory (2 studies, 116 participants: SMD -1.00, 95% CI -3.52 to 1.53; very low certainty evidence). No differences between spiritual practices and usual care were reported on anxiety (one study), and HRQoL (one study). No study of spiritual practices evaluated effects on suicide risk, withdrawal from dialysis or hospitalisation.

            "abstract": "This study analyzes opportunity costs for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. Kidney transplantation remains the most cost-effective treatment for uremia and is one of the most cost-effective technologies in health care. Improved survival of grafts and increased numbers of transplants have the potential to reduce costs for dialysis programs. To support organ donation activities, the public and concerned health professionals should be informed about the opportunity cost of \"unnecessary\" dialysis. These resources could be reallocated from dialysis to other programs. Among patients in dialysis, a more common use of chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis instead of institution-based hemodialysis would greatly increase cost-utility and further reduce the program costs of renal replacement therapy."

General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the management of LBP; however, GP care has not been shown to be the most cost-effective approach unless exercise and behavioural counselling are added to usual care. The Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach to LBP has been developed to assist GPs to manage LBP by empowering exploration and management of psychosocial barriers to recovery and provision of evidence-based care and information. The aim of the Low Back Pain in General Practice (LBPinGP) trial is to explore whether patients with LBP who receive care from GPs trained in the FREE approach have better outcomes than those who receive usual care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a cluster randomised controlled superiority trial comparing the FREE approach with usual care for LBP management with investigator-blinded assessment of outcomes. GPs will be recruited and then cluster randomised (in practice groups) to the intervention or control arm. Intervention arm GPs will receive training in the FREE approach, and control arm GPs will continue to practice as usual. Patients presenting to their GP with a primary complaint of LBP will be allocated on the basis of allocation of the GP they consult. We aim to recruit 60 GPs and 275 patients (assuming patients are recruited from 75% of GPs and an average of 5 patients per GP complete the study, accounting for 20% patient participant dropout). Patient participants and the trial statistician will be blind to group allocation throughout the study. Analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome will be back-related functional impairment 6 months post-initial LBP consultation (interim data at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months), measured with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary patient outcomes include pain, satisfaction, quality of life, days off from work and costs of care. Secondary GP outcomes include beliefs about pain and impairment, GP confidence, and actual and reported clinical behaviour. Health economic and process evaluations will be conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      In the LBPinGP trial, we will investigate providing an intervention during the first interaction a person with back pain has with their GP.

Twelve children were treated with early physiotherapy according to Bobath, ten children were treated according to Vojta and eight constituted a control group. The infants tended for early physical therapy were divided by random into two different groups. The neonatal risk factors, however, proved to be unevenly distributed among the infants in the Vojta- and the Bobath-treated groups - the latter being more heavily burdened in this respect. Vojta has claimed that his method of early physiotherapy is able to prevent the development of cerebral palsy (cp) of \"uncomplicated\" (but not of \"complicated\") type. At follow-up we found one child out of nine with \"uncomplicated\" cp in the Vojta group against three out of six in the Bobath- and two out of six in the control group. These differences, however, are not statistically significant. Further detailed studies with greater groups of children seem necessary to help us to clarify these problems. The psychological aspects of early physiotherapy should be thoroughly considered and this is particularly important in connection with the Vojta method."

The dependent variables were two measures of physical functioning: (1) a ten-item measure of activities of daily living (ADL), and (2) the 45-item physical dysfunction dimension of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Independent variables included four modalities of treatment (in-center hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD], related transplant, and cadaver transplant); primary cause of ESRD (eg, diabetes, glomerulonephritis); comorbidity (other illnesses besides primary cause of ESRD); and demographic characteristics (sex, race, age, marital status, education). ADL and SIP unadjusted mean scores differed significantly by category for each of the eight study factors (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P less than 0.0001), with the exception of sex for SIP means. The highest levels of dependency in ADL were reported by patients who were older, female, black, widowed, less educated, treated with in-center hemodialysis, had diabetes as the primary cause of ESRD, and/or reported more comorbidity. The partial effect of each factor on the dependent measures with adjustment for the seven other factors was assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In the ADL analysis, sex, race, age, primary cause of kidney failure, and comorbidity were significant factors (probability values ranging from 0.05 for race to 0.0001 for sex, primary cause of ESRD, and comorbidity).

Any combination or any single modality (except for PD + HD for graft survival and PD + HD and PD + HD + transplantation for recipient survival) had protective effects on graft and recipient survival compared with HD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our results suggest that compared with PD, HD as an RRT modality immediately before transplantation or as a predominant RRT modality during the ESRD course, used alone or in combination with other RRT modalities, is associated with increased risks for graft failure and recipient death. Increased number of RRT modalities used during the ESRD course is associated with worsening of graft and recipient survival."

            "abstract": "A prospective, randomized double-blind study comparing high-dose short-term penicillin-G prophylaxis with placebo was conducted on patients referred for elective pulmonary surgery. The major advantages of penicillin prophylaxis over placebo were observed for wound infections (2/45 vs 9/47, respectively, p = 0.03), postoperative antibiotic use (13/45 vs 23/47, respectively, p = 0.049), and postoperative hospital stay (median 10 days vs 13 days, respectively, p = 0.02). The prophylactic penicillin regimen had no effect on the incidence of empyema or lower respiratory tract infections. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus were identified as the major pathogens in post-operative infections. Penicillin significantly reduced the incidence of S. aureus in spite of resistance to penicillin in most isolated strains, while the frequency of Haemophilus was similar in the two treatment groups. Colonization with Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was pronounced in the penicillin group. Few side-effects of penicillin treatment were recorded. Short-term penicillin prophylaxis is recommended, but the ideal prophylactic regimen in pulmonary surgery has not yet been found."

            "abstract": "Increased interest in real-world evidence (RWE) for clinical and regulatory decision making and the need to evaluate long-term benefits and risks of pharmaceutical products raise the importance of understanding the use of external controls (ECs) for uncontrolled extensions of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched clinicaltrials.gov from 2009 to 2019 for uncontrolled extensions and assessed the use of ECs in the trial protocol registry and PubMed. We present characteristics of identified uncontrolled extensions, their adoption of ECs, and a qualitative appraisal of published uncontrolled extensions with ECs according to good pharmacoepidemiologic practice. The number of uncontrolled extensions increased slightly across the study period, resulting in a total of 1,115 studies. Most originated from phase III RCTs (62.2%) and specified safety outcomes (61.9% among those with specified outcomes). Most uncontrolled extensions incorporated no control group with only 7 out of 1,115 (0.6%) employing ECs. For those studies with ECs, all involved treatments for rare conditions and assessment of effectiveness. Attempts to balance comparison groups varied from none mentioned to propensity score matching. We noted consistent deficiencies in outcome ascertainment methods and approaches to address attrition bias. The contrast of the large and growing number of uncontrolled extensions with the small number of studies that utilized ECs showed clear opportunities for enhancement in design, measurement, and analysis of uncontrolled extensions to allow causal inferences on long-term treatment effects. As extensions continue to expand within RWE regulatory frameworks, development of guidelines for use of EC with uncontrolled extensions is needed."

Participants were administered the World Health Organization Quality of Life Measure-Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess QoL. Moreover, a broad neuropsychological battery was also administered. Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia patients demonstrated significantly lower scores on the physical, psychological, and social domains of the WHOQOL-BREF compared with controls, but there were no significant differences between the two patient groups on those domains. More symptomatic BD patients reported worse QoL, especially in the physical and environmental domains, which was also associated with worse neurocognitive performance. In schizophrenic patients, neurocognitive performance was not associated with self-reported QoL, but more symptomatic patients reported lower QoL. Substantial impairments in QoL, similar in severity, were found in both patient groups. In patients with schizophrenia, QoL was more strongly related to levels of psychopathology, whereas in BD patients, both psychopathology and neurocognitive deficits were strongly associated with lower QoL. Clinical recovery is essential in schizophrenia and BD. The association between cognitive functioning and QoL in bipolar patients suggests that these patients may also benefit from psychological interventions addressed to improve cognitive deficits and enhance the functional recovery."

Some therapies per se do not try to improve efficacy further but concentrate on important aspects in safety or convenience. Such improvements can be equally important to patients, and development strategies should be available for such compounds. A three-arm design with placebo, active control and experimental treatment may be viewed as the golden standard for such compounds; however, it may be difficult if not impossible to add a placebo arm in certain diseases. In such situations, non-inferiority designs are the only development option left.

The availability of living donors is critical, particularly to meet the increasing demand and potentially pre-emptive transplantation. In addition, living donor transplantation is associated with better outcomes on comparison with dialysis or transplants from deceased donors. The major disadvantage of living donation is that complications may occur both directly perioperatively and in the long-term. Two recent studies confirmed that the risk of renal failure among selected living donors is extremely low. This implies that there is no need to alter the existing positive attitude towards living donation. Finding a comparable long-term control group with relevant genetic and non-genetic risk factors remains a challenge to studies looking at long-term effects."

Two deaths have occurred in the CyA group and seven in the control group. 82% of the CyA group with functioning grafts are receiving CyA alone, 17% have been changed to azathioprine and steroids, and 1 patient is receiving prednisolone in addition to CyA; 27% have never received steroids. At 6 months post-transplant, renal function is similar in patients receiving CyA and in those receiving azathioprine and steroids.

To address the impact of selection bias, this study compared mortality by initial dialysis modality among patients who had ESRD and were placed on the transplant waiting list. This study was a historical prospective cohort of 12,568 patients in the United States who initiated dialysis between May 1, 1995, and October 31, 1998, and were placed on the transplant waiting list before dialysis initiation. Two-year mortality was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models that analyzed patients primarily using an intention-to-treat approach and separately censored patients on a modality switch. At 2 yr, the unadjusted mortality rate was 6.6% among peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients compared with 6.9% among hemodialysis (HD) patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.23). After controlling for differences in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory variables, the selection of PD versus HD remained associated with a similar 2-yr mortality risk (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.28). In separate models, 2-yr mortality associated with PD versus HD was significant among patients with body mass index (BMI) > or = 26 kg/m2 (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.83) but not among patients with BMI < 26 kg/m2 (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07). Results were similar after censoring on a modality switch. In conclusion, although choice of initial dialysis modality seems to be associated with equivalent outcomes among patients who have ESRD and are placed on the transplant waiting list, patients with BMI > or = 26 kg/m2 have increased 2-yr mortality associated with the selection of PD versus HD. Because the interpretation of observational data is highly affected by residual confounding and selection bias, further efforts should focus on the formation and testing of hypotheses to improve dialysis delivery."

In addition, we have been actively involved in studying new immunosuppressive regimens in order to improve and simplify the care of the PTX recipient.

Exercise under the direction of a physical therapist has been shown to reduce the risk of falls in older adults; however, it is not clear whether physical therapist-directed group-based exercise could produce similar results.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of physical therapist-administered group-based exercise when compared with various controls for falls prevention and improvement of quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A computerized search of PubMed and CINAHL was performed. An exhaustive hand search was also performed of the references of all full-text articles. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed for this review. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) comparison of group-based exercise led by a physical therapist to a control group; (2) ambulatory elderly men or women, aged 65 years or older; (3) subjects in the community or institutional setting; (4) the use of 1 or more outcome measures related to functional balance and/or quality of life; (5) randomized controlled or clinical trials; and (6) published in English, between December 1, 2001, and June 7, 2012.

After assessment with the PEDro scale, 8 of these were considered high-quality studies (score > 6/10). Seven studies compared group-based exercise to a nonexercise control group, while 3 studies compared group-based exercise with a physical therapist-prescribed home exercise program.

When compared with a physical therapist-prescribed home exercise program, the group-based exercise results were not statistically different but showed improvements in some quality of life and physical functioning measures. There is also some evidence to suggest that group-based exercise promotes greater patient satisfaction and exercise adherence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the group-based exercise is effective for falls prevention, quality-of-life enhancement, and balance improvements in the older adults comparable with traditional home exercise programs."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPost-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common metabolic complication in kidney allograft recipients, significantly contributing to the elevated cardiovascular morbidity after renal transplantation and increased risk of chronic transplant dysfunction. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the factors influencing PTDM development. Under particular consideration were the elements, existing before the transplantation, especially the modality of dialysis treatment significance, i.e. haemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD).\n## METHODS\nThree hundred and seventy-seven consecutive outpatients who underwent renal transplantation (RTx) in our institution between January 2003 and December 2005 were analysed. PTDM was diagnosed according to the current American Diabetic Association/World Health Organization criteria. Statistical inference was conducted by means of univariate methods (one factor versus PTDM) and multivariate methods in frames of generalized linear model.\n## RESULTS\nIn the study group, 72 patients (23.4%) developed PTDM after RTx (55 HD and 17 PD patients). PTDM incidence at 3, 6 and 12 months was 15.9%, 22.1% and 23.4%, respectively. The mean interval from transplantation to the onset of PTDM was 3.08 ± 2.73 months. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with the elevated risk of PTDM appearance were older recipient age, positive family history of diabetes, hypertensive nephropathy as end-stage renal disease cause, higher body mass index at transplantation, treatment by PD, and the graft from an older donor. In multivariate verification, statistical significance remained: older recipient age (P < 0.001), positive family history of diabetes (P = 0.002), and treatment by PD (P = 0.007).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTreatment by PD appears to be a possible novel factor, not yet reported, which may increase the risk of PTDM development.\n"

            "abstract": "As the End-stage renal disease population continues to grow, innovative strategies that optimize patient outcomes while capitalizing on the relative strengths of the existing modalities must be sought. Renal transplantation remains the preferred form of renal replacement therapy, but given the limited supply of donor organs, dialytic therapies will continue to constitute a large part of the modality mix. Matching patients to the most suitable modalities requires that a number of factors be considered. These include the patient's autonomy, medical and social factors, system-related issues, patient outcomes, and finances. While peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis (HD) have traditionally been viewed as competing modalities, we propose that they, along with home and frequent HD regimens, may be used in a complementary manner, which is based on current evidence, and may provide optimal outcomes while containing treatment costs. In this review, we attempt to synthesize the current literature describing the various issues that affect modality selection, and offer an approach to achieving a balance between these many competing factors."

Over the past decades, haemodiafiltration (HDF) has become available. Although high-dose HDF has shown some promising survival advantage compared to conventional HD, the evidence remains controversial. A Cochrane systematic review found, in low-quality trials, with various convective forms of dialysis, a reduction in cardiovascular, but not all-cause mortality and the effects on non-fatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation were uncertain.

Thrombi were documented by physical removal from the arterial part of the shunt by use of gentle suction or by complete shunt thrombosis (both arterial and venous part of the shunt). Thereafter, the patients' trial period terminated. The total number of thrombi during the observation period was 44 in the pentoxifylline group (26 patients), compared with 82 in the placebo group (25 patients). The mean number of thrombi per patient was 1.69 +/- 1.29 in the pentoxifylline group, significantly lower than that in the placebo group (3.28 +/- 1.99/p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "A major complication in continuous, ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is peritoneal fibrosis, which can result in peritoneal structural changes and functional ultrafiltration failure. Human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) in Wharton's jelly possess stem cell properties and are easily obtained and processed. This study focuses on the effects of HUMSCs on peritoneal fibrosis in in vitro and in vivo experiments. After 24-hour treatment with mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and PD solution at a 1:3 ratio, primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells became susceptible to PD-induced cell death. Such cytotoxic effects were prevented by coculturing with primary HUMSCs. In a rat model, intraperitoneal injections of 20 mM methylglyoxal (MGO) in PD solution for 3 weeks (the PD/MGO 3W group) markedly induced abdominal cocoon formation, peritoneal thickening, and collagen accumulation. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated neoangiogenesis and significant increase in the numbers of ED-1- and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive cells in the thickened peritoneum in the PD/MGO 3W group, suggesting that PD/MGO induced an inflammatory response. Furthermore, PD/MGO treatment for 3 weeks caused functional impairments in the peritoneal membrane. However, in comparison with the PD/MGO group, intraperitoneal administration of HUMSCs into the rats significantly ameliorated the PD/MGO-induced abdominal cocoon formation, peritoneal fibrosis, inflammation, neoangiogenesis, and ultrafiltration failure. After 3 weeks of transplantation, surviving HUMSCs were found in the peritoneum in the HUMSC-grafted rats. Thus, xenografts of HUMSCs might provide a potential therapeutic strategy in the prevention of peritoneal fibrosis. Significance: This study demonstrated that direct intraperitoneal transplantation of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells into the rat effectively prevented peritoneal dialysis/methylglyoxal-induced abdominal cocoon formation, ultrafiltration failure, and peritoneal membrane alterations such as peritoneal thickening, fibrosis, and inflammation. These findings provide a basis for a novel approach for therapeutic benefits in the treatment of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis."

            "abstract": "In addition to kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis represent two options for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Given that most patients are suitable for both types of dialysis and that many of them require lifelong therapy, differences in clinical outcome between these treatments are of major interest. Differences between the two dialysis treatments have been described in single clinical aspects (e.g., hyperkalemia, volume status, blood pressure control, cardiac complications), the relevance of which are reflected by mortality rates. Data available so far indicate that overall outcome of patients with ESRD is comparable in the two types of dialysis. However, there are significant differences in subgroups of patients, such as those with diabetes or coronary heart disease. In order to achieve the best possible survival and quality of life in ESRD, the optimal sequence of dialysis treatments during the course of renal replacement therapy, rather than a single type of treatment, has to be considered. The \"integrated care concept\" takes into account this sequence of dialysis treatments, suggesting that patients should start on PD but be transferred to hemodialysis as soon as PD is no longer adequate. This concept allows longer preservation of residual renal function, better early survival on dialysis and better short-term results of graft survival after kidney transplantation. Thus, if medically suitable, PD should be the first treatment option in patients with ESRD who need renal replacement therapy."

            "abstract": "When using control-group methodologies, the provision of different forms of treatment, which may vary in efficacy, to similar groups of research subjects must be ethically justified. The conventional justification is the existence of a state of clinical equipoise, defined as a lack of consensus among the expert community on the relative efficacy of the treatments. Control groups are justified when the profession does not know which treatment confers more benefit; otherwise, the provision of treatment known to be less effective than other available treatment is unethical. The concept of equipoise was developed to justify clinical trials of medical interventions. Equipoise has proven a durable standard in studies of interventions that confer benefit regardless of the subject's perception. However, equipoise does not apply when a substantive benefit is conferred by the subject's perception. In psychosocial interventions, a subject's experience of the intervention confers benefit and is used to evaluate benefit. Therefore the subject is in a valid position to prefer one treatment over the other and equipoise does not apply."

When compared to the control group, which received only standard antirejection treatment (SAT) of steroid pulsing and local irradiation, the adjunctive ATG treatment group demonstrated significantly faster recovery rates from rejection as well as better graft survival rates (67% versus 91%, respectively, p = .01) after the first rejection. ATG treatment did not result in fewer subsequent rejection episodes than SAT but long-term allograft survival rates remained significantly superior to controls for the entire 3-year study period. By avoiding ATG treatment in those patients who never experienced clinical rejection on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, i.e. nonresponders (32/130--25%), complications associated with excessive immunosuppression were minimized, i.e., graft and patient survival were 100%. The combined results in a 1-year patient survival of 97% and graft survival of 84%. These results suggest that use of ATG therapeutically for the treatment of rejection is efficacious and may be superior to the prophylactic method of ATG treatment in renal transplant patients."

Secondary outcomes were absence of functional constipation irrespective of laxative use, quality of life, global perceived effect, and costs. Children were recruited from September 2014 to February 2017. Initially, we aimed to include children with recent symptom onset. However, in the first phase of enrollment we were confronted with an unforeseen recruitment problem: many children and their parents refused randomization because physiotherapy was considered too burdensome for the stage of disease.

Currently, only 15% of the world dialysis population is managed by PD. Peritoneal dialysis has many advantages over hemodialysis, and if end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are fully informed about them, the proportion of patients who would prefer this treatment would rise to 25%-30%. An integrated approach to the treatment of ESRD could start with PD in a large percentage of patients, especially those who will receive a kidney transplant within 2 - 3 years.

However, its effectiveness when initiated after ICU discharge has yet to be established.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effectiveness of exercise rehabilitation programmes, initiated after ICU discharge, for functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in adult ICU survivors who have been mechanically ventilated longer than 24 hours.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid SP MEDLINE, Ovid SP EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCO host to 15 May 2014. We used a specific search strategy for each database. This included synonyms for ICU and critical illness, exercise training and rehabilitation. We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted primary authors to obtain further information regarding potentially eligible studies. We also searched major clinical trials registries (Clinical Trials and Current Controlled Trials) and the personal libraries of the review authors. We applied no language or publication restriction. We reran the search in February 2015 and will deal with the three studies of interest when we update the review.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared an exercise intervention initiated after ICU discharge versus any other intervention or a control or 'usual care' programme in adult (≥ 18 years) survivors of critical illness.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included six trials (483 adult ICU participants). Exercise-based interventions were delivered on the ward in two studies; both on the ward and in the community in one study; and in the community in three studies. The duration of the intervention varied according to length of hospital stay following ICU discharge (up to a fixed duration of 12 weeks).Risk of bias was variable for all domains across all trials. High risk of bias was evident in all studies for performance bias, although blinding of participants and personnel in therapeutic rehabilitation trials can be pragmatically challenging. For other domains, at least half of the studies were at low risk of bias. One study was at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias and other sources of bias. Risk of bias was unclear for the remaining studies across domains. We decided not to undertake a meta-analysis because of variation in study design, types of interventions and outcome measurements. We present a narrative description of individual studies for each outcome.All six studies assessed functional exercise capacity, although we noted wide variability in the nature of interventions, outcome measures and associated metrics and data reporting. Overall quality of the evidence was very low. Individually, three studies reported positive results in favour of the intervention. One study found a small short-term benefit in anaerobic threshold (mean difference (MD) 1.8 mL O2/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 3.2; P value = 0.02). In a second study, both incremental (MD 4.7, 95% CI 1.69 to 7.75 watts; P value = 0.003) and endurance (MD 4.12, 95% CI 0.68 to 7.56 minutes; P value = 0.021) exercise testing results were improved with intervention. Finally self reported physical function increased significantly following use of a rehabilitation manual (P value = 0.006). Remaining studies found no effect of the intervention.Similar variability was evident with regard to findings for the primary outcome of health-related quality of life. Only two studies evaluated this outcome. Individually, neither study reported differences between intervention and control groups for health-related quality of life due to the intervention. Overall quality of the evidence was very low.Four studies reported rates of withdrawal, which ranged from 0% to 26.5% in control groups, and from 8.2% to 27.6% in intervention groups. The quality of evidence for the effect of the intervention on withdrawal was low. Very low-quality evidence showed rates of adherence with the intervention. Mortality ranging from 0% to 18.8% was reported by all studies. The quality of evidence for the effect of the intervention on mortality was low. Loss to follow-up, as reported in all studies, ranged from 0% to 14% in control groups, and from 0% to 12.5% in intervention groups, with low quality of evidence. Only one non-mortality adverse event was reported across all participants in all studies (a minor musculoskeletal injury), and the quality of the evidence was low.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At this time, we are unable to determine an overall effect on functional exercise capacity, or on health-related quality of life, of an exercise-based intervention initiated after ICU discharge for survivors of critical illness. Meta-analysis of findings was not appropriate because the number of studies and the quantity of data were insufficient. Individual study findings were inconsistent. Some studies reported a beneficial effect of the intervention on functional exercise capacity, and others did not. No effect on health-related quality of life was reported. Methodological rigour was lacking across several domains, influencing the quality of the evidence. Wide variability was noted in the characteristics of interventions, outcome measures and associated metrics and data reporting.If further trials are identified, we may be able to determine the effects of exercise-based intervention following ICU discharge on functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life among survivors of critical illness."

The objective of this analysis was to assess and compare patient-reported health-related quality of life and patient-reported experience with atrial fibrillation care between clinical decision support and control groups. Methods and Results Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level scale, whereas patient-reported experience was assessed using a self-administered satisfaction questionnaire, both assessed at baseline and 12 months. Health utilities were calculated using the Canadian EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level value set. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations were used to compare between groups. Among 1145 patients enrolled in the trial, 717 had complete EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level data at baseline. The mean age of patients was 73.53 years, and 61.87% were men. Mean utilities at baseline were 0.809 (SD, 0.157) and 0.814 (SD, 0.157) for clinical decision support and control groups, respectively. At baseline, most patients in both groups reported being \"very satisfied\" with the care received for their atrial fibrillation. There were no statistically significant differences in utility scores or patient satisfaction between groups at 12 months. Conclusions Health-related quality of life of patients remained stable over 12 months, and there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction or utility scores between clinical decision support and control groups.

            "abstract": "Urea kinetic modelling (UKM) has been proposed as a tool for auditing the adequacy of CAPD and a total fractional daily urea cleared volume (Kt/V) of 0.25 suggested as the minimum adequate level. At the start of CAPD the kidneys contribute significantly to the total clearance and Kt/V often falls below 0.25 as renal function declines. We performed 3-monthly UKM measurements in 56 CAPD patients. These results were used to individualize exchange volume and frequency in an attempt to achieve a Kt/V > 0.25 and compensate for declining renal function in all patients over a study period of 1 year. The mean Kt/V was maintained over 0.29 over the study period. During this time the residual renal component of Kt/V fell significantly from 0.09 (SD +/- 0.07) to 0.06 +/- 0.08 (P < 0.001) while the dialysis component increased significantly from 0.20 +/- 0.05 to 0.24 +/- 0.05 (P < 0.005). This was achieved by increasing the mean daily exchange volume from 8.12 +/- 1.22 to 10.39 +/- 2.68 litres (P < 0.001). After a year, 15 patients had Kt/V < or = 0.25 despite maximum practical exchange volumes. Twelve patients dropped out of the study due to death (4), transplantation (2), and transfer to haemodialysis (6 patients, of whom 4 had frank uraemic toxicity). In most CAPD patients it is possible to compensate for declining renal function by increasing exchange volume, at least over 1 year. However, CAPD was unable to provide Kt/V > 0.25 in 40% of patients, despite individualization of the dialysis prescription."

            "abstract": "The utilization of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been increasing in the past decade owing to various government initiatives and recognition of benefits such as better preservation of residual renal function, quality of life, and lower cost. The Advancing American Kidney Health initiative aims to increase the utilization of home therapies such as PD and kidney transplantation to treat end stage kidney disease (ESKD). A natural consequence of this development is that more patients will receive PD, and many will eventually undergo kidney transplantation. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of pretransplant PD on posttransplant outcomes such as delayed graft function (DGF), rejection, thrombosis, graft, and patient survival. Furthermore, some of these patients may develop DGF, which raises the question of the utility of PD during DGF and its risks. Although transplant is the best renal replacement therapy option, it is not everlasting, and many transplant recipients must go on dialysis after allograft failure. Can PD be a good option for these patients? This is another critical question. Furthermore, a significant proportion of nonrenal solid organ transplant recipients develop ESKD. Is PD feasible in this group? In this review, we try to address all of these questions in the light of available evidence."

Fish oils are rich in very long chain omega-3 fatty acids, which may reduce nephrotoxicity by improving endothelial function and reduce rejection rates through their immuno-modulatory effects. They may also modify the cardiovascular risk profile. Hence, fish oils may potentially prolong graft survival and reduce cardiovascular mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of fish oil treatment in ameliorating the kidney and cardiovascular adverse effects of CNI-based immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register (up to 17 March 2016) through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of fish oils in kidney transplant recipients on a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen.

Heterogeneity was assessed using a Chi(2) test on n-1 degrees of freedom and the I(2) statistic.

All studies were small and had variable methodology. Fish oil did not significantly affect patient or graft survival, acute rejection rates, or calcineurin inhibitor toxicity when compared to placebo. Overall SCr was significantly lower in the fish oil group compared to placebo (5 studies, 237 participants: MD -30.63 µmol/L, 95% CI -59.74 to -1.53; I(2) = 88%). In the subgroup analysis, this was only significant in the long-course (six months or more) group (4 studies, 157 participants: MD -37.41 µmol/L, 95% CI -69.89 to -4.94; I(2) = 82%). Fish oil treatment was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure (4 studies, 200 participants: MD -4.53 mm Hg, 95% CI -7.60 to -1.45) compared to placebo. Patients receiving fish oil for more than six months had a modest increase in HDL (5 studies, 178 participants: MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.21; I(2) = 47%) compared to placebo. Fish oil effects on lipids were not significantly different from low-dose statins. There was insufficient data to analyse cardiovascular outcomes. Fishy aftertaste and gastrointestinal upset were common but did not result in significant patient drop-out.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is insufficient evidence from currently available RCTs to recommend fish oil therapy to improve kidney function, rejection rates, patient survival or graft survival. The improvements in HDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were too modest to recommend routine use. To determine a benefit in clinical outcomes, future RCTs will need to be adequately powered with these outcomes in mind."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) remain reliable substitutes for permanent hemodialysis access in scenarios that preclude the placement of native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). The majority of AVGs are constructed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), which is relatively inexpensive and readily available, but synthetic AVGs have poor patency rates. On the other hand, biologic grafts confer an advantage by virtue of their inherent similarity to the native human vasculature. However, evidence to support the current preference of synthetic conduits over biologic grafts in clinical practice is scarce. The aim of this protocol is to propose a contemporary re-evaluation and comparison between ePTFE and bovine carotid artery (BCA) grafts.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This prospective randomized controlled trial is being conducted at an academic hospital center. A total of 100 patients at least 18 years of age and undergoing AVG placement will be recruited and prospectively randomized into two parallel groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients eligible to receive AVF and those with a known allergic reaction or history of intolerance to any ePTFE or BCA component will not be included in the study. Moreover, patients with a recent active infection at the site of previous AVG placement and patients with a bleeding disorder, an active malignant disease, or a life expectancy <1 year or who refuse blood transfusion and pregnant women will be excluded. Patients will receive either BCA (experimental) or standard ePTFE grafts (control) in compliance with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for AVG creation. Primary end points include primary, primary assisted, secondary, and functional patency at 1 year and 2 years after graft placement. Secondary outcomes include complications (pseudoaneurysms, infections, and steal syndrome) and reintervention rates during the first and second postoperative years. Outcomes will be assessed and documented every 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Once the study is completed, analysis of the data will be performed using univariate methods, and Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses will be employed to evaluate and to compare outcomes between BCA and ePTFE over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The creation of a functional and durable dialysis vascular access is crucial in the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease and is a challenging quest for vascular surgeons. The proposed study compares the outcomes of synthetic and biologic AVG options in patients who are poor candidates for a native AVF.

The Hemodialysis (HEMO) trial, a randomized trial to determine whether increasing urea removal to the maximum practical degree through a 3-times-a-week schedule, showed no difference in mortality in the treatment and control groups. Investigators speculated that the increment in functional waste removal in the HEMO study was too small to produce improvements in mortality. To test this hypothesis, the NIDDK funded the Frequent Hemodialysis Network, a consortium of centers testing whether patients randomized to intensive dialysis would demonstrate improved (reduced) left ventricular LV mass and quality of life. The trial has two arms: the daily (in-center) and the home (nocturnal) arms. Each arm has patients randomized to conventional dialysis or 6 days (or nights) of dialysis.

However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and improve prognosis. Cardiac rehabilitation is a complex multifaceted intervention which aims to improve the health outcomes of people with CHD. Cardiac rehabilitation consists of three core modalities: education, exercise training and psychological support. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011, which aims to investigate the specific impact of the educational component of cardiac rehabilitation.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      1.

Two independent reviewers extracted outcome data onto a standardised collection form. For dichotomous variables, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived for each outcome. Heterogeneity amongst included studies was explored qualitatively and quantitatively. Where appropriate and possible, results from included studies were combined for each outcome to give an overall estimate of treatment effect. Given the degree of clinical heterogeneity seen in participant selection, interventions and comparators across studies, we decided it was appropriate to pool studies using random-effects modelling. We planned to undertake subgroup analysis and stratified meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression to examine potential treatment effect modifiers. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to evaluate the quality of the evidence and the GRADE profiler (GRADEpro GDT) to create summary of findings tables.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      This updated review included a total of 22 trials which randomised 76,864 people with CHD to an education intervention or a 'no education' comparator. Nine new trials (8215 people) were included for this update. We judged most included studies as low risk of bias across most domains. Educational 'dose' ranged from one 40 minute face-to-face session plus a 15 minute follow-up call, to a four-week residential stay with 11 months of follow-up sessions. Control groups received usual medical care, typically consisting of referral to an outpatient cardiologist, primary care physician, or both.We found evidence of no difference in effect of education-based interventions on total mortality (13 studies, 10,075 participants; 189/5187 (3.6%) versus 222/4888 (4.6%); random effects risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.05; moderate quality evidence). Individual causes of mortality were reported rarely, and we were unable to report separate results for cardiovascular mortality or non-cardiovascular mortality. There was evidence of no difference in effect of education-based interventions on fatal and/or non fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (2 studies, 209 participants; 7/107 (6.5%) versus 12/102 (11.8%); random effects RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.48; very low quality of evidence). However, there was some evidence of a reduction with education in fatal and/or non-fatal cardiovascular events (2 studies, 310 studies; 21/152 (13.8%) versus 61/158 (38.6%); random effects RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56; low quality evidence). There was evidence of no difference in effect of education on the rate of total revascularisations (3 studies, 456 participants; 5/228 (2.2%) versus 8/228 (3.5%); random effects RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.71; very low quality evidence) or hospitalisations (5 studies, 14,849 participants; 656/10048 (6.5%) versus 381/4801 (7.9%); random effects RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; very low quality evidence).

Although some health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domain scores were higher with education, there was no consistent evidence of superiority across all domains.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found no reduction in total mortality, in people who received education delivered as part of cardiac rehabilitation, compared to people in control groups (moderate quality evidence). There were no improvements in fatal or non fatal MI, total revascularisations or hospitalisations, with education. There was some evidence of a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal cardiovascular events with education, but this was based on only two studies. There was also some evidence to suggest that education-based interventions may improve HRQoL. Our findings are supportive of current national and international clinical guidelines that cardiac rehabilitation for people with CHD should be comprehensive and include educational interventions together with exercise and psychological therapy. Further definitive research into education interventions for people with CHD is needed."

The present study aimed to compare the neurocognitive performance, functional outcome, and QoL of remitted and non-remitted patients with SC with respect to a group of euthymic patients with BD, and a control group. It included 655 subjects: 98 patients with schizophrenia in remission (SC-R), 184 non-remitted patients with schizophrenia (SC-NR), 117 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD), and 256 healthy subjects. A comprehensive clinical, neurocognitive (six cognitive domains), functional, and QoL assessment was carried out. Remission criteria of Andreasen were used to classify schizophrenia patients as remitted or non-remitted. Compared with control subjects all groups of patients showed impaired neurocognitive performance, functioning and QoL. SC-R patients had an intermediate functioning between control subjects and SC-NR, all at a neurocognitive, functional, or QoL level. There were no significant differences between SC-R and BD. These results suggest that reaching clinical remission is essential to achieve a better level of psychosocial functioning, and QoL. Likewise, the results of this study suggest that euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia in remission are comparable at the neurocognitive and functional levels, which might have implications in the pathophysiology of both disorders."

Home wound care was standardized and patients were followed for a minimum of four or five days. Infection was assessed clinically. Seventy-six patients were enrolled and 62 completed the study. Penicillin (30) and placebo (32) groups were similar in all parameters except wound etiology; assault was more common in the placebo group (P = .02). Two infections occurred in patients receiving penicillin, and six infections were seen among placebo-treated patients (P = .05, beta = 0.17). When patients poorly compliant with therapy were eliminated from analysis, none of the penicillin-treated patients and five of the placebo-treated patients developed infections (P = .027). Our data suggest that patients with intraoral wounds may benefit from prophylactic penicillin if compliant with their therapy. More studies are needed to further delineate the usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics for these wounds."

EPS survivors were invited for review of symptoms, nutritional assessment and evaluation of quality of life. Radiological progression was assessed based on serial computed tomography (CT) scores for each patient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 23 patients with a diagnosis of EPS for at least 5 years were identified, with 18 patients alive at the time of the study. Of these 18 patients, 10 patients transferred to haemodialysis (HD) and 8 patients received kidney transplants. Commonest symptoms were nausea (91%) and vomiting (73%). Mean body mass index for patients was within the ideal and healthy range, with only 11% suffering from continued weight loss. In all, 70% EPS survivors on HD received nutritional support compared to 15% of those with transplants; 17% required ongoing parenteral nutrition. Of the 11 patients with serial CT scans at least 4 years apart, 10 had an increase in radiological score for EPS but with no apparent correlation to clinical outcomes. There were no significant differences in the reported quality of life between EPS survivors on HD and those transplanted, with self-rated health status equivalent to that reported for the general end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Long-term survival following EPS managed conservatively with nutritional support is feasible, with the majority no longer requiring nutritional support and having a quality of life similar to other patients with ESKD."

            "abstract": "University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is now commonly used as a single-flush solution during multiorgan procurement for effective preservation of all intraabdominal organs including the kidney. Many kidneys from single kidney donors are still preserved in Eurocollins solution and the question is whether preservation in UW solution is more cost-effective. A European randomized multicenter trial was organized by the Department of Surgery of Leiden University in close cooperation with Eurotransplant to study the efficacy of UW solution as compared with EC solution. On the basis of this trial we found that at three months after transplant 92.4% of the patients in the UW group had a functioning graft in comparison with 88.4% in the EC group (similar figures after one year were 88.2% and 82.5%, P approximately 0.04), while health care expenditure during these first three months was on average US$ 700 lower for the UW group than for the EC group, taking into account the price difference in the preservation fluids. The long-term benefits of using UW solution as compared with EC solution were conservatively estimated at US$ 7000 per patient reflecting the additional expenses for dialysis in the EC group. We concluded that the extra costs of using UW solution instead of EC solution (US$ 230 per kidney) can be easily earned back within three months and that the long-term savings of such a strategy are considerable. Moreover, the health status of patients in the UW group is expected to be better on the average than in the EC group. Simply reacting to the price tag of the UW solution may be penny-wise but pound-foolish."

It is characterized by a progressive, intra-abdominal, inflammatory process resulting in sheets of fibrous tissue that cover, bind, and constrict the viscera, thereby compromising the motility and function of the bowel. Although recent therapeutic approaches have been reported with variable success, the ability to detect reliably at an early stage patients at risk for EPS would be beneficial and allow treatment standardization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of EPS and identify possible risk factors for its development in CAPD and APD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a review of all cases of EPS in a single center over the last 5 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 810 CAPD and APD patients, managed in our program over this period.

Sixteen cases required surgical treatment and were classified as severe; others were treated conservatively (mild to moderate group). Ten patients received tamoxifen treatment with apparent benefit. The overall mortality rate was 29.6%. Eight patients from the severe group and the entire moderate group survived on hemodialysis or transplantation at 48.71 and 27.63 months follow-up, respectively. Peritonitis rates were not different between the 2 groups and peritoneal history was unremarkable compared to overall peritonitis rates in the unit.

Most cases had PD duration of more than 4 years. Careful monitoring by CT scans of the peritoneal membrane in patients beyond 5 years, and early catheter removal in patients with peritoneal thickening should be considered for long-term CAPD patients. Treatment with tamoxifen may be of benefit in these patients."

            "title": "A rapid and systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of topotecan for ovarian cancer.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Ovarian cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer with an annual incidence of 21.6 per 100,000 in England and Wales. Due to the often asymptomatic nature of the early stages of the disease, most cases are not detected until the advanced stages. Consequently, the prognosis after diagnosis is poor and the 5-year survival rate in the UK is only about 30%. Current recommendations suggest that first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer should involve paclitaxel and platinum (Pt)-based therapy (cisplatin/ carboplatin), however, most patients develop resistant or refractory disease and require second-line therapy. Patients may respond to re-challenge with Pt-agents if the treatment-free interval is > 6 months, but an alternative is often required. Topotecan is one of six drugs currently licensed in the UK for second-line therapy, and recent reviews suggest that it has modest efficacy in the treatment of advanced disease and performs favourably against paclitaxel. However, these reviews are based on a limited number of reports mainly consisting of non-randomised Phase I and II studies.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives of the review:\n        \n      \n      To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral and intravenous topotecan (Hycamtin, SmithKline Beecham, UK) for the treatment of all stages of ovarian cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen electronic databases from inception to September 2000 and Internet resources were searched, in addition to the bibliographies of retrieved articles and submissions from pharmaceutical companies.\n    \n\n\n          Inclusion and exclusion criteria:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts and included/excluded studies based on full copies of manuscripts. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and full economic evaluations comparing topotecan to non-topotecan regimens were included. All stages of therapy and disease were considered, and the outcomes included were survival, response, symptom relief, quality of life, adverse effects and costs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      DATA EXTRACTION STRATEGY: Data were extracted into an Access database by one reviewer and checked by a second. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      QUALITY ASSESSMENT STRATEGY: Two reviewers, using specified criteria, independently assessed the quality of the clinical effectiveness studies and the economic evaluations. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ANALYSIS STRATEGY: Due to the limited number of studies included in the review and the fact that they compared topotecan with different comparators, the out-come data could not be pooled statistically. Clinical effectiveness data are discussed separately under the different outcome subheadings. For time-to-event data, hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals are presented where available, and for the remaining outcomes, relative risks are reported or calculated where sufficient data were available. Relative risk data are also presented in the form of Forest plots without pooled estimates. Economic data are presented in the form of a summary and critique of the evidence, and a grading (A-I) assigned to each study indicating the direction and magnitude of the cost-effectiveness data.\n    \n\n\n          Included studies:\n        \n      \n      A total of 568 titles/abstracts were identified and screened for relevance. Full copies of 72 papers were assessed and seven published manuscripts reporting details of two studies of clinical effectiveness and one economic evaluation were included. Further details of the two clinical effectiveness studies and two new economic evaluations were identified from confidential company submissions. Overall, two international multicentre RCTs of effectiveness comparing topotecan with paclitaxel (trial 039) and topotecan with caelyx (trial 30-49) were included in the review. The three economic evaluations included in the review comprised one cost-minimisation analysis (CMA) comparing topotecan with caelyx, one cost-consequences analysis (CCA) comparing topotecan with paclitaxel, etoposide and altretamine and one cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing topotecan with paclitaxel.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      QUALITY OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS DATA: Both clinical effectiveness studies (trial 30-49 and 039) were of reasonable quality, although it was unclear whether either performed valid intention-to-treat analyses. In addition, trial 30-49 failed to state whether the outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS --QUALITY OF ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS: The CCA (comparing topotecan with three comparators) was of poor quality and of little relevance to the UK NHS. The CMA and CEA were of reasonable quality overall and relevant to the UK NHS. However, both, in particular the CEA, suffered from methodological problems, and thus their findings should be interpreted with caution.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS: The assessment of clinical effectiveness was based on limited data. Only two trials with a total of 709 participants were identified. In general, with a few minor exceptions, there were no statistically significant differences between topotecan and paclitaxel, or topotecan and caelyx in survival, response rate, median time to response, median duration of response and quality of life. Significant differences that were reported were mainly identified in subgroup analyses (Pt-sensitive disease and disease without ascites) of questionable validity and their relevance to a general advanced ovarian cancer patient population undergoing second-line chemotherapy is unclear. However, statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse effects. Topotecan was associated with increased incidences of haematological toxicities (including neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia), alopecia, nausea and vomiting. Caelyx-treated patients suffered from significantly increased incidences of Palmar-Plantar erythrodysesthesia, stomatitis, mucous membrane disorders and skin rashes. Paclitaxel was associated with significant increases in alopecia, arthralgia, myalgia, neuropathy, paraesthesiae, skeletal pain and flushing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS: The assessment of cost-effectiveness was also based on limited data, with three evaluations identified, one of which was not relevant. The two remaining studies, comparing topotecan with paclitaxel (CEA) and topotecan with caelyx (CMA), both used effectiveness data from multicentre RCTs and based their costs on 1999/2000 UK sources. The evaluations were conducted from a UK NHS perspective and findings presented in GB pounds/Euros. Topotecan for the second-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer was shown to be more cost-effective than paclitaxel (32,513 GB pounds versus 46,186 GB pounds per person in terms of any response (complete or partial), incremental cost-effectiveness = 3065 GB pounds) in all respects except cost per time without toxicity or symptoms, but less cost-effective than caelyx (14,023 GB pounds versus 9979 GB pounds per person regardless of whether the patient responded). However, direct comparisons of the cost findings between the two studies is difficult because they used different designs, different time horizons for the cost analyses and the findings were presented as costs per person for only patients who responded in one study (topotecan versus paclitaxel) and costs per person regardless of whether they responded in the other study (topotecan versus caelyx).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review indicates that there is little evidence in the form of RCTs on which to base an assessment of the effectiveness of topotecan as second-line therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. The evidence suggests there were no statistically significant differences overall between topotecan and paclitaxel, or topotecan and caelyx in clinical outcomes. However, statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse effects. The clinical significance of the findings is not discussed. Overall, the effects of topotecan could at best be described as modest, but the alternative agents offer no real advantages except fewer side-effects and possibly improved cost-effectiveness. Both of the clinical effectiveness studies on which this evidence is based had methodological flaws, the most serious being the lack of a blinded assessor in the topotecan versus caelyx trial, which is important for unbiased assessment of response outcomes. The economic evaluations also suffered from a number of potential problems.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further good quality RCTs and CEAs are required comparing topotecan with other licensed and potentially useful (soon to be licensed) second-line treatments for ovarian cancer. At present, it is difficult to make any decisions about topotecan and other drugs for second-line therapy without good quality direct comparisons. In view of the ongoing studies identified, an update of the current review should be considered in approximately 18 months (Summer 2002) or possibly sooner if the recently commissioned National Institute for Clinical Excellence review of caelyx for ovarian cancer identifies additional data relevant to topotecan."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Treament-related diarrhoea is one of the most common and troublesome adverse effects related to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in people with cancer. Its reported incidence has been as high as 50% to 80%. Severe treatment-related diarrhoea can lead to fluid and electrolyte losses and nutritional deficiencies and could adversely affect quality of life (QoL). It is also associated with increased risk of infection in people with neutropenia due to anticancer therapy and often leads to treatment delays, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuation. Probiotics may be effective in preventing or treating chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced diarrhoea.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and side effects of probiotics used alone or combined with other agents for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhoea in people with cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 2, 2017), and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 30). We also searched prospective clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of probiotics for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhoea in people with cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used random-effects models for all meta-analyses. If meta-analysis was not possible, we summarised the results narratively.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 12 studies involving 1554 participants. Eleven studies were prevention studies, of which seven compared probiotics with placebo (887 participants), one compared two doses of probiotics with each other and with placebo (246 participants), and three compared probiotics with another active agent (216 participants).The remaining study assessed the effectiveness of probiotics compared with placebo for treatment of radiotherapy-related diarrhoea (205 participants).For prevention of radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy)-induced diarrhoea, review authors identified five heterogeneous placebo-controlled studies (with 926 participants analysed). Owing to heterogeneity, we could not carry out a meta-analysis, except for two outcomes. For occurrence of any diarrhoea, risk ratios (RRs) ranged from 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.47) to 1.0 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.06) (three studies; low-certainty evidence). A beneficial effect of probiotics on quality of life could neither be demonstrated nor refuted (two studies; low-certainty evidence). For occurrence of grade 2 or higher diarrhoea, the pooled RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.03; four studies; 420 participants; low-certainty evidence), and for grade 3 or higher diarrhoea, RRs ranged from 0.11 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.23) to 1.24 (95% CI 0.74 to 2.08) (three studies; low-certainty evidence). For probiotic users, time to rescue medication was 36 hours longer in one study (95% CI 34.7 to 37.3), but another study reported no difference (moderate-certainty evidence). For the need for rescue medication, the pooled RR was 0.50 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.66; three studies; 194 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported major differences between groups with respect to adverse effects. Although not mentioned explicitly, no studies reported deaths, except one in which one participant in the probiotics group died of myocardial infarction after three sessions of radiotherapy.Three placebo-controlled studies, with 128 analysed participants, addressed prevention of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. For occurrence of any diarrhoea, the pooled RR was 0.59 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.96; two studies; 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other outcomes, a beneficial effect of probiotics could be neither demonstrated nor refuted (one to two studies; 46 to 106 participants; all low-certainty evidence). Studies did not address quality of life nor time to rescue medication.Three studies compared probiotics with another intervention in 213 participants treated with radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy). One very small study (21 participants) reported less diarrhoea six weeks after treatment when dietary counselling was provided (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.81; very low-certainty evidence). In another study (148 participants), grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea occurred less often in the probiotics group than in the control group (guar gum containing nutritional supplement) (odds ratio (OR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.89; low-certainty evidence), and two studies (63 participants) found less need for rescue medication of probiotics versus another active treatment (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86; very low-certainty evidence). Studies did not address quality of life nor time to rescue medication.One placebo-controlled study with 205 participants addressed treatment for radiotherapy-induced diarrhoea and could not demonstrate or refute a beneficial effect of probiotics on average diarrhoea grade, time to rescue medication for diarrhoea (13 hours longer in the probiotics group; 95% CI -0.9 to 26.9 hours), or need for rescue medication (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.03; moderate-certainty evidence). This study did not address quality of life.No studies reported serious adverse events or diarrhoea-related deaths.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review presents limited low- or very low-certainty evidence supporting the effects of probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhoea related to radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) or chemotherapy alone, need for rescue medication, or occurrence of adverse events. All studies were underpowered and heterogeneous. Severe side effects were absent from all studies.Robust evidence on this topic must be provided by future methodologically well-designed trials."

            "abstract": "Peritonitis remains a common clinical problem for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). There are, however, retrospective studies with historical controls that suggest that biocompatible PD solutions may reduce the rates of peritonitis. We conducted a randomized controlled study comparing the use of biocompatible and conventional solutions, accumulating over 7000 patient-months experience. We included peritonitis episodes from patients who discontinued PD during the follow-up period. The study was powered to detect a reduction in the peritonitis rate of over half in the 267 randomized patients in demographically similar groups. There were no intergroup differences in PD technique survival irrespective of whether the outcome was censored for death. Peritonitis-free survival was 26.7 months using conventional compared to 23.1 months using biocompatible PD solutions. The peritonitis rates were also not statistically different when measured in patient-months. Thus, despite the finding of non-randomized studies suggesting benefits of the biocompatible PD solutions, we could not detect any clinically significant advantages in terms of technique survival or peritonitis. Although our study is the largest randomized study comparing different PD solutions to date, we do not exclude the possibility that our results are a consequence of the lack of statistical power. Meta-analysis of randomized control trials in this field is essential."

This study aimed to completely revise the epidemiological data collected during the first 5 yrs (1996-2001) of RIDT activity to evaluate the trends of the main epidemiological features. During this period, regional registries were not always able to assure complete and exhaustive information according to RIDT requirements, owing to different levels of organization and functioning. To avoid any possible error in data analysis, information inadequately assessed was refused. The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Italy has increased from 114 pmp in 1996 to 139 pmp in 2001, that means an increase of 3.5%/yr, corresponding to 5718 patients during 1996 and 8000 patients during 2001. Primary renal diseases (according to the EDTA) in incident ESRD patients are vascular and diabetic nephropathy. Main dialysis modality in incident patients was hemodialysis (HD) (85%), while peritoneal dialysis (PD) was only 15%; pre-emptive transplantation was a very unusual modality. The prevalence of ESRD patients at 31 December was 693 pmp in 1996 and 827 pmp in 2001; among dialysis patients, the corresponding rates were 575 pmp and 657 pmp, respectively. Consequently, the number of dialyzed patients increased, respectively, from 28892 to 37919. The prevalent dialysis modality was bicarbonate dialysis in 74% of cases, followed by hemodiafiltration (HDF) in 15%, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 7% and APD in 3%.

The primary outcomes of the review were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and number of hospital admissions.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-nine studies were included. Twenty-three studies on 3189 participants compared self management versus usual care; six studies on 499 participants compared different components of self management on a head-to-head basis. Although we included non-randomised controlled clinical trials as well as RCTs in this review, we restricted the primary analysis to RCTs only and reported these trials in the abstract.In the 23 studies with a usual care control group, follow-up time ranged from two to 24 months. The content of the interventions was diverse. A statistically relevant effect of self management on HRQoL was found (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, mean difference (MD) -3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.37 to -1.65, 10 studies, 1413 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Self management also led to a lower probability of respiratory-related hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75, nine studies, 1749 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Over one year of follow-up, eight (95% CI 5 to 14) participants with a high baseline risk of respiratory-related hospital admission needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one hospital admission, and 20 (95% CI 15 to 35) participants with a low baseline risk of hospitalisation needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one respiratory-related hospital admission.No statistically significant effect of self management on all-cause hospitalisation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.30, 6 studies, 1365 participants, low-quality evidence) or mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.07, 8 studies, 2134 participants, very low-quality evidence) was detected. Also, dyspnoea measured by the (modified) Medical Research Council Scale ((m)MRC) was reduced in individuals who participated in self management (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.30, 3 studies, 119 participants, low-quality evidence). The difference in exercise capacity as measured by the six-minute walking test was not statistically significant (MD 33.69 m, 95% CI -9.12 to 76.50, 6 studies, 570 participants, very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses depending on the use of an exercise programme as part of the intervention revealed no statistically significant differences between studies with and without exercise programmes in our primary outcomes of HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions.We were unable to pool head-to-head trials because of heterogeneity among interventions and controls; thus results are presented narratively within the review.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improved health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, a reduction in respiratory-related hospital admissions, and improvement in dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC. No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters. However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures makes it difficult to formulate clear recommendations regarding the most effective form and content of self management in COPD."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dialysis can be life-saving for patients with end-stage renal failure. However, not only is it associated with significant morbidity and a greater mortality than transplantation, but it is also expensive. Therefore renal transplantation is generally regarded as the treatment of choice for patients in whom this form of renal replacement therapy is appropriate. Transplantation usually takes place after a variable period of dialytic therapy, but pre-emptive kidney transplantation (PKT) has established itself as an attractive alternative.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      1463 consecutive first kidney transplants performed between January 1980 and December 1995 in a single centre were analysed. The 161 patients (11%) transplanted without prior dialysis were compared with the 1302 patients who had been dialysed prior to being transplanted. The pre-emptive group did not differ from the dialysis group in respect of donor age, donor and recipient gender, HLA mismatch, or cold ischaemic time, although there were more live donor transplants within the pre-emptive group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Delayed graft function occurred more frequently in the dialysis group (25% vs 16%) but more patients experienced an acute rejection episode in the pre-emptive group (67 vs 55%). The actuarial graft survival in the pre-emptive group at 1, 5, and 10 years (84, 76 and 67%) was significantly higher than the respective values in the dialysis group (83, 69, and 56%). Within the live donor recipient cohort the survival advantage for the pre-emptive group was even more striking.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pre-emptive kidney transplantation not only avoids the risks, cost, and inconvenience of dialysis, but is also associated with better graft survival than transplantation after a period of dialysis, particularly within the live donor cohort."

It has also been found that serum VAP-1 was elevated in acute and chronic hyperglycemia and in patients with diabetes as well as in chronic kidney disease. Renalase, with possible monoamine oxidase activity, which breaks down catecholamines such as SSAO, is expressed in the endothelium as well as in the kidney. The aim of the study was to assess serum VAP-1 levels in peritoneally dialyzed (PD) patients and factors explaining its variability. This pilot study was performed on 25 peritoneally dialyzed patients, including 4 patients with type 2 diabetes. We found that the mean VAP-1 was significantly higher in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients when compared to the control group (p<0.05). Dopamine was significantly lower in PD patients when compared to the healthy volunteers (p<0.05), whereas noradrenaline was significantly higher in PD patients relative to the healthy volunteers (p<0.01). There was a significant difference in the VAP-1 concentration in the group with and without residual renal function (p<0.05) as well as between 10 patients with hyperglycemia when compared to patients with normoglycemia (p<0.05). There was no effect of gender on the serum VAP-1 levels. In PD patients VAP-1 correlated with systolic blood pressure (r=-0.4, p<005), residual renal function (r=-0.62, p<0.05), and glucose (=0.54, p<0.05). We concluded that VAP-1, elevated in patients on PD, was predominantly dependent on residual kidney function and glucose level, factors both linked to endothelial damage and cardiovascular complications."

            "abstract": "The postpericardiotomy syndrome occurs in 10% to 40% of patients who undergo open-heart surgery. Its frequency is reportedly decreased when pericardial drainage is used. To challenge this, 50 consecutive patients (1 was disqualified) were randomly assigned to two groups: one in which only the anterior mediastinum was drained (group 1) and the other in which the anterior mediastinum and posterior pericardium were drained (group 2). The surgical procedures performed were: coronary artery bypass grafting in 14 patients, valve surgery in 23 and repair of congenital defects in 12. The two groups were similar with respect to age and the volume of blood drained. Significant differences were found only for the duration of bypass and volume of blood given. At 7 to 10 days there were no differences in the frequency of fever, thoracic pain or presence of arthralgia. Findings were similar in both groups for leukocyte count, sedimentation rate, serum lactic dehydrogenase value and for the frequency of positive blood, urine and sputum cultures. Six patients (three in each group) had a postpericardiotomy syndrome that required steroid treatment and prolonged hospitalization for 10 more days. However, none had postpericardiotomy syndrome complicating coronary artery bypass surgery. None of the patients had cardiac tamponade. This study demonstrates that pericardial drainage has no effect on the frequency of postpericardiotomy syndrome and appears to be unnecessary after open-heart surgery."

Combining steroids plus renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors lowered the risk of progression to ESKD (2 studies, 160 participants: RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.59) and reduced urinary protein excretion (1 study, 38 participants: MD -0.20 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.14) compared with RAS inhibitors or steroids alone.

Evidence for treatment effects of immunosuppressive agents on mortality, infection, and cancer is generally sparse or low-quality and insufficient to guide clinical practice. Available RCTs are few, small, have high risk of bias - particularly selective reporting - and generally do not systematically identify treatment-related harms. Subgroup analyses to identify specific patient characteristics that might predict better response to therapy were not possible. Larger placebo-controlled studies of corticosteroid therapy or mycophenolate mofetil which are sufficiently powered to evaluate patient-relevant end points including adverse events and that examine the optimal duration of treatment are now required in populations with IgAN with a range of kidney function."

While people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self manage their disease, it has been shown that patients' disease-related knowledge is poor, therefore guidelines recommend clear and concise high-quality information at all stages of the disease.

The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings. Topics included disease-modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. The active intervention components included decision aids, decision coaching, educational programmes, self care programmes, and personal interviews with physicians. All studies used one or more components, but the number and extent differed markedly between studies. The studies had a variable risk of bias. We did not perform meta-analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity. All five studies assessing MS-related knowledge (505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions, indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants' knowledge. There were mixed results on decision making (five studies, 793 participants; low-certainty evidence) and quality of life (six studies, 671 participants; low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were detected in the seven studies reporting this outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease-related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. The included studies in this review reported no negative side effects of providing disease-related information to people with MS.

The features of old age and frailty make it difficult to cope with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Evidence exists that quality of life is better on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, yet the majority of older patients are placed on hemodialysis. Older patients should therefore receive appropriate education to enable choice of the appropriate dialysis modality for their lifestyle. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis will enable those who cannot perform their own dialysis to have their treatment at home. Delaying dialysis to a time when it is actually needed and discussing the option of conservative care will also improve the quality of the end-of-life phase for patients with multiple comorbidities and with a poor overall prognosis."

For ongoing or unpublished clinical trials, we searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the ISRCTN registry. To identify economic evaluation studies, we conducted a separate search to 31 March 2015 of the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and from March 2015 to October 2018 on MEDLINE and Embase.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials involving adults with chronic non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy due to a left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35% or less (New York Heart Association (NYHA) type I-IV). Participants in the intervention arm should have received ICD in addition to optimal medical therapy, while those in the control arm received optimal medical therapy alone. We included studies with cardiac resynchronisation therapy when it was appropriately balanced in the experimental and control groups.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death, and adverse events associated with the intervention. The secondary outcomes were non-cardiovascular death, health-related quality of life, hospitalisation for heart failure, first ICD-related hospitalisation, and cost. We abstracted the log (hazard ratio) and its variance from trial reports for time-to-event survival data. We extracted the raw data necessary to calculate the risk ratio. We summarised data on quality of life and cost-effectiveness narratively. We assessed the certainty of evidence for all outcomes using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified six eligible randomised trials with a total of 3128 participants. The use of ICD plus optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone decreases the risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92; participants = 3128; studies = 6; high-certainty evidence). An average of 24 patients need to be treated with ICD to prevent one additional death from any cause (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 24). Individuals younger than 65 derive more benefit than individuals older than 65 (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.91; participants = 348; studies = 1) (NNTB = 10). When added to medical therapy, ICDs probably decrease cardiovascular mortality compared to not adding them (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.21; participants = 1781; studies = 4; moderate-certainty evidence) (possibility of both plausible benefit and no effect). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was also found to decrease sudden cardiac deaths (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.70; participants = 1677; studies = 3; high-certainty evidence). An average of 25 patients need to be treated with an ICD to prevent one additional sudden cardiac death (NNTB = 25). We found that ICDs probably increase adverse events (possibility of both plausible harm and benefit), but likely have little or no effect on non-cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.68; participants = 1781; studies = 4; moderate-certainty evidence) (possibility of both plausible benefit and no effect). Finally, using ICD therapy probably has little or no effect on quality of life, however shocks from the device cause a deterioration in quality of life. No study reported the outcome of first ICD-related hospitalisations.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of ICD in addition to medical therapy in people with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy decreases all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac deaths and probably decreases mortality from cardiovascular causes compared to medical therapy alone. Their use probably increases the risk for adverse events. However, these devices come at a high cost, and shocks from ICDs cause a deterioration in quality of life."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent and often associated with meniscal tear. Physical therapy (PT) and exercise regimens are often used to treat OA or meniscal tear, but, to date, few programs have been designed specifically for conservative treatment of meniscal tear with concomitant knee OA. Clinical care and research would be enhanced by a standardized, evidence-based, conservative treatment program and the ability to study the effects of the contextual factors associated with interventions for patients with painful, degenerative meniscal tears in the setting of OA. This paper describes the process of developing both a PT intervention and a home exercise program for a randomized controlled clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of these interventions for patients with knee pain, meniscal tear and concomitant OA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This paper describes the process utilized by an interdisciplinary team of physical therapists, physicians, and researchers to develop and refine a standardized in-clinic PT intervention, and a standardized home exercise program to be carried out without PT supervision.

A systematic literature review was conducted on RCTs that compared CHMAT, i.e., Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) plus pharmacotherapy (PT), versus the same PT alone in the treatment of CVA. All included trials were assessed for quality and risk bias and analyzed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook based on the Review Manager 5.3 software program. Twenty studies were identified and the CHMAT group had a positive effect on the total effective rate and a lower recurrence rate compared with the control group. CHMAT may have positive effects on CVA, leading to better improvement in disorders of cough and asthma and less adverse effects. However, the methodology and reporting quality of current studies are generally low. Further studies should include larger sample sizes with a strict design to confirm these findings."

However, peritonitis due to Cunninghamella (C.) bertholletiae, a fungus of the class Zygomycetes, is rare. We present a case of fungal peritonitis in a patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis due to kidney rejection. Direct examination of the patient's peritoneal fluid showed fungal hyphae, and the culture was identified as C. bertholletiae. A cumulative dose of 1,600 mg fluconazole was given to the patient intraperitoneally over a one-week period. When his condition had stabilised, oral antifungal treatment was administered for two weeks. After removal of the Tenckhoff catheter, the patient was discharged with arteriovenous fistulation for haemodialysis. Zygomycosis due to C. bertholletiae is often fatal and non-responsive to systemic antifungal therapy. This case is the first from India with a successful outcome, and highlights the importance of early detection and intervention for successful outcome of peritonitis caused by C. bertholletiae."

After randomization, patients in the statin-cessation strategy are instructed to withdraw their treatment. In the comparison strategy, patients continue their statin treatment at the usual dosage.

The review was updated using the EPOC trials register in August 2002.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare discharge planning (the development of an individualised discharge plan) with routine discharge care.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      all patients in hospital.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention:\n        \n      \n      the development of an individualised discharge plan.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Data analysis and quality assessment was undertaken independently by two reviewers using a data checklist. Studies are grouped according to patient group (elderly medical patients, surgical patients, and those with a mix of conditions), and by outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Three new studies were included in this update. In total we included eleven RCTS: 6 trials recruited patients with a medical condition (2,368 patients), and four recruited patients with a mix of medical and surgical conditions (2,983 patients), one of these four recruited medical and surgical patients as separate groups, and the final trial recruited 97 patients in a psychiatric hospital and from a general hospital. We failed to detect a difference between groups in mortality for elderly patients with a medical condition (OR 1.44 95% CI 0.82 to 2.51), hospital length of stay (weighted mean difference -0.86, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.18), readmission rates (OR 0.91 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23) and being discharged from hospital to home (OR 1.15 95% CI 0.72 to 1.82). This was also the case for trials recruiting patients recovering from surgery and those recruiting patients with a mix of medical and surgical conditions. One trial comparing a structured care pathway for patients recovering from a stroke with multidisciplinary care reported a significant rate of improvement in functional ability and quality of life for the control group (median change in Barthel score between 4 to 12 weeks of 2 points for the treatment group, versus 6 for the control group, p<0.01); (Euroqol scores at 6 months 63 for the treatment group, vs. 72 for the control group, p<0.005). Two trials reported that patients with medical conditions allocated to discharge planning reported increased satisfaction compared with those who received routine discharge. No statistically significant differences were reported for overall health care costs.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The impact of discharge planning on readmission rates, hospital length of stay, health outcomes and cost is uncertain. This reflects a lack of power as the degree to which we could pool data was restricted by the different reported measures of outcome. It is possible that even a small reduction in length of stay, or readmission rate, could have an impact on the timeliness of subsequent admissions in a system where there is an shortage of acute hospital beds."

            "abstract": "From a study population of 208 consecutive first cadaver renal transplant recipients a proportional hazard model was used to simultaneously quantify the role in graft failure of matching for specific HLA antigens and constitutional factors (age, sex, duration of dialysis (Dt), and pre- (PTr) and peri-(PerTr) operative transfusions) that influence nonspecific immune response. A comparison was also made of graft survival in patients treated by the two principal methods of dialysis, hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The advisability of including nonimmunological failures in studies of graft survival was also considered. The analysis indicated that factors influencing a patient's innate nonspecific immune response (e.g., Dt and PTr) are important determinants of graft survival and should be taken into account when considering matching for specific HLA-B or DR antigens prior to transplantation. While there was no overall effect of dialysis type on graft survival, the influence of other risk factors depended on the method of dialysis. Failure to identify and exclude graft loss for nonimmunological reasons can give rise to misleading conclusions in analysis of immunoregulatory factors in organ transplantation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Tacrolimus is usually administered orally based on mg/kg or the trough concentration (Cmin) in whole blood. However, it is not easy to determine the optimal oral dose because of considerable variation of tacrolimus bioavailability between patients. In this study, pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in various conditioning kidney transplant recipients was investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      1) Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to participate in two groups. In 17 patients, tacrolimus was administered orally after an overnight fast with breakfast given 1 h later, and in the other 16 patients it was administered orally 1 h after breakfast. 2) In 4 patients, the same dose tacrolimus was given after an overnight fast and 0.5 h after breakfast on two consecutive days. 3) Five patients who underwent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) before transplantation were studied. All patients were investigated in daily profile of tacrolimus blood levels.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a strong correlation between area under the curve (AUC) and the trough concentration in both preprandial and postprandial oral administration, with correlation coefficients of 0.838 and 0.860, respectively. Significant increases in the peak concentration (Cmax) and AUC were observed in the preprandial oral administration subjects. Absorption of CAPD patients was obviously insufficient.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Since tacrolimus absorption was better under fasted condition than under the presence of food, it is thought that the highest medicine effect with the least dosage is provided by preprandial oral administration. Furthermore, preprandial oral administration is recommended from a respect of economic burden reduction and side effect reduction."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Because they generally are older and frequently have co-morbidities, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease seldom are selected for renal transplantation. Thus, information on transplantation results from controlled studies in this high-risk category of patients is scarce. We have compared the results of kidney transplantations in type 2 diabetic patients with carefully matched non-diabetic subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      All first cadaveric renal transplants performed in type 2 diabetic patients from January 1, 1988 to December 31, 1998 in our centre were included. Non-diabetic controls were individually matched with diabetic patients with respect to year of transplantation, sex, age, selected immunological parameters, and graft cold ischaemia.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We included 64 type 2 diabetic and 64 non-diabetic patients who were followed for a mean period of 37+/-27 and 41+/-31 months, respectively, after renal transplantation. Patient survival at 1 and 5 years post-transplant was 85 and 69 vs 84 and 74% (P=0.43, NS), while graft survival rates censored for patient death were 84 and 77 vs 82 and 77% for diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, respectively (P=0.52, NS). With graft survival results not censored for death with functioning graft, no significant change was seen (diabetic vs non-diabetic group: 77 and 54 vs 73 and 61%, P=0.19, NS). Age, but not the presence of diabetes, was the only factor significantly affecting patient survival when both patient groups were pooled. With regard to post-transplant complications requiring hospitalization, there was a significant difference only in the number of patients who had amputations (diabetic vs non-diabetic group: 8 vs 0, P=0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patient and graft survival after kidney transplantation was similar in type 2 diabetic and matched non-diabetic subjects, with more amputations occurring in the diabetic group. Thus, at a single-centre level renal transplantation results almost equivalent to those in non-diabetic patients may be achieved in type 2 diabetes mellitus."

            "abstract": "To obtain information about predialysis characteristics and long-term outcome of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for more than 4 years, we reviewed all patients starting PD who performed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and were at risk for more than 4 years. Sixty-two patients started; 42% were diabetic and 35% over age 60. Three recovered renal function, seven received transplants, and 12 switched to hemodialysis. Nineteen survived more than 4 years (long-term survivors, LTS), eight diabetic and 12 male. Twenty-one died on CAPD in less than 4 years (short-term survivors, STS). In comparison to STS, LTS were younger, with less prior cardiac disease, yet had higher predialysis serum creatinine values and lower hematocrits. LTS were observed for a mean of 65.3 +/- 3 months (48 to 91 months), and STS for a mean of 21 +/- 2 months. When compared to STS, LTS had fewer hospital days, hospital days for peritonitis, and a lower peritonitis rate, although the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis was greater in LTS. Cardiovascular and thromboembolic events were less frequent in LTS, but bone fractures were seen more often in the LTS diabetic patients. Weight gain, especially in males, and hernias were noted in both groups. BP improved, and vision was maintained in both groups. Non-PD-related infections causing hospitalization were low in both groups. Improved mean hematocrit and hemoglobin A, values were seen only in LTS. Mean serum cholesterol values increased with time in LTS. This study reveals that potentially high-risk patients such as diabetics and the elderly can have prolonged survival on PD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In this study, we evaluated the effect of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on mortality of diabetic patients on dialysis, focusing on age and dialysis type.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Of 3,302 patients enrolled in the prospective cohort for end-stage renal disease in Korea between August 2008 and October 2013, 1,239 diabetic patients who had been diagnosed with diabetes or having HbA1c≥6.5% at the time of enrollment were analyzed.

            "abstract": "In the age of evidence-based medicine, results from prospective controlled interventional studies are awarded the highest priority for determining the efficacy of a therapeutic measure. In contract, the role of non-controlled therapy-related observations is very low. This conception is due to the fact that in the absence of a control group it is impossible to assess a causal relationship between an administered therapy and the subsequent clinical outcome.Nevertheless, non-controlled therapeutic observations may be clinically relevant. Four domains may be distinguished : besides their importance for learning and teaching, such observations can contribute to evaluate which benefits results gained in controlled studies have in daily practice. On the other hand, they may point to hitherto unknown phenomena, such as the detection of new indications or unexpected therapeutic side effects. Finally, they may act as an important source for the generation of hypotheses about therapeutic measures, thus fostering further research."

The effects of sexual abuse manifest in a wide range of symptoms, including fear, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and various externalising and internalising behaviour problems, such as inappropriate sexual behaviours. Child sexual abuse is associated with increased risk of psychological problems in adulthood. Cognitive-behavioural approaches are used to help children and their non-offending or 'safe' parent to manage the sequelae of childhood sexual abuse. This review updates the first Cochrane review of cognitive-behavioural approaches interventions for children who have been sexually abused, which was first published in 2006.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT) in addressing the immediate and longer-term sequelae of sexual abuse on children and young people up to 18 years of age.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011 Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to November Week 3 2011); EMBASE (1980 to Week 47 2011); CINAHL (1937 to 2 December 2011); PsycINFO (1887 to November Week 5 2011); LILACS (1982 to 2 December 2011) and OpenGrey, previously OpenSIGLE (1980 to 2 December 2011). For this update we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of CBT used with children and adolescents up to age 18 years who had experienced being sexually abused, compared with treatment as usual, with or without placebo control.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of titles and abstracts identified in the search. Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and entered these into Review Manager 5 software. We synthesised and presented data in both written and graphical form (forest plots).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 10 trials, involving 847 participants. All studies examined CBT programmes provided to children or children and a non-offending parent. Control groups included wait list controls (n = 1) or treatment as usual (n = 9). Treatment as usual was, for the most part, supportive, unstructured psychotherapy. Generally the reporting of studies was poor. Only four studies were judged 'low risk of bias' with regards to sequence generation and only one study was judged 'low risk of bias' in relation to allocation concealment. All studies were judged 'high risk of bias' in relation to the blinding of outcome assessors or personnel; most studies did not report on these, or other issues of bias. Most studies reported results for study completers rather than for those recruited.Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and child behaviour problems were the primary outcomes. Data suggest that CBT may have a positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, but most results were not statistically significant. Strongest evidence for positive effects of CBT appears to be in reducing PTSD and anxiety symptoms, but even in these areas effects tend to be 'moderate' at best. Meta-analysis of data from five studies suggested an average decrease of 1.9 points on the Child Depression Inventory immediately after intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) decrease of 4.0 to increase of 0.4; I(2) = 53%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.08), representing a small to moderate effect size. Data from six studies yielded an average decrease of 0.44 standard deviations on a variety of child post-traumatic stress disorder scales (95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; I(2) = 46%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.10). Combined data from five studies yielded an average decrease of 0.23 standard deviations on various child anxiety scales (95% CI 0.3 to 0.4; I(2) = 0%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.84). No study reported adverse effects.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those when it was first published. The review confirms the potential of CBT to address the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse, but highlights the limitations of the evidence base and the need for more carefully conducted and better reported trials."

Both groups were similar with respect to age, sex, antigen mismatches, number of diabetics, and pretransplant donor/recipient CMV antibody titers. Moderately severe CMV infections occurred in 10 (77%) of 13 control subjects compared with 8 (53%) of 15 IgG-treated patients (not significant). Among those who developed CMV infections, prophylactic IgG had no effect on the severity or duration of fever, leukopenia, or hepatic enzyme elevations. Since none of the IgG-treated patients or control subjects in this study developed life-threatening CMV complications, a beneficial effect of prophylactic IgG in the small number of patients at risk for more severe CMV infections could not be excluded. However, this investigation suggests that the routine, prophylactic administration of polyvalent IgG, to prevent or to ameliorate CMV infection in unselected cadaver renal transplant recipients, is not warranted."

The objective of this study was to clarify the associations between the pretransplant dialysis modality, namely haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), and the development of post-transplant de novo diseases, allograft failure and all-cause mortality for kidney-transplant recipients.\n## DESIGN\nRetrospective nationwide cohort study.\n## SETTING\nData retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.\n## PARTICIPANTS\nThe National Health Insurance database was explored for patients who received kidney transplantation in Taiwan during 1998-2011 and underwent dialysis >90 days before transplantation.\n## OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe pretransplant characteristics, complications during kidney transplantation and post-transplant outcomes were statistically analysed and compared between the HD and PD groups. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the HR of the dialysis modality on graft failure and all-cause mortality. The primary outcomes were long-term post-transplant death-censored allograft failure and all-cause mortality started after 90 days of kidney transplantation until the end of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were events during kidney transplantation and post-transplant de novo diseases adjusted by propensity score in log-binomial model.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 1812 patients included in our cohort, among which 1209 (66.7%) and 603 (33.3%) recipients received pretransplant HD and PD, respectively. Recipients with chronic HD were generally older and male, had higher risks of developing post-transplant de novo ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis and hepatitis C after adjustment. Pretransplant HD contributed to higher graft failure in the multivariate analysis (HR 1.38, p<0.05) after adjustment for the recipient age, sex, duration of dialysis and pretransplant diseases. There was no significant between-group difference in overall survival.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPretransplant HD contributed to higher risks of death-censored allograft failure after kidney transplantation when compared with PD.\n"

Exercise is among the more successful treatments for this condition, however, the type and dosage of exercise that elicits the best results is not clearly defined. Tai chi is a gentle form of low intensity exercise that uses controlled movements in combination with relaxation techniques and is currently used as a safe form of exercise for people suffering from other chronic pain conditions such as arthritis. To date, there has been no scientific evaluation of tai chi as an intervention for people with back pain.

The wait-list control will continue their usual health care practices and have the opportunity to participate in the tai chi program once they have completed the follow-up assessments. The primary outcome will be bothersomeness of back symptoms measured with a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Secondary outcomes include, self-reports of pain-related disability, health-related quality of life and global perceived effect of treatment.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying delayed graft function, which is associated with poor long-term graft survival. Due to organ shortage, the proportion of grafts from expanded criteria donors (ECDs) is ever growing. These grafts may particularly benefit from IRI prevention. In preclinical models, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to efficiently prevent IRI. This study aims to assess the effect of MRA administration in the early phase of kidney transplantation (KT) among recipients of ECD grafts on mid-term graft function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

Included patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either eplerenone 25 mg every 12 h during 4 days (the first dose being administered just prior to KT) or placebo. The primary outcome is graft function at 3 months, assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR, in mL/min/1.73m2) measured using iohexol clearance. Secondary outcomes include (1) proportion of patients with either dialysis dependency or a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 at 3 months, (2) proportion of patients with immediate, slow, or delayed graft function, (3) proteinuria at 3 months, (4) occurrence of hyperkalemia during the first week following KT, (5) length of hospital stay for the KT, and (6) occurrence of biopsy-proven acute rejection in the first 3 months following KT. Estimated GFR, graft, and patient survival will also be collected at 1, 3, and 10 years via the national database of organ recipients.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Improvement of ECD grafts is a public health priority, since better ECD outcomes could eventually limit organ shortage.

Data were obtained from the United Network of Organ Sharing on all cadaveric graft recipients who were dialysis-dependent at the time of transplantation between April 1994 and December 1995. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups, and multivariate logistic regression was performed with outcome measures including urine production in the first 24 h posttransplantation (U24), requirement for dialysis in the first week posttransplant (FWDIAL), and treatment for acute rejection during the initial hospitalization. The odds of oliguria (not producing urine in the first 24 h) were 1.49 (1.28 to 1.74) times higher in HD versus PD patients. After adjustment for other comorbid conditions including age, gender, race, HLA mismatch, time on dialysis, panel-reactive antibodies, and cold and warm ischemia time, the odds of oliguria were 1.60 (1.14 to 2.25) times higher in black HD patients compared with PD patients and 1.29 (1.06 to 1.57) times higher in white HD patients. In a similar manner, after adjustment for significant comorbid conditions, the odds of requiring dialysis in the first week were 1.56 (1.22 to 2.0) times higher in black HD patients versus PD patients and 1.40 (1.21 to 1.60) times higher in white HD patients. The rate of acute rejection was similar during the first hospitalization. These results suggest that there is an association between hemodialysis and delayed graft function.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Migraine affects approximately 20% of the population. Conventional care for migraine is suboptimal; overuse of medications for the treatment of episodic migraines is a risk factor for developing chronic daily headache. The study of non-pharmaceutical approaches for prevention of migraine headaches is therefore warranted. Craniosacral therapy (CST) is a popular non-pharmacological approach to the treatment or prevention of migraine headaches for which there is limited evidence of safety and efficacy. In this paper, we describe an ongoing feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of CST in the treatment of migraine, using a rigorous and innovative randomized controlled study design involving low-strength static magnets (LSSM) as an attention control intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that, compared to those receiving usual care plus a treatment with low-strength static magnets (attention-control complementary therapy), subjects receiving usual medical care plus CST will demonstrate significant improvement in: quality-of-life as measured by the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6); reduced frequency of migraine; and a perception of clinical benefit. Criteria for inclusion are either gender, age > 11, English or Spanish speaking, meeting the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for migraine with or without aura, a headache frequency of 5 to 15 per month over at least two years. After an 8 week baseline phase, eligible subjects are randomized to either CST or an attention control intervention, low strength static magnets (LSSM). To evaluate possible therapist bias, videotaped encounters are analyzed to assess for any systematic group differences in interactions with subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      169 individuals have been screened for eligibility, of which 109 were eligible for the study. Five did not qualify during the baseline phase because of inadequate headache frequency. Nineteen have withdrawn from the study after giving consent.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This report endorses the feasibility of undertaking a rigorous randomized clinical trial of CST for migraine using a standardized CST protocol and an innovative control protocol developed for the study. Subjects are able and willing to complete detailed headache diaries during an 8-week baseline period, with few dropouts during the study period, indicating the acceptability of both interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00665236."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Elective cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the NHS. In bilateral cataracts, the eye with greatest vision impairment from cataract is operated on first. First-eye surgery can improve vision and quality of life. However, it is unclear whether or not cataract surgery on the second eye provides enough incremental benefit to be considered clinically effective and cost-effective.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To conduct a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and analysis of cost-effectiveness of second-eye cataract surgery in England and Wales, based on an economic model informed by systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness and quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Twelve electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched from database inception to April 2013, with searches updated in July 2013. Reference lists of relevant publications were also checked and experts consulted.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently screened references, extracted and checked data from the included studies and appraised their risk of bias. Based on the review of cost-effectiveness, a de novo economic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of second-eye surgery in bilateral cataract patients. The model is based on changes in quality of life following second-eye surgery and includes post-surgical complications.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical effectiveness, three studies of cost-effectiveness and 10 studies of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic reviews and, where possible, were used to inform the economic analysis. Heterogeneity of studies precluded meta-analyses, and instead data were synthesised narratively. The RCTs assessed visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and several measures of HRQoL. Improvements in binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were small and unlikely to be of clinical significance, but stereopsis was improved to a clinically meaningful extent following second-eye surgery. Studies did not provide evidence that second-eye surgery significantly affected HRQoL, apart from an improvement in the mental health component of HRQoL in one RCT. In the model, second-eye surgery generated 0.68 incremental quality-adjusted life-years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1964. Model results were most sensitive to changes in the utility gain associated with second-eye surgery, but otherwise robust to changes in parameter values. The probability that second-eye surgery is cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of £10,000 and £20,000 is 100%.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Clinical effectiveness studies were all conducted more than 9 years ago. Patients had good vision pre surgery which may not represent all patients eligible for second-eye surgery. For some vision-related patient-reported outcomes and HRQoL measures, thresholds for determining important clinical effects are either unclear or have not been determined.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Second-eye cataract surgery is generally cost-effective based on the best available data and under most assumptions. However, more up-to-date data are needed. A well-conducted RCT that reflects current populations and enables the estimation of health state utility values would be appropriate. Guidance is required on which vision-related, patient-reported outcomes are suitable for assessing effects of cataract surgery in the NHS and how these measures should be interpreted clinically.\n    \n\n\n          Study registration:\n        \n      \n      This project is registered as PROSPERO CRD42013004211.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."

This study determines the association between demographic characteristics and the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress in Saudi Arabia. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants comprising hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (Tx) patients. They completed the Short Form-36 Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS). The physical component summary (PCS) score was similar for HD (41.7) and PD (41.5), but higher among Tx (45.2). The mental component summary (MCS) score was similar between HD (48.0) and Tx (48.8), but lower in PD (42.3). The majority of patients in all groups had normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, the study found that PCS was higher among Tx patients compared to HD and PD, while MCS was higher among HD and Tx patients than PD patients. Most patients' levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were within the normal range. Those findings will provide policymakers and health managers with the significant factors which can affect the QOL of dialysis and Tx patients."

However, there is a substantial confounding effect by residual renal function in most studies. We differentiated the effects of dialysis adequacy from those of residual renal function on nutritional status and outcome of CAPD patients. We identified 168 CAPD patients treated in our center between September 1995 and December 1996 and categorized them into three groups: 49 patients with an average total Kt/V of 1.93 +/- 0.18 and a median residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0. 07 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the dialysis-dependent (DD) group; 48 patients with an average total Kt/V of 2.03 +/- 0.25 and a residual GFR of 2. 33 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the residual renal function (RRF) group; and 71 patients with an average total Kt/V of 1.38 +/- 0.22 and a residual GFR of 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the control (CTL) group. They were followed-up for 1 year to compare baseline nutritional status and 1-year morbidity. Baseline normalized protein catabolic rates (NPCR) are 1.00 +/- 0.20 and 0.96 +/- 0.19 (for RRF and DD, respectively) versus 0.89 +/- 0.16 g/kg/d for CTL (P < 0.01). Percentage lean body mass (%LBM) was 71.6 +/- 9.8 and 71.5 +/- 10.0 (for RRF and DD, respectively) versus 65.2 +/- 8.5% for CTL (P < 0. 001). No difference was seen in the nutritional status between RRF and DD groups. Duration of hospitalization for 1 year was 6.9 +/- 11. 8 days in the RRF group versus 14.9 +/- 25.1 in the DD and 10.6 +/- 11.6 days in the CTL groups (P < 0.05). The peritonitis rate was 44. 4 patient-months for the RRF group, versus 13.6 for the DD and 12.9 for the CTL groups (P < 0.05). There also was a trend toward superior 1-year technique survival in the RRF group, but the number of observations was small. There was no difference in duration of hospitalization, peritonitis rate, and technique survival between the DD and CTL groups. Short-term morbidity in patients without residual renal function appears to be independent of total Kt/V, although Kt/V may have some effects on nutritional status. The assumption that renal and peritoneal clearances are equivalent must be carefully reexamined. Further studies on the effect of dialysis adequacy in patients without residual renal function are urgently needed."

Missing standard deviations were calculated from P values.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Four trials were included (602 participants). Three trials were small single-centre trials, and the fourth a large multi-centre trial including 424 participants. All trials had methodological flaws, usually failure to conceal allocation and incomplete follow-up data, which put them at high risk of bias. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 15 years after treatment.Data for functional outcomes, including walking ability, from three trials could not be pooled. The strongest evidence was from the multi-centre trial. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the surgical and conservatively treated groups at three years follow-up in the ''validated disease-specific\" score (0 to 100: perfect result; 424 participants; mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to 9.71; P = 0.12). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of chronic pain at follow-up (19/40 versus 24/42; risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.18; 2 trials). The multi-centre trial found no statistically or clinically significant difference between the two groups in health-related quality of life at three years follow-up (SF-36 (0 to 100: best outcome): MD 4.00, 95% CI -1.16 to 9.16; P = 0.13).Two small trials provided some limited evidence of a tendency for a higher return to previous employment after surgery (27/34 versus 15/27; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.81; I² = 55%; 2 trials). One small trial found no difference between the two groups in the ability to wear normal shoes, whereas another small trial found that surgery resulted in more people who were able to wear all shoes comfortably. There was a higher rate of major complications, such as surgical site infection, after surgery compared with conservative treatment (57/206 versus 42/218; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.04; 1 trial). Conversely, significantly fewer surgical participants had subtalar arthrodeses due to the development of subtalar arthritis (7/206 versus 37/218; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; 1 trial). There were no significant differences between the two groups in range of movement outcomes or radiological measurements (e.g. Bohler's angle).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The bulk of the evidence in this review derives from one large multi-centre but inadequately reported trial conducted over 15 years ago. This found no significant differences between surgical or conservative treatment in functional ability and health related quality of life at three years after displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture. Though it reported a greater risk of major complications after surgery, subtalar arthrodeses for the development of subtalar arthritis was significantly greater after conservative treatment.Overall, there is insufficient high quality evidence relating to current practice to establish whether surgical or conservative treatment is better for adults with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture. Evidence from adequately powered randomised, multi-centre controlled trials, assessing patient-centred and clinically relevant outcomes is required. However, it would be prudent to reassess this need after an update of the review that incorporates new evidence from a currently ongoing multi-centre trial."

In particular, outcomes research seeks to reveal the effects of pharmaceutical, procedural, and structural aspects of healthcare on patient outcomes, including mortality, disease control, toxicity, cost, and quality of life. Although outcomes research can utilize interventional study designs, insightful use of observational data is a defining feature of this field. Many questions in gynecologic oncology are not amenable to investigation in randomized clinical trials due to cost, feasibility, or ethical concerns. When a randomized trial is not practical or has not yet been conducted, well-designed observational studies have the potential to provide the best available evidence about the effects of clinical care. Such studies may use surveys, medical records, disease registries, and a variety of administrative data sources. Even when a randomized trial has been conducted, observational studies can be used to estimate the real-world effect of an intervention, which may differ from the results obtained in the controlled setting of a clinical trial.

Patients were separated into two groups according to their HD history. Group 1 and group 2 consisted of patients with (n=48) and without (n=251) a history of prior HD, respectively. Socio-demographic characteristics such as who helped administer the PD and the preference of patients (compulsory vs their preference) were obtained from the patient records. The clinical data obtained during the last clinical evaluation before the initiation of PD (blood pressure, daily urine volumes, daily ultrafiltration amounts and laboratory parameters) were recorded. Additional systemic diseases and information about the etiologies of the end stage renal disease (ESRD) of all patients were recorded. Frequencies of the infectious complications were recorded.

Thirty five patients (70%) and 25 patients (9.3%) have been transferred to PD due to vascular problems in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). In group 1, 37 (74%) patients were carrying out PD treatment by themselves, compared to 222 (88.4%) patients in group 2 (p=0.016).

In group 1, twenty three patients have death and 2 patients have discontinued the treatment due to transplantation. In group 2, 174 patients have discontinued the treatment (55 patients have died, 80 patients have been switched to hemodialysis and 39 patients have received renal transplantation). There were significant differences between groups according to the last condition (p<0.001). Mean patient survival were found 22.9±4.2 and 55.5±2.8 patient-months in group 1 and group 2, respectively.

One of every three people with DVT will develop post-thrombotic complications within five years. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. Clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of the utility of compression therapy for treatment of DVT. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine relative effectiveness and rate of complications when compression therapy is used in people with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (20 March 2017) and CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2). The CIS also searched trial registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of compression therapy, such as bandaging and elastic stockings, in people with clinically confirmed DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors (DK and EvL) identified and assessed titles and abstracts for relevance, and a third review author (DA) verified this assessment independently. Review authors imposed no restrictions on date or language of publications. Three review authors (DA, DK, EvL) used data extraction sheets to independently extract study data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 10 RCTs with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy. The overall methodological quality of these trials was low. We used only five studies in meta-analysis owing to differences in intervention types and lack of data. Three studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg at the ankle) versus no intervention. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. Overall, use of elastic compression stockings led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; 1393 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence); no reduction in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; 1224 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence); and no clear difference in DVT recurrence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28; 1212 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism because this information was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups included in individual studies (low-quality evidence).Two studies evaluated effects of compression in the acute phase versus no compression treatment and found no differences in the incidence of PTS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; P = 0.2; 101 participants). One study reported that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants). Another trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence.Two of the 10 included studies described patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems. The first study showed significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life with compression treatment (P < 0.05) compared with bed rest, and the second study showed no differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Four studies poorly reported side effects (low-quality evidence) that included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction and described no serious adverse events. Compliance with wearing of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings may reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to considerable heterogeneity between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. No serious adverse effects occurred in these studies. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings because of current lack of high-quality evidence and considerable heterogeneity."

Lupus activity was clinically apparent in 55.4% of patients in the first year, 6.5% in the fifth, and none in the tenth year. In 45% of patients, lupus activity was clinically inactive at entry to ESRD and remained inactive throughout the observation period. Serological activity declined proportionally, but to a lesser extent than clinical activity. Cumulative patient survival was 81.1% and 74.6% at the fifth and tenth year, respectively, from the inception of dialysis treatment; similarly it was 78% at the fifth and tenth year after the transplantation. Graft survival was 60.4% at the fifth and 45.5% at the tenth year. No one had recurrence of clinical lupus nephritis in the graft for up to 16 years of follow-up. Fourteen patients died from either infectious or cardiovascular complications, but none from SLE per se. This long-term study with a large number of lupus patients confirms our previous findings that the progression of renal disease to ESRD may be mediated by nonimmunologic mechanisms, as well as immunologic insults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people. There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age groups."

Given the diverse design features, results are presented both for individual trials and for several combinations of similar studies, to provide more stable estimates of effects. Two of three trials in severe hypertension, while lacking enough events to evaluate effect on mortality, found significant reductions in \"hypertensive\" events, with the overall estimate being an 80% reduction. Similarly, combining six trials in less severe hypertension with untreated controls showed a 54% reduction in such events. The favorable trend in all-causes mortality from these trial results, whether viewed separately or in combination, was not significant. However, the findings from a large randomized trial with community controls, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, indicated significant reduction of all-causes mortality, the magnitude of which was consistent with the other trials. Outcomes of hypertensive participants in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial raised questions about mortality benefits in certain subgroups. These and other issues about patient benefit are further addressed with trial data and reference to the 1984 Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. We note also 1) that evidence for reduction of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction with antihypertensive drug treatment is weak, perhaps due to inadequate power to detect such a difference, and that data are limited regarding effects on quality of life. Nevertheless, the overall trial results provide strong support for drug treatment of severe hypertension, and for most individuals with less severe hypertension, when nonpharmacologic treatment will not suffice."

The platelet count and the mean platelet component (MPC, a measure of platelet activation) were determined on the ADVIATM 120 Haematology System (Bayer, NY).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Platelet activation as assessed by MPC or CD62P expression was significantly increased in haemodialysis but not CAPD patients compared with controls. Circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates were significantly increased in parallel with a significant reduction in PSGL-1 expression on monocytes in both patient groups compared with normal controls. The presence of higher platelet-monocyte aggregates in dialysis patients was associated with increased cardiovascular events.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We describe increased platelet-monocyte aggregates with reduced leucocyte PSGL-1 expression in patients with end-stage renal disease irrespective of dialysis modality, associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings may suggest a novel mechanism by which accelerated atherosclerosis occurs in uraemic patients."

            "abstract": "Patients returning to dialysis after graft loss (DAGL) are an increasing segment of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. It is unclear whether patients with previous graft loss have equivalent or reduced survival from the time of restarting dialysis when compared with ESRD patients initiating dialysis for the first time. Moreover, the impact of dialysis modality on the survival of patients returning to DAGL is not known. Studies of patients with transplant graft failure returning to hemodialysis (HD) have suggested decreased survival when compared with transplant-naïve dialysis patients, yet some studies of patients with graft failure returning to peritoneal dialysis (PD) have demonstrated equivalent survival. Based on these data, it is unclear whether survival differences may exist between the dialysis modalities, and if they do, whether they can be attributed to either differences in patient characteristics or to factors related to the dialysis modalities. For patients starting back onto dialysis, in whom preservation of residual renal function is important, it is also unclear how immunosuppression reduction or transplant nephrectomy may affect survival. In this review, we will summarize the available literature on survival rates of patients returning to DAGL; compare and contrast survival after initiation of HD and PD and discuss what is known about the impact of transplant nephrectomy and the different approaches to immunosuppression reduction. Practical considerations will be discussed with a specific emphasis on patients treated by PD."

Urinary cortisol excretion, a marker of the stress response, was significantly diminished during the first 24 postoperative hours in the group receiving EAA (P = 0.025). Finally, hospital costs were significantly reduced for patients who received EAA (P = 0.02).

            "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity in peritoneal dialysis (PD) populations has risen dramatically since the mid-1980s. This epidemic has been driven by the increased prevalence of obesity in the general population, the increased risk of progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in obese subjects, the reduced probability of listing obese dialysis patients for renal transplantation, a paradoxical enhanced survival in at least some obese populations on dialysis as compared with non-obese ESRF patients, and a possible adipogenic effect of excessive peritoneal glucose absorption in PD. Although obesity has consistently been associated with improved outcomes in hemodialysis, conflicting results have been seen in PD. In general, an elevated body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a neutral or deleterious impact on PD outcomes, and the relationship appears to be explained predominantly by fat mass. Risk is also elevated in patients with a low BMI, such that the \"optimal BMI\" appears to lie between 20 kg/m2 and 25 kg/m2. The mechanisms underpinning the harmful effect of obesity appear to include increased peritonitis rate, proinflammatory effects, and a more rapid decline of residual renal function in obese patients. No proof exists that weight reduction engenders an improvement in outcome in PD patients, but the available studies suggest that cautious weight reduction is advisable. A few studies have demonstrated that clinically important and sustained weight reduction can be successfully achieved through a combination of individual meal plans, regular exercise, and substitution of icodextrin for dextrose in the once-daily long dwell."

Several preliminary studies suggest that interventions to improve the poor nutritional status of the ESRD patients may actually improve the expected outcome in these patients, although their long-term efficacy is not well established. It is therefore important to emphasize that malnutrition is a major co-morbid condition in the ESRD population and that the nutritional status and the treatment parameters of these patients should be altered to improve not only the mortality outcome of ESRD patients but also their quality of life."

Thirty-nine dialysis patients (group 2) were also retrospectively selected for comparison and matched for age, sex, year of initiation, length of time on dialysis, and presence of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic heart disease at initiation of dialysis. Using life-table analysis, survival probability (with 95% confidence limits) was determined from the time of CABG for group 1 or after an equivalent period of time on dialysis for group 2. Two life-table analyses were performed; one with study end-points of death, withdrawal (renal transplantation, transfer to other dialysis facilities, and reoperation), and alive on dialysis; and a second with identical end points except that noncardiac deaths were treated as withdrawals. Coronary arteriography revealed severe three vessel disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and segmental wall motion abnormalities in most patients. A mean (+/- SD) of 2.56 +/- 0.75 vessels were bypassed with an operative mortality (30 days) of 2.6%.

However, no comprehensive empirical estimate of the absolute or relative magnitude of this benefit is currently available. This paper presents a data synthesis of the research literature on bypass surgery to derive such an estimate. It uses follow-up measures of the percent of patients who were angina-free within both the surgical and medical groups of 14 controlled trials to estimate the quality of life benefit following surgery. Results based on the longest reported follow-up period suggest that the chances are approximately 25 to 40% greater that patients will be angina-free if they receive surgery rather than medical treatment. Estimates of benefit are about 15% less in randomized controlled trials compared to controlled trials that used a matching strategy. These results are unlikely to be affected by related factors such as the percentage of patients who crossover from the medical group to the surgical group or the specific method of calculating anginal relief used in this research report.

This initial comparison of APD and CAPD from the NAPRTCS dialysis registry database indicated that there was a higher percentage of younger patients choosing APD, the time to transplantation was shorter for the CAPD patient, and the incidence and time to first peritonitis episode was significantly (p = 0.006) better in the APD population.

Patients previously on antihypertensive therapy did not differ from new patients in work absenteeism, both before and throughout the clinical trial.

Mean glycated haemoglobin measured by electroendosmosis was significantly greater in all groups with chronic renal failure except the transplant group. Mean glycated haemoglobin measured by affinity chromatography was not significantly different from controls in any of the groups with chronic renal failure. No difference in mean fructosamine concentration was detected in the transplant or conservatively managed groups compared to controls, but values were significantly lower in the CAPD group, and greater in the haemodialysis group predialysis. Post-haemodialysis samples showed a significant reduction in mean fructosamine concentration when compared with prehaemodialysis samples. Fructosamine:albumin ratios were elevated in all groups of patients with renal failure, with the exception of the transplant group. Of the four indices of glycaemic control considered in this study, only glycated haemoglobin measured by affinity chromatography appears to be unaffected by chronic renal failure."

Options for effective treatment of cancer-related fatigue are limited, consisting only of non-pharmacologic interventions like physical activity, psychosocial, and mind-body interventions. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D3 supplementation might alleviate cancer-related fatigue. However, confirmation in a randomized controlled trial is needed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 456 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients aged 18 years and older are being recruited in three German rehabilitation clinics. Study inclusion requires hospitalization of at least 3 weeks at such a clinic, a diagnosis of non-metastatic CRC (stage I-III), surgical removal of the tumor within the past 9 months, and season-adapted vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to a personalized regimen of vitamin D3 or placebo for 12 weeks. In the intervention group, a loading dose of 20,000 or 40,000 IU vitamin D3 will be administered daily during the first 11 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 2000 IU daily. Patients will complete questionnaires for secondary outcomes (fatigue subdomains, quality of life and subdomains, depression, functional well-being, and infection frequency). Blood and urine samples will be collected for analyses of safety parameters (hypervitaminosis D, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment) and efficacy biomarkers (25-hydroxyvitamin D, HbA1c, white blood cell count, leukocyte subtype counts, serum C-reactive protein, uric acid, creatinine, triglycerides, total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This trial tests whether a personalized vitamin D3 dosing regimen reduces or prevents fatigue among non-metastatic CRC patients by treating the underlying vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. If efficacy can be confirmed, personalized vitamin D3 supplementation could be used as a tertiary prevention measure in addition to non-pharmacological treatments of cancer-related fatigue in CRC patients.

All three tests can be implemented straightforwardly in standard statistical software packages, as can the corresponding confidence intervals. Simulations indicate that the three alternatives are similar in terms of the Type I error, with values close to the nominal level.

All studies were of moderate methodological quality. Important limitations of the studies were: (1) insufficient statistical power (type II error); (2) poor methodological quality due to inadequate randomization and blinding procedures; (3) insufficient contrast in dosage and treatment between experimental and control groups; and (4) lack of appropriate measurement instruments able to identify clinically meaningful changes according to the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). In the last 5 years, the methodological quality of RCTs has shown substantial improvement. Most high-quality studies investigated the effects of exercise therapy, including the use of external rhythms to improve gait and gait-related activities. The results of these trials suggest that the effects of PT are task- and context-specific. This indicates that the tasks that are trained tend not to generalize to related activities that are not directly trained in the rehabilitation programme itself, and suggests that future programmes should train meaningful tasks preferably in patients' home environment. In addition, the decline in treatment effects after an intervention has ended suggests the need for permanent treatment of patients with PD, i.e. chronic treatment for this chronic disease. Future studies should aim to develop responsive measurement instruments able to monitor meaningful changes in activities, as well as better understanding of insufficiently understood symptoms such as freezing, rigidity and bradykinesia and greater insight into neurophysiological mechanisms underlying training-induced changes in activities such as improved gait performance by rhythmic cueing."

Outcomes were analyzed for 1656 patients, excluding those younger than 15 years of age at initiation of CAPD, those having less than 3 months' follow-up, or those who had been on hemodialysis or who received a kidney graft before starting CAPD. In the study patients, technique survival at 5 and 10 years was 71.9% and 48.1% respectively. Patient survival was 69.8% and 51.8%. Mean age at the start of PD (50.4 +/- 13.9 years vs. 44.2 +/- 13.9 years, p < 0.01), ESRD incidence as a result of diabetic nephropathy (30.5% vs. 19.5%, p < 0.01), and incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities (26.6% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.01) were all significantly greater in patients who started PD during the second half of the study period (1993 - 2005) as compared with the first half (1981 - 1992). A multivariate analysis adjusting for these changes in demographics and comorbid conditions revealed that PD therapy starting in 1993 - 2005 was associated with a significant reduction in technique failure [hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; p < 0.01] and mortality (HR: 0.68; p < 0.01) as compared with the earlier period. However, in subgroup analyses, technique survival was not observed to be significantly improved in patients with diabetes. In summary, technique and patient survival have significantly improved despite increases in patient age, cardiovascular comorbidity, and ESRD caused by diabetes.

Without prophylactic treatment 65% of the patients received antimicrobial treatment during the postoperative course, whereas less than 20% among the treated patients did so.

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newer immunosuppressive drugs for renal transplantation: basiliximab, daclizumab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate (mofetil and sodium) and sirolimus.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Electronic databases. Industry submissions. Current Clinical Trials register. Cochrane Collaboration Renal Disease Group.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      The review followed the InterTASC standards. Each of the five company submissions to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) contained cost-effectiveness models, which were evaluated by using a critique covering (1) model checking, (2) a detailed model description and (3) model rerunning.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For induction therapy, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that daclizumab significantly reduced the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection and patient survival at 6 months/1 year compared with placebo, but not compared with the monoclonal antibody OKT3. There was no significant gain in patient survival or graft loss at 3 years. The incidence of side-effects with daclizumab reduced compared to OKT3. Eight RCTs found that basiliximab significantly improved 6-month/1-year biopsy-confirmed acute rejection compared to placebo, but not compared to either ATG or OKT3. There was no significant gain in either 1-year patient survival or graft loss. The incidence of side-effects with basiliximab was not significantly different compared to OKT3/ATG. For initial/maintenance therapy, 13 RCTs found that tacrolimus reduced the 6-month/1-year incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection compared to ciclosporin. There was no significant improvement in either 1-year or long-term (up to 5 years) graft loss or patient survival. The acute rejection benefit of tacrolimus over ciclosporin appeared to be equivalent for Sandimmun and Neoral. There were important differences in the side-effect profile of tacrolimus and ciclosporin. Seven RCTs found that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduced the incidence of acute rejection. There was no significant difference in patient survival or graft loss at 1-year or 3-year follow-up. There appeared to be differences in the side-effect profiles of MMF and azathioprine (AZA). No RCTs comparing MMF with AZA were identified. One RCT compared mycophenolate sodium (MPS) to MMF and reported no difference between the two drugs in 1-year acute rejection rate, graft survival, patient survival or side-effect profile. Two RCTs suggest that addition of sirolimus to a ciclosporin-based initial/maintenance therapy reduces 1-year acute rejections in comparison to a ciclosporin (Neoral) dual therapy alone and substituting azathioprine with sirolimus in initial/maintenance therapy reduces the incidence of acute rejection. Graft and patient survival were not significantly different with either sirolimus regimen. Adding sirolimus increases the incidence of side-effects. The side-effect profiles of azathioprine and sirolimus appear to be different. For the treatment of acute rejection, three RCTs suggested that both tacrolimus and MMF reduce the incidence of subsequent acute rejection and the need for additional drug therapy. Only one RCT and one subgroup analysis in children (<18 years) were identified comparing ciclosporin to tacrolimus and sirolimus, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The newer immunosuppressant drugs (basiliximab, daclizumab, tacrolimus and MMF) consistently reduced the incidence of short-term (1-year) acute rejection compared with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The independent use of basiliximab, daclizumab, tacrolimus and MMF was associated with a similar absolute reduction in 1-year acute rejection rate (approximately 15%). However, the effects of these drugs did not appear to be additive (e.g. benefit of tacrolimus with adjuvant MMF was 5% reduction in acute rejection rate compared with 15% reduction with adjuvant AZA). Thus, the addition of one of these drugs to a baseline immunosuppressant regimen was likely to affect adversely the incremental cost-effectiveness of the addition of another. The trials did not assess how the improvement in short-term outcomes (e.g. acute rejection rate or measures of graft function), together with the side-effect profile associated with each drug, translated into changes in patient-related quality of life. Moreover, given the relatively short duration of trials, the impact of the newer immunosuppressants on long-term graft loss and patient survival remains uncertain. The absence of both long-term outcome and quality of life from trial data makes assessment of the clinical and cost-effectiveness on the newer immunosuppressants contingent on modelling based on extrapolations from short-term trial outcomes. The choice of the most appropriate short-term outcome (e.g. acute rejection rate or measures of graft function) for such modelling remains a matter of clinical and scientific debate. The decision to use acute rejection in the meta-model in this report was based on the findings of a systematic review of the literature of predictors of long-term graft outcome. Only a very small proportion of the RCTs identified in this review assessed patient-focused outcomes such as quality of life. Since immunosuppressive drugs have both clinical benefits and specific side-effects, the balance of these harms and benefits could best be quantified through future trials using quality of life measures. The design of future trials should be considered with a view to the impact of drugs on particular renal transplant groups, particularly higher risk individuals and children. Finally, there is a need for improved reporting of methodological details of future trials, such as the method of randomisation and allocation concealment. A number of issues exist around registry data, for example the use of multiple drug regimens and the need to assess the long-term outcomes. An option is the use of observational registry data including, if possible, prospective data on all consecutive UK renal transplant patients. Data capture for each patient should include immunosuppressant regimens, clinical and patient-related outcomes and patient demographics."

Our data show that there is no significant difference in the survival duration between CAPD group and HD group; that there is also no significant difference in the survival duration between the two groups treated with the same immunosuppressive drugs, and that patients prepared by CAPD have a low risk of peritonitis after transplantation. It is better not to remove the Tenckhoff catheter until the graft function is stable so that it can be used for the transient peritoneal dialysis in the case of the insult of graft function or for the sampling of the peritoneal effusion for diagnosis of suspectable peritonitis after renal transplantation."

The relative merits of different response options for these instruments is an important issue. Therefore, we compared the responsiveness and validity of seven-point versus visual analogue scales (VAS) in a questionnaire measuring quality of life in chronic heart failure in a double-masked crossover trial of digoxin versus placebo. The VAS and seven-point scale versions of the questionnaire were administered to 20 patients during 7 weeks on digoxin and 7 weeks on placebo. The order of administration of the questionnaires was determined by random allocation. The ability of the two methods to distinguish digoxin and placebo, and their correlation with other measures, were comparable. We conclude that the two methods of presenting response options show comparable responsiveness and validity in a randomized trial setting. The ease of administration and interpretation of the seven-point scale recommend its use."

            "abstract": "End-stage renal disease treatment expenditures have increased greatly in recent years. Modality of treatment is a very important factor in determining costs as well as outcome and quality of life. Using quarterly observations on treatments received by ESRD patients, this paper presents a definition of modality based on type of treatment received and setting in which treatment is received. This paper also documents the magnitude of switching among defined modalities. Because many patients switch modality, selection of one modality is really a selection of a probable course of treatment by several modalities. The careful definition of modality and recognition that switching occurs are important first steps in conducting cost-effectiveness type analyses of ESRD treatment."

The PubMed search resulted in a total of 72 articles, 11 of which were included in this review. The analysis included 591 participants, of which 358 (60.6 %) were women. Patients had a mean age between 37.1 and 54.6 years. Duration of MS since diagnosis was reported in nine of the 11 studies and varied between 5.2 and 15.9 years. According to PEDro scale, nine of the 11 included studies were considered to be of high methodological quality, with scores ranging from 7 to 10. In eight of the 11 included studies, the effectiveness of exercise therapy was compared to standard care, in two it was compared to those on a waiting list, and in one, to control treatment. The results of this review suggest that exercise therapy may have a beneficial effect in patients with MS, and therefore may be recommended for the rehabilitation of these patients."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      As an effective renal replacement therapy, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is as important as hemodialysis (HD) and renal transplantation. PD is beneficial for social rehabilitation and home medical care. However, in Japan, there are fewer PD patients than HD patients.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      According to the JSDT 2015 registry, PD patients accounted for only 2.9% of all dialysis patients, and they have been gradually decreasing since 2009. One of the reasons why PD is not widely used in Japan is that there is insufficient evidence supporting its use. In this review, some recent reports about changes and challenges of PD, including survival rates, residual renal function, peritonitis, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), and combination therapy are summarized. These also indicate some problems and strategies related to PD treatment in Japan. According to the PDOPPS study, the incidence of peritonitis and culture-negative peritonitis was higher in Japan than in other countries. Further, the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) Recommendation about peritonitis and catheter-related infection that topical application of antibiotic cream or ointment to the catheter exit site should be used daily could be a strategy for decreasing the incidence of peritonitis. The prevention and treatment of EPS are other challenges in PD. An EPS recommendation was published by the ISPD in 2017. Although the Next PD study showed that the occurrence of EPS is now decreasing compared to the time when acidic dialysates were used, the predictors for the development of EPS and strategies to reduce EPS have not been established. Peritoneal pathological parameters of groups that did and did not develop EPS were compared using peritoneal biopsy tissues at the time of cessation of PD, and it was found that the L/V ratio could be an independent predictor of EPS development. In Japan, 20% of PD patients are receiving combination therapy, which shows promising results. However, some problems, such as the risk of EPS, still limit long-term PD. Key Messages: PD treatment is changing as patients' situations change and with advances in technology. It is necessary to translate evidence to Japan from overseas reports and ISPD guidelines."

            "abstract": "In a multi-centre study by seven large renal units in the United Kingdom, the morbidity and mortality of all patients starting CAPD and haemodialysis during a 2-year period (1983-1984) has been monitored prospectively and related to reasons for choice of therapy and potential risk factors. Over this period 338 new patients (mean age 48; range 3-77 years) started CAPD; 17% had diabetes mellitus and 25% had cerebro/cardiovascular disease. One hundred and seventy-five patients (mean age 45; range 5-73 years) started haemodialysis; 6% had diabetes mellitus and 14% had cerebro/cardiovascular disease. The Kaplan-Meier actuarial patient survival estimates at 2 years were haemodialysis 84% and CAPD 83%, whilst technique survival figures for the same period were haemodialysis 92% and CAPD 80%. Cox's regression analysis showed that cerebro/cardiovascular disease and age greater than 60 years were most important predictors for survival in CAPD patients, in whom smoking appeared to be a significant risk factor, for permanent change of therapy to haemodialysis. The major cause of 'drop out' in both groups was transplantation, whilst hospitalisation was 14.9 days per patient year for CAPD and 12.8 for haemodialysis patients. Within the CAPD group a temporary change to haemodialysis (less than 2 months) occurred on 106 occasions (each of mean of 19 days duration), amounting to 10 days per patient year of therapy. CAPD was used twice as often as haemodialysis for managing new patients. After 2 years hospitalisation technique and patient survival were comparable in the two groups, with cerebro/cardiovascular disease, age, and smoking being significant predictors of outcome."

Neuropsychological tests were administered every 6 months for up to four testing sessions. The renal subjects had reduced function on medical management, were being dialyzed or had transplants. Those renal patients who changed treatment groups over the course of the study were classified as good or bad change depending upon medical criteria. Those patients who remained in the same treatment group were classified as no change. Differences in performance between last and first sessions were analyzed for each pair. Renal subjects exhibited less improvement on memory function than controls but greater improvement on choice reaction time and vigilance.

New research findings will be emerging, but clinicians need criteria by which to assess new results, to evaluate the existing literature, and to strengthen future investigation. Twenty-six original articles on chemonucleolysis were reviewed according to nine criteria of validity and applicability. Common threats to validity were failure to use randomized controls, make blind outcome assessments, assure equal co-treatments, and to calculate statistical power when results were negative. Threats to applicability included wide variations and incomplete reporting of patient selection, procedure technique, and many relevant outcomes. Methods for improving these design features are suggested, and a basic study design is proposed for comparing chemonucleolysis with both surgical and conservative management techniques."

This study was conducted to identify the characteristics of membrane permeability in the Saudi population and to assess the role of various factors affecting solute transport across the peritoneal membrane. We followed up a total of 52 patients on Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) as well as Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD), being treated in the PD unit of the King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh.

Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were considered at low risk of bias in eleven and nine studies respectively. All studies were considered at high risk for performance bias as they were open-label studies. We assessed detection bias for outcome assessment for GFR and ESKD separately. As GFR measurement was a laboratory outcome all studies were assessed at low risk of detection bias. For ESKD, nine studies were at low risk of detection bias as the need to commence dialysis was determined by personnel independent of the study investigators. Five studies were assessed at high risk of attrition bias with eleven studies at low risk. Ten studies were at high risk for reporting bias as they did not include data which could be included in a meta-analysis. Eight studies reported funding from government bodies while the remainder did not report on funding. Ten studies compared a low protein diet with a normal protein diet in participants with CKD categories 3a and b (9 studies) or 4 (one study). There was probably little or no difference in the numbers of participants who died (5 studies 1680 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 13 fewer deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). A low protein diet may make little or no difference in the number of participants who reached ESKD compared with a normal protein diet (6 studies, 1814 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.53; 7 more per 1000 reached ESKD; low certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a low protein diet compared with a normal protein intake impacts on the outcome of final or change in GFR (8 studies, 1680 participants: SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.38; very low certainty evidence). Eight studies compared a very low protein diet with a low protein diet and two studies compared a very low protein diet with a normal protein diet. A very low protein intake compared with a low protein intake probably made little or no difference to death (6 studies, 681 participants: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.54; 10 more deaths per 1000; moderate certainty evidence). However it probably reduces the number who reach ESKD (10 studies, 1010 participants: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; 165 per 1000 fewer reached ESKD; moderate certainty evidence). It remains uncertain whether a very low protein diet compared with a low or normal protein intake influences the final or change in GFR (6 studies, 456 participants: SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.52; very low certainty evidence). Final body weight was reported in only three studies. It is uncertain whether the intervention alters final body weight (3 studies, 89 participants: MD -0.40 kg, 95% CI -6.33 to 5.52; very low certainty evidence).Twelve studies reported no evidence of protein energy wasting (malnutrition) in their study participants while three studies reported small numbers of participants in each group with protein energy wasting. Most studies reported that adherence to diet was satisfactory. Quality of life was not formally assessed in any studies.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review found that very low protein diets probably reduce the number of people with CKD 4 or 5, who progress to ESKD. In contrast low protein diets may make little difference to the number of people who progress to ESKD. Low or very low protein diets probably do not influence death. However there are limited data on adverse effects such as weight differences and protein energy wasting. There are no data on whether quality of life is impacted by difficulties in adhering to protein restriction. Studies evaluating the adverse effects and the impact on quality of life of dietary protein restriction are required before these dietary approaches can be recommended for widespread use."

The approach aims to enhance daily functioning through increased psychological flexibility. Whilst the therapeutic model behind ACT appears well suited to chronic pain, there is a need for further research to test its effectiveness in clinical practice, particularly with regards to combining ACT with physical exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This prospective, two-armed, parallel-group, single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT programme, in comparison to supervised exercise for chronic pain. One hundred and sixty patients, aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with a chronic pain condition by a physician will be recruited to the trial. Participants will be individually randomised to one of two 8-week, group interventions. The combined group will take part in weekly psychology sessions based on the ACT approach, in addition to supervised exercise classes led by a physiotherapist. The control group will attend weekly supervised exercise classes but will not take part in an ACT programme. The primary outcome will be pain interference at 12-week follow-up, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference Scale. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported pain severity, self-perception of change, patient satisfaction, quality of life, depression, anxiety and healthcare utilisation. Treatment process measures will include self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, fear avoidance, pain acceptance and committed action. Physical activity will be measured using Fitbit ZipTM activity trackers. Both groups will be followed up post intervention and again after 12 weeks. Estimates of treatment effects at follow-up will be based on an intention-to-treat framework, implemented using a linear mixed-effects model.

Hepatitis C was the main cause of liver failure necessitating the transplant (8 patients). Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity was the lead cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (12 patients). The overall peritonitis rate was 39.8 patient-months (0.3 episodes per year at risk). There was 1 patient with relapsing peritonitis, and 1 patient had severe peritonitis and died. Mean survival was 58.9 ± 11.3 months, 4 patients died, 4 received a kidney transplant, 1 patient was transitioned to hemodialysis due to poor ultrafiltration, 1 patient was transferred to another program, 2 remained on PD and 2 patients recovered renal function.

The study has shown CAPD to be an effective form of dialysis with a number of advantages over intermittent peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis (better control of salt and water status, hypertension and anemia, steady state biochemistry and greater ease of self-dialysis). Peritoneal clearance and ultrafiltration have remained adequate in all but a few patients. Hypoproteinemia, poor nutrition, obesity and abdominal herniae have been problems in a small percentage of patients. Hyperlipidemia has developed in half the patients but improved with diet. Peritonitis remains the major barrier to the more widespread use of CAPD, although its incidence can be considerably reduced by use of better connectors, bacterial filters and choice of patients."

The patients were entered 14-36 days after infarction and were followed for one year. Recruitment was discontinued before the scheduled 4000 patients had been entered. There were 57 deaths (6.6%) in patients randomized with respect to oxprenolol as compared with 45 deaths (5.1%) in patients randomized with respect to placebo. The difference in cumulative mortality rates (30.4%) is not statistically significant. 275 patients from each treatment group discontinued trial medication.

Most of these patients were functionally anephric, and the beta 2M levels did not correlate with age, sex, or time on dialysis. In patients receiving conventional hemodialysis using cellulose acetate membrane, beta 2M levels increased 25.4% after hemodialysis, whereas in patients receiving HF hemodialysis using polysulfone membrane, beta 2M levels decreased significantly (43.0%) after hemodialysis. End-stage renal disease patients dialyzed for the first time had beta 2M values significantly lower than the other two groups because of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CAPD patients also had lower values because they had an estimated loss of 80.4 mg/d of beta 2M in the dialysate fluid. In patients with chronic renal failure, beta 2M levels paralleled the increase in serum creatinine. Patients who received kidney transplants had a dramatic decrease in beta 2M levels that correlated with improvement in GFR. beta 2M correlated with the residual GFR, and its removal was membrane-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The examination of four unsuccessful catheters revealed no evidence for infection being the cause of implantation failure. However the porous surface of these catheters was filled with blood components and products, sometimes apparently laid down in layers, suggesting that frequent bleeding resulting from repeated trauma may be responsible for the failure of catheter fixation.

The goal of this report was to analyze the impact of this CQI program on hemodialysis outcomes within the organization. Kaiser Permanente is a national, integrated, nonprofit, staff model health maintenance organization with 8 million members. The southern California region has 3.1 million members and currently manages the health care of 3,700 hemodialysis patients, 300 peritoneal dialysis patients, and 1,000 kidney transplant patients. Thirty-one vascular surgeons and 29 interventional radiologists provide for their hemodialysis access needs. The Kidney Disease Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines were adopted, as well as measures to perform more venous transpositions and less common arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) before graft placement. The outcomes assessed included incidence and prevalence of AVFs, grafts, and catheters; replacement access with AVFs; and combined AVF and graft thrombosis episodes per patient per year. Primary AVF incidence rates increased from 27% in 1997 to 88% in 2003. AVF prevalence rates increased from 30% in 1997 to 62% in 2003. Replacement access which is an AVF increased from 26% in 1998 to 58% in 2003. Yearly thrombosis episodes/patient decreased from 0.62 in 1998 to 0.34 in 2003. Catheter usage as of 2003 comprised an incidence of 65% and prevalence (> or =90 days) of 13%, which was essentially unchanged from 1999, despite improvements in fistula usage and thrombosis rate. The rate of AVF prevalence can be increased dramatically, exceeding the 40% K/DOQI recommendation, by using the CQI process. Increased prevalence of AVF is associated with a lower yearly incidence of thrombosis episodes/patient. Reducing excessive catheter usage appears to be a more difficult problem."

There was a clinically relevant benefit of GI/H compared to controls on ≥50% pain relief [RD 0.18 (95% CI 0.02, 0.35)] and psychological distress [SMD -0.40 (95% CI -0.70, -0.11)] at the end of therapy. Acceptability at the end of treatment for GI/H was not significantly different to the control. Two RCTs with 95 subjects were included in the comparison of hypnosis combined with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus CBT alone. Combined therapy was superior to CBT alone in reducing psychological distress at the end of therapy [SMD -0.50 (95% CI -0.91, -0.09)]. There were no statistically significant differences between combined therapy and CBT alone in other primary outcomes at the end of treatment and follow-up. No study reported on safety. GI/H hold promise in a multicomponent management of fibromyalgia.\n    \n\n\n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      We provide a systematic review with meta-analysis on guided imagery and hypnosis for fibromyalgia. Current analyses endorse the efficacy and tolerability of guided imagery/hypnosis and of the combination of hypnosis with cognitive-behavioural therapy in reducing key symptoms of fibromyalgia."

Desipramine, compared with both other treatments, substantially decreased cocaine use. Lithium treatment outcome did not differ from that of placebo. Desipramine-treated subjects attained contiguous periods of abstinence substantially more frequently than subjects receiving lithium or placebo. Fifty-nine percent of the desipramine-treated subjects were abstinent for at least three to four consecutive weeks during the six-week study period, compared with 17% for placebo and 25% for lithium. Cocaine craving reductions were also substantially greater in the desipramine-treated subjects. Establishment of initial abstinence is the first stage in recovery from cocaine dependence.

We also found surveys, but no relevant qualitative research studies were located.: Adverse effects reported appear limited to 'remedy reactions' ('aggravations') including temporary worsening of symptoms, symptom shifts and reappearance of old symptoms.

Reports published before 2007 were identified from the existing Cochrane review (major databases searched from inception to 2007).

Where possible, we combined data from included trials using standard inverse variance methods. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A de novo economic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness over a 10-year period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 26 RCTs (published in 45 papers) with a total of 8763 participants. CoaguChek was used in 85% of the trials. Primary analyses were based on data from 21 out of 26 trials. Only four trials were at low risk of bias. Major clinical events: self-monitoring was significantly better than standard monitoring in preventing thromboembolic events [relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.84; p = 0.004]. In people with artificial heart valves (AHVs), self-monitoring almost halved the risk of thromboembolic events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.82; p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; p = 0.02). There was greater reduction in thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality through self-management but not through self-testing. Intermediate outcomes: self-testing, but not self-management, showed a modest but significantly higher percentage of time in therapeutic range, compared with standard care (weighted mean difference 4.44, 95% CI 1.71 to 7.18; p = 0.02). Patient-reported outcomes: improvements in patients' quality of life related to self-monitoring were observed in six out of nine trials. High preference rates were reported for self-monitoring (77% to 98% in four trials). Net health and social care costs over 10 years were £7295 (self-monitoring with INRatio2); £7324 (standard care monitoring); £7333 (self-monitoring with CoaguChek XS) and £8609 (self-monitoring with ProTime). The estimated quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain associated with self-monitoring was 0.03.

Self-monitoring, and in particular self-management, of anticoagulation status appeared cost-effective when pooled estimates of clinical effectiveness were applied. However, if self-monitoring does not result in significant reductions in thromboembolic events, it is unlikely to be cost-effective, based on a comparison of annual monitoring costs alone.

However, the prevalence of transplantation is extremely low and most patients with ESRD should continue dialysis for their whole life. Recently, high transposition rate of renal transplantation from peritoneal dialysis (PD) was reported, however, it was unclear whether a difference in dialytic modality can influence the outcome. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of dialytic modality on the rate of kidney transplantation and outcome in our single center.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty-two kidney transplants were carried among 1,573 dialysis patients from the years 1986 to 2004 in our center.

Among these cases, dialytic modality prior to transplantation was 57.1% in HD, and 42.9% in PD. The transfer rate from PD to transplantation was significantly (p = 0.0036) higher (4.7%) than that of HD (1.9%). The reason for the high transfer rate of PD patients might be cooperation with their family and the provision of relevant information by nephrologists during PD. There were no differences between the two modalities prior to transplantation in the graft survival rate, incidence of acute rejection, and complications before and after transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Difference in pretransplant dialysis modality did not affect the outcomes, however, the transfer rate from PD was significantly higher than from HD.

These chronic complaints are the effects of venous outflow restriction that can cause symptoms such as heaviness, itching, pain, cramps, and paraesthesia. Twenty to fifty percent of people with DVT develop post-thrombotic complications. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of PTS during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. There have been limited studies regarding the effectiveness of compression therapy for prevention or treatment of PTS. As a result, clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of compression therapy during treatment of DVT and in the treatment of PTS. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of post-thrombotic syndrome, including elastic compression stockings and mechanical devices compared with no intervention, placebo and with each other.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries on 2 July 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included trials that evaluated compression therapy for the treatment of PTS. The primary outcomes were severity of PTS and adverse effects. There were no restrictions on date or language. Two review authors (SA, DNK) independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      One review author extracted and summarised data and one review author (DNK) verified them. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed methodological study quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified four trials, with 116 participants, investigating the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of PTS. The methodology used by each trial was too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, so we reported our findings narratively.Two trials studied the effect of graduated elastic compression stockings (GECS) on improvement of PTS symptoms. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while the other found no benefits on PTS severity compared to placebo (very low-certainty evidence). There was very limited evidence available for adverse effects and quality of life (QoL). The two studies did not report on compliance rates during the study period.Two trials studied the effects of intermittent mechanical compression devices. Both reported improvement in PTS severity (low-certainty evidence). Improvement of the severity of PTS was defined by treatment 'success' or 'failure'. Only one study comparing compression devices evaluated adverse effects and QoL. Although 9% of the participants experienced adverse effects such as leg swelling, irritation, superficial bleeding, and skin itching (moderate-certainty evidence), QoL was improved (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies did not assess compliance using intermittent mechanical compression devices.None of the studies evaluated patient satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is very low-certainty evidence regarding the use of GECS for treatment of PTS as assessed by two small studies of short duration. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while one found no benefits on PTS severity compared to control/placebo stockings. There is very limited evidence for adverse effects, patient satisfaction, QoL, and compliance rates. There is low-certainty evidence favouring use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices compared to a control device for the treatment of severity owing to different measurements used by the studies reporting on this outcome and small studies of short duration. There is moderate-certainty evidence of improved QoL but possible increased adverse effects related to compression device use owing to small studies of short duration. High-certainty evidence to support the use of compression therapy in prevention of PTS is lacking and any conclusions drawn from current evidence should be interpreted with care. Further research is needed to assess whether compression can result in long-term reduction and relief of the symptoms caused by PTS, or prevent deterioration and leg ulceration."

Current modalities of renal replacement therapy include in-center hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation. Patient survival has gradually increased during the past 2 decades and efforts continue to improve mortality and quality of life for patients with ESRD. Developments in sorbent technology, nanotechnology, and cell culture techniques provide promise for new innovations in ESRD management. New modalities currently in testing include wearable (WAKs) and implantable artificial kidneys (IAKs). The automated WAK (AWAK) and WAK are devices that have undergone small trials in humans. Additional study is needed before regulatory approval, coverage decisions, and widespread clinical implementation. The IAK is a biohybrid combining artificial filters and living cells currently in preclinical testing. These portable devices reduce the need for large quantities of water and continuous electrical supply. This could lower some barriers to home dialysis, making self-care renal replacement therapy more accessible and desirable. If widely successful, these devices could reduce the need to build and staff dialysis facilities, thus lowering health care costs associated with dialysis.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nRenal vascular thrombosis (RVT) is a rare but catastrophic complication of renal transplantation. Although a plethora of risk factors has been identified, a large proportion of cases of RVT is unexplained. Uremic coagulopathy and dialysis modality may predispose to RVT. We investigated the impact of the pretransplant dialysis modality on the risk of RVT in adult renal transplant recipients.\n## METHODS\nRenal transplant recipients (age 18 years or more) who were enrolled in the national registry between 1990 and 1996 (N = 84,513) were evaluated for RVT occurring within 30 days of transplantation. Each case was matched with two controls from the same transplant center and with the year of transplantation. The association between RVT and 18 factors was studied with multivariate conditional logistic regression.\n## RESULTS\nForty-nine percent of all cases of RVT (365 out of 743) occurred in repeat transplant recipients with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.72 compared with first transplants (P < 0.001). There were a significantly higher odds of RVT in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-compared with hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (OR = 1.87, P = 0.001). Change in dialysis modality was an independent predictor of RVT: switching from HD to PD (OR = 3.59, P < 0.001) and from PD to HD (OR = 1.62, P = 0.047). Compared with primary transplant recipients on HD (OR = 1.00), the highest odds of RVT were in repeat transplant recipients treated with PD (OR = 12.95, P < 0.001) and HD (OR = 4.50, P < 0.001). Other independent predictors of RVT were preemptive transplantation, relatively young and old donor age, diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus as causes of end-stage renal disease, recipient gender, and lower panel reactive antibody levels (PRAs).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe strongest risk factors for RVT were retransplantation and prior PD treatment. Prevention of RVT with perioperative anticoagulation should be studied in patients who have a constellation of the identified risk factors.\n"

            "abstract": "In a prospective randomized trial we evaluated the influence of the calcium antagonist diltiazem (Dil) on the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in cadaveric kidney transplantation. Dil was added to Eurocollin's solution (20 mg/l) at donor nephrectomy. The graft recipient received a preoperative bolus injection of Dil (0.28 mg/kg) which was followed by an infusion of Dil (0.0022 mg/min/kg) for 2 days. Thereafter, Dil was applied orally. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of ciclosporin (CS) and low-dose steroids. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to donor characteristics, HLA matching and ischemic periods. In the control group (n = 22), 9 patients (41%) developed ATN compared to 2 patients (10%) in the Dil group (p less than 0.05). In the control group, 3.5 +/- 0.4 HD per patient were necessary compared to 0.6 +/- 0.2 in the Dil group (p less than 0.05). Although CS blood levels were significantly higher in the Dil group (1st week 1,150 vs. 728 ng/ml; p less than 0.01), the GFR of grafts with primary function was significantly higher in the Dil group (day 7:39 vs. 24 ml/min; p less than 0.05). A significant reduction of the CS dose by 30% (p less than 0.01) led to comparable CS levels. In the Dil group, significantly fewer rejection episodes occurred during the first month. Our data indicate that the application of the calcium antagonist Dil lowered the incidence of posttransplant ATN. In addition, there is a possibility that Dil not only ameliorates ischemic damage in the kidney, but also reduces CS nephrotoxicity."

Thus, adolescent depression is a prime candidate for innovation in treatment. In depressive adults, meta-analytic evidence has proven that bright light therapy (BLT) is a potent low-threshold intervention, promising due to easy application, low side effects, and optimized compliance.

The occurrence of cardiac events, consisting of cardiac death and of readmission to hospital for unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or recurrent infarction, differed significantly for the two treatment groups in the 2-3 years after infarction. Seven out of 42 patients in treatment group A (17%) experienced a cardiac event, in contrast to 17 out of 46 (37%) patients in treatment group B, (P = 0.05, two-tailed).

Total mortality was significantly lower in patients randomized to metoprolol. At the median follow-up time (4.2 years) 28 deaths occurred in the metoprolol group and 54 in the diuretic group--a difference of 48% in total mortality (95% confidence limit, ranging from 68% to 17%), mainly because of a highly significant reduction in coronary heart disease at this point in time.

In Tx observed correlations were positive between thyroid volume and creatinine, negative between thyroid volume and TSH. The time after transplantation correlated negatively with TSH. No correlation between TSH, thyroid volume, and time on dialysis was observed. The prevalence in patients on renal replacement therapy was higher than that in the general population.

Recent studies have suggested that hyperkalemia may underlie the development of neuropathy. As such, maintenance of serum K(+) within normal limits between periods of dialysis in ESKD patients manifesting early neuropathic symptoms may reduce neuropathy development and progression. For patients with more severe neuropathic syndromes, increased dialysis frequency or a switch to high-flux dialysis may prevent further deterioration, while ultimately, renal transplantation is required to improve and restore nerve function. Exercise training programs are beneficial for ESKD patients with muscle weakness due to neuropathy or myopathy, and are capable of improving exercise tolerance and quality of life. Specific treatments have recently been evaluated for symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, including sildenafil for impotence and midodrine for intra-dialytic hypotension, and have been shown to be effective and well tolerated. Other important management strategies for neuropathy include attention to foot care to prevent callus and ulceration, vitamin supplementation, and erythropoietin. Treatment with membrane-stabilizing agents, such as amitryptiline and gabapentin, are highly effective in patients with painful neuropathy."

The selection of PD or HD will usually be based on patient motivation, desire, geographic distance from an HD unit, physician and/or nurse bias, and patient education. Unfortunately, many patients are not educated on PD before beginning dialysis. Most studies show that the relative risk of death in patients on in-center HD versus PD changes over time with a lower risk on PD, especially in the first 3 months of dialysis. The survival advantage of PD continues for 1.5-2 years but, over time, the risk of death with PD equals or becomes greater than with in-center HD, depending on patient factors. Thus, PD survival is best at the start of dialysis. Patient satisfaction may be higher with PD, and PD costs are significantly lower than HD costs. The new reimbursement system, including bundling of dialysis services, may lead to an increase in the number of incident patients on PD. The high technique failure of PD persists, despite significant reductions in peritonitis rates. Infection also continues to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity among HD patients, especially those using a central venous catheter as HD access.

We examined four large cohorts of patients initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD) in 2000-2003 (total of >40 000 patients) to ascertain trends in patient outcomes, technique success, and predictors of both parameters of interest. Age, end-stage renal disease vintage, and diabetes were clear predictors of patient survival. Technique success was higher in patients on automated PD than in patients on continuous ambulatory PD. Center size was a powerful predictor of technique success. We conclude that the current state of PD in the United States is characterized by improving patient outcomes, higher technique success, and a predominance of use of cycler-based therapy. Several opportunities for improving technique success amenable to practice interventions have been identified."

            "abstract": "Treatment of end-stage renal failure in children is invasive and prolonged. Although kidney transplantation is often the desired therapy, children usually require some form of life-sustaining dialysis until a suitable donor is found. Home continuous-cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) is a useful alternative to in-center hemodialysis for these children. Adequate biochemical control of the uremic state can be achieved with continuous-cycling peritoneal dialysis. Peritonitis remains the major complication of this form of dialysis, averaging approximately one episode per 12 patient-months. Growth rates of children maintained on continuous-cycling peritoneal dialysis appear to be equivalent to growth rates of children treated with hemodialysis. The advantage of continuous-cycling peritoneal dialysis lies in the fact that exchanges occur during the evening hours and parental intervention is minimized."

Results were summarised as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) or standardised MD (SMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or in descriptive format when meta-analysis was not possible. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet. Risks of bias in the included studies were generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in the results. Participants were followed up for a median of 12 months (range 1 to 46.8 months).Studies were not designed to examine all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. In very-low quality evidence, dietary interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality or ESKD. In absolute terms, dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year avoiding ESKD, although the certainty in this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for cardiovascular events were sparse. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence were associated with a higher health-related quality of life (2 studies, 119 people: MD in SF-36 score 11.46, 95% CI 7.73 to 15.18; I2 = 0%). Adverse events were generally not reported.Dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (3 studies, 167 people: MD -9.26 mm Hg, 95% CI -13.48 to -5.04; I2 = 80%) and diastolic blood pressure (2 studies, 95 people: MD -8.95, 95% CI -10.69 to -7.21; I2 = 0%) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions were associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (5 studies, 219 people: SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.97; I2 = 88%) and serum albumin levels (6 studies, 541 people: MD 0.16 g/dL, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I2 = 26%). A Mediterranean diet lowered serum LDL cholesterol levels (1 study, 40 people: MD -1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.44).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Dietary interventions have uncertain effects on mortality, cardiovascular events and ESKD among people with CKD as these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels.Based on stakeholder prioritisation of dietary research in the setting of CKD and preliminary evidence of beneficial effects on risks factors for clinical outcomes, large-scale pragmatic RCTs to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are required."

Two patients who were operated on and three who were treated conservatively had to have the lateral extremity of the clavicle resected because of pain. The rehabilitation period was significantly shorter with non-operative treatment, and after thirteen months there was no difference in the clinical results. There were no serious postoperative complications, but about half of the patients who were operated on had problems with the metallic device, such as breakage or migration of the pins, or both, and six patients had a superficial infection. For most patients with total acromioclavicular dislocation we recommend conservative treatment with a sling until the patient is free of pain. Operation should be considered in thin patients who have a prominent lateral end of the clavicle, in those who do heavy work, and in patients whose daily work requires that the shoulder often be held in about 90 degrees of abduction and flexion."

A 2017 change in policy delineated renal function criteria for SLKT and implemented a safety net for kidney-after-liver transplantation. We compared the use and outcomes of SLKT and kidney-after-liver transplant with the 2017 policy. United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research files were used to identify adults who received liver transplantations (LT) from August 10, 2007 to August 10, 2012; from August 11, 2012 to August 10, 2017; and from August 11, 2017 to June 12, 2019. LT recipients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were defined by dialysis requirement or estimated glomerular filtration rate <25. We evaluated outcomes and center-level, regional, and national practice before and after the policy change. Nonparametric cumulative incidence of kidney-after-liver listing and transplant were modeled by era. A total of 6332 patients received SLKTs during the study period; fewer patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥50 mL/min underwent SLKT over time (5.8%, 4.8%, 3.0%; P = 0.01 ). There was also less variability in GFR at transplant after policy implementation on center and regional levels. We then evaluated LT-alone (LTA) recipients with ESRD (n = 5408 from 2012-2017; n = 2321 after the policy). Listing for a kidney within a year of LT increased from 2.9% before the policy change to 8.8% after the policy change, and the rate of kidney transplantation within 1 year increased from 0.7% to 4% (P < 0.001). After the policy change, there was no difference in patient survival rates between SLKT and LTA among patients with ESRD. Implementation of the 2017 SLKT policy change resulted in reduced variability in SLKT recipient kidney function and increased access to deceased donor kidney transplantation for LTA recipients with kidney disease without negatively affecting outcomes."

A cross-sectional study included 155 adult patients enrolled in the CPD program in a single renal unit of a teaching hospital who were screened for anti-HCV by second-generation enzyme immunoassay, which was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay. Serum was also assayed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). History of renal transplantation, blood transfusions, and exposure to hemodialysis was obtained from medical records. Ten of 155 patients (6.5%) in this study population were anti-HCV positive [anti-HCV(+)] and 11/155 (7.1%) were HBsAg positive; no patient was positive for both. All the anti-HCV(+) patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); no continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) patient was anti-HCV(+). Exposure to hemodialysis was a risk factor for anti-HCV seropositivity, with 7 out of 10 (70%) anti-HCV(+) patients having been on hemodialysis compared to 55/134 (41%) anti-HCV(-) (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). No difference was noted between anti-HCV(+) and anti-HCV(-) groups in relation to age, gender, duration on CPD, renal transplantation, or exposure to blood transfusions. Seroconversion occurred in only one patient after a mean observation period of 20 +/- 0.6 months. The prevalence of anti-HCV seropositivity in this population of CPD patients is 6.5%, and HBsAG 7.1%.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      If a patient agrees to take part in a randomised trial it is reasonable to presume that the patient would prefer to be allocated into the intervention. This study's aim was to investigate how patients react after they have been randomised into control group.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Nested study within two randomised trials. Telephone interviews with a structured questionnaire. The participants were invited after they had been randomised into the control group in two smoking cessation trials. The main outcome measures were reaction to control group allocation and drop-out rates.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-seven out of 30 possible interviews were successfully completed. Fourteen persons expressed that they were disappointed of being allocated to the control group. Five persons said that they had not understood the consent information and three of these were very disappointed. Surprisingly these three persons said that they had not expected a randomization. A woman expressed that she \"felt as if I was being swindled\". There were in total 9/117 (7.7%) lost to follow-up in the control group and there were 4/105 (3.8%) losses to follow-up in the intervention group (P=0.26). Active withdrawal of consent was slightly higher among the control group, five in the control group (4.3%) and no active withdrawals in the intervention group (P=0.06).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Disappointment was common after allocation to the control group. This is a probable explanation of the higher drop-out rate in the control group. The consent information is of highest importance since those who were very disappointed claimed they did not receive understandable information."

            "abstract": "Recurrent glomerular disease is an important cause of late allograft loss in renal transplant recipients. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide and its recurrence has been reported in allografts. The present study examined outcomes following renal transplantation (RTX) in 101 patients with ESRD due to biopsy-proven IgAN, in comparison to non-IgA patients, and evaluated the incidence of recurrence. The study population (mean age 34.8 +/- 7.7 years; males 62.2%; Chinese 88.3%) underwent RTX under CsA immunosuppression between November 1984 and December 2004; as two patients underwent retransplantation during the study period, 103 allografts (56.3% cadaveric) were included for retrospective analysis. At time of analysis on 1 January 2005, 78 (75.7%) renal allografts (IgAN RTX) were functioning, of which 51 (49.5%) had normal serum creatinine, 27 (26.2%) had chronic allograft dysfunction, while 25 had graft losses, either due to patient death with functioning grafts (5.8%) or withdrawal to dialysis (18.5%). Persistent microscopic haematuria, not attributable to other causes or proteinuria > 1 g/day occurred in 42.7% and 13.6% of allografts respectively. Of 29 allografts biopsied for evaluation of proteinuria and/or renal dysfunction post-RTX, 8 (27.6%) had IgAN (overall histological recurrence, 7.8%). Of these, three had graft loss due to recurrent IgAN, three had elevated serum creatinine, while two had normal serum creatinine. Overall five and ten year patient survivals for IgAN RTX were 95.3% and 82.2%, and five and ten year actuarial graft survivals were 82.3% and 67.8% respectively. Five and ten year patient and graft survivals for IgAN RTX were not significantly different from that for non-IgAN RTX. In summary, RTX patients with IgAN have a low incidence of documented histological recurrence and recurrence contributing to graft loss occurs in only 2.9%. These results suggest that RTX is an excellent modality of renal replacement therapy in this population."

Epidemiological studies indicate that CKD patients undergo physical activity ~9 days/month and 43.9% of dialysis patients report not exercising at all. On the basis of awareness about the strong link between sedentary lifestyle and adverse clinical outcomes, the National Kidney Foundation and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes have provided specific recommendations for physical activity in patients with kidney disease. Given the fact that CKD is a public health problem and it is still debated which type of exercise should be prescribed in these patients, this review focuses on the most robust evidence accumulated so far on the beneficial effect of various types of physical exercise on clinical outcomes in CKD and dialysis patients. This review does not treat this very important topic in another CKD category of patients, such as kidney-transplanted patients, for whom a special issue should be dedicated."

Obesity is a predictor of incident CKD and progression to kidney failure.

Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of more than four weeks duration, reporting on intentional weight loss interventions, in individuals with any stage of CKD, designed to promote weight loss as one of their primary stated goals, in any health care setting.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias' tool and used the GRADE process to assess the certainty of evidence. We estimated treatment effects using random-effects meta-analysis. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean differences (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes or in descriptive format when meta-analysis was not possible.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 17 RCTs enrolling 988 overweight or obese adults with CKD. The weight loss interventions and comparators across studies varied. We categorised comparisons into three groups: any weight loss intervention versus usual care or control; any weight loss intervention versus dietary intervention; and surgical intervention versus non-surgical intervention. Methodological quality was varied, with many studies providing insufficient information to accurately judge the risk of bias. Death (any cause), cardiovascular events, successful kidney transplantation, nutritional status, cost effectiveness and economic analysis were not measured in any of the included studies. Across all 17 studies many clinical parameters, patient-centred outcomes, and adverse events were not measured limiting comparisons for these outcomes. In studies comparing any weight loss intervention to usual care or control, weight loss interventions may lead to weight loss or reduction in body weight post intervention (6 studies, 180 participants: MD -3.69 kg, 95% CI -5.82 to -1.57; follow-up: 5 weeks to 12 months, very low-certainty evidence). In very low certainty evidence any weight loss intervention had uncertain effects on body mass index (BMI) (4 studies, 100 participants: MD -2.18 kg/m², 95% CI -4.90 to 0.54), waist circumference (2 studies, 53 participants: MD 0.68 cm, 95% CI -7.6 to 6.24), proteinuria (4 studies, 84 participants: 0.29 g/day, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.18), systolic (4 studies, 139 participants: -3.45 mmHg, 95% CI -9.99 to 3.09) and diastolic blood pressure (4 studies, 139 participants: -2.02 mmHg, 95% CI -3.79 to 0.24). Any weight loss intervention made little or no difference to total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and inflammation, but may lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol. There was little or no difference between any weight loss interventions (lifestyle or pharmacological) compared to dietary-only weight loss interventions for weight loss, BMI, waist circumference, proteinuria, and systolic blood pressure, however diastolic blood pressure was probably reduced. Furthermore, studies comparing the efficacy of different types of dietary interventions failed to find a specific dietary intervention to be superior for weight loss or a reduction in BMI. Surgical interventions probably reduced body weight (1 study, 11 participants: MD -29.50 kg, 95% CI -36.4 to -23.35), BMI (2 studies, 17 participants: MD -10.43 kg/m², 95% CI -13.58 to -7.29), and waist circumference (MD -30.00 cm, 95% CI -39.93 to -20.07) when compared to non-surgical weight loss interventions after 12 months of follow-up. Proteinuria and blood pressure were not reported. All results across all comparators should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies, very low quality of evidence and heterogeneity across interventions and comparators.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All types of weight loss interventions had uncertain effects on death and cardiovascular events among overweight and obese adults with CKD as no studies reported these outcome measures. Non-surgical weight loss interventions (predominately lifestyle) appear to be an effective treatment to reduce body weight, and LDL cholesterol. Surgical interventions probably reduce body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass. The current evidence is limited by the small number of included studies, as well as the significant heterogeneity and a high risk of bias in most studies."

            "abstract": "An increased oxidative stress is now considered one of the major risk factors in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients that may be exacerbated by dialysis. It has been postulated that this increased oxidative stress might cause an augmented red blood cell (RBC) membrane lipid peroxidation with the consequent alteration in membrane deformability. The aim of this study was to evaluate RBC susceptibility to an in vitro induced oxidative stress and RBC antioxidant potential in different groups of CRF patients undergoing different substitutive treatment modalities. Fifteen end-stage CRF patients were evaluated in conservative treatment, 23 hemodialysis (HD) patients, 15 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, 15 kidney transplanted patients, and 16 controls. Their RBCs were incubated with the oxidative stress-inducing agent tert-butylhydroperoxide both in the presence and in the absence of the catalase inhibitor sodium azide, and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) (a product of lipid peroxidation), was measured at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of incubation. In addition, the RBC content of reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured by HPLC. As opposed to the controls, RBCs from end-stage CRF patients exhibited an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress induced in vitro, both in the absence and presence of a catalase inhibitor, as demonstrated by a significantly higher level of MDA production at all the incubation times (P < 0.05). Different substitutive treatments had different impacts on this phenomenon; CAPD and kidney transplantation were able to normalize this alteration while HD was not. GSH appeared to be related to the increase in RBC susceptibility to oxidative stress; its content being significantly elevated in end-stage CRF and HD patients as compared with CAPD and transplanted patients and controls (P < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the RBC glutathione content during the HD session. The increase of GSH in RBCs of end-stage CRF and HD patients seems to indicate the existence of an adaptive mechanism under increased oxidative stress occurring in vivo. Unlike HD, the beneficial effect of CAPD on the anemia of dialysis patients might partly be due to a condition of lower oxidative stress that might in addition counterbalance the cardiovascular negative effects of dislipidemia of CAPD patients."

We also checked the reference lists of retrieved studies and articles.Date of search: November 2012\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) that compared any dose or form of thyroid hormone therapy alone or in combination with other agents compared with placebo or supplemental treatment (such as furosemide, dopamine, or atrial natriuretic peptide) in adult AKI patients.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes (death, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), we planned to express results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (length of hospital stay, durations of AKI and RRT), we planned to use the mean difference (MD).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Two studies, enrolling 97 participants, met our inclusion criteria. The studies differed significantly in terms of study populations, natural history of AKI (multifactorial AKI in patients with native kidneys versus delayed graft function associated with acute tubular necrosis in transplant recipients), and study interventions; hence, data were not meta-analysed. One study reported a significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality associated with thyroid hormone interventions compared with placebo (59 participants, RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.21 to 9.12); no deaths were reported in the other study. Both studies reported no significant difference in the need for RRT associated with thyroid hormone therapy when compared to placebo. Neither study reported incidence of progression to ESKD. There was a significantly longer duration of AKI (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.82) and RRT (5.00 days, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.95) associated with thyroid hormone therapy compared with placebo in one study; no differences in durations of AKI (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI -3.53 to 7.53) and RRT (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI -2.36 to 6.36) were noted in the other study. One study reported similar lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital in both intervention and control arms (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -8.17 to 7.77); the other did not report this outcome. No adverse events were noted to be associated with thyroid hormone therapy in either study. Adequate data were not available to assess changes in kidney function or numbers of RRT sessions. Both included studies were small and methodological quality was suboptimal.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found a paucity of large, high quality studies to inform analysis of thyroid hormone interventions for the treatment of people with AKI. Current evidence suggested that thyroid hormone therapy may be associated with worse outcomes for patients with established AKI; therefore, its use for these patients should be avoided. The role of thyroid hormone therapy in preventing AKI has not been adequately investigated and may be considered in future clinical studies."

            "abstract": "The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer remains controversial because the potential benefits in terms of prolongation of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) must be balanced against the toxicity of treatment. Following mastectomy, 463 evaluable postmenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemoendocrine therapy for 1 year, or endocrine therapy alone for 1 year, or no adjuvant therapy (Ludwig Trial III). At 7-years median follow-up, OS was longer for the chemoendocrine-treated patients compared with controls (P = .04) and compared with the adjuvant endocrine therapy-alone group (P = .08). In order to balance this therapeutic advantage against the toxic effects of treatment, OS time was divided into time with toxicity (TOX), time without symptoms and toxicity (TWiST), and time after systemic relapse (REL). TOX and REL were weighted by coefficients of utility relative to TWiST and the results added to give a period of quality-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST). Benefits measured by Q-TWiST generally favored chemoendocrine therapy. For example, if TOX and REL were both given utility coefficients of 0.5 relative to 1.0 for TWiST, then by 7 years the average Q-TWiST for chemoendocrine therapy was 6.7 months longer than for no-adjuvant therapy (P = .05) and 4.1 months longer than for endocrine therapy alone (P = .20). Quality-adjusted survival analysis is recommended in assessing costs and benefits of toxic adjuvant therapy. In this example, it supports the use of chemoendocrine therapy in postmenopausal node-positive patients for a wide range of relative values assigned to periods with symptoms and toxicity."

This treatment may also be suitable for patients waiting for renal or renal-pancreas transplantation. In vitro studies of the immune status of peritoneal dialysis patients are conflicting. The most useful conclusions come from comparable series of patients transplanted after either PD or haemodialysis. All such studies report identical results for the two groups. There appears to be a consensus that transplantation should not be sooner than 2 to 6 weeks after the last peritonitis episode. The attitude to the catheter during the transplantation is similarly unanimous. It should be withdrawn 6 to 8 weeks after transplantation, except in exceptional cases. The use of a PD catheter immediately after transplantation is associated with a significant risk of peritoneal infection.

            "abstract": "The increasing concern of antibacterial resistance has been well documented, as has the relative lack of antibiotic development. This paradox is in part due to challenges with clinical development of antibiotics. Because of their rapid progression, untreated bacterial infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. As a consequence, placebo-controlled studies of new agents are unethical. Rather, pivotal development studies are mostly conducted using non-inferiority designs versus an active comparator. Further, infections because of comparator-resistant isolates must usually be excluded from the trial programme. Unfortunately, the placebo-controlled data classically used in support of non-inferiority designs are largely unavailable for antibiotics. The only available data are from the 1930s and 1940s and their use is associated with significant concerns regarding constancy and assay sensitivity. Extended public debate on this challenge has led to proposed solutions by some in which these concerns are addressed by using very conservative approaches to trial design, endpoints and non-inferiority margins, in some cases leading to potentially impractical studies. To compound this challenge, different Regulatory Authorities seem to be taking different approaches to these key issues. If harmonisation does not occur, antibiotic development will become increasingly challenging, with the risk of further decreases in the amount of antibiotic drug development. However with clarity on Regulatory requirements and an ability to feasibly conduct global development programmes, it should be possible to bring much needed additional antibiotics to patients."

Electronic database searches of Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and the WHO Trial Registry were conducted in March 2019. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019133086). Of 7125 records identified, 237 RCTs were included for analysis, representing 35 427 patients with a mean age of 59 years. Only 43 RCTs (18%) reported PROMs of which 27 included a generic PROM that measured health-related quality of life (HRQL) necessary to conduct comparative effectiveness research. There was notable under-representation of certain patient groups-only 31% were women and only 8% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity, in trials which reported such data. The reporting standard of PROMs was highly variable with 8-62% adherence against CONSORT PRO-specific items. In summary, PROMs play a crucial role in determining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments which primarily offer symptomatic improvement, such as CCA. Their underuse significantly limits evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of treatments. Using CCA as an exemplar, there are additional issues of infrequent assessment, poor reporting and under-representation of many population groups. Greater use of PROMs, and specifically validated HRQL questionnaires, is paramount in giving patients a voice in studies, generating more meaningful comparisons between treatments and driving better patient-centred clinical and policy-level decision-making."

This difference appeared to be independent of the duration of dialysis and, although a significant blood transfusion effect was seen in the HD group, no such trend was evident in the CAPD group.

In the United States, kidney transplant rates remain low and <10% of patients utilize home dialysis therapies.

The presentation of treatment options was delayed (48% either after or < 1 month before the first dialysis). The majority of ESRD patients were not presented with chronic peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or renal transplantation as options (66%, 88%, and 74%, respectively). Using multivariate analyses, variables significantly associated with selection of chronic peritoneal dialysis as dialysis modality were the probability of chronic peritoneal dialysis being presented as a treatment option and the time spent on patient education.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An incomplete presentation of treatment options is an important reason for under-utilization of home dialysis therapies and probably delays access to transplantation.

Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings.

No rationale was proposed for stroke; otherwise having a rationale was not associated with objective, positive or negative findings, means of intervention, country of origin, funding source or journal type.

Transplants that were associated with hemodialysis within 24 hours before transplant (study group) were compared with the remainder of the cohort (control group).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 205 renal transplants were reviewed. There were 144 of 205 transplants (70.24%) in the study group, and the others comprised the control group. The rate of delayed graft function was 31% for the study group and 29% for control groups (P = .4959). Mean length of delayed graft function was 5.8 days for the study group and 6.1 days for control group (P = .7323). Delayed graft function risk factors such as donor age, terminal creatinine, and machine perfusion rate were similarly distributed across both groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Normokalemic patients who did or did not undergo dialysis within 24 hours before transplant had equivalent incidence and duration of delayed graft function, graft outcomes, and patient outcomes. Therefore, dialysis within 24 hours before transplant is unnecessary in the setting of normokalemia."

However, the impact of RI on outcome following transplantation and the role of combined liver-kidney transplant are not well understood. The effect of RI on patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) was investigated using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Liver Transplantation Database. Patients were analyzed based on the presence of RI, defined as creatinine >1.6 mg/dl, or on dialysis. Patients undergoing liver-kidney transplantation were analyzed separately. For patients with FHF, the RI group had a lower patient survival rate at 1 year (50% vs. 83%, P=0.04) and tended to have a lower graft survival rate (50% vs. 71%). Stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was prolonged in the RI group but hospital stay was not. Among patients with cirrhosis, RI did not affect patient survival, except for patients on dialysis or those with liver-kidney transplants. One-year patient and graft survival rates were 65% and 60% for the dialysis group, 74% and 70% for the liver-kidney transplant group, 89% and 86% for RI patients not on dialysis, and 89 and 84% for non-RI patients. ICU and hospital stays were prolonged for all of the RI groups compared with the non-RI patients. Patients with RI had higher rates of posttransplant dialysis; however, the differences tended to equalize after 4 weeks. We conclude that RI in FHF and RI requiring dialysis or liver-kidney transplantation in cirrhosis predict lower posttransplant patient and graft survival rates. Patients with RI have longer hospital and ICU stays and an increased need for dialysis, which likely increases the cost of transplantation. Whether liver-kidney transplantation improves outcome and thus represents an appropriate use of cadaver kidneys requires further study."

Long-term clinical observations of children and teenagers with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) showed that more than one third of those patients manifested various cardio-vascular conditions. The aim of the study was to analyze possible disturbances in the heart ventricular conduction system by using a technique of ventricular activation time (VAT) differences in ESRF children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) with normal electrocardiogram (ECG) examinations.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      The study group comprised 10 ESRD children (mean age: 13.6 ± 2.31 years) on peritoneal dialysis - group I. The control group (group II) consisted of 26 age-matched healthy children with no clinical evidence of renal or cardiac disease and with normal 12-lead ECG recordings. Each of the ESRD patients was also subjected to the standard ECG examination. In order to capture possible heart conduction abnormalities, body surface potential mapping (BSPM) recordings were performed in PD patients between the successive dwells ('on empty abdomen') with a HPM-7100 Fukuda Denshi system.

Nowadays, it is known that reducing the dialysis period has many advantages regarding QoL and medical outcomes. Although preemptive transplantation is the preferred strategy to prevent patients undergoing dialysis, its psychological impact is unknown. Moreover, transplantation can be experienced in a completely different manner among patients who were on dialysis and those who still had a functioning kidney at the time of surgery. Longitudinal data are often collected to allow analyzing the evolution of patients' QoL over time using questionnaires. Such data are often difficult to interpret due to the patients' changing standards, values, or conceptualization of what the questionnaire is intended to measure (e.g. QoL). This phenomenon is referred to as response shift and is often linked to the way the patients might adapt or cope with their disease experience. Whether response shift is experienced in a different way among patients who were on dialysis and those who still had a functioning kidney at time of surgery is unknown and will be studied in the PreKit-QoL study (trial registration number: NCT02154815).

Multivariate survival analysis according to the Cox proportional-hazard model showed that the most powerful predictor associated with high risk of death was low serum albumin levels. According to the Cox model other independent variables significantly associated with increase in the probability of death while on CAPD were advancing age, low serum creatinine concentrations and elevated serum cholesterol levels. These results indicate that the risk factors associated with death in CAPD patients are similar to those observed for hemodialysis patients and suggest that using simple laboratory measurements at the enrollment in CAPD the relative risk of death for each patient can be estimated."

We examined data for heterogeneity (I2 technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings' table for seven main outcomes of interest using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We were able to include six studies (586 participants). Non-standard care consisted solely of another type of exercise programme. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There was a clear difference in the outcome leaving the study early (6 RCTs, n=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 to 0.83, medium quality evidence) in favour of the yoga group. There were no clear differences between groups for the remaining outcomes. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 to 1.07, low quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 to 1.04, low quality evidence), quality of life (mental health) (average change 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) quality-of-life sub-scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD -5.30 CI -17.78 to 7.18, low quality evidence), physical health, (average change WHOQOL-BREF physical-health sub-scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD 9.22 CI -0.42 to 18.86, low quality evidence). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. There were a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included relapse, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found minimal differences between yoga and non-standard care, the latter consisting of another exercise comparator, which could be broadly considered aerobic exercise. Outcomes were largely based on single studies with limited sample sizes and short-term follow-up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality - too weak to indicate that yoga is superior or inferior to non-standard care control for management of people with schizophrenia."

            "abstract": "Whether changes in substrate and insulin levels that occur during peritoneal dialysis (PD) have effects on muscle protein dynamics was evaluated by studying muscle protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NB) by the forearm perfusion method associated with the kinetics of 3H-phenylalanine in acute, crossover studies in which PD patients served as their own controls. Studies were performed (1) in the basal state and during PD with dialysates that contained dextrose alone in different concentrations (protocol 1: eight patients), (2) during PD with dialysates that contained dextrose alone or dextrose and amino acids (AA) (protocol 2: five patients), and (3) in time controls (five patients). PD with dextrose alone induced (1) a two- to threefold increase in insulin, as well as a 20 to 25% decrease in AA, mainly BCAA, levels; (2) an insulin-related decline (-18%) in forearm PB (P<0.002); (3) a 20% decrease in muscle PS (P<0.04), which was related to arterial BCAA and K+ (P<0.02 to 0.05); (4) a persistent negative NB; and (5) a decrease in the efficiency of muscle protein turnover, expressed as the ratio NB/PB. PD with dextrose+AA versus PD with dextrose induced (1) similarly high insulin levels but with a significant increase in total arterial AA (+30 to 110%), mainly valine; (2) a reduced release of AA from muscle (P<0.05); and (3) a decrease in the negative NB observed during PD with dextrose, owing to an increase (approximately 20%) in muscle PS, without any further effect on muscle PB. This study indicates that in PD patients in the fasting state, the moderate hyperinsulinemia that occurs during PD with dextrose alone causes an antiproteolytic action that is obscured by a parallel decrease in AA availability for PS. Conversely, the combined use of dextrose and AA results in a cumulative effect, because of the suppression of endogenous muscle PB (induced by insulin) and the stimulation of muscle PS (induced by AA availability). The hypothesis, therefore, is that in patients who are treated with PD, when fasting or when nutrient intake is reduced, muscle mass could be maintained better by the combined use of dextrose and AA."

The principle of haemodialysis is that such substances can be removed when blood is passed over a semipermeable membrane. Natural membrane materials can be used including cellulose or modified cellulose, more recently various synthetic membranes have been developed. Synthetic membranes are regarded as being more \"biocompatible\" in that they incite less of an immune response than cellulose-based membranes.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of different haemodialysis membrane material in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched Medline (1966 to December 2000), Embase (1981 to November 2000), PreMedline (29 November 2000), HealthStar (1975 to December 2000), Cinahl (1982 to October 2000), The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 1996), Biosis (1989 to June 1995), Sigle (1980 to June 1996), Crib (10th edition, 1995), UK National Research Register (September 1996), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted biomedical companies, investigators and we hand searched Kidney International (1980 to 1997). Date of the most recent searches: November 2000.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing different haemodialysis membrane material in patients with ESRD.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of studies. Data was abstracted from included studies onto a standard form by one reviewer and checked by another.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty seven studies met our inclusion criteria and where possible data from these were summated by meta-analyses (Peto's odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)). Twenty two outcome measures were sought in 10 broad areas. For two (number of episodes of significant infection per year and quality of life) no data were available. For the comparison of cellulose with synthetic membranes, data for 12/20 outcome measures were available in only a single trial. For modified cellulose and synthetic membranes, data for three outcome measures were available in one trial only and for 12 of the outcomes no data were found, crossover studies were analysed separately and studies which randomised by patient yet analysed by dialysis sessions adjusted for clustering. Pre-dialysis beta2 microglobulin concentrations were significantly lower at the end of the studies in patients treated with synthetic membranes (WMD - 14.5; 95% CI -17.4 to -11.6). One crossover study showed a lowering of beta2 microglobulin when low flux synthetic membranes were used. When analysed for a change in beta2 microglobulin across a trial a fall was only noted when high flux membranes were used. In one very small study the incidence of amyloid was less in patients who were dialysed for six years with high flux synthetic membranes (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18). In the single study which measured triglyceride values there was a significant difference in favour of the synthetic (high flux) membrane (WMD -0.66; 95% CI -1.18 to -0.14). Serum albumin was higher in patients treated with synthetic membranes (both low and high flux) although this just bordered statistical significance (WMD -0.09; 95% CI -0.18 to 0.00). Dialysis adequacy measured by Kt/V was marginally higher when cellulose membranes were used (WMD 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.16). There was no significant difference between these membranes for any of the other clinical outcomes measures but confidence intervals were generally wide. No differences were found between modified cellulose and synthetic membranes although many fewer trials were carried out for this comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For clinical practice This systematic literature review has generated no evidence of benefit when synthetic membranes were used compared with cellulose/modified cellulose membranes in terms of reduced mortality nor reduction in dialysis related adverse symptoms. Despite the relatively large number of RCTs undertaken in this area none of the included studies reported any measures of quality of life. End-of-study beta2 microglobulin values, and possibly the development of amyloid disease, were less in patients treated with synthetic membranes compared with cellulose membranes. Plasma triglyceride values were also lower with synthetic membranes in the single study that measured this outcome. Differences in these outcomes may have reflected the high flux of the synthetic membrane. Serum albumin was higher when synthetic membranes of both high and low flux were used. Kt/V and urea reduction ratio were higher when cellulose or modified cellulose membranes were used in the few studies that measured these outcomes. We are hesitant to recommend the universal use of synthetic membranes for haemodialysis in patients with ESRD because of; the small number of trials (particularly for modified cellulose membranes, most with low patient numbers), the heterogeneity of many of the trials compared, the variations in membrane flux, the differences in exclusion criteria, particularly relating to comorbidity and the relative lack of patient-centred outcomes studied. Such evidence as we have favours synthetic membranes but even if we assume extra benefit it may be at considerable cost, particularly if high flux synthetic membranes were to be used. For further research A further systematic review of RCTs comparing high and low flux haemodialysis membranes, subgrouped according to membrane composition (cellulose, modified cellulose, synthetic) and reporting clinical outcomes of major importance to patients needs to be undertaken. Further pragmatic RCTs are required to compare the different dialysis membranes available. We recommend that they: - Take into account other properties including flux as well as the material from which the membrane is made and test modified cellulose membranes as well as standard ones. - Record an agreed minimum dataset on primary outcomes of major importance to patients. - Explicitly record whether symptoms are patient- or staff-reported recognising that generally patient reporting will be more appropriate for evaluating effectiveness but staff reported data may be necessary for calculating the cost of treating complications. - Be multi-centre (and possibly multinational) to have sufficient patients to complete the study to allow for a considerable number of withdrawals and dropouts. - Have sufficient length of follow up to draw conclusions for important clinical outcome measures and continue to follow patients who have renal transplants. - Include older patients and those with comorbid illnesses and take into account age and comorbidity when assessing outcomes (possibly by stratification at trial entry). - Carry out, in parallel, an economic evaluation of the different policies being compared in the trial."

Transplantation of a kidney. In order to define the optimal therapy for these patients not only economic factors but also quantitative evaluation of life quality has to be taken into account. To this end a questionnaire called \"Sickness Impact Profile\", that covers most of the relevant features of life and is well established in the Anglo-Saxon countries, was translated into German language and tested in 34 hemodialysis-patients, 25 CAPD-patients and 29 patients with kidney transplant, in order to investigate the applicability. Results showed that the German issue can successfully be applied to Swiss patients with renal failure and lead to the conclusion that--in accordance to results of similar studies in the USA--life quality in patients with kidney transplant is better than in patients treated with hemodialysis or CAPD."

Children are frequently on dialysis for less than 2 years prior to transplantation. Thus if type 1 UF frequency increases with time on dialysis, it would be expected to occur less frequently in children, because they often are on dialysis for shorter periods. A retrospective chart review was performed to determine the cause of ultrafiltration failure in children; 172 children, mean age 8.0 +/- 5.5 (SD) years received a mean of 15 +/- 11.9 (SD) months of chronic PD; 39 patients received only continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, 18 received only continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis, 22 received only tidal PD, and 94 received more than one type of PD. Ten patients (5.8%) developed type 2 UF failure as sequellae of atypical peritonitis, Candida albicans (6 patients), Mycobacterium foruitum (2), Achromatium spp. (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). There was no significant difference in time on dialysis for children who developed membrane failure. No patients with type 1 or type 3 UF could be identified.

The results are generally disappointing with respect to clinically relevant endpoints such as membrane function and patient survival. The rarity of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, still a vexing and worrying complication, hampers any systematic examination of pathogenesis and treatment. The establishment of registries may help to better understand this condition. In the absence of randomized, controlled trials of PD versus hemodialysis, survival analyses are fraught with enormous methodological and statistical pitfalls. Nevertheless, many investigators remain focused on small differences in survival between the two modalities; even more inappropriately, some clinicians use these imperfect data to guide their modality recommendations. Recent outcome studies suggest that the survival of patients on PD compared with conventional hemodialysis is astonishingly similar, and differences between early and late survival are more explainable by the circumstances around initiation than by the modality itself."

            "abstract": "Home extended hours hemodialysis improves some measurable biological and quality-of-life parameters over conventional renal replacement therapies in patients with end-stage renal disease. Published small studies evaluating costs have shown savings in terms of ongoing operating costs with this modality. However, all estimates need to include the total costs, including infrastructure, patient training, and maintenance; patient attrition by death, transplantation, technique failure; and the necessity of in-center dialysis. We describe a comprehensive funding model for a large centrally administered but locally delivered home hemodialysis program in British Columbia, Canada that covered 122 patients, of which 113 were still in the program at study end. The majority of patients performed home nocturnal hemodialysis in this 2-year retrospective study. All training periods, both in-center and in-home dialysis, medications, hospitalizations, and deaths were captured using our provincial renal database and vital statistics. Comparative data from the provincial database and pricing models were used for costing purposes. The total comprehensive costs per patient-incorporating startup, home, and in-center dialysis; medications; home remodeling; and consumables-was $59,179 for years 2004-2005 and $48,648 for 2005-2006. The home dialysis patients required multiple in-center dialysis runs, significantly contributing to the overall costs. Our study describes a valid, comprehensive funding model delineating reliable cost estimates of starting and maintaining a large home-based hemodialysis program. Consideration of hidden costs is important for administrators and planners to take into account when designing budgets for home hemodialysis."

            "abstract": "The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide was estimated to be 39.5 million in 2006, 2.6 million more than in 2004. The manifestations of HIV infection in the kidney are multiple and varied, highlighting the complexity of the disease process. There is a wide spectrum of renal disease that occurs in the course of HIV infection. Biopsy studies reveal varying frequencies of histological patterns. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is most common. A biopsy study at Chris Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa showed that HIVAN was present in 27% and immune complex disease in 21%. Han et al. studied HIV-positive patients in Durban, South Africa and screened for proteinuria, including microalbuminuria. They found persistent proteinuria in 6%; HIVAN in 21/30 (72.4%) and the prevalence of HIVAN in patients with persistent microalbuminuria was 85.7%. Studies in black patients have shown a higher prevalence of both severe glomerular lesions (focal glomerulosclerosis) and nephrotic range proteinuria with renal dysfunction in the presence of normo-hypotension. There have been no prospective randomised controlled studies with any form of therapy for HIVAN to date. Therapy of HIVAN has included corticosteroids, cyclosporine and antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART appears to be a logical choice in the management of HIV-associated renal disease. Regimens containing protease inhibitors have been shown to be associated with significant slowing of the decline in creatinine clearance. Both peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis are appropriate treatment modalities for HIV-infected patients with end stage renal disease. The choice of dialysis modality between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis is not a factor in predicting survival, if patients are stable on ART. Preliminary short-term data in case reports and small cohorts of liver, kidney, and heart transplant recipients suggest that patient survival rates may be similar to those in HIV-uninfected transplant recipients. However, high rates of acute and chronic rejection have been observed among HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines in 2005, recommending that all individuals be assessed for kidney disease at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection with a screening urinalysis for proteinuria and a calculated estimate of renal function. Therefore any patient with persistent proteinuria, persistent haematuria or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) should be referred to an institution where a specialist can evaluate this patient for further investigations. An integrated plan to reduce the progression to kidney failure together with lifestyle measures, focusing also on high risk groups with effective management at all levels of chronic kidney disease remains essential."

            "abstract": "To reduce a clinical trial's cost and ethical risk to its enrollees, some oncology trial designers have suggested borrowing information from similar but already completed trials to reduce the number of patients needed for the current study. Motivated by competing drug therapies for lymphoma, we propose a Bayesian adaptive \"platform\" trial design that uses commensurate prior methods at interim analyses to borrow adaptively from the control group of an earlier-starting trial. The design adjusts the trial's randomization ratio in favor of the novel treatment when the interim posterior indicates commensurability of the two control groups. In this setting, our design can supplement a control arm with historical data, and randomize more new patients to the novel treatments. This design is both ethical and economical, since it shortens the process of introducing new treatments into the market, and any additional costs introduced by this design will be compensated by the savings in control arm sizes. Our approach performs well via simulation across settings with varying degrees of commensurability and true treatment effects, and compares favorably to an adaptive \"all-or-nothing\" approach in which the decision to pool or discard historical controls is based on a simple ad-hoc frequentist test at interim analysis. We also consider a three drug extension where a new imaginary intervention joins the platform, and show again that our procedure performs well via simulation."

There have been challenges and limitations in several of the trials addressing the optimal treatment strategy for SIHD due to potential selection bias (due to knowledge of coronary anatomy prior to randomization), patient crossover, and advances in medical therapy and revascularization strategies since trial completion. The challenges inherent to prior trials addressing the optimal management strategy for SIHD have impacted the generalizability of results to real-world cohorts. Until the results of additional ongoing trials are available, the decision for revascularization or medical therapy should be based on patients' symptoms, weighing the risks and benefits of each approach, and patient preference."

            "abstract": "Impaired cognitive functioning in patients with end-stage renal disease may reduce their capabilities to adhere to complex medical or dietary regimens and to fully participate in medical decisions. With decreasing renal function, cognitive abilities are likely to decline, with cognitive dysfunction improving after initiation of dialysis and even being generally reversible after successful renal transplantation. However, little is known about cognitive changes particularly regarding different treatment modalities. To gain further insight into this, we focused on a one-year course of cognitive functions, comparing peritoneal to hemodialysis patients. Within the CORETH-project, two validated neurocognitive tests, assessing executive functioning (Trail Making Test-B) and attention (d2-Revision-Test) and the self-reported Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form Cognitive Function-subscale, were administered to 271 patients at baseline and after one year. Subsamples were matched by propensity score, adjusting for age, comorbidity, education, and employment status for 96 hemodialysis and 101 peritoneal dialysis patients. The effects of time and treatment modality were investigated, controlling for well-known confounders. Both tests revealed improvement over one year. Peritoneal dialysis was associated with better outcomes than hemodialysis at baseline and follow-up, but comparability between groups may be limited. The opposite pattern applied to self-reporting. Hemodialysis patients had to be excluded from cognitive testing more often than peritoneal dialysis patients. As such, the number of exclusions may have biased the findings, limiting generalizability. Thus, our findings suggest an improvement of cognitive functioning and support previous indications for peritoneal dialysis being associated with better cognitive functions during a one-year course than hemodialysis."

When adjusted for all available demographic and clinical data, pretransplant treatment with hemodialysis (vs. peritoneal dialysis) was associated with a 19% increased risk in de novo posttransplant HF, with sub-distribution HR 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09-1.29).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that choice of pretransplant dialysis modality may impact the development of posttransplant HF.\n"

With ever-growing numbers of patients requiring treatment for this condition, the increased use of peritoneal dialysis is being promoted. While it is known that quality of life is reduced when using dialysis, few studies have sought to explore experiences of peritoneal dialysis specifically. No previous studies were identified that adopted an ethnographic approach.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative design was employed, utilising ethnographic methodology.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Ethical and governance approvals were gained in November 2010 and data were generated in 2011.

HRQoL questionnaires included the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a Patient Assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS) Impact (PAMSI), and MS-specific symptom scales for Bladder and Bowel Control, Cognition, and Sexual Satisfaction. Standard summary statistics described the population while Pearson and Spearman correlations evaluated the baseline association between HRQoL and clinical measures. Cross-sectional estimates of MID in HRQoL scores were derived using several clinical anchors, the PAMSI, and two tests: Tukey multiple comparisons and adjacent mean difference.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients (n = 249) had a mean age of 39.0 (Standard deviation, SD = 10.5), 70% were female, 63% resided in Europe, and 96% were Caucasian. Baseline median Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) was 2.5 (range = 0.0-6.5); median disease duration was 1.9 years (range = 0.1-33.6). The worst baseline mean (normalized) SF-36 scores were for General Health (39.9), Role Physical (40.4), Physical Functioning (41.0), and Vitality (42.7). The worst MS symptom mean scores were for Cognition (6.3) and FSS (4.4). Fatigue scores indicated substantial burden and were consistent with SF-36 Vitality results. Baseline HRQoL scores (SF-36, FSS, MS symptom scales) correlated most with EDSS, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), age and disease duration.

HRQoL data varied with clinical measures and contributed new information regarding disease burden. The association between clinical and HRQoL measures was limited to cross-sectional analysis and requires confirmation in longitudinal datasets. These findings reflect an ambulatory, early-stage RRMS population that was mostly European in location or descent. The PAMSI also requires further validation as a measure of patient health status."

            "abstract": "The main reason why peritoneal dialysis (PD) still has limited use in the management of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) lies in the fact that the currently used glucose-based PD solutions are not completely biocompatible and determine, over time, the degeneration of the peritoneal membrane (PM) and consequent loss of ultrafiltration (UF). Here we evaluated the biocompatibility of a novel formulation of dialytic solutions, in which a substantial amount of glucose is replaced by two osmometabolic agents, xylitol and l-carnitine. The effect of this novel formulation on cell viability, the integrity of the mesothelial barrier and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated on human mesothelial cells grown on cell culture inserts and exposed to the PD solution only at the apical side, mimicking the condition of a PD dwell. The results were compared to those obtained after exposure to a panel of dialytic solutions commonly used in clinical practice. We report here compelling evidence that this novel formulation shows better performance in terms of higher cell viability, better preservation of the integrity of the mesothelial layer and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This new formulation could represent a step forward towards obtaining PD solutions with high biocompatibility."

Sleep disorders are common in ESRD patients treated with dialysis and are associated with patients' perceptions of quality of life, assessed by diverse measures, as well as depressive affect. Sleep disorders appear to be equally prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Treatment for sleep disorders in dialysis patients depends on establishing the diagnosis, often in a sleep laboratory, using polysomnography. Reversing coexistent medical and psychological disorders is important. The sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure in dialysis patients, but conventional hemodialytic techniques have little effect on its severity. In contrast, nocturnal HD and transplantation appear to have important beneficial effects on sleep disordered breathing in ESRD patients. Although pain has been appreciated as a problem for ESRD patients for more than 20 years, few studies exist on this subject. Pain appears to be an underappreciated problem for ESRD patients. More research must be performed on the problem of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)."

This was a multicentric French clinical trial (51 centers) of Phase IV, open, controlled, randomized, consisting in two parallel groups: the Soleduc group (N=111) and the control group (N=109). All subjects received a variable dose over the 2-year period of the same antipsychotic drug (amisulpride).

Patients in the control group received a non-specific psychosocial training for an equivalent period of time. The models of Andersen-Gill (AG) and Prentice, Williams and Peterson (PWP) were used to analyze relapses. Patients in the Soleduc group attended 14.8+/-6.1 sessions (mean+/-SD), including 17 patients who never attended a session. Intent to treat analysis showed less patients relapsing in the Soleduc group as compared to the control group (21.6% versus 28.4% after 1 year and 84.4% versus 90.8% after 2years), but the differences were not statistically significant. Relapse risk was significantly reduced for patients who followed at least 7 modules (p=0.015 AG-test; p<0.001 PWP-test). In conclusion, no significant differences in relapse rates were found between patients attending the Soleduc program and the control group.

Depression is the most common disorder in the world, generally has a higher prevalence among women. In our study we overview and demonstrate that the exercise is a powerful intervention for prevention and treatment not only in non-clinical but also in clinical levels of depression. In sub-clinical levels of depression the meta-analytic findings and population surveys suggest that the exercise is associated with a significant moderate reduction of depression in different groups by gender and age; as well as a physically active lifestyle associates with lower levels of depression. In clinical levels of depression the physical activity is an effective tool in the prevention, studies support an association between higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of depression. In the treatment of clinical depression the randomized-controlled trials suggest the clear positive effects of exercise. This effect is similar to psychotherapeutic interventions and it was appeared under relatively short time (4-8 weeks). The exercise is one of the most important preventive health-related behaviors. Our review suggests a protective effect from activity on the development of clinical levels of depression and depressive symptoms. In addition the randomized controlled trials support a causal connection between exercise and reduction of depression.

In the absence of health insurance plans, fewer than 10% of all patients receive renal replacement therapy (RRT). Hemodialysis (HD) is mainly a short-term measure to support ESRD patients prior to transplant. Infections are common in dialysis patients. The majority of patients starting HD die or are forced to abandon treatment because of cost constraints within the first 3 months. The cost of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is two times higher than that of HD, fewer than 2% of patients are started on PD. Among the three RRT options available, renal transplant is the preferred mode, as it is most cost-effective and provides a better quality of life. But due to financial constraints and nonavailability of organs, only about 5% of ESRD patients undergo transplant surgery. Though the removal of organs from brain-dead patients has been legalized, the concept of donation of organs from deceased donors has not received adequate social sanction. Only 2% of all transplants are performed from deceased donors. Due to limited access to RRT, the ideal approach should be to reduce the incidence of ESRD and attempt preventive measures. Preemptive transplant, reducing the duration of dialysis prior to transplant, use of immunosuppression for only up to 1 year, and availability of more deceased donor organs may be helpful to make RRT options within the reach of the common man."

There was a trend toward poorer graft survival in non-white SLE patients receiving living donor grafts compared with white SLE patients. An increased graft failure rate was seen among those SLE cadaveric transplant recipients receiving peritoneal dialysis before transplant compared with controls and compared with SLE patients receiving hemodialysis. No differences were seen in rates of acute tubular necrosis or overall acute rejection incidence, although there was a significant increase in the percentage of living donor SLE patients who experienced greater than four rejection episodes.

            "abstract": "Despite advances in treatment and prevention, peritonitis remains a major problem in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with often technique failure as a consequence. The last decades the focus of PD peritonitis has changed from lowering peritonitis incidence to improvement of peritonitis outcome. Prognostic factors for peritonitis outcome can influence decision making during the treatment of peritonitis, for example to take out the PD catheter early in the time course of peritonitis and prevent further damage to the peritoneal membrane. In this paper, we give a review of the literature about prognostic factors for peritonitis outcome. In most studies, age, gender, diabetes, time on PD, a precursor of calcitonin:procalcitonin, IL-6 and albumin did not show a significant effect on peritonitis outcome. The following factors have been associated with poor outcome of peritonitis: Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium species, fungal peritonitis, polymicrobial peritonitis, concurrent exit site or tunnel infection, Caucasian race, low residual GFR, persistently elevated peritoneal dialysate white cell count, CRP, and low levels of slCAM-1 and hyaluronan at the end of peritonitis treatment. In fungal peritonitis, abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, the catheter remaining in situ and Candidaparapsilosis are factors associated with higher mortality rate and a greater risk of technique failure. Recent antibiotic therapy and peritonitis are associated with poor treatment response in culture-negative peritonitis. Recurrent peritonitis episodes have a poor therapeutic response and high mortality and have a worse prognosis than relapsing ones. Older age, long PD duration and continuous elevated serum CRP levels are predictors of adverse outcomes in PD patients after peritonitis-related catheter removal. Peritonitis remains a serious complication of PD with marked morbidity. It is a common cause of technique failure. The rate of PD-related peritonitis has decreased over the last decades due to advances in treatment and prevention. Nowadays, the focus moved from lowering peritonitis incidence towards improving peritonitis outcome. It is useful to have prognostic factors for peritonitis outcome, because they can influence decision-making during the treatment of peritonitis, for example to take out the PD catheter early in the time course of peritonitis and prevent further damage to the peritoneal membrane. In the last decades, many publications appeared about prognostic factors for peritonitis outcome. This article summarizes those prognostic factors, based on an extensive review of the literature."

Fifty patients scheduled for laparotomy after penetrating abdominal wounds were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin phosphate 600 mg every six hours with gentamicin (as the sulfate salt) 3-5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses or moxalactam disodium 2 g every 12 hours. Therapy was begun preoperatively and continued for a minimum of three days in patients without hollow-organ injury and five days in patients with hollow-organ injury; total duration of therapy could not exceed four weeks. Patients receiving moxalactam also received phytonadione 10 mg intramuscularly once a week. Although wound cultures from several patients were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci, no symptomatic infections developed. No direct toxic effects of moxalactam or gentamicin-clindamycin were seen; transient abnormalities in blood-coagulation tests or serum creatinine concentration occurred in several patients. Although mean drug costs per patient for moxalactam and gentamicin-clindamycin were similar, the mean cost of therapy per patient was $125.23 higher for the combination regimen than for moxalactam when laboratory, personnel-time, and supply costs were added to drug costs. Moxalactam given every 12 hours was a safe and effective alternative to the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin for preventive use in the study patients with penetrating abdominal trauma."

Therefore, we studied the effects of pre-transplant dialysis modality on outcomes in a large United States cohort.\n## METHODS\nWe compared rates of transplantation between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients from the years 1995 to 1998 in the United States (N = 252,402) and outcomes after transplantation (N = 22,776), using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n## RESULTS\nIn a Cox proportional hazards analysis that was adjusted for multiple patient characteristics, kidney transplantation was 1.39 (95% CI = 1.35 to 1.43) times more likely in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis patients (P < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the adjusted risk for death-censored graft failure was 1.15 (1.04 to 1.26) times higher in peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis (P < 0.05), but mortality and overall graft failure rates were not different. Pre-transplant dialysis modality did not affect outcomes for patients who survived with a functioning kidney for at least 3 months. However, in adjusted Cox analyses restricted to the first 3 months, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a 1.23 (1.09 to 1.39) times higher risk for early graft failure (P < 0.001) and a 1.33 (1.16 to 1.53) times higher risk for death-censored graft failure (P < 0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients, however, were seen to have a lower incidence of delayed graft function. In a smaller sample of patients with data on causes of early graft failure, graft thrombosis was more commonly listed as a cause of graft failure among peritoneal dialysis patients, 41% (64/156), compared to hemodialysis patients, 30% (106/349), P < 0.05.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nKidney transplantation is more frequent in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis patients, and transplantation in peritoneal dialysis patients is more frequently associated with early, but not late, graft failure. Delayed graft function was less common in peritoneal dialysis patients but this potential benefit appears to be offset by other factors which are associated with early graft loss. Additional studies are needed to determine what factors may help understand this early risk of graft failure.\n"

The most common primary renal diagnosis was renal hypoplasia/dysplasia, occurring in 7 infants. Mean time on PD was 10 +/- 10 months. Eleven infants had oliguria, and 10 infants had adequate urine output. All but 1 infant received tube feedings; mean caloric intake was 453 +/- 92 kJ/kg/day. Despite nutritional management, weight, height, and head circumference was at or above the fifth percentile in only 10, 4, and 5 infants, respectively. Nonrenal abnormalities were present in 12 of 21 infants with lung, heart, and central nervous system abnormalities occurring most often. Outcome included 7 receiving renal transplants, 1 who recovered renal function, 4 who continued on PD, and 9 who died. Seven infants with oliguria died, while only 2 infants with adequate urine output died. No infant with isolated renal disease died, while 9 of 12 patients with renal plus nonrenal abnormalities died. Thus mortality in infants less than one year of age on PD appears to be associated with the presence of oliguria and nonrenal abnormalities."

            "abstract": "Maintenance dialysis usually serves as an interim treatment for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) until transplantation can take place. Some children, however, may require dialytic support for an extended period of time. Although dialysis improves some of the problems associated with growth failure in ESRD (acidosis, uremia, calcium, and phosphorus imbalance), many children continue to grow poorly. Therefore, three different dialysis modalities, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), cycler/intermittent peritoneal dialysis (CPD), and hemodialysis (HD), were evaluated with regard to their effects on the growth of children initiating dialysis and remaining on that modality for 6-12 months. Growth was best for children undergoing CAPD when compared with the other two modalities with regard to the following growth parameters: incremental height standard deviation score for chronological age [-0.55 +/- 2.06 vs. -1.69 +/- 1.22 for CPD (P < 0.05) and -1.80 +/- 1.13 for HD (P < 0.05)]; incremental height standard deviation score for bone age [-1.68 +/- 1.71 vs. -2.45 +/- 1.43 for CPD (P = NS) and -2.03 +/- 1.28 for HD (P = NS)]; change in height standard deviation score during the dialysis period [0.00 +/- 0.67 vs. -0.15 +/- .29 for CPD (P = NS) and -0.23 +/- .23 for HD (P = NS)]. The reasons why growth appears to be best in children receiving CAPD may be related to its metabolic benefits: lower levels of uremia, as reflected by the blood urea nitrogen [50 +/- 12 vs. 69 +/- 16 mg/dl for CPD (P < 0.5) and 89 +/- 17 for HD (P < 0.05)], improved metabolic acidosis, as indicated by a higher serum bicarbonate concentration [24 +/- 2 mEq/l vs. 22 +/- 2 for CPD (P < 0.05) and 21 +/- 2 for HD (P < 0.05)]. In addition, children undergoing CAPD receive significant supplemental calories from the glucose absorbed during dialysis. CAPD, and possibly, other types of prolonged-dwell daily peritoneal dialysis appear to be most beneficial for growth, which may be of particular importance for the smaller child undergoing dialysis while awaiting transplantation."

            "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney-graft failure who are starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment need special consideration. The question of whether mortality is higher in these patients than in those who have not received a transplant is controversial. However, some studies suggest that differences in mortality between these groups are mainly explained by variations in age, duration of dialysis and comorbidity. One study showed similar survival between patients with chronic graft failure treated with hemodialysis (HD) and those on PD, but there is some evidence that residual renal function in PD patients with chronic graft failure declines faster than in PD-patients without transplants. Until now there have been no data on whether PD has a positive influence on the course of residual renal clearances compared with the influence of HD. The fact that PD patients with transplants show significantly higher peritoneal transport rates than patients without transplants may have an influence on technique survival. In patients with chronic graft failure, the type and dose of immunosuppressive therapy, as well as its influence on the incidence of acute rejections, residual renal function and infection rates, are also controversial. Immunosuppressive therapy may preserve residual graft function, but these patients have a higher risk of Gram-negative peritonitis, a shorter interval between start of dialysis and first episode of peritonitis, and a higher risk of catheter infections with Staphylococcus aureus than PD patients without transplants. In conclusion, PD is an acceptable treatment option for patients with chronic kidney-graft failure provided that the above clinical aspects are considered (e.g., intensified monitoring of infections and residual renal function)."

The results illustrate the geographical variations in CRF aetiology in different countries, which may be influenced by current patterns of referral as well as environmental and society factors.

We have shown that nutritional deterioration in patients with gastrointestinal and head and neck cancer was multifactorial and mainly determined by the tumour burden and location. In a larger cohort, stage and location were yet again the major determinants of patients' quality of life (QoL), despite the fact that nutritional deterioration combined with intake deficits were functionally more relevant than cancer stage. Based on this framework, the potential role of integrated oral nutritional support on outcomes was investigated. In a pilot study using individualized nutritional counselling on a heterogeneous patient population, the achieved improvement of nutritional intake was proportional to a better QoL. The role of early nutritional support was further analysed in a prospective randomized controlled trial in head and neck cancer patients stratified by stage undergoing radiotherapy. Pre-defined outcomes were: nutritional status and intake, morbidity and QoL, at the end and 3 months after radiotherapy. Nutritional interventions, only given during radiotherapy, consisted of three randomization arms: (1) individualized nutritional counselling vs. (2) ad libitum diet+high protein supplements vs. (3) ad libitum diet. Nutritional interventions 1 and 2 positively influenced outcomes during radiotherapy; however, 3 months after its completion individualized nutritional counselling was the single method capable of sustaining a significant impact on patients' outcomes.

The reasons behind the choice of placebo control in new drug development include anticipated small effect size for active-controlled comparisons and the sufficiency of demonstrated treatment effect (new drug vs placebo) for regulatory approval. These reasons have led to great reliance on placebo control in drug evaluation studies, despite the ethical controversy over the use of placebo when there are known effective standard treatments. While the use of placebo controls has been widely debated, a less considered aspect of the usual placebo-controlled non-equivalence design is the disparity between the decisions that it supports and those that pervade clinical practice. We propose an alternative approach that randomizes one group of patients to an adaptive treatment strategy that exemplifies the adaptive nature of clinical decision-making in the treatment of ongoing mental health disorders. The basic idea is to compare the adaptive strategy, which uses a patient's outcomes to date to determine when to switch from an initial treatment (e.g. an accepted standard) to an alternative (e.g. the new) treatment, to fixed trials of either treatment option. We state the conditions under which the adaptive treatment RCT is attractive to implement and the requirements for doing so."

Ours was a cross-sectional study of 81 patients aged 10 years to 21 years with ESRD (68 with kidney transplants and 13 on dialysis) at five Spanish paediatric nephrology centres. HRQOL was investigated with the Spanish version of the child health and illness profile, adolescent edition (CHIP-AE). Clinical variables such as underlying diagnosis, number of rejection episodes, pre-emptive transplantation, anaemia and height were also analysed. No differences were found between patients with kidney transplants and their healthy peers in any domain or sub-domain of CHIP-AE. The group on dialysis scored lower than healthy controls and patients with transplants for satisfaction with health. Discomfort was higher in patients with transplants who had suffered one rejection episode. Physical discomfort was increased in anaemic patients with transplants. Short patients scored less in the satisfaction domain, with lower self-esteem and lower satisfaction with health. Adolescents with kidney transplants had better satisfaction with health than the group on dialysis, which matched the level of a healthy population. Further long-term prospective research is warranted."

QOL is one of the important indicators of the effects of medical treatment. In this cross-sectional study, QOL was analyzed in 302 renal transplant recipients compared with 64 hemodialysis (HD) patients, 207 (PD) peritoneal dialysis patients, and 278 normal controls (NC) matched as closely as possible to the grafted patients regarding age, gender, education, and occupation. All groups were asked to estimate their subjective QOL by responding to sociodemographic data, Turkish adapted instruments of the Nottingham Health profile (NHP), and the Short-form 36 (SF-36). Transplant recipients were significantly younger than the HD and PD patients (P < .0001). There was no statistically significant differences between normal controls and transplant patients ages. Among the three renal replacement methods, QOL in transplants was clearly better than that in HD or PD patients (P < .0001). The QOL measured by the NHP and SF-36 scale showed that the normal population was statistically significantly better than the transplant recipients (P < .0001). Transplant renal replacement therapy provides a better QOL compared with other replacement methods."

Up to now, the optimal duration of the break-in period is still unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate in patients, with immediate initiation of continuous peritoneal dialysis, the efficacy of a double purse-string around the inner cuff in preventing mechanical and infectious complications either in semi-surgical or surgical catheter implantation. From January 2011 to December 2018, 135 peritoneal dialysis catheter insertions in 125 patients (90 men and 35 women, mean age 62.02 ± 16.7) were performed. Seventy-seven straight double-cuffed Tenckhoff catheters were implanted semi-surgically on midline under the umbilicus by a trocar, and 58 were surgically implanted through the rectus muscle. In all patients, continuous peritoneal dialysis was started immediately after catheter placement. Mechanical and infectious catheter-related complications during the first 3 months after initiation of continuous peritoneal dialysis were recorded. The overall incidence of leakages, catheter dislocations, peritonitis, and exit-site infections was 4/135 (2.96%), 2/135 (1.48%), 14/135 (10.3%), and 4/135 (2.96%), respectively. Regarding the incidence of catheter-related complications, no bleeding events, bowel perforations, or hernia formations were observed with either the semi-surgical or surgical technique. Double purse-string technique around the inner cuff allows an immediate start of continuous peritoneal dialysis both with semi-surgical and surgical catheter implantation. This technique is a safe and feasible approach in patients needing an urgent peritoneal dialysis."

We performed systematic searches of PubMed, PsychInfo, Cancerlit and the Cochrane Library using the MESH terms exercise, neoplasms, cancer, rehabilitation and intervention. We identified 12 randomised trials with sample sizes ranging from 21 to 155 patients. Only four studies reported the number of patients assessed for eligibility and the reasons for exclusion; 15% to 30% of patients assessed for eligibility were randomised into the intervention programmes. Drop-out rates in the trials ranged from 0% to 34%. Most studies included female breast cancer patients (nine studies, 62% of total number of patients). Interventions included aerobic exercise training (10 studies) and resistance exercise (two studies). The studies used a wide range of instruments to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the physical exercise capacity. The studies indicated promising effects on both physiological and psychological outcomes. Randomised clinical studies are few, small in scope, and mainly focus on breast cancer patients. Complete knowledge about the type of physical exercise most beneficial for patients at different stages of the disease progression is still lacking. Future work should identify fewer and more specific endpoints."

The responses of the items for measuring QOL indices usually vary widely from patient to patient and from time to time. Measurement errors might be present in the responses of the items, and they might be correlated. Hence, in analyzing QOL data, the usual assumption that there are no measurement errors in responses is too liberal. Because the QOL indices are likely to be correlated, separate analysis of each index might not be efficient from the point of view of statistical methodology. We apply linear structural equation modeling (LISREL) in assessing the QOL data obtained from a clinical trial. A basic premise of the LISREL approach is that the abstract concepts (latent constructs) that are not directly measurable can be studied. LISREL is a statistical procedure for conceiving and testing structural hypotheses that cannot be tested adequately with other statistical procedures. It allows us to specify relations between unobserved and observed variables while controlling for measurement errors and correlations among both the measurement errors and the latent constructs."

All graft losses from thrombosis occurred within 16 days of surgery. Possible predisposing causes were identified in three patients. Donor age was greater in CAPD patients losing their kidneys from thrombosis compared to the overall CAPD group [mean (SD) years, 43.0(12.9) versus 29.1(15.8); P = 0.01] whereas no significant difference in haematocrit, platelet count, antibody status, cyclosporin use, peroperative hypotension, primary diagnosis, smoking, or diabetes mellitus was found. Data from the EDTA registry for 1990-91 show that graft loss from primary renovascular thrombosis in UK-treated patients was reported in 7.1% of CAPD recipients compared with 1.8% in haemodialysis.

However, there are some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have shown contradictory results concerning the cardiovascular benefits of OM3FA. Analyzing these RCTs we found that the use of olive oil in some RCTs could be responsible for contradictory results, since both. since both olive oil and OM3FA, in addition to reduce triglycerides, have anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory activities, considered important for the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. This pharmacodynamic profile may have a cardio protective effect that was confirmed by several RCTs. Therefore, olive oil seems an active substance, and its use might have reduced the differences between groups masking the efficacy of OM3FA. This inferred lack of OM3FA cardiovascular benefits due to bias induced by a \"false placebo\" control, raises epistemological considerations on the choice of placebos that always should be pharmacologically inert substances. More studies are necessary to clarify the real efficacy of OM3FA that is more innocuous than many medicines, but it seems useful in future RCTs the use of a truly inert substance as a placebo, as well as the outline of a semi quantitative dose-response curve suggestive of a causal nexus between active substances and their outcomes."

It has been reported that pretransplantation peritoneal dialysis was correlated with a better recovery of graft function than hemodialysis in adult kidney recipients. However, the effect of pretransplantation dialysis mode (PDM) seemed to be unclear on the early outcome of KT in pediatric recipients. In this study, the potential impact of PDM on early graft function was evaluated in 174 pediatric patients who underwent KT by using cadaveric donors. The primary outcome parameter was the time to reach a serum creatinine (SCr) level 50% of the pretransplantation value [T(1/2(SCr))], while DGF was defined as a T(1/2(SCr)) >3 days after KT (n = 40). By stratifying kidney recipients for normal function graft or DGF, this latter group showed a significantly higher body weight (BW) on the day of KT (P = 0.014), body surface area (BSA) (P = 0.005), warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.022), early SCr on the day 1 after KT (P < 0.001), and T(1/2(SCr)) (P < 0.001), whereas lower urine volume (UV) collected in the first 24 h after KT (P < 0.001) and fluid load (P < 0.001) occurred. Univariate exponential correlation that was carried out between T(1/2(SCr)) and all the other variables had shown a better value than the linear correlation for BW (R(2) = 0.28 vs. R(2) = 0.04), BSA (R(2) = 0.29 vs. R(2) = 0.03), and SCr (R(2) = 0.51 vs. R(2) = 0.28).

However, factors like body height, lack of kidney source, and severe complications render some patients ineligible for KTx. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) acts as the bridging therapy to KTx, especially for infants and young children. Because the period of PD treatment is relatively longer in Japan due to the lack of kidney donors, management of PD is imperative for the success of the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric patients receiving PD treatment present several characteristics similar to adult patients. A small number of patients could result in the lack of experience accumulation, such as treatment/patient education or shortage of specialized nurses/social workers, at each hospital. Recent advancements in the treatment of glomerulonephritis and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome might reduce the incidence rate of end-stage renal disease. Recently, the frequency of congenital diseases, such as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and patients ranging from infants to young children, has relatively increased. Because polyuria is a characteristic of CAKUT, PD is used for solute removal, and urine is used for fluid management. The incidence of comorbidities is not negligible. In this study, approximately half of the patients received KTx from their parents. Key Messages: Because PD is the only treatment option available to patients, especially infants and young children, to become a bridge to KTx, its management and outcome must be efficient."

The best intervention to improve the QoL of ESRD patients is renal transplantation. The role of erythropoietin and intensification of dialysis dose in improving patients' QoL is undergoing review. We have previously shown relationships between patients' perception of quality of life and depressive affect, perception of burden of illness (IEQ), social support (MSP), pain and sleep disturbances.

            "abstract": "Kidney transplantation is the favored method to treat end-stage renal disease. Some recipients develop severe diseases requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication among critically ill patients but few data are available among renal transplant recipients. The aim of this monocenter retrospective study was to describe renal function in kidney transplant recipients admitted to an ICU and to evaluate their renal functional recovery after this stay. We identified all renal transplant recipients admitted to our medical ICU from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010: namely, 79 stays by 62 patients. We used the glomerular filtration rate criteria of the RIFLE classification to evaluate AKI during the ICU stay. During the ICU stay, 56 patients (70.9%) were classified as \"no AKI\" according to the RIFLE classification; 11 (13.9%) belonged to class R, 10 (12.7%) to class I, and 2 (2.5%) to class F. Overall, 24% of the patients needed dialysis during the ICU stay. Mortality rate at 3 months after the ICU stay was 25.3%. Among the patients who survived, 40 (68%) recovered to their baseline renal function at 3 months, most of them being classified as no AKI during the ICU stay. We have herein reported the evolution of renal function among kidney graft recipients after an ICU stay."

            "abstract": "The per capita expenditure for health care of patients with multiple physical symptoms but no apparent physical disease (somatization disorder) is up to nine times the average per capita amount. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether psychiatric consultation would reduce the medical costs of these patients, without effecting a substantial change in patient outcome. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups and studied prospectively for 18 months. Treatment consisted of a psychiatric consultation and suggestions on management given to primary physicians. After nine months, the control group was crossed over to receive treatment with the same intervention. After the psychiatric consultation, the quarterly health care charges in the treatment group declined by 53 percent (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the charges in the control group showed wide variations but no overall change. The quarterly charges in the control group were significantly higher than those in the treatment group (P less than 0.05). After the control group was crossed over to receive treatment, their quarterly charges declined by 49 percent (P less than 0.05). The reductions in expenditures in both groups were due largely to decreases in hospitalization. We conclude that psychiatric consultation in the care of patients with somatization disorder reduced subsequent health care expenditures without inducing changes in health status or patients' satisfaction with their health care."

            "abstract": "Although intra-operative vascular complications during renal transplantation are rare, injuries associated with prolonged ischemia may lead to graft threatening early and late complications. This series describes a novel technique for intra-operative repair of vascular complications in five patients over a three-yr period. The method consists of rapid graft nephrectomy and re-preservation of the graft with cold University of Wisconsin solution, which allows for controlled/precise back table repair of the vascular injury without incurring prolonged warm ischemia time. In three cases, the donor renal vein (2) and donor renal artery (1) were damaged and required back table reconstruction. In two cases, the recipient iliac artery needed reconstruction. Three of the five cases used deceased donor iliac vessels from another donor for reconstruction. Two patients required postoperative dialysis for delayed graft function for three to nine d (average six d) and two patients had slow graft function. All grafts were functioning at 17 months (mean) after transplant, with a median serum of 1.61 mg/dL (0.74-3.69). This series demonstrates the effectiveness of kidney clamp, perfuse, resuscitate as an effective intra-operative technique to salvage grafts after vascular injury. Although the grafts may suffer from delayed or slow graft function, excellent long-term function is attainable."

This prospective clinical trial examined the impact of early TEN vs. TPN in the critically injured. Seventy-five patients with an abdominal trauma index (ATI) greater than 15 and less than 40 were randomized at initial laparotomy to receive either TEN (Vivonex TEN) or TPN (Freamine HBC 6.9% and Trophamine 6%); both regimens contained 2.5% fat, 33% branched chain amino acids, and had a calorie to nitrogen ratio of 150:1. TEN was delivered via a needle catheter jejunostomy. Nutritional support was initiated within 12 hours postoperatively in both groups, and infused at a rate sufficient to render the patients in positive nitrogen balance. The study groups (TEN = 29 vs TPN = 30) were comparable in age, injury severity and initial metabolic stress. Jejunal feeding was tolerated unconditionally in 25 (86%) of the TEN group. Nitrogen balance remained equivalent throughout the study period, at day 5 TEN = -0.3 +/- 1.0 vs. TPN 0.1 +/- 0.8 gm/day. Traditional nutritional protein markers (albumin, transferrin, and retinol binding protein) were restored better in the TEN group. Infections developed in 5 (17%) of the TEN patients compared to 11 (37%) of the TPN group. The incidence of major septic morbidity was 3% (1 = abdominal abscess) in the TEN group contrasted to 20% (2 = abdominal abscess, 6 = pneumonia) with TPN. This clinical study demonstrates that TEN is well tolerated in the severely injured, and that early feeding via the gut reduces septic complications in the stressed patient."

Transplantation improves the quality of life of the transplant recipient and also results in reduced treatment costs owing to the cost difference between dialysis and the post-transplant immunosuppression medications. Currently, the USA's Medicare program covers immunosuppression medications for 3 years post-transplant for nonelderly, nondisabled patients, and there is currently a proposal to extend this coverage from 3 years to a lifetime for all transplant recipients. Upon expiration of the current 3-year benefit, some patients are unable to afford to pay for the medication on their own, resulting in graft loss and a return to dialysis. This article reviews studies that documented the improvements in long-term transplant outcomes attributable to previous coverage extensions of immunosuppression medications, from both 1-3 years post-transplant for all transplant recipients in 1993 and the coverage extension from 3 years to lifetime for elderly and disabled patients in the year 2000.

Patient questionnaires for 1985 were received from 83% of known centres and for 1986 from 79% of known centres in 33 countries. Of 244,497 individually registered patients, 116,892 were known to be alive on defined forms of renal replacement therapy on 31 December 1985 and 121,755 on 31 December 1986. Countries covered by the EDTA Registry include one-third of the world's population on renal replacement therapy. Individual countries exemplify different strategies with variable proportional contributions from home haemodialysis, CAPD and transplantation, and varying levels of achievement in numbers of patients on treatment. Trends in patient populations demonstrate that standard risk patients (aged under 55 and non-diabetic) are mostly receiving treatment in countries with advanced programmes, whereas the growth in numbers of new patients is due largely to increase in the acceptance of high-risk patients (aged over 55 or with diabetes mellitus). These trends have implications for the future; predictions must take account of the variable mixture of standard and high-risk patients, the different results achieved in these categories and the rates at which the mixture between them is changing."

            "abstract": "Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a well-known complication in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). While a number of risk factors for PTDM have been identified, the potential impact of pre-transplant dialysis modality on subsequent development of PTDM has not yet been explored. We performed a multicenter retrospective study on 2010 consecutive RTRs who did not have a history of diabetes prior to renal transplantation. PTDM was defined as a need for anti-diabetic therapy in an RTR without a history of diabetes prior to transplantation. Analysis of the risk factors for development of PTDM was performed with respect to pre-transplant dialysis modality. A total of 137 (6.8%) patients developed PTDM; 7% in the hemodialysis group and 6.5% in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) group (p = 0.85). In the multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), use of tacrolimus (p = 0.002), and rejection episodes (p < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for development of PTDM. Patients in the PD group were younger (p = 0.004), had lower BMI (p = 0.07), and were less likely to have a history of hepatitis C (p = 0.007) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (p = 0.07). Adjustment for these variables did not modify the results. The results of this study suggest that pre-transplant dialysis modality does not have an impact on the subsequent development of PTDM in RTRs.\n"

Primary outcomes were AFS and freedom from MALEs along with their components of assisted primary patency, limb salvage, and patient survival. The χ2 tests and independent samples t-tests were used to compare demographic variables. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate outcomes, and Cox regression analyses were used to confirm independent predictors of outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 2707 PVI (351 KTRs and 2356 DDPs) and 1444 LEB (198 KTRs and 1246 DDPs) procedures performed for limb-threatening ischemia. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, female patients, and African Americans were more common among the DDP group, as were lower preoperative hemoglobin values and older age. After PVI, KTRs had better AFS than DDPs (42% vs 66% at 1 year, 15% vs 26% at 2 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.64; P < .001) and fewer MALEs (53% vs 64% at 1 year, 35% vs 49% at 18 months; HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.25-2.34; P = .001). PVI outcomes, AFS, and freedom from MALEs were driven primarily by differences in limb salvage and patient survival but not assisted primary patency.

Authors contacted when published data were incomplete. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was explored using the Cochran Q statistic and the I2 test. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, recovery of kidney function, weekly delivered Kt/V, correction of acidosis, fluid removal, duration of dialysis, and infectious complications. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Six studies (484 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Five studies compared high volume PD with daily haemodialysis, extended daily haemodialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy. One study focused on the intensity of PD. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear. Compared to extracorporeal therapy, PD probably made little or no difference to all-cause mortality (4 studies, 383 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.55; I2 = 69%; moderate certainty evidence), or kidney function recovery (3 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.35; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). PD probably slightly reduces the amount of fluid removal compared to extracorporeal therapy (3 studies, 313 participants: MD -0.59 L/d, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.01; I2 = 89%; low certainty evidence), and probably made little or no difference to infectious complications (2 studies, 263 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.78; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether PD compared to extracorporeal therapy has any effects on weekly delivered Kt/V (2 studies, 263 participants: MD -2.47, 95% CI -5.17 to 0.22; I2 = 99%; very low certainty evidence), correction of acidosis (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 13.60; I2 = 96%; very low certainty evidence), or duration of dialysis (2 studies, 170 participants: MD -1.01 hours, 95% CI -91.49 to 89.47; I2 = 98%; very low certainty evidence). Heterogeneity was high and this may be due to the different extracorporeal therapies used.One study (61 participants) reported little or no difference to all-cause mortality, kidney function recovery, or infection between low and high and intensity PD. Weekly delivered Kt/V and fluid removal was lower with low compared to high intensity PD.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on moderate (mortality, recovery of kidney function), low (infectious complications), or very low certainty evidence (correction of acidosis) there is probably little or no difference between PD and extracorporeal therapy for treating AKI.

Although both HD and PD are cost intensive, specific advantages and disadvantages have been identified with either of them. Comparative assessment of their effectiveness, benefits and cost will assist in providing a rational basis for preference of one or the other especially in third world countries where renal replacement therapy remains unaffordable and therefore relatively inaccessible to majority of patients. We therefore conducted this prospective randomised study to compare the effectiveness, benefits, cost and complications of acute or intermittent PD (IPD) and HD using locally manufactured PD fluids. Two groups of twenty patients with renal failure matched for age and clinical diagnosis were managed with IPD and HD and the effectiveness, costs and complications of both modalities compared. We found that both were comparably effective in the control of uraemia with significant reductions in the serum urea, creatinine and potassium from 29.2 +/- 7.2 mmol/L, 1693.7 +/- 580.5micromol/L and 4.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L to 13.2 +/- 4.6 mmol/L, 796.0 +/- 458.0micromol/ L and 3.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/L respectively for IPD (P<0.05) and 34.4 +/- 9.0mmol/L, 1536.0 +/- 832.5 micromol/L and4.8 +/- 1.3 mmoV L to 14.6 +/- 7.5 mmol/L, 830.0 +/- 570.7 micromol/L and 3.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L respectively for HD (P<0.05). In addition, there were significant improvements in serum bicarbonate in both groups. There was no significant difference in percentage reduction in serum urea, creatinine and serum potassium in both groups (P>0.05). However, HD managed patients required more blood transfusion (P<0.05). There were also comparably significant reductiohs in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures in both groups (P<0.05). The costs of dialysis as well as the total cost of hospitalization were found to be significantly lower in patients managed with IPD (P<0.05). The commonest complication observed in patients managed with IPD was peritonitis while in patients managed with HD it was dialysis-induced hypotension. The clinical outcome was equally good in all the ARF patients as all of them recovered irrespective of the treatment modality; CRF patients did not fare as well with 37.5% mortality observed. We conclude that IPD and HD are effective renal replacement therapies with the former being significantly cheaper.

            "abstract": "The pubertal growth spurt has been associated with changes of physiologic pulsatile growth hormone (GH) secretion, and abnormalities of the central regulation of GH release have been found by pharmacologic testing in patients with chronic renal failure. To assess the characteristics of GH pulsatility in chronic renal failure and their relationship to pubertal growth, we studied spontaneous nighttime GH plasma profiles in 80 patients (61 boys) aged 10 to 20 years receiving conservative treatment (n = 29) or dialysis (n = 18) or after renal transplantation (n = 33). Tanner genital stages 1 to 4 in boys and breast stages 1 to 3 in girls were represented. Growth hormone pulse analysis was performed by the PULSAR algorithm. Growth hormone concentration profiles were pulsatile in each patient. Growth hormone mean and baseline levels and pulse amplitudes were higher in patients receiving conservative or dialysis treatment than in patients who had undergone renal transplantation. Peak frequency was similar in all treatment groups in boys but higher in girls who had undergone transplantation than in girls receiving conservative or dialysis treatment. Growth hormone peak amplitude and mean levels were lowest in patients in late puberty. The physiologic elevation of GH amplitudes around midpuberty was observed in boys receiving conservative and dialysis treatment but not after transplantation. Growth hormone mean and baseline levels were positively correlated with plasma androgen levels in boys. Growth hormone peak amplitude was correlated with 6-month height velocity after transplantation but not in patients receiving conservative treatment or dialysis. A strong inverse relationship was observed between GH peak amplitude and corticosteroid dosage in patients undergoing transplantation. The lack of relationship between circulating GH levels and growth in patients receiving conservative or dialysis treatment is compatible with end-organ hyporesponsiveness to GH. Pubertal growth failure despite successful transplantation appears to be related to steroid-induced GH hyposecretion."

The transport pathways for buffers and carbon dioxide (CO2) across the peritoneal membrane remain poorly understood.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Combining well-established PD protocols, whole-body plethysmography and renal function studies in mice, we investigated molecular mechanisms of acid-base regulation in PD, including the potential role of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After instillation in peritoneal cavity, the pH of acidic dialysis solutions increased within minutes to rapidly equilibrate with blood pH, whereas the neutral pH of biocompatible solutions remained constant. Predictions from the three-pore model of peritoneal transport suggested that local production of HCO3- accounts at least in part for the changes in intraperitoneal pH observed with acidic solutions. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were evidenced in the peritoneal membrane and their inhibition with acetazolamide significantly decreased local production of HCO3- and delayed changes in intraperitoneal pH. On the contrary, genetic deletion of AQP1 had no effect on peritoneal transport of buffers and diffusion of CO2. Besides intraperitoneal modifications, the use of acidic dialysis solutions enhanced acid excretion both at pulmonary and renal levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that changes in intraperitoneal pH during PD are mediated by bidirectional buffer transport and by CA-mediated production of HCO3- in the membrane. The use of acidic solutions enhances acid excretion through respiratory and renal responses, which should be considered in patients with renal failure."

However, most transplants fail after 10 to 12 years, consigning patients back onto dialysis. Damage by the immune system accounts for approximately 50% of failing transplants and it is possible to identify patients at risk by screening for the presence of antibodies against human leukocyte antigens. However, it is not clear how best to treat patients with antibodies. This trial will test a combined screening and treatment protocol in renal transplant recipients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Recipients>1 year post-transplantation, aged 18 to 70 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate>30 mL/min will be randomly allocated to blinded or unblinded screening arms, before being screened for the presence of antibodies. In the unblinded arm, test results will be revealed. Those with antibodies will have biomarker-led care, consisting of a change in their anti-rejection drugs to prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. In the blinded arm, screening results will be double blinded and all recruits will remain on current therapy (standard care). In both arms, those without antibodies will be retested every 8 months for 3 years. The primary outcome is the 3-year kidney failure rate for the antibody-positive recruits, as measured by initiation of long-term dialysis or re-transplantation, predicted to be approximately 20% in the standard care group but <10% in biomarker-led care. The secondary outcomes include the rate of transplant dysfunction, incidence of infection, cancer and diabetes mellitus, an analysis of adherence with medication and a health economic analysis of the combined screening and treatment protocol. Blood samples will be collected and stored every 4 months and will form the basis of separately funded studies to identify new biomarkers associated with the outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We have evidence that the biomarker-led care regime will be effective at preventing graft dysfunction and expect this to feed through to graft survival.

This effect size probably makes it very difficult to perform new large placebo controlled trials for hemifacial spasm. Despite the paucity of good quality controlled data, all the studies available suggest that BtA is effective and safe for treating hemifacial spasm. Future trials should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals, different injection techniques, doses, Bt types and formulations. Other issues include service delivery, quality of life, long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. BtA should be compared with surgical microvascular decompression."

The search for a credible mechanism that underpins the effect of acupuncture in pain has recently involved the use of brain imaging techniques in an attempt to identify the neural correlates involved in pain control.

In particular, we explicitly addressed the changing risks following transplantation, and looked at both younger (low-risk) and older (higher-risk) recipients, and examined the effect of attribution of deaths in the early period following loss of transplant function to the risk of transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a cohort study, initially including 11 560 people aged 15-65 years who began treatment for end-stage renal disease in Australia or New Zealand between 1991 and 2000. Of these, 5144 were recorded at least once as on an active cadaveric transplant waiting list. Survival was analysed with Cox regression, including time-dependent covariates to allow for the violation of proportional hazards with changing mortality risks post-operatively. We also performed stratified analyses on low-risk recipients (<50 years, without co-morbidity) and older recipients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a clear difference in survival between those on the active transplant waiting list and those not listed. Of those who were on the cadaveric transplant waiting list, 2362 (46%) were transplanted in the period to 30 September 2001. Cadaveric transplantation was associated with an initial increase in mortality [during the first 3 months post-transplantation, adjusted HR 2.0 (1.5-2.7), P<0.001]. This fell below the dialysis group at 6 months [adjusted HR 0.27 (0.16-0.47), P<0.001] and from 12 months post-transplantation, the reduction in risk of mortality was approximately 80% [adjusted HR 0.19 (0.15-0.24), P<0.001]. A secondary analysis showed the excess risk attributed to the period immediately following transplantation was actually due to deaths in the 60 days after loss of transplant function rather than those occurring with a functioning graft.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      As well as improved quality of life, cadaveric renal transplantation in Australia and New Zealand is associated with a survival advantage compared with those remaining on the waiting list."

Data were obtained from 24 renal centers: 23 dialysis and one transplant center, referred as of 31 December 2011, with 100% response rate to individual patient questionnaires. Slovenia has a population of approximately 2 million (2 052 496 in 2011). The total number of patients treated by RRT was 2011,that is, 980 per million of population (pmp); 0.4% decrease compared to 2010. 1347 (67.0%) were treated by hemodialysis, 60 (3.0%) by peritoneal dialysis, and 604 (30.0%) had a functioning kidney graft. A total of 236 incident patients, 115 pmp (at day one), started RRT, their median age was 68 years, 64.8% were men, 36.4% were diabetics. Regarding hemodialysis patients, 59.3% were treated with on-line hemodiafiltration, 86% with ultrapure dialysis fluid. Median weekly duration of hemodialysis was 12.5 h, median dry body weight 70 kg, mean blood flow 275 ± 46 mL/min, 7.1% were dialyzed in a single-needle mode. Vascular accesses were native arteriovenous fistula in 79%, polytetrafluoroethylene graft in 6%, and catheter in 15%. The crude death rate was 15.9% in dialysis patients, 1.9% in transplant recipients, and 12.0% in all RRT patients (both dialysis and transplant, incident patients at day 1 included). Slovenia has been a member of Eurotransplant since 2000. Forty-six kidney transplantations were performed in 2011, all from deceased donors. A slight decrease in prevalent number of RRT patients was observed in 2011, for the first time in 40 years. The number and proportion of patients with functioning kidney grafts is increasing, reaching 30% in 2011."

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was recently introduced as a national service and is provided free of charge by the Federal State. We present here an overview of our experience and outcomes after the first 20 months of operation of the National Program, displaying its organization and patient and technique survival, peritonitis rates, and adequacy parameters of the first patients to undergo CAPD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      As a national experiment, the program was sequentially launched in 5 adult and 2 pediatric centers in Khartoum, the capital city of the country. The data include the entire 111 patients who underwent CAPD from June 2005 to January 2007. All data were reported to, and analyzed at, the head office of the Sudan National Peritoneal Dialysis Program.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      CAPD is the modality exclusively utilized thus far. Automated PD will be added to the program this year. By 30 January 2007, the total number of patients enrolled was 111. Their age range was 1 - 75 (median 56) years. 20 patients (18%) were shifted to hemodialysis and 5 patients received living related kidney transplants. Two died of severe septicemia due to peritonitis; 16 (14%) others died of non-PD-related causes. There were 60 cases of peritonitis in 839 patient-months, which equates to an overall peritonitis rate of 1 episode every 14 months (0.87 episodes per year at risk). The individual center rates varied. A critical review of cases at the end of the first year showed a statistically significant age difference, with peritonitis being more common in the younger patients. Mean age of patients that developed peritonitis was 30.53 years, whereas that for peritonitis-free patients was 44.09 years (p = 0.025). All patients that had peritonitis presented with abdominal pain and had a cloudy effluent; none had exit-site or tunnel infection. The culture-negative peritonitis rate was 53%. Pseudomonas species were responsible for 13.3% and Staphylococcus aureus for 6.7%. Touch contamination was the likely mechanism behind 46.7% of the episodes. There were 3 cases of refractory peritonitis and a single case of relapsing peritonitis. Concerning PD adequacy, average Kt/V urea was 1.74; weekly creatinine clearance was 62.5 L/1.73 m(2). Average normalized protein catabolic rate, as a measure of dietary protein intake in patients in a steady state, was 1.17 g/kg. These measures indicate that the overall program adequacy was satisfactory and the values fall within the recommended ranges.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The first 20 months of operation of the Sudan's National Peritoneal Dialysis Program have proven that it is a promising project with multifaceted success. The adequacy indicators are acceptable but the cumulative peritonitis incidence is above that recommended, indicating several areas for potential improvement. Although CAPD is highly cost-effective, ongoing difficulties, including the cost of medications and laboratory tests, are being sorted out with official support and public involvement."

This article summarizes the results of a comprehensive Dutch long-term follow-up study performed in 2000 and 2010 of patients with RRT onset at age <15 years between 1972 and 1992. After a median of 25.5 RRT years, patients had stayed 23% of RRT time on dialysis. We observed a 30 times greater mortality risk compared with age-matched peers with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the main cause of death during 1972-2000 and infections during 2000-10. The observed shift towards infections was associated with more RRT time with a graft and receiving a stricter CVD protective treatment. For patients >40 years of age, motor disabilities affecting routine activities, skin cancer and severe fatigue were the most disabling sequelae. After 30 years of transplantation, 41% of the survivors had developed cancer, a life-threatening form of squamous cell skin carcinoma being most prevalent. Important delays in autonomy development and educational attainment and a relatively high level of unemployment were observed. Transplanted patients reported a good mental and physical quality of life, but the latter tended to decrease over time. A long period of dialysis was associated with all adverse somatic and psychosocial outcomes. Paediatric nephrologists should aim for transplantation at the earliest possible time and focus on autonomy and educational attainment. Nephrologists should focus on strict CVD prevention, adjustment of immunosuppression to the lowest possible dose and surveillance of malignancy-associated viral infections in patients with childhood end-stage renal disease."

The total time required for planning and recruitment was 44 months. Eligibility rates and dropout or refusal rates between screening visits varied considerably among the 20 clinics that took part in MRFIT. The variation in eligibility rates resulted largely from subjective interpretation by the staff of the willingness of the men to participate in the study and to make risk factor changes. Cigarette smokers and blacks were more likely to discontinue their participation between screening exams. The ultimate success of the MRFIT recruitment is attributed to (1) the previous experience of investigators in screening large numbers of participants for clinical trials and similar epidemiologic investigations, (2) the identification at each clinic of one or more persons whose specific responsibility was recruitment, (3) the phased entry of clinics into the study, (4) routine monitoring and reporting of recruitment rates by the coordinating center, (5) regular discussion of recruitment successes and problems at the Steering Committee meetings, and (6) site visits to examine in detail recruitment problems."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In end-stage renal disease patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD), the osmotic conductance to glucose (OCG) represents the intrinsic ability of the membrane to transport water in response to a crystalloid osmotic gradient. A progressive loss of OCG in long-term PD patients indicates the development of fibrosis in the peritoneal interstitium, and helps identify patients at risk for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. The double mini-peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been proposed as a simple method to assess OCG using the difference in initial ultrafiltration rates generated by 2 successive dwells using 1.36% and 3.86% glucose-based, 1-h PET. However, the presence of a large peritoneal residual volume (RV) may potentially interfere with the correct evaluation of drained volumes, limiting the reliability of OCG assessed by the double mini-PET.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We retrospectively reviewed data from 53 peritoneal function tests in 35 consecutive PD patients starting PD at our center between March 2013 and March 2017. The test consisted of a uni-PET (double mini-PET combined with a 3.86%, 4-h PET) performed at PD start, then yearly. In addition to peritoneal solute transport rate and net ultrafiltration, the tests provided information about osmotic water transport (OCG, sodium sieving, and free-water transport) as well as the RV estimated from albumin dilution.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Contrary to sodium sieving, net ultrafiltration, and free-water transport, OCG did not correlate with any of the other parameters of osmotic water transport. In multivariate regression analyses, the RV was identified as the only determinant of OCG, while it did not alter the robust association between sodium sieving/free-water transport and their respective determinants. Considering only baseline tests or the whole series of tests, the presence of a large intraperitoneal RV was associated with discrepant values between OCG and sodium sieving, and with an artificial increase in OCG.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A large RV leads to significant overestimation of OCG using the double mini-PET, potentially reducing the ability of OCG to identify patients with progressive fibrosis in the peritoneal interstitium. On the other hand, sieving of the dialysate sodium, a biochemical surrogate for OCG, is independent of the RV and may therefore be more reliable. A call for caution is warranted in patients with a large RV to avoid misinterpretation of OCG values derived from the double mini-PET."

            "abstract": "In a randomised controlled trial comparing the outcome of two groups of men aged 16-45 one group received outpatient physiotherapy after medial meniscectomy and the other did not. In clinical aspects of knee function there was no significant difference between the test group and control group measured at specified intervals up to 26 weeks postoperatively. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the groups in the time taken to return to work or in the mean fall in take-home pay as a result of meniscectomy. The mean cost per patient of providing outpatient physiotherapy in the test group was 23 pounds at 1976 prices. Thus the least costly way of returning male patients aged 16-45 to activity is by not providing routine outpatient physiotherapy after medial meniscectomy. Further randomised controlled trials are, however, required to determine the value of physiotherapy in other age groups and other conditions."

The mainstay of treatment is Kasai portoenterostomy, as soon as the disease has been confirmed. Glucocorticosteroids are steroid hormones which act on the glucocorticoid receptor and have a range of metabolic and immunomodulatory effects. Glucocorticosteroids are used to improve the postoperative outcomes in infants who have undergone Kasai portoenterostomy.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of glucocorticosteroid administration versus placebo or no intervention following Kasai portoenterostomy in infants with biliary atresia.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and online trial registries (last search: 20 December 2017) for randomised controlled trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised clinical trials which assessed glucocorticosteroids for infants who have undergone Kasai portoenterostomy. For harm, we also considered quasi-randomised studies, observational studies, and case-control studies that were identified amongst the search results.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias for each trial according to prespecified domains. We analysed data using both random-effects and fixed-effect models. We performed the analyses using Review Manager 5.3 and Trial Sequental Analysis software. We considered a P value of 0.025 or less, two-tailed, as statistically significant. We planned to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For all association measures, we planned to use 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as well as Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs. We used Trial Sequential Analyisis to control the risks of random errors; however, we were often unable to implement this beyond calculating the required information size as there were few trials and data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We found two randomised controlled trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of our review. The trials provided data for meta-analysis. We judged the two trials as trials at low risk of bias. The two trials randomised a total of 213 infants to glucocorticosteroids versus placebo. In our Trial Sequential Analysis, the required information size (that is, the meta-analytic sample size) was not reached for any outcome. Trials were funded by charities, public organisations, and received support from private sector companies, none of which seemed to have an interest in the outcome of the respective trials. The effect of glucocorticosteroids after Kasai portoenterostomy on all-cause mortality is uncertain; the confidence interval is consistent with appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 6.90; low-certainty evidence). The results showed little or no difference in adverse effects between the use of glucocorticosteroids or placebo after Kasai portoenterostomy, however this analysis was based on a single trial and we have low certainty in the result (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20;). Available data suggest that the proportions of infants who do not clear their jaundice at six months is similar between the two groups (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17; low-certainty evidence). All-cause mortality or liver transplantation did not differ at two years between the two groups (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.39; low-certainty evidence). There were no data regarding health-related quality of life.Our searches also yielded 19 observational studies, some of them containing limited information on harmful effects of glucocorticosteroid treatment. We presented the extracted information narratively. We identified one further ongoing trial with no currently available results.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The two meta-analysed randomised clinical trials present insufficient evidence to determine the effects of using glucocorticosteroids versus placebo after Kasai portoenterostomy in infants with biliary atresia on any of the primary or secondary review outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to support glucocorticosteroid use in the postoperative management of infants with biliary atresia for long-term outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. It is also unclear if glucocorticosteroids are able to reduce the numbers of infants who did not clear their jaundice by six months. Further randomised, placebo-controlled trials are required to be able to determine if glucocorticosteroids may be of benefit in the postoperative management of infants with biliary atresia treated with Kasai portoenterostomy. Such trials need to be conducted as multicentre trials."

            "abstract": "Although previous studies have documented neuropsychological deficits in children with end-stage renal disease, few have evaluated and compared the cognitive functioning and the school performance of children with renal failure. The current study evaluated the influence of chronic renal failure on cognitive functioning and school performance in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis and after renal transplantation. Participants were given standardized IQ and achievement tests to assess cognitive functioning and ability. Academic performance was determined by evaluating grades for the semester in which the testing was performed; a grade point average (GPA) was calculated based on a 4.0-point scale. The 11 dialysis patients and 13 transplant patients were comparable in age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Overall IQ and subtest scores demonstrated no differences between the two groups. Performance on the Woodcock-Johnson achievement tests showed that the transplant patients did better on achievement tests of written language (P = 0.04) and in school performance in English compared with dialysis patients (P < 0.05). Furthermore the dialysis patients tended to be below age and grade level in all areas, whereas the transplant patients were achieving at or above these levels. There were significant differences in the age equivalent scores between the dialysis and transplant patients in the areas of mathematics and written language (P < 0.05). However, when grades were evaluated there were no differences in overall GPA or in the mathematics GPA. Days absent were not different between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Silver dressings are wound products designed to control and inhibit infection and provide a wound environment conducive to healing. However, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness in doing so.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of literature from 1950-May 2007 was conducted using the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, MEDLINE, British Nursing Index, EBSCO Host, OCLC, Proquest and PsychInfo databases.

This is an update of a review first published in 2002.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the efficacy of, and complications associated with, intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) for maintaining patency after angioplasty or stent insertion in native vessels or bypass grafts of the iliac or infrainguinal arteries.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched their Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials of the use of brachytherapy as an adjunct to the endovascular treatment of people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or stenosed bypass grafts of the iliac or infrainguinal arteries versus the procedure without brachytherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and two other review authors independently extracted the data. Adverse event information was collected from the trials.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight trials with a combined total of 1090 participants were included in this review. All included studies used the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries. All studies compared PTA with or without stenting plus IVBT versus PTA with or without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to technologies such as drug eluting stents or balloons, or cryoplasty. Follow-up ranged from six months to five years. The quality of the included trials was moderate with our concerns relating to the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the procedures and the small sample sizes for some studies. Primary outcomes (patency or restenosis and need for re-intervention) were reported in the majority of the trials, but reporting at various time points and the use of multiple definitions of the outcomes by the included studies meant that not all data were available for pooling. The secondary outcomes were not reported in many of the included studies.For brachytherapy, cumulative patency was higher at 24 months (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.10, n = 222, P = 0.002). A statistically significant difference was found for restenosis at six months (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.66, n = 562, P = 0.004), 12 months (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, n = 375, P = 0.0002) and 24 months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78, n = 164, P = 0.007) in favour of IVBT. No difference was found after five years as measured in one study. The need for re-interventions was reported in six studies. Target lesion revascularisation was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with IVBT compared with angioplasty alone (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97, P = 0.04) at six months after the interventions. No statistically significant difference was found between the procedures on the need for re-intervention at 12 and 24 months after the procedures.A statistically significant lower number of occlusions was found in the control group at more than three months (OR 11.46, 95% CI 1.44 to 90.96, n = 363, P = 0.02) but no differences were found at less than one month nor at 12 months after the procedures making the clinical significance uncertain. Ankle brachial index was statistically significantly better for IVBT at the 12 month follow-up (mean difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, n = 100, P = 0.02) but no statistically significant differences were found at 24 hours and at six months.Quality of life, complications, limb loss, cardiovascular deaths, death from all causes, pain free walking distance and maximum walking distance on a treadmill were similar for the two arms of the trials with no statistically significant difference found between the treatment groups.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence for using peripheral artery brachytherapy as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to maintain patency and for the prevention of restenosis in people with peripheral vascular disease is limited, mainly due to the inconsistency of assessment and reporting of clinically relevant outcomes. More data are needed on clinically relevant outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQOL) or limb salvage and longer-term outcomes, together with comparisons with other techniques such as drug eluting balloons and stents. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials, health economics and cost-effectiveness data are required before the procedure could be recommended for widespread use."

We analysed the clinical and laboratory indices, the treatment responses and the biopsy findings.

During follow-up, twenty-nine patients evolved to ESRD. Renal survival rate at 5 and 10 years after LN onset was 95.9% and 91.1%, respectively. Deteriorated renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73m2) at LN onset (hazard ratio: 9.223) was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of ESRD. Recurrence of lupus nephritis in renal allograft and flare-ups of lupus activity were not observed among the patients undergoing kidney transplantation (KT) (n=11). In contrast, those with maintenance dialysis (n=18) developed 13 episodes of lupus flare in 10 patients and 5 died of either infection (n=2) or lupus flare (n=3).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The impaired renal function at baseline is an independent predictor of ESRD in Korean patients with LN.

However, there were no significant differences in total QOL scores between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and transplant patients in child self-reports. In addition, there were differences in the ESRD module scores between child self- and parent proxy reports. Children usually reported better QOL than their parents.

            "abstract": "Actuarial five-year patient survivals after pediatric orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of 75 to 80% are now commonplace. However, renal dysfunction after pediatric OLT remains a serious complication and maybe broadly divided into four categories. The first is pre-existing renal disease in association with liver disease. This includes tyrosinemia with Fanconi syndrome, congenital cystic disease of the liver with associated polycystic disease of the kidney, Alagille's syndrome and primary hyperoxaluria. Second is hepatorenal syndrome. Resolution is dependent on successful OLT, although short-term dialysis may be required. Children with renal failure prior to transplantation have a significantly increased mortality. Third is peri- and early post-transplant renal impairment. The four major influences on early renal function after OLT are: (i) pretransplant renal function; (ii) early liver graft function; (iii) induction therapy with cyclosporine and tacrolimus; (iv) use of other nephrotoxic drugs. Fourth is long-term nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK-506). Both of these essential immunosuppressives carry the risk of long-term irreversible toxicity. In one study children, treated with cyclosporine, surviving > one year after OLT, 73% had a true GFR < 77 ml/min/1.73 m2. Children treated for > or = 24 months had a significantly lower GFR than those treated from 12 to 24 months. Half the children with a GFR < or = 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 had hypertension. Another study showed that 46% of pediatric OLT patients had a > or = 20% decrease in GFR over two to four years. FK-506 nephrotoxicity is comparable to that of cyclosporine. In a randomized control trial comparing FK-506 and cyclosporine, there was a 52% decrease in GFR over the first year in the FK-506 group, which was not significantly different to that of the cyclosporine group. In 60% of patients converted from cyclosporine to FK-506 one study showed a 50% or more drop in GFR. Both FK-506 and cyclosporine are associated with hypertension, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia and metabolic acidosis. In conclusion, the prognosis for long-term renal function in pediatric OLT patients is as yet unknown. Debate continues as to whether the impairment is static or progressive. Long-term follow-up studies of GFR are essential."

However, consequences on patient-relevant outcomes of pre-emptive correction of a stenosis in a functioning access as opposed to deferred correction, i.e. correction postponed to when the access becomes dysfunctional, are uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to evaluate 1) whether pre-emptive correction of an AV access stenosis improves clinically relevant outcomes; 2) whether the effects of pre-emptive correction of an AV access stenosis differ by access type (fistula versus graft), aim (primary and secondary prophylaxis), and surveillance method for primary prophylaxis (Doppler ultrasound for the screening of functional and anatomical changes versus measurement of the flow in the access); and 3) whether other factors (dialysis duration, access location, configuration or materials, algorithm for referral for intervention, intervention strategies (surgical versus radiological or other), or study design) explain the heterogeneity that might exist in the effect estimates.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 30 November 2015 using search terms relevant to this review.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included all studies of any access surveillance method for early identification and pre-emptive treatment of an AV access stenosis.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted data on potentially remediable and irremediable failure of the access (i.e. thrombosis and access loss respectively); infection and mortality; and resource use (hospitalisation, diagnostic and intervention procedures). Analysis was by a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 14 studies (1390 participants), nine enrolled adults without a known access stenosis (primary prophylaxis; three studies including people using fistulas) and five enrolled adults with a documented stenosis in a non-dysfunctional access (secondary prophylaxis; three studies in people using fistulas). Study follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months, and study size ranged from 58 to 189 participants. In low- to moderate-quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria) in adults treated with haemodialysis, relative to no surveillance and deferred correction, surveillance with pre-emptive correction of an AV stenosis reduced the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 30%; 18 study comparisons, 1212 participants), but had imprecise effect on the risk of access loss (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 972 participants). In analyses subgrouped by access type, pre-emptive stenosis correction did not reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 697 participants) or access loss in grafts (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.15; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons; 662 participants), but did reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons, 515 participants) and the risk of access loss in fistulas (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 310 participants). Three of the four studies reporting access loss data in fistulas (199 participants) were conducted in the same centre. Insufficient data were available to assess whether benefits vary by prophylaxis aim in fistulas (i.e. primary and secondary prophylaxis). Although the magnitude of the effects of pre-emptive stenosis correction was considerable for patient-centred outcomes, results were either heterogeneous or imprecise. While pre-emptive stenosis correction may reduce the rates of hospitalisation (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; I² = 67%; 4 study comparisons, 219 participants) and use of catheters (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; I² = 53%; 6 study comparisons, 394 participants), it may also increase the rates of diagnostic procedures (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.67; I² = 62%; 7 study comparisons, 539 participants), infection (IRR 1.74, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.91; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 248 participants) and mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 386 participants).In general, risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we assessed. Four studies were published after 2005 and only one had evidence of registration within a trial registry. No study reported information on authorship and/or involvement of the study sponsor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pre-emptive correction of a newly identified or known stenosis in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although pre-emptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. While pre-emptive stenosis correction may reduce the risk of hospitalisation, this benefit is uncertain whereas there may be a substantial increase (i.e. 80%) in the use of access-related procedures and procedure-related adverse events (e.g. infection, mortality). The net effects of pre-emptive correction on harms and resource use are thus unclear."

Previous studies have tested heterogeneous exercise programs using different QoL instruments and reported inconsistent effects on QoL. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new exercise program for people with heart failure (EFICAR), additional to the recommended optimal treatment in primary care, to improve QoL, functional capacity and control of cardiovascular risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Multicenter clinical trial in which 600 patients with heart failure in NYHA class II-IV will be randomized to two parallel groups: EFICAR and control.

Both groups receive the optimized treatment according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. In addition, the EFICAR group performs a 3 month supervised progressive exercise program with an aerobic (high-intensity intervals) and a strength component; and the programme continues linked with community resources for 9 months. The main outcome measure is the change in health-related QoL measured by the SF-36 and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes considered are changes in functional capacity measured by the 6-Minute Walking Test, cardiac structure (B-type natriuretic peptides), muscle strength and body composition.

Their ages ranged from 4 to 16 years; 3 were boys and 7 were girls. IgM mesangial nephropathy (IgMN) (three cases) were the most common causes of renal failure in the patients. All patients were trained in the hospital. After CAPD treatment, serum BUN and creatinine dropped significantly. Serum levels of potassium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase dropped and serum sodium and calcium rose significantly after treatment. Improvement of anemic state and control of hypertension were also noted. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia developed after CAPD treatment. Despite protein loss through the peritoneal cavity, there was no evidence of protein malnutrition. Total serum protein and albumin increased significantly after treatment. The most common complication was peritonitis. Three of these 10 patients developed an episode of peritonitis, or an incidence of 1 episode per 17.2 patient months. To the present, seven patients are still doing well on CAPD. Three patients have received renal transplantation. The majority of the patients experienced an increased sense of well-being, easier diet and fluid management, freedom for travel and daily activities. Physical development also improved, with body length and body weight gaining steadily. It can be concluded that CAPD is a good modality of long-term therapy for ESRD children."

The 10-year patient survival of 100% in the preemptive group was similar to that of the nonpreemptive group (85%, P = .11). But the 10 year graft survival was higher among the preemptive than the nonpreemptive group (100% vs 75%, P = .02). Pre-transplantation modality did not affect graft survival.

The present study was undertaken to examine the clearance of Palb and Pfree by different modalities of renal replacement therapy, that is, hemodialysis (HD), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and renal transplantation. HD cleared Pfree (9.4 +/- 4.3 nmol/kg/HD) but not Palb, by diffusion but not by membrane adsorption, whereas CAPD cleared both Palb (4.03 +/- 2.01 nmol/kg/day) and Pfree (2.43 +/- 1.24 nmol/kg/day). Plasma total pentosidine levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in CAPD (0.97 +/- 0.41 nmol/ml) than in HD (1.19 +/- 0.41 nmol/ml), as the result of a lower serum albumin level in the former patients. Indeed, Palb expressed per mg albumin was virtually identical in HD and CAPD. By contrast, Pfree was significantly lower in CAPD than in HD. Palb levels were significantly correlated with plasma Pfree levels in both HD and CAPD patients, but not in the CAPD dialysate. Pentosidine transport across the peritoneum occurs mainly by diffusion, both as Palb and Pfree. Interestingly, peritoneal Palb clearance (0.17 +/- 0.07 ml/min) significantly (P < 0.00001) exceeded albumin clearance (0.11 +/- 0.05 ml/min). Palb levels being significantly higher (P < 0.0005) in the peritoneal fluid (36.28 +/- 18.55 pmol/mg) than in the serum (27.12 +/- 11.71 pmol/mg), thus raises the possibility of a facilitated diffusion of Palb or an active transport mechanism for protein-linked pentosidine into the peritoneal cavity. After renal transplantation, plasma Pfree fell rapidly, remained barely detectable after one month, and returned to normal at six months. By contrast, Palb fell more slowly and remained significantly above normal at six months, but returned eventually to normal levels. These findings demonstrate that: (1) both HD and CAPD remove Pfree; (2) the peritoneal clearance of Palb, might contribute to the lower level of plasma pentosidine in CAPD than in HD patients; and (3) renal transplantation is the best therapeutic modality to normalize both Palb and Pfree levels."

Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effects of a long-term exercise periodization on health-related physical fitness components such as cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, skeletal muscle function, and body composition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifty patients with coronary artery disease will be recruited among those who underwent the hospital-based CR phase. These patients will be randomized (1:1) into one of the following exercise groups: (1) periodized group; and (2) non-periodized group (exercise prescription based on standard guidelines). There will be four assessment time points: at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months after starting the exercise training program. At each time point, maximal and submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness, skeletal muscle deoxygenation dynamics, body composition by dual energy radiographic absorptiometry, functional fitness, maximal isometric and dynamic strength, physical activity, and quality of life will be assessed. This experimental design will last for 48 weeks with a frequency of three times per week for both groups.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Most medium- to long-term exercise-based CR programs do not employ periodization or exercise progression. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate long-term periodization outcomes and assess the length of change observed in supervised CR programs. This study will contribute to generate evidence-based exercise prescription approaches to prolong the exercise training after the end of hospital-based CR programs.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03335319 .

            "abstract": "Aging of the population and the increased prevalence of diseases such as diabetes and arterial hypertension result in an increasing need of dialysis treatment. Herein we describe a cohort of elderly patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and assess the influence of the modality on the long-term survival. Out of a multicenter prospective cohort of 2,144 BRAZPD PD incident patients during a period from December 2004 to October 2007, 762 elderly adults, defined as patients ≥65-year-old, were eligible for the study, 413 started on automated PD (APD) and 349 on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD). Patients were followed until death, transfer to hemodialysis, recovery of renal function, loss to follow-up, or transplantation. Demographics and clinical data were evaluated at baseline and described as mean ± standard deviation, median, or percentage. Competing risk and time-dependent Cox analysis were performed, having dialysis modality APD] vs. CAPD as a dependent variable, as hazard ratio (HR) is not proportional throughout the therapy time. Mean age was 74.5 ± 6.8 years in APD, 74.6 ± 6.7 in CAPD, 50.8% females in APD, 54.4% in CAPD. The frequently observed comorbidities were diabetes (52.3% in APD and 47% in CAPD) and left ventricular hypertrophy (36.3% in APD and 46.1% in CAPD) whereas 93.6% presented Davies score ≥2. In Cox time-dependent analysis, HR did not show difference up to 18 months HR = 1.11, confidence interval (CI) = 0.85-1.46], but thereafter, APD modality revealed lower risk of mortality (HR = 0.25, CI = 0.0073-0.86), when compared with CAPD. After adjustment for the confounding factors, CAPD presented a higher risk of mortality (HR = 4.50, CI = 1.29-15.64). No differences in survival were observed up to 18 months of therapy; however, beyond 18 months, APD modality was a protection factor."

            "abstract": "The kidney has been considered a highly terminally differentiated organ with low proliferative potential and thus unlikely to undergo regeneration. Glomerular disease progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires dialysis or renal transplantation for better quality of life for patients with ESRD. Because of the shortage of implantable kidneys and complications such as immune rejection, septicemia and toxicity of immunosuppression, kidney transplantation remains a challenge. Therapeutic options available for glomerular disease include symptomatic treatment and strategies to delay progression. In an attempt to develop innovative treatments by promoting the limited capability of regeneration and repair after kidney injury and overcome the progressive pathological process that is uncontrolled with conventional treatment modalities, stem cell-based therapy has emerged as novel intervention due to its ability to inhibit inflammation and promote regeneration. Recent developments in cell therapy have demonstrated promising therapeutic outcomes in terms of restoration of renal structure and function. This review focuses on stem cell therapy approaches for the treatment of glomerular disease, including the various cell sources used and recent advances in preclinical and clinical studies."

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based therapeutic modality that has been used in the setting of refractory congestive HF to help optimize volume status. Not only does PD allow for customized sodium and water removal, but it also provides the opportunity for the patients to fully benefit from guideline-directed medical therapy for HF that could have otherwise been challenging to use. Areas covered: Authors provide an overview of the pathophysiologic basis for the use of PD in HF, followed by a review of the findings of the main clinical trials such as the salutary impact on HF re-admissions and quality of life. Since the goals of therapy in this setting differ from those for patients with end-stage renal disease, pertinent practical considerations in the use of this modality are then discussed as well as potential barriers. Expert opinion: For patients with chronic refractory HF, PD represents an alternative to medical therapy alone. Identification of patients that would benefit most from this modality and detection of major enablers and obstacles for the implementation of this therapy should be the focus of future studies."

This study examined associations of pretransplant dialysis modality with post-transplant outcomes in a large national cohort of kidney transplant recipients.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nLinking the 5-year patient data of a large dialysis organization to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, 12,416 hemodialysis and 2092 peritoneal dialysis patients who underwent first kidney transplantation were identified. Mortality or graft failure and delayed graft function risks were estimated by Cox regression (hazard ratio) and logistic regression (odds ratio), respectively.\n## RESULTS\nRecipients treated with peritoneal dialysis pretransplantation had lower (21.9/1000 patient-years [95% confidence interval: 18.1-26.5]) crude all-cause mortality rate than those recipients treated with hemodialysis (32.8/1000 patient-years [30.8-35.0]). Pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 43% lower adjusted all-cause and 66% lower cardiovascular death. Furthermore, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis use was associated with 17% and 36% lower unadjusted death-censored graft failure and delayed graft function risk, respectively. However, after additional adjustment for relevant covariates, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis modality was not a significant predictor of death-censored graft failure delayed graft function, respectively. Similar trends were noted on analyses using a propensity score matched cohort of 2092 pairs of patients.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCompared with hemodialysis, patients treated with peritoneal dialysis before transplantation had lower mortality but similar graft loss or delayed graft function.

Acyclovir was given orally in doses of 800 to 3200 mg per day, according to the patients' estimated level of renal function. Patients took the first dose of either acyclovir or placebo six hours before transplantation and continued to take the assigned medication for 12 weeks. Of 118 patients enrolled in the study, 104 completed at least 30 days on the study medication and were included in our analysis of the results. During the first year after transplantation, 4 of 53 patients (7.5 percent) in the acyclovir group had symptomatic cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with 15 of 51 (29 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.002). There was a single case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in the acyclovir group, as compared with nine in the placebo group. The greatest prophylactic benefit of acyclovir was observed among seronegative patients who had received a kidney from a seropositive donor; only one of six such patients in the acyclovir group had cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with all seven in the placebo group. Acyclovir decreased the incidence of documented cytomegalovirus infection (with or without symptomatic disease) to 36 percent from 61 percent among the patients who received the placebo (P = 0.011). Among the patients who received acyclovir, the rates of recovery of virus from the blood and urine were significantly reduced, but the rate of viral shedding from the pharynx was not significantly different from that in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events or in the rate of survival of either grafts or patients.

There is considerable controversy regarding pancreas transplantation (p Tx), however, as some recent reviews have concluded, p Tx results in at most only modest reductions in secondary complications and has increased morbidity and costs compared with kidney transplant alone. While the impact on patients' quality of life (QOL) is a major consideration for p Tx, the literature on this topic has not been carefully considered. The purpose of this review is to evaluate studies of QOL after p Tx and identify well-validated findings. Comparative cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that the QOL outcomes of p Tx recipients who achieve insulin-independence are better than those of candidates or of recipients with pancreas graft loss. More positive health perceptions, improved social interaction and increased vitality/energy are significantly associated with successful p Tx. Researchers have found few areas where the QOL benefits of p Tx significantly exceed or differ from those that occur with kidney transplant alone. A consistent finding across studies is that p Tx improves patient perceptions about diabetes-specific issues such as satisfaction with diet flexibility and health management, while kidney transplant does not. Future studies should attempt to accrue sufficient sample sizes to permit statistical adjustment for selection biases; follow patients for several years to permit differences in rates of progression of secondary complications to impact QOL; and use current graft loss and morbidity statistics to estimate any added risks of p Tx over kidney-only transplant. It is still an open question as to whether or not there are sufficient QOL benefits from p Tx long-term to out-weigh added risks, and this needs to remain an active area of investigation."

Forty-nine patients were randomized into three groups who received three times daily either two placebos (17 patients), 325 mg ASA and placebo (16 patients), or 325 mg ASA and 75 mg DIP (16 patients). The patients were seen at 3-month intervals for 1 year, and coded medication bottles were dispensed and returned pills counted to assess patient compliance. Treatment failure was defined as the first graft occlusion. The data were analyzed using the Breslow statistic for progressively censored survival type data. The 1-year cumulative patency rate for the entire series was 59%. The rates for above-knee grafts in the ASA group (100%) and the ASA/DIP group (100%) were significantly higher than the rates for the placebo group (50%) (P = 0.05). The 1-year cumulative patency rates for patients with below-knee grafts were not statistically different among the groups, although the patients who received ASA alone had a higher rate than did the other two groups (65% versus 21% for placebo and 19% for ASA/DIP). There were fewer occlusions in the above-knee grafts as compared to below-knee grafts in all groups, but the differences were statistically significant only in the ASA/DIP group. There were no statistical differences between the two active treatment groups."

            "abstract": "A prospective and double-blind study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of two different treatments on two randomized groups of patients with threatened preterm labor. The first treatment consisted of the administration of ritodrine and a placebo; in the second, ritodrine was combined with indomethacin. 22 patients were evaluated in each group. The results obtained for gain in days, number of patients delivered at term, weight of newborns and number of recurrences in each group suggest that treatment with ritodrine and indomethacin is slightly but significantly more effective than treatment with ritodrine and placebo in prolonging pregnancy. No evidence has been found of possible unfavorable vascular effects of indomethacin in the fetus or the newborn."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Thorough treatment planning is essential for a good clinical outcome in orthognathic treatment. The planning is often digital. Both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) software options are available. The aim of this randomized 2-arm parallel double-blinded active-controlled clinical trial was to compare the outcomes of computer-based 2D and 3D planning techniques according to patient-reported health related quality of life. The hypothesis was that a 3D technique would give a better treatment outcome compared with a 2D technique.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Orthognathic treatment for 62 subjects, aged 18 to 28 years, with severe Class III malocclusion was planned with both 2D and 3D techniques. After treatment planning but before surgery, the patients were randomly allocated via blind collection of 1 enveloped card for each subject in a 1:1 ratio to the test (3D) or the control (2D) group. Thus, the intervention was according to which planning technique was used. The primary outcome was patient-reported outcome measures. The secondary outcome was relationship between patient-reported outcome measures and cephalometric accuracy. Questionnaires on the patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were distributed preoperatively and 12 months after surgical treatment. The questionnaires were coded, meaning blinding throughout the analysis. Differences between groups were tested with the Fisher permutation test. The HRQoL was also compared with measurements of cephalometric accuracy for the 2 groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three subjects were lost to clinical follow-up, leaving 57 included. Of these, 55 subjects completed the questionnaires, 28 in the 2D and 27 in the 3D groups. No statistically significant difference regarding HRQoL was found between the studied planning techniques: the Oral Health Impact Profile total showed -3.69 (95% confidence interval, -19.68 to 12.30). Consistent results on HRQoL and cephalometric accuracy showed a difference between pretreatment and posttreatment that increased in both groups but to a higher level in the 3D group. A difference between pretreatment and posttreatment HRQoL was shown for both groups, indicating increased quality of life after treatment. This supports recent findings comparing 3D and 2D planning techniques. No serious harm was observed during the study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Improvements of HRQoL were shown after treatment independent of which planning technique, 2D or 3D, was used. No statistically significant difference was found between the planning techniques.\n    \n\n\n          Registration:\n        \n      \n      This trial was not registered.\n    \n\n\n          Protocol:\n        \n      \n      The protocol was not published before trial commencement.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was supported by personal grants to Martin Bengtsson from the Scandinavian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (25000 SEK), the Southern Region of the Swedish Dental Association (50000 SEK), and the Swedish Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (25000 SEK).

We searched Medline by PubMed using the following key words: \"spa therapy\" \"balneotherapy\" \"mud\" \"peloid\" \"mud pack Therapy\" in combination with \"randomized controlled trial\" \"double blind trial.\" We also reviewed the reference list of articles retrieved by the Medline search. We selected the double-blind randomized clinical trials that assessed the effects of mineral water or mud treatments compared to tap water, attenuated peloid/mud therapy or similar treatments without the specific minerals or chemical compounds of the treatment group (\"non-mineral\"). We evaluated the internal validity and the quality of the statistical analysis of these trials. The final selection comprised 27 double-blind randomized clinical trials, 20 related to rheumatology. A total of 1118 patients with rheumatological and other musculoskeletal diseases were evaluated in these studies: 552 of knee osteoarthritis, 47 of hand osteoarthritis, 147 chronic low back pain, 308 of reumathoid arthritis, and 64 of osteoporosis; 293 of these participants were assigned to the experimental groups of knee osteoarthritis, 24 in hand osteoarthritis, 82 of low back pain, 152 with reumathoid arthritis, and 32 with osteoporosis. They were treated with mineral water baths and/or mud/peloid (with or without other forms of treatment, like physical therapy, exercise…). The rest were allocated to the control groups; they received mainly tap water and/or \"non-mineral\" mud/peloid treatments. Mineral water or mud treatments had better and longer improvements in pain, function, quality of life, clinical parameters, and others in some rheumatologic diseases (knee and hand osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis) compared to baseline and non-mineral similar treatments. Internal validity and other limitations of the study's methodology impede causal relation of spa therapy on these improvements. Randomized clinical trials are very heterogeneous. Double-blind randomized clinical trials seem to be the key for studying the role of mineral elements and other chemical compounds, observing enough consistency to demonstrate better and longer improvements for mineral waters or derivate compared to tap water; but due to heterogeneity and gaps on study protocol and methodology, existing research is not sufficiently strong to draw firm conclusions. Well-designed studies in larger patients' population are needed to establish the role of minerals and other chemical compounds in spa therapy."

            "abstract": "One hundred one suitable patients with peritonitis of diverse origin were randomized into two groups. In each patient in group 1 (50 patients), the abdomen was washed after the appropriate surgical procedure with normal saline solution, and 2 gm chloramphenicol was introduced before abdominal closure; in each patient in group 2 (51 patients), the abdomen was washed as in group 1, but chloramphenicol was not instilled. All patients were given 1 gm chloramphenicol intramuscularly either preoperatively or intraoperatively and 3 gm daily for 3 days. Chloramphenicol was selected on the basis of its activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and its demonstrated stimulating effect on peritoneal macrophages in vitro. All explorations were done through the midline, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were closed secondarily 3 to 4 days after operation. No drains were used. The two groups were roughly comparable, but results were significantly better for all parameters studied in patients receiving chloramphenicol locally. Blood dyscrasias were not observed. It is suggested that the combination of washing and local antibiotics is superior to washing alone; in addition to its parenteral administration, chloramphenicol is of considerable value if instilled in the area of peritonitis after washing; and besides its bacteriostatic action, chloramphenicol may have a local stimulating effect on peritoneal defenses and may therefore be the drug of choice for local use in generalized peritonitis."

Survival was 78.6% and 40.7% in years 1 and 5, being worse for initial patients of each program, infants, and elders. Technique survival was 57.4% and 10.1% at years 1 and 5. Patients interrupting treatment for any reason had a higher chance of dropout. In Porto Alegre, 294 patients started dialysis during 1993; 21 performed CAPD, 44 had a transplant, and the others were hemodialyzed. Children were treated mostly by CAPD. CAPD patients had less diabetes and ischemic heart disease and received more transplants. Their adjusted actuarial survival (100% year 1; 67% year 3) was no different than hemodialysis. CAPD is not a popular form of renal therapy in RS, and dropout rates are significant."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Monotherapy approvals have been difficult to obtain from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and have almost all been achieved using a trial design entitled \"withdrawal to monotherapy\" in treatment-resistant patients, which employs a so-called \"pseudo-placebo\" as a comparator arm. The authors submitted a white paper to the FDA advocating use of a virtual placebo historical control as an alternative to pseudo-placebo. Such an approach reduces patient risk that would result from exposure to pseudo-placebo. In this article, we present the data submitted to the FDA to justify a historical control.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed individual patient data from eight previously completed withdrawal to monotherapy studies, which we determined had similar design. All studies employed percent meeting predetermined exit criteria (denoting worsening of seizure control) as the outcome measure. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percent exiting were calculated at 112 days.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The percent meeting exit criteria were uniformly high, ranging from 74.9-95.9%. The eight studies appear to meet the criteria set forth for use of historical control. The estimate of the combined percent exit based on the noniterative mixed-effects model is 85.1%, with a lower bound of the 95% prediction interval of 65.3%, and 72.2% for an 80% prediction interval.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is justification for proposing that these data can serve as a historical control for future monotherapy studies, obviating the need for a placebo/pseudo-placebo arm in trials intended to demonstrate the efficacy of approved drugs as monotherapy in treatment-resistant patients."

            "title": "Sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients: different causes and management strategies.",
            "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a major cause of death in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The precise estimate of its incidence is difficult to establish because studies on the incidence of SCD in ESKD are often combined with those related to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurring during a haemodialysis (HD) session. The aim of the European Dialysis Working Group of ERA-EDTA was to critically review the current literature examining the causes of extradialysis SCD and intradialysis SCA in ESKD patients and potential management strategies to reduce the incidence of such events. Extradialysis SCD and intradialysis SCA represent different clinical situations and should be kept distinct. Regarding the problem, numerically less relevant, of patients affected by intradialysis SCA, some modifiable risk factors have been identified, such as a low concentration of potassium and calcium in the dialysate, and some advantages linked to the presence of automated external defibrillators in dialysis units have been documented. The problem of extra-dialysis SCD is more complex. A reduced left ventricular ejection fraction associated with SCD is present only in a minority of cases occurring in HD patients. This is the proof that SCD occurring in ESKD has different characteristics compared with SCD occurring in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or heart failure and not affected by ESKD. Recent evidence suggests that the fatal arrhythmia in this population may be due more frequently to bradyarrhythmias than to tachyarrhythmias. This fact may partly explain why several studies could not demonstrate an advantage of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in preventing SCD in ESKD patients. Electrolyte imbalances, frequently present in HD patients, could explain part of the arrhythmic phenomena, as suggested by the relationship between SCD and timing of the HD session. However, the high incidence of SCD in patients on peritoneal dialysis suggests that other risk factors due to cardiac comorbidities and uraemia per se may contribute to sudden mortality in ESKD patients."

This study was designed to determine the bioavailability of GCV and to test a dosing algorithm in transplant and dialysis patients with different levels of renal function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in 23 patients who were either a recipient of an organ transplant or on hemodialysis. Drug dosing was established by the following algorithm based on calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl): CrCl = [(140-age) x body weight]/(72 x Cr) x 0.85 for women that is, CrCl >50 ml/min, 1000 mg every 8 hr; CrCl of 25-50 ml/min, 1000 mg every 24 hr; CrCl of 10-24 ml/ min, 500 mg every day; CrCl < 10 ml/min (or on dialysis), 500 mg every other day after dialysis. GCV was taken within 30 min after a meal. The patients received oral GCV for between 12 days and 14 weeks. Serum specimens (or plasma from patients on hemodialysis) obtained at steady state were analyzed for GCV concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography. In nine of the transplant recipients, absolute bioavailability was determined by comparing GCV levels after single oral and intravenous doses of GCV.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The following GCV concentrations (mean +/-SD) were determined: with CrCl of > or =70 ml/min, the minimum steady-state concentration (Cmin) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were 0.78+/-0.46 microg/ml and 1.42+/-0.37 microg/ml, respectively, with a 24-hr area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24) of 24.7+/-7.8 microg x hr/ml; with CrCl of 50-69 ml/min, the Cmin and Cmax were 1.93+/-0.48 and 2.57+/-0.39 microg/ml, respectively, with an AUC0-24 of 52.1+/-10.1 microg x hr/ml; with CrCl of 25-50 ml/min, the Cmin and Cmax were 0.41+/-0.27 and 1.17+/-0.32 microg/ml, respectively, with an AUC0-24 of 14.6+/-7.4 microg x hr/ml. For one patient with a CrCl of 23.8 ml/min, the Cmin and Cmax were 0.32 and 0.7 microg/ml, respectively, with an AUC0-24 of 10.7 microg x hr/ml. With CrCl of <10 ml/min, the mean Cmin and Cmax were 0.75+/-0.42 and 1.59+/-0.55 microg/ml, respectively, with a mean AUC0-24 of 64.6+/-18.8 microg x hr/ml. Absolute bioavailability, for the nine patients so analyzed, was 7.2+/-2.4%. For those patients with end-stage renal failure, GCV concentrations fell during dialysis from a mean of 1.47+/-0.48 microg/ml before dialysis to 0.69+/-0.38 microg/ml after dialysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The bioavailability of oral GCV in transplant patients was similar to that observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. However, levels between 0.5 and 1 microg/ml (within the IC50 of most cytomegalovirus isolates) could be achieved with tolerable oral doses. The proposed dosing algorithm resulted in adequate levels for patients with CrCl greater than 50 ml/min and for patients on dialysis. For patients with CrCl between 10 and 50 ml/min, the levels achieved were low and these patients would likely benefit from increased doses."

In order to evaluate the infectious risk of renal transplantation in patients previously maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and/or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), we retrospectively evalauted the clinical course of 44 pediatric patients (mean age 12.0 +/- 5.7 [SD] years) who received 32 cadaver and 16 live-related donor renal grafts after being maintained on peritoneal dialysis for 756 patient-months (mean 17.1 +/- 11.5 months). In the posttransplant period, 25 patients (57%) required dialysis because of acute tubular necrosis or acute rejection. Peritonitis developed in five patients (11%) following transplantation; two were being dialyzed at the time. Exit-site and tunnel infections occurred in nine patients (20%). In all instances, antibiotic treatment and/or catheter removal was curative. Posttransplant ascites developed in 12 patients (27%) and was alleviated by catheter drainage. The catheters were left in situ at the time of transplantation and electively removed when stable graft function was present. The 1- and 2-year actuarial graft survival rate was 65% and 55%, respectively. One patient died in the immediate posttransplant period, which was unrelated to peritoneal dialysis. In conclusion, pediatric patients maintained on CAPD and/or CCPD can be safely transplanted. The potential infectious risks related to peritoneal dialysis can be managed with appropriate management of the catheter and prompt antibiotic therapy. The patient and graft survival rates are comparable to those with patients receiving hemodialysis prior to transplantation. There is no need to limit access to transplantation in children undergoing CAPD and/or CCPD."

When analyzed as a whole group, renal patients maintained on dialysis (n = 45: hemodialysis, n = 20; peritoneal dialysis) or with a functioning kidney transplant (n = 19) did not differ in mean ACA concentration and LAC activity (n = 84, ACA: IgG 10 +/- 7 U/ml, IgM 2 +/- 1 U/ml, LAC ratio: 1.0 +/- 0.2) from healthy subjects (n = 50, ACA: IgG 10 +/- 3, IgM 2 +/- 1 U/ml, LAC ratio: 1.0 +/- 0.1) but they had a higher incidence of raised IgG-ACA titers (renal replacement 14% vs. normal controls 4%, p less than 0.05). No significant correlation was found between thrombotic events and raised ACA or LAC activity in dialysis patients.

Two review authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies according to EPOC criteria. We undertook meta-analyses using the fixed-effect model where studies were examining the same treatment effect and to account for small sample sizes. We compared outcomes to a random-effects model where clinical or statistical heterogeneity existed.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 46 studies (37,337 participants); non-medical prescribing was undertaken by nurses in 26 studies and pharmacists in 20 studies. In 45 studies non-medical prescribing as a component of care was compared with usual care medical prescribing. A further study compared nurse prescribing supported by guidelines with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with non-medical prescribing being undertaken by other health professionals. The education requirement for non-medical prescribing varied with country and location.A meta-analysis of surrogate markers of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein) showed positive intervention group effects. There was a moderate-certainty of evidence for studies of blood pressure at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -5.31 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.46 to -4.16; 12 studies, 4229 participants) and low-density lipoprotein (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.14; 7 studies, 1469 participants); we downgraded the certainty of evidence from high due to considerations of serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. A high-certainty of evidence existed for comparative studies of glycated haemoglobin management at 12 months (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.38; 6 studies, 775 participants). While there appeared little difference in medication adherence across studies, a meta-analysis of continuous outcome data from four studies showed an effect favouring patient adherence in the non-medical prescribing group (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 4 studies, 700 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adherence to moderate due to the serious risk of performance bias. While little difference was seen in patient-related adverse events between treatment groups, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to indirectness, as the range of adverse events may not be related to the intervention and selective reporting failed to adequately report adverse events in many studies.Patients were generally satisfied with non-medical prescriber care (14 studies, 7514 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence from high to moderate due to indirectness, in that satisfaction with the prescribing component of care was only addressed in one study, and there was variability of satisfaction measures with little use of validated tools. A meta-analysis of health-related quality of life scores (SF-12 and SF-36) found a difference favouring usual care for the physical component score (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.17), but not the mental component score (MD 0.58, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.55). However, the quality of life measurement may more appropriately reflect composite care rather than the prescribing component of care, and for this reason we downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate due to indirectness of the measure of effect. A wide variety of resource use measures were reported across studies with little difference between groups for hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In the majority of studies reporting medication use, non-medical prescribers prescribed more drugs, intensified drug doses, and used a greater variety of drugs compared to usual care medical prescribers.The risk of bias across studies was generally low for selection bias (random sequence generation), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). There was an unclear risk of selection bias (allocation concealment) and for other biases. A high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) existed.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings suggest that non-medical prescribers, practising with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, in a range of settings, were as effective as usual care medical prescribers. Non-medical prescribers can deliver comparable outcomes for systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and health-related quality of life. It was difficult to determine the impact of non-medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for adverse events and resource use outcomes due to the inconsistency and variability in reporting across studies. Future efforts should be directed towards more rigorous studies that can clearly identify the clinical, patient-reported, resource use, and economic outcomes of non-medical prescribing, in both high-income and low-income countries."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Hearing loss is quite prevalent and can be related to people's quality of life. To our knowledge, there are limited studies assessing the efficacy of hearing interventions on quality of life in adults. Therefore, we aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of community-based hearing rehabilitation on quality of life among Chinese adults with hearing loss.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      In this two-arm feasibility study, participants aged 16 and above with some degree of hearing loss (n = 464) will be recruited from Linyi City, Shandong Province. They are randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group. Those in the treatment group are prescribed with hearing aids, while those in the control group receive no intervention. Reinstruction in use of devices is provided for the treatment group during booster visits held 12 months post-randomization or unscheduled interim visits when necessary. Data are collected at baseline and the follow-up 20 months later. The primary outcome is changes in quality of life over a 20-month study period. Secondary outcomes include sub-dimensions in quality of life, physical functioning, chronic diseases, cognitive function, depression, social support, hospitalizations, falls, and healthcare costs. Finally, we will evaluate whether hearing aids intervention is cost-effective to apply in a large scale.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The trial is designed to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a community-based rehabilitation intervention on quality of life among Chinese adults with hearing loss.

            "title": "Current international status of home hemodialysis.",
            "abstract": "Three times weekly home hemodialysis (HHD) was introduced shortly after the initiation of chronic hemodialysis (HD) treatment in 1960. HHD eliminates the need of transportation to and from the dialysis unit and by allowing patients to set their own dialysis schedule, decreases the burden of treatment on their personal and professional lives. HHD has been found more economical and more highly associated with better patient survival than in-center dialysis. Nevertheless, the global prevalence of HHD decreased between 1980 and 2000 due to the increased availability of dialysis units and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, advances in cadaveric kidney transplantation, and several other factors. However, the availability of HHD at a frequency of more than 3 times/week, the typical frequency of conventional HD (CHD), in such forms as brief HD sessions of 2-3 h 5-6 days/week and nocturnal HD (NHD) has led to reversals in this trend. Frequent HHD, such as short daily HD (SDHD) and NHD instead of 3 times/week CHD, has been found to significantly improve hypertension, left ventricular mass, renal anemia, quality of life and mortality. On the other hand, NHD has been found to significantly improve hypertension, left ventricular mass, renal anemia, quality of life, malnutrition, mortality and phosphate clearance. Many observational clinical studies and one randomized controlled trial of SDHD and/or NHD have been conducted, and compact and convenient dialysis machines have been developed and used for HHD. The most recent data reported in the national and local registries of selected countries indicate that the prevalence of HHD among all dialysis patients from 2008 to 2010 varied from 0 to 3.3% except in New Zealand and Australia, where it was 16.3 and 9.3%, respectively. As HHD appears to be a more effective and economical dialysis modality than in-center CHD, its prevalence is likely to increase in the future."

This fact poses a significant health expense. Square Stepping Exercise (SSE) is a balance training system that has been shown to be effective in preventing falls in the elderly. However, there are neither studies in people with FM nor studies that apply SSE through video-conferencing (Tele-SSE). The objectives of this project are 1) to investigate the applicability, safety, decrease in the number of falls, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prevention of falls program through Tele-SSE in women with FM, and 2) to study the transfer of obtained results to the public and private socio-health economy of Extremadura. Methods/Design: A randomized controlled trial with experimental (Tele-SSE) and control (usual treatment) groups will be carried out. The application of Tele-SSE will be performed for 12 months (three times per week) and one additional follow-up month after the intervention. A focus group including agents to identify key points to transfer the findings to the public and private sectors in Extremadura. One-hundred and eighteen women with FM will be recruited and randomly distributed into the two groups: Experimental (Tele-SSE; n = 59) and control group (Usual care; n = 59). Primary outcome measures will be: 1) Applicability; 2) safety; 3) annual number of falls; and 4) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes will be: 1) Balance; 2) fear of falling; 3) socio-demographic and clinical information; 4) body composition; 5) physical fitness; 6) physical activity and sedentary behavior; 7) quality of life-related to health, mental health, and positive health; 8) pain; 9) disability level; 10) cognitive aspects; and 11) depressive symptoms. Regarding the focus group, the acceptability of the Tele-SSE will be evaluated in social-sanitary agents and will include Tele-SSE in their services offer. A statistical analysis will be carried out by treatment intention and protocol. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health system will be performed.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This project aims to improve the efficiency and equity of physical therapy services based on tele-exercise in preventing falls in people with FM.

            "abstract": "Sclerosing peritonitis (SP) is an uncommon but serious complication of CAPD with various suggested etiologies. We have documented 14 cases of SP in 18 patients who had used chlorhexidine in alcohol (ChA) in the connection procedure for CAPD. Thirteen died. Nine of the 14 patients had been transferred to hemodialysis or renal transplantation, yet all still developed symptoms of SP within a few months after transfer - even the 5 who were originally asymptomatic. The main symptoms of SP were peritoneal ultrafiltration failure, exudative bloody ascites and intestinal obstruction. They presented at around 5 years (30-80 months) after commencement of CAPD. Most deaths were related to intestinal obstruction. Four other patients with a comparable duration of ChA exposure were continued on CAPD with the Travenol Spike System (TSS), without further exposure to ChA. They were all asymptomatic of SP after 9-12 months. Comparing the 2 groups of asymptomatic patients, those transferred to TSS had a much better outcome after 9 months than those transferred to HD or renal transplantation (P = 0.0476). We suggest that ChA is the main cause of SP in our patients and that continuing CAPD without further exposure to ChA is a better alternative than stopping CAPD to prevent the progression of SP."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Varicose veins are enlarged, visibly lumpy knotted veins, usually in the legs. Uncomplicated varicose veins can cause major discomfort and some complications. They are part of chronic venous disease (CVD), which is reported to have a substantial negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Traditional treatments for varicose veins involve surgical stripping and ligation and liquid sclerotherapy (LS), but can be invasive and painful. New minimally invasive treatments offer an alternative. These treatments typically involve use of laser, radiofrequency or foam sclerosant. They are increasingly widely used and offer potential benefits such as reduced complications, faster recovery, fewer physical limitations and improved quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this report is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of the minimally invasive techniques of foam sclerotherapy (FS), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in comparison with other techniques, including traditional surgical techniques, LS and conservative management, in the management of varicose veins.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search was made of 11 bibliographic databases of published and unpublished literature from their inception to July 2011: MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; The Cochrane Library; Biological Abstracts; Science Citation Index (SCI); Social Sciences Citation Index; Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science; UK Clinical Research Network; Current Controlled Trials; and ClinicalTrials.gov.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques compared with other treatments, principally surgical stripping, in terms of recurrence of varicose veins, retreatment and clinical symptoms, as measured by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), pain and quality of life. Network meta-analysis and exploratory cost-effectiveness modelling were performed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The literature search identified 1453 unique citations, of which 34 RCTs (54 papers) satisfied the criteria for the clinical effectiveness review. The minimally invasive techniques reported clinical outcomes similar to surgery. Rates of recurrence were slightly lower for EVLA, RFA and FS, especially for longer follow-up periods; VCSS score was lower for EVLA and FS than for stripping, but slightly higher for RFA; short-term pain was less for FS and RFA but higher for EVLA; higher quality-of-life scores were reported for all evaluated interventions than for stripping. Differences between treatments were therefore negligible in terms of clinical outcomes, so the treatment with the lowest cost appears to be most cost-effective. Our central estimate is that total FS costs were lowest and FS is marginally more effective than stripping. However, this result was sensitive to the model time horizon. Threshold analysis indicated that EVLA and RFA might be considered cost-effective if their costs are equivalent to stripping. These findings are subject to uncertainty on account of the risk of bias present in the evidence base and the variation in costs.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the techniques are principally based on rates of post-operative technical recurrence rather than symptomatic recurrence, as this was the reported outcome in all trials. The true proportion of treated individuals who are likely to present with symptoms of recurrence requiring retreatment is therefore not certain. A figure reflecting the likely proportion of treated individuals who would experience symptomatic recurrence requiring retreatment (with its associated costs), therefore, had to be calculated by the authors based on a small number of studies. The findings of this report also need to be verified by data from future trials with longer follow-up and using more standardised outcome measures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This assessment of the currently available evidence suggests there is little to choose between the minimally invasive techniques in terms of efficacy or cost, and each offers a viable, clinically effective alternative to stripping. FS might offer the most cost-effective alternative to stripping, within certain time parameters. High-quality RCT evidence is needed. Future trials should aim to measure and report outcomes in a standardised manner, which would permit more efficient pooling of their results.\n    \n\n\n          Study registration:\n        \n      \n      PROSPERO number CRD42011001355.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."

            "abstract": "Health-related quality of life (QOL) refers to the measure of a patient's functioning, well-being, and general health perception in each of three domains: physical, psychological, and social. Along with survival and other types of clinical outcomes, patient QOL is an important indicator of the effectiveness of the medical care they receive. QOL of patients with end-stage renal disease is influenced by the disease itself and by the type of replacement therapy. Numerous studies have identified the effect of such factors as anemia, age, comorbidity, and depression on QOL. Most of these factors appear during the predialysis period, and the adequate management of some of them could influence patient outcomes. Among replacement therapies, transplantation appears to give the best QOL for large groups of patients. No conclusive data exist to prove differences in QOL between hemodialysis patients and peritoneal dialysis patients. In the case of elderly patients or those with a high degree of comorbidity, the best treatment option should be assessed in each individual case, taking all possible factors into account. Finally, it has been proven that physical and mental function are inversely correlated with the risk for hospitalization and mortality."

Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice, offering better survival and cost-effectiveness than other alternatives. This study aimed to compare the cost of living-donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) during the first year after transplantation with that of hemodialysis (HD).\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, descriptive study of cost and efficacy was performed in the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona from January to December 2011.

Several psychosocial issues are potentially relevant in the clinical management of hemophilia, including it being a chronic and incurable condition; e.g. people with hemophilia must adapt to optimally interact with peers and to practice sports - even choosing a sport represents an issue for perceived limitations, expectations and cultural influences on the individual and their family. People with hemophilia can react by denying their condition and its manifestations and not adhering to treatment. Due to the complexity of relationships surrounding genetic diseases, parents and relatives may have their own issues that contribute to making life easier or more difficult for the person with hemophilia. Anxiety, sadness and depression resulting in mental health disorders are reported in this population and may influence quality of life (QoL) depending on cultural background, religious beliefs, family support and other variables.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Primarily to assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for improving the ability of people with hemophilia to cope with their chronic condition.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to identify trials from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, Embase and PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE and trial registries.

All psychological interventions for promoting emotional, intellectual and spiritual wellness. Individual, group or family group therapy interventions were eligible.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Seven trials were included (362 participants randomized, data from 264 participants available for analysis); six of parallel design and one a partial cross-over design. One multicenter trial was conducted in Canada; the remaining six were single centre undertaken in the UK, USA, Iran and in the Netherlands. All trials had a high risk of bias for participant blinding and use of patient-reported outcomes. Evidence was retrieved on four interventions: psycho-education (DVD plus information booklet versus information booklet alone; computerised learning versus no intervention); cognitive therapy (auto-hypnosis (self-hypnosis) versus control); and behavioural therapy (relaxation (progressive or self control) versus no treatment). We also aimed to assess psychodynamic therapy and systemic therapy, but no trials were identified. Heterogeneity of the outcome measures and measurements precluded meta-analyses. No trial reported the cost of the psychological intervention and family adjustment. DVD plus information booklet compared to information booklet alone One trial (108 participants) showed coping strategies may lower pre-contemplation scores and negative thoughts, mean difference (MD) -0.24 (95%CI -0.48 - 0.00, low-certainty evidence), however, other measures of coping strategies in the same trial suggest little or no difference between groups, e.g. contemplation, MD (-0.09, 95%CI -0.32 - 0.14, low-certainty evidence). The same trial measured QoL and showed little or no difference between treatment groups for the physical domain, MD 0.59 (95% CI -3.66 to 4.84, low-certainty evidence), but may improve scores in the mental health domain for those receiving the booklet plus DVD compared to booklet alone, MD (4.70, 95% CI 0.33 to 9.07, low-certainty evidence). Mood or personal well-being were not reported. Computerised learning compared to no intervention Two trials (57 participants) reported on interventions aimed at children and adolescents and their impact on promoting a sense of self-efficacy (primary outcome 'Mood and personal well-being'), but only one showed an increase, MD 7.46 (95%CI 3.21 to 11.71, 17 participants, very low-certainty evidence); the second did not report control group data. One trial (30 participants) showed the intervention did not improve self-efficacy in adults, but appropriate data could not be extracted. Two trials (47 participants) reported coping strategies; one only reported within-group differences from baseline, the second showed an increase from baseline in coping strategies in the Internet program group compared to the no intervention group (disease-specific knowledge, MD 2.45 (95% CI 0.89 to 4.01); self-management ability and transition readiness, MD 19.90 (95% CI 3.61 to 36.19; low-certainty evidence). One trial reported QoL but with insufficient information to calculate changes from baseline; no difference in post-treatment scores was seen between groups, MD -8.65, 95% CI -18.30 to 1.00, very low-certainty evidence). Auto-hypnosis (self-hypnosis) compared to control There were two older trials that reported on this intervention (50 participants) focusing mainly on the secondary outcome 'physical health'; only one trial reported the primary outcome 'mood and personal well-being' (only within-group differences in the treatment group). Coping strategies and QoL were not assessed in the trials. Relaxation (progressive or self control) compared to no treatment Only one trial (seven participants) from 1985, was included which focused on 'physical health' and did not report on any of our primary outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Not all of the seven included trials analysed the effects of the interventions on our primary outcomes (mood and personal well-being, coping strategies and QoL). Three trials were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s using techniques of auto-hypnosis or relaxation and, in accordance with the needs and therapeutic possibilities of the time, they focused on secondary outcomes, e.g. frequency of bleeding (physical health) and adherence to the intervention. The four newer trials assessed psycho-educational interventions all mediated by the use of technologies (DVD or computer) and often created according to age needs of the target group. In these cases, attention was shifted to our pre-defined primary outcomes. This review has identified low- and very low-certainty evidence, prompting caution in its interpretation. The major problem we encountered was the heterogeneity of trial designs, of interventions and of outcome measures used across the trials. We strongly suggest that researchers consider developing a core outcome set to streamline future research; randomization was proven to be safe and acceptable, and blinding should be considered for those assessing patient-reported outcomes."

Five patients were on regular haemodialysis and five patients were on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Oxalate metabolism was assessed by measurement of plasma oxalate concentration (POx), oxalate metabolic pool size (OxMP), tissue oxalate accumulation rate (TOxA), oxalate production rate (OxPR) and dialysis clearance of oxalate (DCOx). These observations were made on three separate occasions in each of the ten patients: initially when the patients were taking a routine ascorbic acid supplement of 100 mg per day; then after a period of 1 month with no ascorbic acid supplement; and then finally after a further period of 1 month's treatment with pyridoxine 800 mg daily.

The IPC leadership interpreted the results after each survey.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The majority of participants (77% in Survey 1 and 89% in Survey 2) agreed that studies of investigative treatments should include an active comparator. Participants described the most important feature of a gold standard as a treatment that: is widely used and generally accepted (45%); has the best efficacy (42%); and is well tolerated (13%). The majority agreed that gold standards should be dependent on: patient subgroup; location/extent of psoriasis; and psoriasis subtype/morphology. It was also agreed that continuous therapy for more than 3 years is needed for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We have provided an expert opinion regarding the definition of a gold standard in psoriasis and have also established that no single treatment can be the gold standard across all subgroups and types of the disease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A single gold standard for the treatment of psoriasis does not exist. The complexity and heterogeneity of psoriasis requires different gold standards for the various manifestations of psoriasis and for subgroups of patients reconciling comorbidities. Of note, 17 experts out of 30 selected methotrexate as the most nominated gold standard amongst systemic agents. The experts support the election of an active comparator as one that is most efficacious over just the best in a particular class. In concordance, 87% of respondents agreed that good tolerability is therefore not the lead criterion for selection of an active comparator in favor of effectiveness and broad use. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis require continuous therapy; this statement was supported by 93% of the experts. Reasons for considering long-term therapy included appearance of comorbidities, impairment of quality of life, possibility of relapse, and subjective complaints such as itch, pain, and joint disease."

Nearly 75 per cent of the transplant recipients were able to work, as compared with between 24.7 and 59.3 per cent of the patients undergoing dialysis. On three subjective measures (life satisfaction, well-being, and psychological affect) transplant recipients had a higher quality of life than patients on dialysis. Among the patients treated with dialysis, those undergoing treatment at home had the highest quality of life. All quality-of-life differences were found to persist even after the patient case mix had been controlled statistically. Finally, the quality of life of transplant recipients compared well with that of the general population, but despite favorable subjective assessments, patients undergoing dialysis did not work or function at the same level as people in the general population."

Although ESRD disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, data on disparities in use and outcomes with home dialysis are sparse. We analyzed data of patients who initiated maintenance dialysis between 2007 and 2011 and were admitted to any of 2217 dialysis facilities in 43 states operated by a single large dialysis organization, with follow-up through December 31, 2011 (n =: 162,050, of which 17,791 underwent PD and 2536 underwent home HD for ≥91 days). Every racial/ethnic minority group was significantly less likely to be treated with home dialysis than whites. Among individuals treated with in-center HD or PD, racial/ethnic minorities had a lower risk for death than whites; among individuals undergoing home HD, only blacks had a significantly lower death risk than whites. Blacks undergoing PD or home HD had a higher risk for transfer to in-center HD than their white counterparts, whereas Asians or others undergoing PD had a lower risk than whites undergoing PD. Blacks irrespective of dialysis modality, Hispanics undergoing PD or in-center HD, and Asians and other racial groups undergoing in-center HD were significantly less likely than white counterparts to receive a kidney transplant. In conclusion, there are racial/ethnic disparities in use of and outcomes with home dialysis in the United States. Disparities in kidney transplantation evident for blacks and Hispanics undergoing home dialysis are similar to those with in-center HD. Future studies should identify modifiable causes for these disparities."

The manner of addressing this challenge varies around the world as seen in different patterns of RRT. We present here a summary of the incidence and prevalence of treated ESRD in Australia and New Zealand in 2000.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data are derived from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), which collects data about all patients receiving RRT from all renal units in Australia and New Zealand on a 6-monthly basis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The crude incidence rates of new RRT patients for 2000 for Australia and New Zealand were 92 and 107 per million population, respectively. Prevalence rates (December 31, 2000) of dialysis-treated patients were 334 per million in Australia and 348 per million in New Zealand, with 273 per million functioning kidney transplants in Australia and 267 per million in New Zealand. The principal area of increase has been in the older patients (>/=65 years), where age-specific rates still are increasing. Death rates remained in excess of the general population, with cardiac and infective causes predominant among dialysis patients and cardiac, infective, and malignant causes among transplant recipients. Data about hemodialysis treatments showed a continuing trend toward greater dose of hemodialysis achieved principally through increases in blood flow rate rather than increasing treatment time. Use of erythropoietic agents was common although more restricted in New Zealand by government regulation. Cadaveric transplantation rates were stable, but there has been a steady increase in the proportion of grafts from live donors. Practice in immunosuppression appears to be rapidly changing, with near-universal use of corticosteroids and mycophenolate as part of an initial therapy regimen with a calcineurin inhibitor. Tacrolimus, however, has rapidly increased in its use, presumably reflecting more widespread availability.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Relative to other countries, Australia and New Zealand have moderate incidence rates of ESRD. The increased rates in older patients reflect similar trends throughout the world. The traditional reliance of Australia and New Zealand on home- and satellite center-based dialysis therapy and transplantation as modalities of RRT is slowly changing with this growth in older patients. Cross-sectional survey results of iron studies suggest the relationship between iron studies and erythropoietin is modified by confounding."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Deep venous obstruction (DVO) has a great impact on quality of life (QoL) comparable to angina pectoris or chronic pulmonary disease. Post-thrombotic scar formation and May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) are the most common causes of DVO. Conventional treatment of DVO focuses on reducing pain or leg swelling by use of (pain) medication and therapeutic elastic stockings. In the past, a venous bypass was offered in severe post-thrombotic cases, but this procedure showed bad clinical and patency outcomes. With the introduction of percutaneous angioplasty and dedicated venous stents new opportunities were created. Deep venous stenting has been shown to be effective in retrospective case series. However, there is no prior research in which QoL after interventional treatment is compared with QoL after conventional treatment. Currently, there is a debate about the true additional value of interventional treatment. We investigate whether those patients who are treated with stenting experience a change in short form 36 (SF-36) and the Veines-QoL/Sym questionnaires compared with conventionally treated patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      This is a randomised trial comparing conservative deep venous management to interventional treatment.

Patients will be randomised to conservative treatment or venous stenting and stratified for the PTS or MTS subgroup. Conservative treatment consists of either one or a combination of pain medications, manual lymphatic drainage, compression stockings and regular post-thrombotic anticoagulant therapy.The primary outcome is the QoL change after 12 months compared with baseline QoL. Secondary outcomes are QoL changes at 6 weeks, clinical assessment of DVO, recurrence rate of deep venous thrombosis at 6 weeks and 12 months, and the total amount of working days lost. Intervention-specific outcomes include complications and patency.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      The protocol is approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Academisch ziekenhuis Maastricht/Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands (protocol number NLNL55641.068.15 / METC 161008).We aim to publish the results of this study in a peer reviewed journal and present our findings at national or international conferences.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration number:\n        \n      \n      The study protocol was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT03026049) on 17 January 2017."

Additionally, 149 healthy controls were enrolled by an accumulative process starting from employees of the University Hospital Essen. Members of these three groups were strictly matched by age and gender. Medical data were gained from the patient record, QOL was measured by a global inventory, the Munich Quality of Life Dimension List (MLDL), and two specific inventories, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Questionnaire for Social Support - Short Form (K-22). Transplanted patients and healthy controls reported similar QOL, which was significantly higher than in dialysis patients (p < 0.0001). This was particularly true for the physical and the psychological status, but not for the social situation. Both patient groups reported similar social support, which was significantly lower than in controls (p < 0.006). Both ESRD groups described higher satisfaction with social support than the healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Successful kidney transplantation not only improved distinct aspects of QOL, but even put the patients on par with healthy controls regarding physical, psychological and functional QOL. Lower social support and higher satisfaction with social support in both patient groups should be evaluated further. From a clinical viewpoint, the improvement of QOL due to transplantation is impressive, but more attention should be paid to the interpersonal relations of ESRD patients. International multicenter longitudinal studies to investigate QOL in ESRD patients under different treatment modalities are emphasized."

Since January 2000, patients have been offered urgent start on chronic PD right after PD-catheter insertion by open surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective study describing how acute APD was initiated using a standard prescription for a 12 h overnight APD in the supine position right after (<24 h) PD catheter placement and comparing short-term (3 months) outcome measures and dialysis-related complications between a group of patients started acutely on chronic PD and a non-matched group of patients with a planned start on chronic PD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The number and type of infectious complications were equal in both the groups. The total number of mechanical complications was significantly higher in the acute group compared with the planned group (P < 0.05). Consequently, the need for surgical replacement of catheters was also significantly higher in the study group (P < 0.02). With death and transplantation being the censored events, there was no difference in short-term PD technique survival rates between the two groups [39/45 (86.7%) vs 45/50 (90.0%)].\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The PD modality may be a feasible, safe and complementary alternative to HD not only in the chronic, but also in the acute setting. The concept of acute start on chronic PD may be an yet another tool to increase the PD penetration rate among incident patients starting chronic dialysis therapy."

            "abstract": "After myeloablative treatment and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), patients are kept in isolation rooms in the hospital to prevent neutropenic infections. During a 3-year period, patients were given the option of treatment at home after SCT. Daily visits by an experienced nurse and daily phone calls from a physician from the unit were included in the protocol. We compared 36 patients who wished to be treated at home with 18 patients who chose hospital care (control group 1). A matched control group of 36 patients treated in the hospital served as control group 2. All home care patients had hematologic malignancies and 19 were in first remission or first chronic phase. Of the donors, 25 were unrelated. The patients spent a median of 16 days at home (range, 0-26 days). Before discharge to the outpatient clinic after SCT, patients spent a median of 4 days (range, 0-39 days) in the hospital. In the multivariate analysis, the home care patients were discharged earlier (relative risk [RR] 0.33, P =.03), had fewer days on total parenteral nutrition (RR 0.24, P <.01), less acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV (RR 0.25, P =.01), lower transplantation-related mortality rates (RR 0.22, P =.04), and lower costs (RR 0.37, P <.05), compared with the controls treated in the hospital. The 2-year survival rates were 70% in the home care group versus 51% and 57% (not significant) in the 2 control groups, respectively (P <.03). To conclude, home care after SCT is a novel and safe approach. This study found it to be advantageous, compared with hospital care."

Confounding effects of late referral, emergency dialysis start, or start with central venous catheter on this association have never been studied concomitantly. Survival was studied among the 495 incident dialysed patients in our department from 1995 to 2006 and followed at least 1 year until December 31, 2007. Nested Cox models adjusted on patient characteristics explored factors associated with 1-year and ≥1-year mortality.

When adjusted only on age, sex, and comorbidities, HD was associated with poor 1-year outcome: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for death in HD vs. PD was 1.77, P=0.02. In fully adjusted model, among first dialysis feature variables, only emergency dialysis start was significantly associated with 1-year mortality: aHR 1.53, P=0.02. Dialysis modality was not associated with 1-year mortality rates in this fully adjusted model: aHR in HD vs. PD became 1.03, P=0.91. In ≥1-year period, HD was associated with lower mortality than PD (aHR 0.61, P=0.004), whereas other first dialysis features were not associated with death. Other factors associated with death were age, type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, and hepatic failure. Negative association between HD and 1-year survival on dialysis was explained by confounders. Emergency dialysis start was strongly associated with early mortality on dialysis.

Adverse factors were age, amyloidosis, ischaemic heart disease, convulsions, and acute presentation. Beneficial variables were male sex, parenthood, pyelonephritis, and residence in Leicestershire. By correcting for the influence of these variables and using time-dependent treatment co-variates, the bias adjusted estimates of the relative risk of death were 1 for patients on CAPD, 1.30 for those on haemodialysis, and 1.09 for patients who received transplants. These risks do not differ significantly from one another and suggest that CAPD is at least as effective as haemodialysis or transplantation at preserving life."

These positive studies and interventions have subsequently been brought together into \"bundles\" of care. This rush to change clinicians' practice has often been with little regard for the context in which the evidence was generated and the problems created by the difference between efficacy and effectiveness. This methodology created a bypass mechanism through which implementation of a package of interventions could be fast-tracked to a much larger group of critically ill patients that differ significantly from those in whom the evidence was generated, without being validated as a bundle. The risk of this process is that the bundle tools will be used for issues such as quality control, performance evaluation, and legal and regulatory purposes without the necessary background of robust validation studies. This has resulted in a \"two-weight, two-measures\" situation that needs to be resolved to avoid the risk of taking interventions completely out of the context in which the positive results were generated and putting patients and professionals at risk of being harmed by the package of interventions."

Two additional studies reported the effect of an oral antioxidant inflammation modulator in patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), and post-hoc findings from a subgroup of people with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥125 μmol/L) respectively. Interventions included different doses of vitamin E (two studies); multiple antioxidant therapy (three studies); co-enzyme Q (one study); acetylcysteine (one study); bardoxolone methyl (one study); and human recombinant superoxide dismutase (two studies).Compared with placebo, antioxidant therapy showed no clear overall effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.27; P = 0.71); all-cause mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14; P = 0.48); cardiovascular disease (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18; P = 0.24); coronary heart disease (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.23; P = 0.22); cerebrovascular disease (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.32; P = 0.63); or peripheral vascular disease (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.12; P = 0.10). Subgroup analyses found no evidence of significant heterogeneity based on proportions of males (P = 0.99) or diabetes (P = 0.87) for cardiovascular disease.

Significant benefit was conferred by antioxidant therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention in dialysis patients (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; P = 0.001), although no effect was observed in CKD patients (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.32; P = 0.63).Antioxidant therapy was found to significantly reduce development of end-stage of kidney disease (ESKD) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.00; P = 0.05); lowered serum creatinine levels (MD 1.10 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.81; P = 0.003); and improved creatinine clearance (MD 14.53 mL/min, 95% CI 1.20 to 27.86; P = 0.03). Serious adverse events were not significantly increased by antioxidants (RR 2.26, 95% CI 0.74 to 6.95; P = 0.15).Risk of bias was assessed for all studies. Studies that were classified as unclear for random sequence generation or allocation concealment reported significant benefits from antioxidant therapy (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; P = 0.001) compared with studies at low risk of bias (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.32; P = 0.63).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although antioxidant therapy does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death or major cardiovascular events in people with CKD, it is possible that some benefit may be present, particularly in those on dialysis. However, the small size and generally suboptimal quality of the included studies highlighted the need for sufficiently powered studies to confirm this possibility. Current evidence suggests that antioxidant therapy in predialysis CKD patients may prevent progression to ESKD; this finding was however based on a very small number of events. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed for confirmation. Appropriately powered studies are needed to reliably assess the effects of antioxidant therapy in people with CKD."

Patients in GERAS were receiving treatment as part of standard care.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements:\n        \n      \n      Between-group differences for changes from baseline over 36 months in cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were assessed using models stratified by propensity score.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, patients and caregivers participating in GERAS were significantly older than those in the EXPEDITION studies, and the GERAS patient cohort had fewer years of education and a shorter time since diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The baseline mean Mini-Mental State Examination score of the GERAS cohort was significantly higher (indicating better cognition) than that of patients receiving placebo or active treatment in the pooled EXPEDITION studies Baseline functional ability scores were significantly lower for the GERAS cohort, indicating poorer functioning. Propensity score stratification achieved a good balance in the baseline variables between GERAS and the two EXPEDITION arms. Over 18 months, least squares mean changes from baseline in outcome measures were similar in the GERAS cohort and the pooled placebo groups from the randomized controlled trials. Also, the 18-month results for the comparison between the GERAS cohort and the pooled active treatment groups from the randomized controlled trials were generally similar to those reported for the comparison with the control group in the randomized trial. Comparison of active treatment (EXPEDITION-EXT) and observational study (GERAS, as proxy control) results over 36 months of the open-label trial showed a significantly smaller decline in activities of daily living (instrumental and basic) in the active treatment group, reflecting better functioning, but no between-group differences at 36 months for cognitive function or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Comparing results from clinical trials and observational studies (real-world data) may be a useful methodological approach for informing long-term outcomes in Alzheimer's disease drug development and could be used to inform health economic modeling. Further research using this methodological approach is needed."
