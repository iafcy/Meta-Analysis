Results
1 707 594 records were available in the Praeventis neonatal
screening database for the study period. 1 599 547 singleton
neonates were included in our analysis (figure 1).
Characteristics of this population are shown in table 1.
Cross-validation against Perined data for selected years
(2011, 2014, and 2017) showed that babies born at the lowest
gestational ages and those with the lowest birthweights
