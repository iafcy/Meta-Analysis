level-III delays.
Results: A significant difference in the rate of stillbirths was found among cases
(37.4/1000) and controls (29.9/1000) (P = 0.045). Abruption in normotensive women
was significantly higher in cases compared to controls (P = 0.03). Modifiable factors
or preventable causes were noted in 76.1% of cases and 59.6% of controls; the differ-
ence was highly significant (P < 0.001, relative risk [RR] 1.8). Level-II delays or delays
in reaching the hospital for delivery due to lack of transport were observed in 12.7%
of cases compared to none in controls (P < 0.006, RR 47.7). Level-III delays or delays in
providing care at the facility were observed in 31.3% of cases and 11.5% of controls
(P < 0.001, RR 2.7).
Conclusion: Although there was no difference in causes of stillbirth between cases
and controls, level-II and level-III delays were significantly impacted by the pandemic,
leading to a higher rate of preventable stillbirths in pregnant women not infected with
COVID-19.
