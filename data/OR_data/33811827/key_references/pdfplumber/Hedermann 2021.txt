Short report
We also identified children from the period of 20 January–22
February, for years 2015–2020 (n=32 070), to analyse a period
before COVID-19 had been reported in Denmark.
To limit the influence of other determinants of premature
birth, we considered only singletons. Gestational age (GA) at
birth was categorised in completed weeks (table 1).
Likelihood ratio- based tests, estimates and CIs regarding
changes in composition of GA at birth categories between
the lockdown period and the consolidated reference period
for 2015–2019 were obtained from a series of logistic regres-
sions. First, we made an assessment of the odds of being born
during lockdown by GA category; that is, did the proportions in
different GA categories vary by time? Second, on finding such
variation, we estimated ORs of being in lockdown between each
GA category and the rest, to possibly pinpoint GA categories
with big relative changes. Frequency plots were used to illustrate
variations in GA between the birth cohorts studied. Statistical
analyses were run in SAS V.9.4 and R V.3.6.1.
RESULTS
We included 31 180 live singleton infants born in Denmark from
12 March to 14 April during 2015–2020. Births were distributed
into GA categories (table 1). The total number of singleton births
during lockdown in 2020 (n=5162) did not differ statistically
significantly from the other years (mean births per year: 5203.6,
SD ±221.4; p=0.24). We identified 1566 singleton premature
infants (5.02%).
Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the distri-
bution of GA in 2020 differed significantly from the previous
years (p=0.004). The proportion of extremely and very prema-
ture births (figure 1) was significantly different between the
2020 nationwide lockdown and the same calendar period from
the previous 5 years (p=0.003). However, the difference was
driven by a reduction in extremely premature to 0.19/1000
births during the 2020 nationwide lockdown compared with an
average of 2.19/1000 births for the previous years (p<0.001)
(table 1 and figure 1). No differences in birth rates were noted in
the January and February periods (figure 1, inset).
DISCUSSION
We report a potential effect of a nationwide lockdown on
extremely premature birth rates. Although it is too early to
draw definitive conclusions, we believe that these findings and
their potential implications merit immediate dissemination.
The COVID-19 lockdown has drastically changed our lives by
changing our working environment, reducing physical interac-
tions and increasing our focus on hygiene. This unusual situa-
tion is likely to have influenced several risk factors for premature
birth.
Increased systemic maternal inflammation is an element of
several risk factors, which, along with other immunologically
mediated processes, are believed to play a part in the preterm
birth syndrome.4 Possibly, the increased focus on hygiene, strict
physical distancing and home confinement have influenced the
overall inflammatory state of pregnant women.
The literature on a potential link between work and prema-
ture birth is contradictory.5 Although we currently have no
national details of their occurrences, the potential reduced
physical demands associated with work, travel and even reduc-
tions in minor accidents or other traumas could all be possible
contributors.
We found no significant differences in the rates of the very
premature, moderate premature, term or post- term births, which
