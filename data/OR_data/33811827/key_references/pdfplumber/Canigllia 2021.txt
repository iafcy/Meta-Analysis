COVID-19 lockdowns, although the
magnitude of our findings was smaller.
Our results differ from studies in Lon-
don, Nepal, and India that found an
increased risk of stillbirth during the
lockdown
period.5e7
The differences
between our findings and studies con-

low- and middle-income countries. In
addition,thepreviousstudiescompared
the lockdown period with the period
immediately before the lockdown or to
the same period in previous years, even
though adverse birth outcomes vary by
season and by calendar
year.33e35
For
example, several studies conducted in
Sub-Saharan Africa have found more

findings.
Clinicalimplications
Several possible explanations have been
proposed for the favorable impact of
COVID-19 lockdown on preterm birth
and birth of low birthweight infants,
including reducing inflammation,
decreasing the risk of influenza and
other infections, decreasing physical la-
bor, decreasing stress, and decreasing
exposure to air pollution.1,2,4 In
Botswana,wefoundthattheshelter-in-
place order successfully led to more
people staying put, which could have
reduced physical labor, exposure to in-
fections and air pollution, and some
sources of stress. The food insecurity
mitigation strategy implemented in
Botswana could have increased
