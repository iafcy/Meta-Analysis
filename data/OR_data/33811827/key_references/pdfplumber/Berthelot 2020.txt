effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms
(Wilks’ λ = 0.68, F 6,1400 = 108.50, P < .001, partial η2 = 0.32). According to post-hoc
analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive

in the COVID-19 cohort having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would
be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.
Conclusions: Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported
more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the
pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harm-
ful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently ob-
served upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical
surveillance.

The analysis yielded three domains of symptoms: mood and anxiety symptoms (including symptoms of anxiety/depression, negative affectivity, and
symptoms of PTSD), dissociative symptoms and low positive affectivity (see Supplementary material, Table S4). Three multiple regressions were next
performed with the COVID-19 women's clinical and sociodemographic characteristics as predictors and the factor scores as criteria. The significance
