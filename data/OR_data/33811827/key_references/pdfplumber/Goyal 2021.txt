Correspondence outcomes.

accessibility of health care, and complications during pregnancy, and compared with
data from the pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020.
Results: There was a reduction of 45.1% in institutional deliveries (P < 0.001), a per-
centage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and 2.5-fold rise in admission to
the intensive care unit of pregnant women during the pandemic. One-third of women
had inadequate antenatal visits. The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lock-
down and fear of contracting infection, resulting in 44.7% of pregnancies with com-
plications. Thirty-two symptomatic women who tested positive for COVID-19 were
managed at the center with good maternal and fetal outcomes.
Conclusion: Although COVID-19 does not directly affect pregnancy outcomes, it has
indirect adverse effects on maternal and child health. Emergency obstetric and an-
tenatal care are essential services to be continued with awareness of people while
maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene.
