demographic data, including age, area of residence, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean deliv-
eries, high-risk pregnancy follow-up, the last 30days admissions to the obstetrical emergency
department,gestationalage,chiefcomplaints,cervicaldilatation,cervicaleffacement,admissions

Results: During the pandemic outbreak, 398 women met study inclusion criteria, compared to
544 women in the matched period of the previous year. During the COVID-19 period, women
visited the obstetrical emergency department at a more advanced mean gestational age
(37.6±3.7 vs. 36.7±4.6, p¼.001). Higher proportions of women in the COVID-19 cohort pre-
sented in active labor, defined by cervical dilation of at least 5cm on admission to the labor
ward [37 (9.3%) vs 28 (5.1%), p¼.013)] and with premature rupture of membranes [82 (20.6%)
vs 60 (11.0%), p<.001)], and consequently with more admissions to the delivery room [198
(49.7%) vs 189 (34.7%), p<.001)]. We also recorded a significant increase in urgent obstetrical
events in the emergency department during the recorded COVID-19 pandemic [23 (5.8%) vs 12
(2.2%)), p¼.004]. However, the rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity did not change.
During the outbreak the proportion of visits during the night was higher than during the
matched period of the previous year: [138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)), p¼.008]. In a multivariate
logisticregression,thehigherrates ofadmissiontothedeliveryroomduringactivelaborandof
urgent events during the pandemic outbreak compared to the matched period in the previous
yearremainedstatisticallysignificant.
Conclusions: The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 caused a behavioral change among women
who presented to the obstetrical emergency department. This was characterized by delayed
arrival to the obstetrical emergency department and the delivery room, which led to a signifi-
cant increase in urgent andacute interventions. The change in behavior did not affect therates
