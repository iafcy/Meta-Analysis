New knowledge added by this study
• The delivery rate at a public hospital was reduced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
• Women who delivered in the public hospital had higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores during
the coronavirus alert period.
• A lower rate of non-pharmacological pain relief and a higher rate of pethidine usage were observed during
labour.
Implications for clinical practice or policy
• Obstetricians should be aware of the psychological burden of the COVID-19 outbreak on pregnant women,
especially in the immediate postpartum period.
• Alternative measures and effective intervention should be available to support these women during this
pandemic crisis.
