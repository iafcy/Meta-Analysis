study group), with an antecedent group of matched postpartum women (control group)
who delivered in the same period in 2019. Participants completed the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on the second day postpartum.
Results: The COVID‐19 study group (n=91) had significantly higher mean EPDS scores
compared with the control group (n=101) (8.5 ± 4.6 vs 6.34 ± 4.1; P<0.001). Furthermore,
28.6% of women in the COVID‐19 group had a global EPDS score above 12. Analysis of
three EPDS subscales revealed significantly higher scores among the COVID‐19 group
compared with the control group for anhedonia (0.60 ± 0.61 vs 0.19 ± 0.36; P<0.001)
and depression (0.58 ± 0.54 vs 0.35 ± 0.45; P=0.001).
Conclusions: Concerns about risk of exposure to COVID‐19, combined with quarantine
measures adopted during the COVID‐19 pandemic, adversely affected the thoughts and
emotions of new mothers, worsening depressive symptoms.
