among pregnant women during the pandemic (P = 0.002). Social environmental char-
acteristics of families showed impaired family cohesion, and increased levels of con-
flict and independence during the pandemic (all P < 0.05). The FES score for family
cohesion was negatively related with obsessive–compulsive, depression, anxiety, and
hostility symptoms, whereas that for conflict was positively related with these symp-
toms (all P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The mental health, sleep, and family environment of pregnant women
was impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential protective factors including
increased social support might help to mitigate long-lasting negative consequences.
