Abstract 
To explore the mental health consequences of COVID-19-related social restrictions on pregnant women living in low socioeco- 
nomic status. Prenatal women appearing at the Mount Sinai Hospital Ambulatory Practice were screened for mood symptom- 
atology from February 2, 2020, through June 12, 2020. An improvement in prenatal mood was observed following social 
restrictions compared to before the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 remains largely unknown and may be useful towards 
understanding the needs of pregnant women living in poverty. 


Addressing the mental health needs of pregnant women dur- 
ing the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an 
increasing concern among obstetricians and mental health cli- 
nicians. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll 
(2020), the majority of adults report their lives have been 
disrupted by the virus (84%), and nearly half (45%) report 
their mental health has been negatively impacted. While mi- 
nority women living in low socioeconomic status (SES) are 
among the most vulnerable for mood disruption during preg- 
nancy (Shakeel et al. 2015), how the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and accompanying social restrictions, may impact this popu- 
lation remains unknown.

This study, therefore, aimed to explore how social restric- 
tions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be 
impacting prenatal women living in low SES. The results of 
this exploration will help better understand the needs of wom- 
en in poverty, both during the pandemic and thereafter. 

In 2011, the Mount Sinai Hospital Obstetrics & Gynecology 
Ambulatory Practice initiated the first large-scale universal 
symptomatology screening for perinatal mood utilizing clini- 
cal decision support tied into electronic medical records 
(Loudon et al. 2016). In February of 2020, to further improve 
clinical services, the assessment of mood at a woman’s first 
prenatal visit was added. 

The study cohort consisted of the entire population of women 
who appeared for their first prenatal appointment at the Mount 
Sinai Hospital OB/GYN Ambulatory Practice between February 
3, 2020, and June 12, 2020. The Ambulatory Practice serves a 
population of primarily Hispanic and African-American minority 
women (90%) who reside in the inner city. The remaining 10% 
of women self-identify as Asian, Caucasian, Filipino, Indian, 
Islander, Native American, and “unknown.” Approximately

70% of the women reported being single or unmarried at their 
first preterm appointment, and 90% were enrolled in a US 
government–funded healthcare plan. 

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al. 
1987) was provided to all women as a screen for prenatal 
mood dysregulation. The EPDS is a ten-item self-report mul- 
tidimensional instrument, validated in over 36 languages, ca- 
pable of assessing symptoms associated with depression and 
anxiety using a scale of 0–30. Initially designed to assess 
postpartum mood, the EPDS effectively assesses mood 
throughout pregnancy (Meijer et al. 2014). When used as a 
first step in screening for significant mood changes or when 
used in a retrospective study for statistical analysis, the rec- 
ommended cutoff score of ≥ 9 indicates symptomatology con- 
sistent with possible depression, whereas a cutoff score of ≥ 
12 indicates probable depression, with a sensitivity of 86%, 
and a specificity of 78% (Cox et al. 1987). Whenever possible, 
assessments were provided in the patient’s primary language. 

The patient’s date of service and EPDS score was downloaded 
directly from the Mount Sinai Hospital network and imported 
into SAS 9.2 for analysis. To accomplish the study aims, two 
separate analyses were run. First, women were divided into 
groups of those screened before and those after New York’s 
March 12, 2020, ban on large gatherings, and second, those 
who appeared and were screened during the 6 weeks before 
imposing social restrictions (February 2, 2020-March 11, 
2020) and those appearing and screened during the last 
6 weeks of available data (May 4, 2020–June 12, 2020). 
All work was performed in compliance with the Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine Program for the Protection of 
Human Subjects and in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) secu- 
rity rule guidelines enacted in 2003. 

Of the 488 women who appeared for their first prenatal ap- 
pointment between February 3, 2020, and June 12, 2020, 485 
women (ages 16–40 years) had recorded EPDS scores; three 
women declined EPDS screening. Of the women who com- 
pleted the EPDS, 406 (83.7%) reported some change of mood 
over the past 2 weeks (EPDS ≥ 1), 73 women (15.1%) had a 
score ≥ 9, and 40 women (8.2%) had a score ≥ 12 (mean = 4.7, 
median = 4, range = 0–22, SD = 4.2). While there was no sig- 
nificant difference observed in mean EPDS scores between 
women screened before (n = 153; mean = 5.0, median = 4, 
range = 0–21, SD = 4.4) and following (n = 332; mean = 4.5,

strictions, t(483) = 1.16, p = 0.25, n.s., a significant difference 
in EPDS scores were observed between those women who 
appeared for their first prenatal appointment in the 6 weeks 
prior to restrictions (n = 154; mean = 5.0, median = 4, range = 
0–21, SD = 4.4) compared with those who appeared the last 
6 weeks of available data, May 4, 2020–June 12, 2020 (n = 
155; mean = 3.9, median = 3, range = 0–14, SD = 3.6), 
t(307) = 2.51, p < 0.01; corresponding to restrictions of 
schools and nonessential business. Notably, this difference is 
related to decreased symptomatology. (Fig. 1). 

Women living in low socioeconomic status in New York City 
demonstrated an improvement in mood in light of the implemen- 
tation of social restrictions in New York City secondary to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic’s effects on pregnant 
women are of considerable concern among clinicians who treat 
pregnant women, surprisingly, symptoms of mood dysregulation 
for minority women of low SES appeared to decline. 
On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization de- 
clared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic, and 
community-wide restrictions closing school and non-essential 
business were mandated across New York State. Although 
considerable efforts have focused on the medical challenges 
associated with COVID-19, less attention has been focused 
on the mental health implications of the “shut-down” during 
pregnancy. That we found lower rates of depression symptom- 
atology among minority women is consistent with an increas- 
ing body of research demonstrating minority women living in 
low socioeconomic status may be less likely to suffer from 
acute episodes of depression (Bailey et al. 2019), may be more 
resilient to effects of stressful life events (Assari and Lankarani 
2016), and may also be more emotionally resilient in the face of 
opportunistic illness (Dale and Safren 2018). Equally notable is 
that some consequences of imposed social restrictions may 
have had unexpected positive effects on health and wellbeing 
(see Nelson 2020), specifically among those living in lower 
SES. For example, the well-understood social and economic 
factors which disproportionately impact mothers living in low 
SES such as unavailable childcare, limited partner and family 
support, and reduced time flexibility secondary to formal and 
informal employment obligations, which undoubtedly play a 
role in contributing to poorer maternal mental health outcomes 
(Beeber et al. 2008), may have, in many cases, been ameliorat- 
ed in light of the imposed social restrictions. 
While these findings are important towards understanding 
the early maternal needs of those living in poverty, we recog- 
nize some critical limitations. First, the assessment used, the 
EPDS, a validated measure of mood change throughout preg- 
nancy, may not be sensitive enough to detect symptoms asso- 
ciated specifically with COVID-19 pandemic concerns. 
However, the specificity and sensitivity to general symptoms 
of both anxiety (Matthey, 2008) and mood (Cox et al. 1987) as 


measured by the EPDS are high. Second, we did not analyze 
the data using demographic factors as covariates. Because 
there may be a subgroup of pregnant women disproportionally 
experiencing mood changes, this will need to be further ex- 
plored as the days of the pandemic continue, and the sample 
size increases, thereby allowing for appropriate statistical 
power to determine such differences. Similarly, given the 
Mount Sinai Hospital OB/GYN Ambulatory Practice’s 
prenatal EPDS screening program began shortly before 
the pandemic was announced, and as we presumably re- 
main in the early stages of the crisis, it is also possible that 
as the pandemic continues and concerns associated with 
extended unemployment intensify, anxiety and depression 
among this population will increase. Finally, a problem 
universal to all health registry–based studies is that out- 
come variables may only represent treatment-seeking be- 
havior, as opposed to incidence. That is, we can only assess 
those women who chose to come for their appointments, and 
given the increased concern of COVID-19 in medical settings, 
we realize the most anxious and concerned prenatal women 
may have chosen not to attend their appointments for fear of 
contracting the virus. Such an occurrence would result in an 
underestimation of symptoms and could explain why EPDS 
scores appeared to improve. To explore this possibility, we 
conducted a post hoc analysis of prenatal appointment atten- 
dance for each week to determine if there was a significant 
difference after restrictions were implemented. No difference 
was observed (Fig. 2). 
Minority women living in low SES are among the most 
vulnerable for prenatal mood disruption. However, many 
of the social and economic disparities among those living 
in lower SES, which likely also play a contributing role to 
poorer maternal health outcomes, may have been reduced 
as a result of imposed social restrictions. That we found a 
decrease in symptomatology is also consistent with a 
recent Gallop Panel (2020) reporting that many 
Americans are experiencing less worry than they had ear- 
lier in the pandemic. While these findings have implica- 
tions for urban health policy, as the pandemic continues, 
and as economic and employment concerns worsen, our 
results might prove temporary. Certainly, because we are 
still in the early stages of the pandemic and as maternal 
stress, anxiety, and depression may adversely affect the 
infant’s long-term well-being (Kinsella and Monk 2009), 
monitoring pregnant women for emotional dysregulation 
continues to warrant special attention.
