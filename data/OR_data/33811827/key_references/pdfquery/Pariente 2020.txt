Abstract 
The aim of the current study was to assess the risk for post-partum depression among women delivering during the COVID-19 
pandemic as compared to the risk among women delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was performed among 
women delivering singletons at term which were recruited in the maternity wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. Recruitment 
was done during the COVID-19 strict isolation period (March 18 and April 29, 2020). Women delivering during the COVID-19 
pandemic completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the results were compared to women delivering at the 
same medical center before the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to control for potential 
confounders. A total of 223 women who delivered during the COVID-19 strict isolation period were recruited. Women delivering 
during the COVID-19 pandemic had lower risk of having a high (> 10) or very high (≥ 13) EPDS score as compared with women 
delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic (16.7% vs 31.3%, p = 0.002, and 6.8% vs 15.2%, p = 0.014, for EPDS ≥ 10 and EPDS ≥ 
13, respectively). These results remained similar in the multivariable logistic regression models, for both EPDS score ≥ 10 and EPDS 
score ≥ 13, while controlling for maternal age, ethnicity, marital status, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 
0.23–0.70, p = 0.001 and adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.15–0.74, p = 0.007 for EPDS score > 10 and > 13, respectively). In our 
population, delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with lower risk of post-partum depression. 


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first 
recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China’s 
Hubei province [https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/

situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn= 
20a99c10_4]. The disease has since spread worldwide, 
resulting in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (Borges do 
Nascimento et al. 2020). In January 2020, it was recognized 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a major public 
health concern. As a result of this expeditious epidemic, gov- 
ernments and public health authorities urgently needed guid- 
ance and actionable information on effective public health in- 
terventions in order to protect the public health. 
A sudden outbreak of a disease may pose threat to the men- 
tal health of affected people (Maunder et al. 2003).Previous 
epidemiological studies that assessed mental health among 
the survivors of the 2003 SARS epidemic have found higher 
rates of depression, anxiety, panic attack, psychomotor excite- 
ment, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tenden- 
cy among the survivors (Maunder et al. 2003). Unavailability 
of a vaccine, unpredictability of the situation, and quarantine 
for indefinite period of time have all been associated with 



stressful feelings, which have been found to increase common 
mental health problems such as anxiety and depression (Dar 
et al. 2017). Moreover, the overflow of information about the 
COVID-19 epidemic on social media also triggers anxiety that 
may lead to extreme behavior and even suicidal ideations 
(Goyal et al. 2020). 
To date, little has been published regarding mental health 
problems due to outbreak of COVID-19 and mass isolation. A 
Chinese study has recently assessed the mental health status of 
Chinese people from Hubei province during the COVID-19 
pandemic. The study demonstrated higher rates of anxiety, 
depression, and alcohol consumption among the people of 
Hubei province during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ahmed 
et al. 2020). A cross-sectional study demonstrated that people 
with suspected COVID-19 symptoms had higher risk for de- 
pression and lower health-related quality of life (Nguyen et al. 
2020). Another cross-sectional study, which assessed the risk 
for depression among pregnant women hospitalized during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrated that women hospital- 
ized at the high-risk pregnancy unit during the COVID-19 
strict isolation period were not at increased risk for depression, 
as compared to women hospitalized before the COVID-19 
pandemic (Sade et al. 2020). One particular group that might 
be negatively affected by the pandemic is pregnant women 
and women during the post-partum period, since stress and 
anxiety are also thought to have a significant effect on preg- 
nancy outcomes (Baibazarova et al. 2013; Avraham et al. 
2020). Nevertheless, scarce data exist regarding maternal 
post-partum depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Pregnancy and the post-partum period are susceptible 
times for onset or relapse of mental illness, with depres- 
sion and anxiety being the most common psychiatric dis- 
orders during these periods (Pavlov et al. 2014; Hermon 
et al. 2019). The estimated prevalence of post-partum uni- 
polar major depression varies widely, depending upon the 
population studied, whether post-partum depression was 
assessed in the community or in clinical settings and 
whether depression was identified through self-report 
measures or clinical interviews (Norhayati et al. 2015). 
Although debatable, accumulating data suggest depressive 
symptoms have a profound negative impact on pregnancy 
and post-partum period (Yedid Sion et al. 2016; Howard 
et al. 2014). 
With little existing published data, specifically focusing on 
post-partum depression among women delivering during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and in light of its potential adverse 
effect on both the mother and the infant, we aimed to assess 
the incidence of increased risk for post-partum depression in 
women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic as com- 
pared with the incidence of increased risk for post-partum 
depression among women delivering before the COVID-19 
pandemic. 


The first Israeli cases of coronavirus were diagnosed on 
February 21st among local citizens in contact with tourists from 
western Pacific and returning travelers. According to the WHO 
report from May 12, 16,526 cases have been diagnosed in Israel 
since then. In late February, aiming to minimize person-to- 
person transmission, the Israeli Ministry of health has recom- 
mended that all citizens returning from eastern countries stay 
quarantined for 14 days following their return. These recom- 
mendations have since been extended, to comprise all citizens 
returning from abroad. Since March 12th, the early childhood, 
school systems, and higher education programs have closed 
down, and since then, public transportation and social isolation 
have progressively been restricted. These early restrictions re- 
sulted in low rates of exposure and very low rates of mortality 
through COVID 19. Since March 2020, the Israeli Ministry of 
health has been using satellite information and cellular phone 
location, to identify people that should be quarantined due to 
being in close proximity with diagnosed cases. These people 
received automated text messages informing them to monitor 
themselves for possible symptoms, to stay quarantined, and to 
contact a health care provider in case any symptoms occur. 

Eligible women were healthy women who had been confined 
during lockdown, with a singleton pregnancy, who delivered a 
healthy baby at term (more than 37 gestational weeks), at the 
maternity ward of the Soroka University Medical Center 
(SUMC), the sole medical center in the southern part of Israel 
(the Negev region). In the Negev, reside two societies, Jewish 
and Bedouin Arabs, which have different cultural and 
sociodemographic characteristics. The Bedouin minority is a 
Muslim community, which suffers from an indigent economic 
base. The Bedouins are generally abiding in small towns 
scattered throughout the desert; however, a transition to a more 
urbanized way of living has been seen in the past two decades. 
The Bedouin tradition attributes great importance to familial and 
tribal cohesiveness and to fertility. Consanguineous marriages 
are common (approximately 40% of all marriages are between 
first cousins and another 20% between more remote family rel- 
atives). Like all Israeli citizens, Bedouins are covered by National 
Health Insurance and receive maternal and child preventive ser- 
vices, including prenatal and postnatal care (Abu-Ganem et al. 
2012; Sheiner et al. 1998). Recruitment and data collection were 
done during the COVID-19 strict isolation period, between 
March 18 and April 29, 2020. Women who delivered between 
November 2016 and April 2017, before the COVID 19 pandem- 
ic, served as the comparison group. SUMC, located in southern 
Israel, is the largest country birth center, with > 17,000 births a 


year in recent years. The study was approved by the SUMC IRB 
Committee (IRB approval # 0079-20-SOR). 

A cohort study was performed. Women delivering during the 
COVID-19 pandemic were compared to historic unexposed 
group delivering singletons at term, at the same medical center, 
before the COVID-19 pandemic (Mazor et al. 2019). Each wom- 
an was recruited and participated at a single time point (fixed 
estimate of time). Women were approached by the research team 
on day 2 post-partum and were invited to participate, following 
an oral and written explanation on the study course and purpose. 
Eligible women were asked to complete the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale (EPDS) questionnaire. Every day during the 
time frame of the study, the research team handed out self- 
reported questionnaires to all women who met the inclusion 
criteria. All hospitalized women were approached. Each woman 
from both the exposed and the comparison group answered ques- 
tions regarding her socioeconomic state, obstetrical history, cur- 
rent pregnancy course, and completed the EPDS questionnaire 
during hospitalization at the maternity ward. This screening test, 
established by Cox et al. in 1987 (Cox et al. 1987), was devel- 
oped for diagnosing pregnant and post-partum women who are 
at high risk for depression. This questionnaire is widely used 
based on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology 
(ACOG) recommendations (Committee Opinion No 2018).The 
questionnaire consists of 10 self-completed questions regarding 
mood in the past week. The scores in each question are summed, 
and a final score of < 10 is defined as low risk for depression. A 
score of ≥ 10 defines a person at risk for depression and a score 
of ≥ 13 defines a person at higher risk for depression (Cox et al. 
1987). Positive suicidal ideation was defined as any positive 
answer to question number 10 (“The thought of harming myself 
has occurred to me”) in the EDPS questionnaire. Background 
variables assessed included maternal demographic and pregnan- 
cy data, as well as delivery course and immediate outcome. Data 
were collected in a cross-sectional format. 

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0. 
Comparison of continuous variables was performed using 
Student’s t test and chi-square test was used to examine differ- 
ences in the distribution of categorical variables. Multivariable 
logistic regression models were constructed to examine the re- 
lationship between the independent and dependent variables, 
while adjusting for confounding. The strategy for model build- 
ing was as follows: Background characteristics were compared 
between the study groups (exposed and unexposed women). 
Variables associated with the exposure (i.e., were different be- 
tween the study groups) were suspected as confounding vari- 
ables, and they were tested in the multivariable models, to 
determine whether they are also associated with the outcome 
variable, and are therefore possibly confounding the association 
between the exposure and the outcome. A suspected confound- 
ing variable included the marital status. Maternal age and eth- 
nicity are both variables with clinical significance. Ethnicity in 
our study population represents social, cultural, educational, and 
religious differences between the groups, which have been 
known to affect EPDS scores (Abu-Ganem et al. 2012; 
Sheiner et al. 1998). Interactions between the independent var- 
iables and outcome were examined. No interactions between the 
independent variables and exposure were found. 

A total of 223 women who delivered during the COVID-19 
strict isolation period, and 123 women who delivered before 
the COVID 19 pandemic, were included in the study. 
Table 1 summarizes maternal demographic features and preg- 
nancy outcomes of both groups. Mean maternal age was com- 
parable between the groups (29.1 ± 5.1 vs 28.3 ± 5.0 for mother 
delivering during and before the COVID-19 pandemic, respec- 
tively, p = 0.816), as was ethnicity and gravidity. No significant 
differences were noted between the groups in terms of pregnancy 
course and outcome, including complication rates (gestational 
diabetes and preeclampsia) and neonatal characteristics. 
Maternal possible depression score is presented in Table 2. 
Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic had lower 
risk of having a high (≥ 10) EPDS score compared to women 
delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic (16.7% vs 31.3%, 
p = 0.002). Likewise, women delivering during the COVID- 
19 pandemic had lower risk of having a very high (≥ 13) 
EPDS score compared to women delivering before the 
COVID-19 pandemic (6.8% vs 15.2%, p = 0.014). Rates of 
positive suicidal ideations (according to question number 10 
in the EPDS questionnaire) were comparable between the 
groups (0.5% vs 0.9%, p = 0.621). 
Using multivariable logistic regression models, controlling 
for maternal age, ethnicity, marital status, and adverse preg- 
nancy outcomes, delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic 
was independently associated with lower risk for maternal 
possible depression according to both EPDS score ≥ 10 and 
EPDS score ≥ 13 (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.23–0.70, p = 
0.001 and adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.15–0.74, p = 0.007 for 
EPDS score ≥ 10 and ≥ 13, respectively (Table 3).

background characteristics or pregnancy complications. 

In recent years, there has been growing research into the psy- 
chopathological consequences of collectively experienced 
traumatic events including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, 
and pandemics, with depressive disorders most studied after 
disasters (Maunder et al. 2003; Ahmed et al. 2020; Nguyen

et al. 2020; Sade et al. 2020; Baibazarova et al. 2013; 
Avraham et al. 2020; North and Pfefferbaum 2013). Most 
studies reported elevated rates of depressive and other mental 
disorders not only among individuals who directly experi- 
enced traumatic events linked to the disaster but also among 
the general population who were living in the area when the 
disaster occurred (North and Pfefferbaum 2013; Foa et al. 
2006). From an academic point of view, several theories 
may explain the association between natural disaster and men- 
tal health problems. The first is that natural disasters may lead 
to consequential negative life events such as death of a family 
member or loss of employment. The second concerns the im- 
mediate traumatic exposure to the natural disaster that may be 
both life-threatening and frightening (Perkonigg et al. 2000). 
Studies performed following both natural disasters and 
non-natural disasters such as times of war and terror dem- 
onstrated higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in- 
cluding delivering newborns with low birth weight, pre- 
term births, and other adverse outcomes associated with 
the psychological stress (Wainstock et al. 2014; Engel 
et al. 2005; Buzaglo et al. 2012) or depression (Hermon 
et al. 2019; Yedid Sion et al. 2016). Most research has 
focused on investigating pregnancy outcomes associated 
with collectively experienced traumatic events (Dancause 
et al. 2011; Nugent et al. 2011). However, less is known 
regarding emotional consequences of exposure of preg- 
nant and post-partum women to a major disaster.

One study conducted in Nepal investigated the risk and 
protective factors for clinically significant symptoms of ante- 
natal common mental disorders among women who experi- 
enced the 2015 Nepal earthquakes during pregnancy (Khatri 
et al. 2018).Using the EPDS score, the authors found higher 
risk for clinically significant mental disorders among pregnant 
women who experienced the earthquake. Having an en- 
couraging partner and income-generating work were 
found to be protective factors against common mental 
disorders among pregnant women experiencing the 
earthquake (Buzaglo et al. 2012). 
Harville et al. examined the influence of Hurricane Katrina 
on mental health in a group of post-partum women from 
southern Louisiana (Harville et al. 2009).The authors conclud- 
ed that the overall rates of depression and PTSD did not seem 
to be higher than in studies of the general population (Harville 
et al. 2009). The same group concluded that many pregnant 
and post-partum women are resilient from the mental health 
consequences of disaster, and even perceive benefits after a 
traumatic experience (Harville et al. 2010). 

Our study demonstrated lower rates of depression during the 
immediate post-partum period among women delivering dur- 
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several possible ex- 
planations for the negative association between delivery dur- 
ing the strict isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
maternal depression seen in our study. First, since the study 
was performed during the strict quarantine, mothers gained 
greater support from close family members. Many significant 
others did not go to work or worked from home, which 
allowed them the opportunity to better support the women. 
Families stayed at home together, which increased family co- 
hesiveness. Since the virus spreads primarily through droplets, 
and due to its high contamination potential, the Israeli 
Ministry of health allowed an earlier discharge from maternity 
ward post-partum. It is reasonable to assume that shorter hos- 
pital stay would be associated with lower risk for post-partum 
depression (Brockington 2004). Second, the extent of expo- 
sure to the adverse consequences may play a critical role in the 
emotional response to a disaster (Fergusson et al. 2014). Even 
though large societies have been socially isolated in order to 
contain the virus spread throughout the southern part of the 
country, the extent of contamination was lower compared to 
other parts of the country. Another possible explanation for 
the lower rates could be that women did not have to go out into 
society and confront day to day realities. The lower rates may 
also be explained by relief of the women that their infant was 
healthy. Finally, many disaster victims do not develop short- 
or long-term psychopathology (Bonanno et al. 2006). As was 
noted previously, many people are resilient after terrible 
events, and even the worst events may have a positive side 
(Harville et al. 2010). It is known that a close maternal-fetal 
attachment buffers post-partum symptoms of anxiety, partially 
mediated through post-partum bonding and partnership satis- 
faction (Matthies et al. 2020), and the pandemic era might 
increase such bonding. Resilience from the mental health con- 
sequences of a disaster has been demonstrated among preg- 
nant and post-partum women, and has been associated, among 
other things, with having a partner (Khatri et al. 2018; Harville 
et al. 2009). Our study found significant difference in the 
marital status between the two populations, a factor 
which may partially explain the lower prevalence of 
depression among women who delivered during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, although this has been controlled 
for in the multivariable model. 

More studies should be done in order to shed some more light 
on the association between delivering during the COVID-19 
pandemic and post-partum depression as well as to assess the 
prevalence of anxiety and other mental disorders among post- 


partum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. One specific 
matter of interest will be to assess late-onset post-partum de- 
pression, 6–12 months after the end of the isolation period. 

Strengths of the study include the use of standardized mental 
health instrument and a systematic recruitment of an unselect- 
ed population. However, our study has several limitations. 
There is reason to believe that natural disasters may lead to 
an increased risk for mental health problems due to both the 
immediate impacts of the disaster and consequential life 
events experienced following the disaster and that adequate 
assessment of disaster exposure must take all of these into 
consideration. There is a growing literature that suggests it is 
important to assess both categorical and dimensional aspects 
of mental disorders particularly as there may be individuals 
who display symptoms of disorder (including impairment) 
and experience significant distress but whose symptoms do 
not meet diagnostic criteria. Another limitation concerns 
post-event non-traumatic stressors. Our study assessed the 
women during the COVID-19 pandemic. As post-event non- 
traumatic stressors are associated with the risk of depression, 
elevated prevalence of depression after disasters does not rest 
on the experience of specific traumatic events. Rather, it may 
rest on elevated exposure to stressors in the post-disaster con- 
text (Kessler 1997). Moreover, leading theories about the 
emergence of depression emphasize that depression often oc- 
curs following repeated stressors or feelings of hopelessness, 
but the study window is limited and occurs at the onset of the 
pandemic. It may not be enough time for depression to devel- 
op. Nevertheless, the study’s main purpose was to assess risk 
for depression, rather than depression itself. As our study oc- 
curred at the onset of the pandemic, more studies should be 
taken in the future during later outbreaks of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Another limitation of our study relates to the pos- 
sible seasonality effects on the studied association, since ex- 
posed and unexposed were recruited in different season, due 
to the COVID-19 exposure window. Finally, when using the 
EPDS to screen for post-partum depression, investigators 
should realize that the instrument does not exclusively reflect 
the risk for post-partum depression, as a positive result at an 
early stage of the post-partum period may be associated with 
post-partum blues rather than depression. Nevertheless, as 
both, the exposed and the control groups, were given in the 
EPDS questionnaire on the same day post-partum, we would 
expect same rates of association with post-partum blues. 

In conclusion, our study found that post-partum women de- 
livering during the COVID-19 pandemic have lower risk for 
depression compared to the comparison group of women not 
delivering during the pandemic.
