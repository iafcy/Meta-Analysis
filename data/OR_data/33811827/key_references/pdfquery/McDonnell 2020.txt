Objective: To explore any apparent trends in maternal or neonatal outcomes during the Covid-19 
pandemic by comparing the maternity outcomes before, during and after the pandemic. 
Study design: A retrospective review was performed of maternity statistics recorded on the hospital 
database of a large tertiary referral centre in Dublin with over 8000 deliveries per annum from 1st 
January to 31st July 2020. This time period represented the months prior to, during the peak and 
following the pandemic in Ireland. 
Results: There was no correlation between the monthly number of Covid deaths and the monthly number 
of perinatal deaths (r = 0.465, NS), preterm births (r = 0.339, NS) or hypertensive pregnancies (r = 0.48, 
NS). 
Compared to the combined numbers for the same month in 2018 and 2019, there were no signiﬁcant 
changes in perinatal deaths or preterm births in the months when Covid deaths were at their height. The 
rate of preterm birth was signiﬁcantly less common in January-July 2020 compared to January-July in 
2018/2019 (7.4 % v 8.6 %, chi-sq 4.53, P = 0.03). 
Conclusion: The was no evidence of a negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on maternity services, as 
demonstrated by maternal and neonatal outcomes. 


Covid-19 has been described as the pandemic of the century [1]. 
The Republic of Ireland (ROI) has been successful in its endeavour 
to 
 and reduce transmission of the virus through 
strict public health measures overseen by the National Public 
ﬁrst detected case of SARS 
Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The 
CoV2 in the Republic of Ireland was reported on 29th February 
2020. Schools, colleges and childcare facilities were closed on 12th 
March followed by a nationally enforced 
 on 27th March 
which saw government-mandated closure of all non-essential 
businesses, restricted non-essential journeys and advised isolation 
of vulnerable individuals. Ireland’s strategy is synchronous with 
global strategies endorsed by the World Health Organisation and 
European Centre for Disease Control. During the containment 
phase, a policy of case identiﬁcation, testing and contact tracing

was implemented. The country is now in the delay phase, with 
successful suppression of the virus in the community, although 
‘second wave [2,3]. Table 1 
concern mounts 
represents the incidence of and deaths with SARS-CoV2 in the 
Republic of 
July 2020. There was 
widespread transmission and diagnosis of the virus, and virus- 
related deaths from March, peaking in April and declining sharply 
thereafter. 



The initial response to the virus saw a radical overhaul of the 
Irish healthcare system in order to mitigate the impact of the 
pandemic on healthcare resources. Restrictions were placed on 
elective and outpatient services with a focus on maintaining 
emergent and essential clinical services [5]. As pregnancy is a time- 
limited condition, provision of maternity care is an essential 
service which continued to function throughout the pandemic, 
albeit with adjustment to care pathways [1,6,7]. Now in the delay 
phase, a retrospective analysis of the impact of the pandemic on 
maternity services is appropriate. It is possible that there are direct 
effects of the virus in pregnant women, but it is also plausible that 
there are subtle effects resulting from the change in service 
delivery, or possibly to due to maternal stress and anxiety arising 
during this period.

The time is right to explore any apparent trends in maternal or 
neonatal outcomes during this time period by comparing the 
maternity outcomes before, during and after the pandemic. 

This was a retrospective review of maternity outcomes over a 
7-month period in the largest provider of women and infants 
healthcare in the Republic of Ireland. The Coombe Women & 
Infants University Hospital (CWIUH) is a large, stand-alone 
Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Neonatal tertiary referral centre 
serving a static catchment area with approximately 8000 
deliveries per annum. All maternities are recorded on the 
hospital database that is used to generate a published annual 
report. Maternal and neonatal outcomes from 1st January to 
31st July 2020 were reviewed. This time period encompasses the 
time from the pre-pandemic phase, through the peak incidence 
of Covid-19 cases 
in Ireland, to the period where national 
lockdown measures were eased following successful contain- 
ment of the virus. 
The monthly number of covid deaths was correlated with 
monthly birth statistics (Pearsons correlation co-efﬁcient) to 
reveal any signiﬁcant associations with the progress and resolution 
of the pandemic. In addition, the monthly perinatal mortality and 
preterm birth statistics from 2018 and 2019 were combined and 
then analysed against the statistics from 2020 using chi-squared 
analysis or Fishers exact test as appropriate. 
The aim was to identify any statistically signiﬁcant trends in 
maternal or neonatal outcomes during this period and examine the 
impact of the pandemic on healthcare delivery. Hospital senior 
management authorised the collection and analysis of data from 
the hospital database. 



Fig. 1 demonstrates the perinatal death and preterm birth rate 
from January to July, contrasted with the number of Covid-19 
related deaths in the ROI in the same time period. 
There was no correlation between the monthly number of Covid 
<37 weeks 
deaths and the monthly number of preterm deliveries 
<26 weeks (r=(cid:1)0,32, p = NS) 
(r = 0.339, p = NS), preterm deliveries 
or with the monthly number of perinatal deaths (r = 0.465, p = NS). 
The mode of delivery did not show any signiﬁcant correlations 
but April (the month of highest Covid-related mortality) had the 
lowest normal delivery rate. The number of inductions of labour 
was negatively correlated with the number of Covid deaths 
(r=(cid:1)0.759, p 
 0.05) and the lowest labour induction rate was also 
seen in April. (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 

The diagnosis of antenatal complications such as hypertensive 
diseases of pregnancy occurred at the same rate pre-pandemic as 
in the months during the pandemic (Table 3). No difference was 
seen in the rate of intrapartum or postpartum complications, and 
low birthweight 
frequency 
throughout the study period (Table 4). 


There was no correlation in the rate of unbooked pregnancies, 
or infants born before arrival to hospital and the number of Covid 
deaths in the review period (Table 3). Disclosures of domestic 
violence at booking visit appear to be 
less during the peak 
pandemic period, although this was not found to be statistically 
signiﬁcant. 
Table 5 outlines the hospital statistics for the same months in 
2018 and 2019. If the 2018 and 2019 numbers are combined and 
compared to the same month in 2020, there were signiﬁcantly less 
preterm births in February 2020 and signiﬁcantly less perinatal 
deaths in July 2020, however neither of these months were during 
the peak pandemic period. In comparison to the preceding two 
years, the rate of preterm delivery over the 7 month period in 2020 
was signiﬁcantly less (7.4 % v 8.6 %, chi-sq 4.53, 1df, p = 0.03). 
In summary, there is no correlation between Covid deaths 
(representing the pandemic peak) and preterm births, perinatal 
mortality, mode of delivery or maternity complications across the 
months of January to July 2020. When 2020 monthly statistics are 
compared to 2018 and 2019 combined, there is an overall reduction 
in preterm births and more speciﬁcally, a difference observed in 
February 2020. There is a signiﬁcant reduction in perinatal deaths 
in July 2020 compared to July 2018 and 2019 combined but no 
difference 
in the overall perinatal mortality rate during the 
pandemic period reviewed compared with previous years.

There has been a wealth of data published on Covid-19 infection 
in pregnancy and our knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV2 on 
maternal and neonatal outcomes has rapidly evolved, with reports 
of perinatal transmission increasing [8,9]. In contrast, although 
much has been written regarding potential unintended adverse 
effects of the pandemic on provision of maternity services and the 
resulting impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes, there has 
been 
little actual data to support or refute these concerns,

particularly since many countries continue to experience wide- 
spread infection and so are not yet in a position to perform 
reﬂective analysis [7,10,11]. This study of overall hospital statistics 
compares monthly outcomes and relates them to the severity of 
the pandemic and also to the combined hospital statistics of the 
same month in 2018 and 2019. The severity of the pandemic was 
assessed by the number of Covid related deaths in the ROI. The 
number of Covid deaths rather than Covid-19 infection rate was 
used as a disease marker as it is a more reliable measure, being 
unaffected by testing availability, inaccuracies, delayed reporting 
and missing asymptomatic individuals. 
Published data suggests an increase in preterm births in Covid- 
19 affected pregnancies, the majority of which is iatrogenic due to 
maternal illness or fetal compromise [8,9]. A large population- 
based study in the UK by Knight et al. (2020) showed a 26 % 
preterm birth rate amongst Covid-19 affected pregnancies and 76 % 
of these were iatrogenic [9]. However, a regional maternity unit in 
Ireland has described a reduction in preterm deliveries of very low 
birth weight 
in their 
population. The authors postulated this resulted from a socio- 
environmental impact of mandated lockdown on pregnant women 
unaffected by Covid-19. The study is, however, based on a four 
month period from January to April 2020, which includes a 2 
ﬁrst diagnosed in Ireland 
month period from when SARS-CoV2 was 
(March and April), and a 6 week period of lockdown (from 12th 
March onwards) [12]. 

Yet data from our unit, with almost double the delivery rate and 
evaluating the complete course of the pandemic, does reveal a 
reduction in preterm deliveries in comparison to the same time 
period in the preceding two years. It could be reasoned that this 
may be secondary to social and health behaviours amongst the 
obstetric population in the midst of a pandemic with enforced 
lockdown. However, February 2020 was the only month individu- 
ally to demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant difference from the 
same month in the preceding two years, which was prior to the 
ﬁrst diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 in Ireland. The preterm delivery rate 
for March and April 2020 was not signiﬁcantly different from the 
same months 
in 2018 and 2019 and overall there was no 
correlation between the preterm delivery rate in 2020 and the 
peak pandemic period, represented by incidence of Covid-related 
deaths. One factor which warrants consideration is the impact of 
the newly enacted legislation on 1st January 2019 allowing for 
termination of pregnancy in limited circumstances in Ireland. 
Termination of pregnancies with chromosomal or congenital 
anomalies which may have been predisposed to either spontane- 
ous or iatrogenic preterm delivery may in part contribute to the 
noted reduction in preterm birth rate in 2020. 

in CWIUH remained stable 
throughout the peak of the pandemic, however there was a 
signiﬁcant reduction noted 
in comparison with 
previous years. In contrast, Khalil et al. (2020) compared birth 
trends in their London unit in a pre-pandemic and pandemic time 
period and found a signiﬁcantly increased incidence of stillbirth, 

none of which occurred in women diagnosed with Covid-19 [13]. 
However, the testing strategy in the UK at that time was limited to 
symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalisation and it is noted 
that surveillance data suggests up to 90 % asymptomatic infection 
rate among pregnant populations [13–16]. There 
is also no 
evidence of SARS-CoV2 testing of these women following the 
diagnosis of intrauterine fetal demise, nor postmortem testing of 
fetal or placental tissue. 

There was a negative correlation between the induction rate 
and the number of Covid deaths (p 
 0.05), with the lowest rate of 
inductions occurring in April (34 %), during the peak of Covid-19 
case diagnoses and deaths. This may demonstrate less obstetric 
intervention, however this is negated by the mode of delivery 
statistics which show April had the lowest rate of normal deliveries 
(49 %) and the highest rate of caesarean sections (37 %) in the seven 
month period. 

A statistically signiﬁcant decrease in hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy during the pandemic period was described in the 
study by Khalil et al. (2020). The authors hypothesised that this, 
together with 
incidence, may be 
increased stillbirth 
secondary to reduced antenatal surveillance or women 
less 
likely to attend hospital during the pandemic 
if unwell or 
concerns with fetal movements [13]. Worries regarding the 
possibility of missed antenatal complications were also raised by 
other publications, secondary to the rapid reconﬁguration of 
maternity services during the pandemic [7]. However, as shown 
in Table 4, there was no difference in pregnancy or delivery 
complications in the CWIUH during this time period. Antenatal 
visits continued with regular frequency and although anecdotally 
women may have been deterred from attending the hospital on 
an emergent basis, there was no demonstrable 
impact on 
pregnancy outcomes. 
Corbett et al. (2020), in a study performed in an obstetric 
ﬁrst two weeks of the pandemic delay phase 
population during the 
in Ireland, found that over half of women surveyed worried about 
their health often or all of the time, with 63 % reporting concern 
about their unborn baby. They reported an overall increased level 
of health anxiety in this population, which may explain why initial 
fears that women would be deterred from attending hospital or 
seeking emergent care in pregnancy have not been evidenced in 
our study [17]. There was no difference in unbooked pregnancies or 
infants born before arrival to hospital during the months pre- and 
post-pandemic peak or in the midst of it. 
Concern regarding an increase in domestic violence due to the 
effects of social isolation and enforced lockdown measures during 
the pandemic has been well-documented [18]. The Irish Govern- 
ment ran a campaign across television, radio and social media to 
reassure victims of domestic violence that supports remained 
available in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic [19]. Pregnancy is an 
acknowledged risk factor for domestic violence which compounds 
the risk in the obstetric population during this period of mandated 
lockdown [7,18]. At the booking visit in our unit, all women are 
asked if they have or are experiencing domestic violence to identify 



those at risk. 
less women disclosed domestic 
violence at booking during the peak pandemic period when 
lockdown was enforced in the months of March and April, 2 
women in each month, in comparison with the pre-pandemic 
months of 
January and February where 12 and 10 women 
respectively, made disclosures (Table 3). This was consistent with 
a survey of 71 patients performed in the CWIUH on the effects of 
isolation on mood and relationships in pregnant women during the 
covid-19 pandemic (Milne et al., 2020). They found only 4.3 % of 
women reported a deterioration in their relationship with their 
partner during the pandemic, which is less than published reports 
of DV in pregnancy, with no reports of physical violence and the 
majority of women reporting improved relationships [20]. 

We continue to live through the Covid-19 era, with uncontrolled 
spread and resurgence of the virus in many countries across the 
world. The rapid control and ongoing successful suppression of the 
Covid-19 pandemic 
Ireland over a short 
in the Republic of 
timeframe affords us the ability to provide a unique insight into 
the effects of the pandemic on maternity services in a high-income 
country with universal access 
to healthcare. There was a 
statistically signiﬁcant difference in the number of preterm births 
over the study period in comparison to previous years, however 
ﬁnding to 
further research is required before attributing this 
behavioural and environmental changes secondary to the effects of 
the pandemic. There were no differences in all other maternal and 
neonatal outcomes reviewed. 
It is important to realise the impact of the pandemic on 
pregnant women, and information sharing with studies like ours 
will assist in reassuring the obstetric population that the overall 
results approximate 
those expected. Ongoing review of
