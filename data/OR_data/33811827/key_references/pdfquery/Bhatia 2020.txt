Summary 
At the onset of the global pandemic of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), guidelines recommended using regional 
anaesthesia for caesarean section in preference to general anaesthesia. National ﬁgures from the UK suggest that 
8.75% of over 170,000 caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic. We explored whether general 
anaesthesia rates for caesarean section changed during the peak of the pandemic across six maternity units in the 
north-west of England. We analysed anaesthetic information for 2480 caesarean sections across six maternity units 
from 1 April to 1 July 2020 (during the pandemic) and compared this information with data from 2555 caesarean 
sections performed at the same hospitals over a similar period in 2019. Primary outcome was change in general 
anaesthesia rate for caesarean section. Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean section rates, obstetric 
indications for caesarean section and regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates. A signiﬁcant reduction (7.7 
to 3.7%, p < 0.0001) in general anaesthetic rates, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39–0.93), was noted across hospitals 
during the pandemic. Regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates reduced (1.7 to 0.8%, p = 0.012), risk ratio 
(95%CI) 0.50 (0.29–0.86). Obstetric indications for caesarean sections did not change (p = 0.17) while the overall 
caesarean section rate increased (28.3 to 29.7%), risk ratio (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00–1.04), p = 0.052. Our analysis shows 
that general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section declined during the peak of the pandemic. Anaesthetic 
decision-making, recommendations from anaesthetic guidelines and presence of an on-site anaesthetic consultant 
in the delivery suite seem to be the key factors that inﬂuenced this decline. 



Introduction 
The National Maternity and Perinatal Audit [1] recently 

National Health Service (NHS) across England, Wales and 
Scotland during 2016–2017. In that dataset, around one in 
four women delivered by caesarean section. Regional 










have encouraged use of regional anaesthesia over general 
anaesthesia for surgery, including caesarean sections [4–7]. 
Cited advantages of regional anaesthesia, speciﬁcally in 
include: decreased risk of an 
relation to the pandemic, 
aerosol-generating procedure and its associated risks to 
healthcare staff; reduced use of speciﬁc personal protective 
equipment (PPE) such as ﬁltering facepiece masks; and 
improving theatre turnover by avoiding the need to wait for 
a speciﬁc number of air changes [8]. More data about 
obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women 
affected by COVID-19 have been reported across the globe 
[9–10].

Methods 
Anaesthetic information for caesarean sections performed

were included in our analysis to reﬂect a reasonable mix of 
hospitals with varying delivery rates. We speciﬁcally 
planned to determine the general anaesthesia rate for 







each participating hospital. The best practice RCoA 
standards suggest that > 95% of category 4 caesarean 
sections, > 85% of category 2–3 and > 50% of category 1 
caesarean sections should receive regional anaesthesia. 
Regional 
to general anaesthesia conversion should 
be < 1% for category 4, < 5% for category 2–3 and < 15% 
for category 1 caesarean sections [13].

Mantel-Haenszel chi-square analysis was used to estimate 
the pooled risk ratio (RR) (95%CI) stratiﬁed by hospital. 
Logistic regression was used to assess differences in rates in

Manchester which was 7.5% [11]. It was estimated that at 
least 1900 women undergoing caesarean section would be 
required in each of the two periods to ﬁnd a RR of 0.70 or 
lower using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square as signiﬁcant at 
p < 0.05 (two-sided) with at least 80% power. Analyses were 
performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp Inc., College Station,

statistical signiﬁcance.
