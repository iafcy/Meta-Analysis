Results: The 1754 pregnant women (Mage = 29.27, SD = 4.23) were between 4 and 
41 gestational weeks (M = 24.80, SD = 9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had

using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10).11,12 
Higher scores at the K10 indicate more symptoms and distress and 
76.3% of respondents with scores ≥30 would meet the 4th revision of 





criteria for anxiety, affective, or substance use disorder during a di- 
agnostic interview.13 Both the English and French versions have sim- 
ilarly satisfactory psychometric properties11 and the instrument has 



been shown to screen adequately for mood and anxiety disorders in 
pregnant women.14 Cronbach's α for the K10 in this study was 0.88. 
Positive and negative affect were assessed using the Positive 
and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).15,16 The Positive Affect 










reversed to reflect low positive affectivity. The original and the 
French version have been shown to be valid and reliable,16,17 and 
PANAS scores were shown to be associated with DSM-IV major 
depressive disorder in pregnant women.18 The Cronbach's α for the 
Positive Affect and Negative Affect subscales were 0.85 and 0.89,

was 0.92.

TA B L E 2 Analyses of covariance comparing the pre-COVID-19 cohort with the COVID-19 cohort of pregnant women on six psychiatric 
symptoms 

































Note: Analyses of covariance were performed to examine group differences on the psychiatric symptoms separately. Scores were previously 
converted to z scores. The analyses controlled for age, gestational age, education level, household income, and lifetime psychiatric disorders. Effect 
sizes (ES) were calculated using the difference of adjusted means between participants of the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 cohorts divided by a 
pooled standard deviation.

pregnant women of the COVID-19 cohort 









Low positive 
affectivity 



































































Note: A factor analysis was performed on the COVID-19 cohort to regroup the six clinical symptoms into a limited number of meaningful clusters. 
The analysis yielded three domains of symptoms: mood and anxiety symptoms (including symptoms of anxiety/depression, negative affectivity, and 
symptoms of PTSD), dissociative symptoms and low positive affectivity (see Supplementary material, Table S4). Three multiple regressions were next 
performed with the COVID-19 women's clinical and sociodemographic characteristics as predictors and the factor scores as criteria. The significance 
level was fixed at P < .02.
