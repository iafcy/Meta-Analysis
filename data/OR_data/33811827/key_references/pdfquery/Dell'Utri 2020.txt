Objective: During the lockdown period, the fear about the risk of infection in hospital has reduced the 
admission to Emergency Services (ES) with possible negative health effects. We have investigated the 
ﬂow occurred during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an obstetrics and gynecological 
changes in the emergency 
ES and the short-term adverse outcomes on women’s and reproductive health. 
Study design: The study was conducted in the OBGYN ES of the Clinica Mangiagalli, the largest maternity 
clinic of Milan, Lombardy, Northern Italy. We analyzed retrospectively the records of all women 
consecutively admitted at the ES from February 23rd to June 24th 2019, and compared them with the 
admissions during the lockdown executive order from February 23rd to June 23rd, 2020. Patients were 
assessed in terms of demographic features, presentation times, triage classiﬁcation (urgent/not urgent), 
reason for admission and outcome of the visit (discharge/admission to the ward). A total of 9291 data

Results: During the period February 24 th - May 31 th 2020 the admissions at the ES decreased by 35.4 % (95 
% CI—34.1–36.6) compared with the corresponding period in 2019. The reduction was more marked for 
gynecological complaints (-63.5 %, 95 %CI -60.5 to -66.5): in particular we observed a reduction of 
admissions for genital infection/cystitis of 75.7 % (95 %CI -71.4 to -80.1). The admission for complaints

The respiratory disease that emerged in December 2019 caused 
by a novel coronavirus SARS(cid:1)COV-2 rapidly spread from the 
Chinese city of Wuhan worldwide, causing a serious public health 
emergency [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a 
warning and declared a world health emergency on January 31st 
2020, and on March 11th 2020 declared the state of pandemic. 
Northern Italy became one of the epicenters of SARS CoV-2

pandemic in Europe, Lombardy being the most affected region. On 
23th February 2020, the Italian National Health Authority imposed 
in Lombardy limitations to movement of the population followed 
on 9th March by a national lockdown, including also the temporary 
closure of non-essential shops and businesses. In the period 18th 
May to 2nd June, factories, bars, restaurants and barbers were 
reopened, but limitations to social contact were still present. 
During the whole period any movement for health reasons was 
always allowed. 
During the lockdown period the national health system faced 
a difﬁcult situation. With the purpose of managing the state of 
emergency the National Health system had to relocate resources 
in order to reorganize human and logistic aids. Most of the 
health workers had to deal with the severe cases, threated in the 
intensive care units. Thus, causing a decrease of healthcare 
resources for the treatment of mild or nonurgent cases. Further,

The scientiﬁc community questions the possible effects of these 
changes on the population health. Oncologists have warned of 
possible future increases in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer due 
to a reduction in screening programs leading to a diagnostic delay 
with a detection of cancers at more advanced stages [4]. Two

Syndrome (ACS) and described a reduction rate in ED visits for 
angina or myocardial diseases of 30 % and 50 % depending on the 
study [2,3]. Paediatricians warned the population about the 
possible complications of the underdiagnosed Kawasaki Disease 
(KD) and 
infection related 
inﬂammation syndrome. the hesitation of the parents to go to 
the hospital, inﬂuenced by the fear of in-hospital contagion, lead to 
the manifestation of more severe forms [5]. 

Limited data on the impact of lockdown on obstetrics and 
gynecological ESs are available so far. This study analyses all the 
patients’ 
 visits of the Obstetrics and Gynecology ES in the major 
maternity hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy, during the lockdown 
period and retrospectively compares the clinical data with the 
same period in the previous year. The main objective was to

We retrospectively collected the data of women who were 
admitted respectively from February 23rd to June 24th, 2019, and 
3647 during the lockdown executive order from February 23rd to 
June 23rd, 2020, in the Obstetrics and Gynecology ES of the Clinica

ﬁles and automation system. Patients 
were assessed in terms of demographic features, presentation 
times, triage classiﬁcation (urgent/not urgent), reason for admis- 
sion and outcome of the visit (discharge/admission to the ward). 
The staff of the ES comprises registered obstetricians and 
gynecologists. Triage was conducted using a-four-level-classiﬁca- 
tions with corresponding colors (red/immediate priority, yellow/ 
urgent priority; green/ less urgent priority, white/not urgent). 
The number of newly diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases 
in Lombardy was obtained by ofﬁcial data of Regional Health 
Authority [6]. 
Categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers, 
percentages and compared by the chi-square test calculating the 
p value. 
Percentage changes (with the corresponding 95 % Conﬁdence 
interval) in the absolute numbers observed in 2020 vs 2019 were 
also computed. 
Given the retrospective observational nature of the study based 
on anonimous routine data base, approval by the Local Ethics 
Committee was not necessary. 

During the period February 24th and June 23th 2020 a total of 
3647 admissions were registered at the ES with a 35.4 % reduction 
(95 % CI -34.1 to-36.6) compared with the equivalent period in 
2019. 
The highest reduction rate was observed during the 5th week 
analyzed, from March 22nd to March 28th 2020, which corre- 
sponds 
infected cases 
registered in Lombardy (Fig. 1). 




The decrease was about double among Italian than foreign 
women. In particular no decrease was observed among African 
women. 
The reduction was more marked for gynecological complaints 
(-63.5 %, 95 %CI: -60.5 to -66.5) : in particular the admissions for 
vulvovaginal 
infections, uro-gynecological conditions and/or 
cystitis decreased of 75.7 % (95 %CI: 71.4 to -80.1) 
Regarding the gynecological visits for menorrhagia/atypical 
blood loss we observed a reduction of -41.4 % (95 %CI: -31.7%– 
51.1%). Despite the reduction of 
the visits, the number of 
hospitalizations for blood transfusion increased from 4 to 6 during 
quarantine, this difference, however, was not statistically signiﬁ- 
cant (chi square 2.43, p = 0.12.) 


for ectopic 
pregnancy was of -20.6 % (95 %CI: -11.0 % to-30.2 %), and the 
absolute number of hospitalizations decreased from 20 to 16 in 
2020. Of those 9 and 11 respectively in 2019 and 2020 underwent 
urgent laparoscopy for salpingectomy and drainage of abdominal 
ﬂuid and 11 and 5 were treated with methotrexate, this 
free 
difference, however, was not statistically signiﬁcant (chi-square 
2.0306. p = 0.15) 
Finally, we observed 13 cases of pelvic inﬂammatory disease in 
2019 and 5 in 2020, corresponding to reduction of 61.5 % (95 %CI: 
-35.1 to -88.0). 

(95 %CI: -27.2–29.9). 
In the study period 
ﬁve fetal deaths were diagnosed at our ES, in 
comparison with one fetal death observed in the corresponding 
period in 2019 (chi square computed using as denominator all 
observed pregnancies = 4.29, p = 0.04). 
We have also considered the changing trends in the main 
reasons of admission among pregnant women. The admissions due 
bleeding in pregnancy decreased by -46.6 % (95 %CI -51.9 to -41.3; 
from 339 cases to 181 cases) and those for gestational diabetes by 
-47.1 % (95 %CI -0.57 to -0.38; from 104 to 55 cases). Otherwise, the 
admissions 
for hypertensive disorders/preeclampsia/eclampsia 
were substantially unchanged being increased of 2.1 % (95 %CI-1 
to+11.0; from 48 to 49 cases). Finally, the cases of threat of preterm- 
birth increased of +13.7 % (95 %CI + 4.1 to +22.3; from 49 to 53 
cases).

Table 2 shows the distribution of women admitted for delivery 
according the planned mode of delivery in 2019 and 2020. The 
frequency of elective caesarean section and 
labour induction 
increased respectively from 20.4 % and 27.1 % in 2019 to 23.6 % and 
30.0 % in 2020: this difference was statistically signiﬁcant (chi 
square = 8.52, p = 0.014). 



In comparison to 2019, the ES admission rate observed during 
lockdown period decreased signiﬁcantly by 35.4 %, the 
the 
frequency of intrauterine fetal deaths diagnosed at admission 
increased and of natural deliveries decreased. The highest 
reduction rate was observed during the 5th week analyzed, from 
March 22nd to March 28th 2020, which corresponds to the 
maximum increase of newly infected cases registered in our 
region. 
During that weeks, the frightening effect that aroused from the 
media campaign reporting the struggle of the National Health 
Service, the constant display of dramatic images of hospitalized 
patients in intensive care units and the daily report of increasing 
number of deaths, critically increased the fear of the population 
and thus inﬂuenced the attitudes of women toward the search of 
care. This phenomenon has been recognized in Italy also for other 
specialties, such as cardiology [2,3]. 
The reduction of the patient visits was higher in Italian than in 
foreign women. In particular no reduction was observed among 
African women. This difference may be due to the fact that African 
women live in a closed community, and most of them have less 
access to media information due to a language barrier. Moreover, 
analyzing the reasons for visits to ES of African women it appears 
that they seek urgent care either for pregnancy related compli- 
cations or for delivery and/or for severe menorrhagia, not for 
nonurgent issues (data not shown). During the whole lockdown 
period, private practice was allowed. Thus it is possible that Italian 
women, to avoid hospital access, chose more frequently a safer 
environment by asking for their General Practitioner or private 
gynecologist. 

The reduction observed was allocated primarily to visits for 
minor gynecological problems (such as vulvovaginal infections, 
menstrual-cycle irregularities, uro-gynecological conditions) and 
secondly for obstetric controls of an uncomplicated pregnancy 
the gynecological visits, despite 
the observed 
reduction of visits for menorrhagia/ atypical blood 
loss, the 
number of hospitalizations for blood transfusion increased from 
four to six during quarantine, although this increase was not 
statistically signiﬁcant. This opposite trend can be explained by the 
fear of in-hospital contagion: this reluctance caused a worsening of 
patients’ 
 physical conditions, resulting in an increase of blood 
transfusion and potentially serious adverse effect. 
Women showing with suspected pelvic inﬂammatory disease 
were less than half compared to the previous year. This reduction 
in numbers may be due to the quarantine, that forced people to 
stay home, reducing promiscuous relationships. Nevertheless, 
some women may not have adequately treated the infection, 
increasing the risk of possible long-term complications, which can 
negatively impact women’s quality of life and increase the risks of 
complications and repercussions on fertility [7].

Within all pregnant women, there was a decrease related to 
ﬁrst and second trimester (up until week 24). On 
issues during the 
the other hand, as expected, the number of hospitalizations for 
births was substantially unchanged. 
The number of women diagnosed with intrauterine fetal deaths 
at the ES conﬁrmed by the absence of the heartbeat during the 
ultrasound at admission was relevant, increased from one case in 
ﬁve cases in 2020. We hypothesize that the increase could 
2019 to 
have been due to the inclination of the women to wait longer for 
the visit, which resulted in underestimating important signs, such 
as the reduction of fetal movements felt by the mother, for hours or 
days. 
The data shows a change in the mode of delivery, favoring the 
pre-planned induced births and the hospitalizations for chosen c- 
sections, compared to the natural births. It could have been due to 
the doctors advising the pregnant women to preplan their birth, so 
that they could feel safer knowing they would have a preﬁxed birth 
plan, given the uncertainty and the continuous changes related to 
the emergency situation of COVID-19. 
Potential limitations of this analysis should be considered. We 
have analyzed data obtained by a routine data base, including only 
the main diagnosis/complaint of the woman attending the ES. This 
limitation is, however, similar in both the considered periods. 
Among strengths we have to considered the large sample size. 


lockdown has had 
relevant impact on ES admission and consequently on the woman’s 
health such as an increase of intrauterine fetal death, a decrease of 
natural birth and an increase, although in a not statistically 
signiﬁcant way, of admission for menorrhagia requiring blood 
transfusion. 
At the moment it is not possible to estimate the effect that the 
reduction of patient visits at the ES have on the long term health of 
the women general population, but some consequences due to 
under- or delayed diagnosis, for example of infections, can be 
expected. 
 


We believe it’s necessary to raise awareness to the correct use of 
hospitals and ESs, informing the population on how and when to 
use hospital services. An important focus should be teaching not to 
underestimate important signs and symptoms that could bring 
serious consequences, in the medium and long run, putting the 
mother and the fetus at risk also in case of a new lockdown.
