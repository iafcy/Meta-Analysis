Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions can adversely impact antenatal maternal 
well-being and health behaviours. 
Aim: To examine antenatal stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support, and health behaviours 
between women pregnant before and during the pandemic in Ireland. 
Methods: 210 pregnant women were recruited online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary 
maternity hospital before the pandemic, and 235 women recruited online during the pandemic. Only 
women resident in Ireland were included in this study. Women completed measures of stress, social 
support, health-behaviours, and self-reported stress-reduction strategies. Differences in outcomes were 
examined between women pregnant before and during the pandemic, and between Phase 2 and Phase 3 
of the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions. 
Findings: Women pregnant during the pandemic reported lower perceived social support, including 
support from a signiﬁcant other, friends and family, than women pregnant before the pandemic. There 
were no signiﬁcant differences in stress in health behaviours but women reported higher stress and less 
physical activity during the pandemic. Women reported a range of comparable stress-reduction 
strategies before and during the pandemic. No differences were observed between phases of pandemic- 
related restrictions for any outcome. 
ﬁndings highlight negative impacts of the pandemic on social support, stress, and 
Discussion: Our 
physical activity, which can have implications for maternal and child health. Lack of differences between 
restriction phases suggests on-going negative effects for antenatal well-being and behaviours. 
Conclusion: Development of supports for pregnant women during the pandemic should include social- 
support and stress-reduction components.

High antenatal stress, low social support, and inappropriate 
health behaviours can have negative impacts on maternal 
and child health. 

COVID-19 and related restrictions are 
linked to adverse 
mental health outcomes in general populations and can 
increase antenatal anxiety and depression. 





Antenatal stress is estimated to impact up to 30% of women 
during pregnancy [1] and is associated with poor postpartum 
mental and physical health [2,3], obstetric outcomes [4,5], and 
child health and neurodevelopment [6,7]. Antenatal stress is also 
associated with maternal perinatal health behaviours, which can 
also have direct impact on child health and development [8]. 
Positive factors, such as social support, are argued to have a 
protective effect however by buffering effects of stress on maternal 
and child outcomes [9,10]. Antenatal stress can arise from multiple 
psychological, physiological, social and socio-demographic factors 
[11,12]. It can also result from experiencing signiﬁcant and/or 
stressful 
life events, such as bereavement [13], and natural 
disasters [14], and is a likely outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In Ireland, at the time of writing, the national cumulative incidence 
of conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases is 974.98 per 100,000 population; the 
national cumulative incidence of conﬁrmed deaths is 33.31 per 
100,000 population [15]. 
There is already evidence that COVID-19, which was announced 
as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 
2020 [16], has led to adverse mental health consequences in 
general populations [17]. A recent review indicates that stress, 
anxiety, depression, and disrupted sleep are common mental 
health outcomes of COVID-19 [18]. Such outcomes may be due to 
multiple COVID-19 related factors, including perceived risk of 
infection, concerns about loved ones [19], and the implementation 
of 
lockdowns globally that have restricted 
movement and social interactions [20]. For pregnant women, 
the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to changes in maternity care 
access and procedures [21], which when coupled with broader 
COVID-19 concerns, have the potential to signiﬁcantly impact 
pregnant women’s stress and behavioural responses [20]. There is 
some emerging evidence supporting this, with reports that women 
pregnant during the pandemic experience increased concern and 
feelings of vulnerability [19], depression, and anxiety [22,23]. 

To date, there are limited data on antenatal stress, social 
support, and health behaviours during the pandemic in compari- 
son to before the pandemic; this is largely due to the rapid and 
unexpected onset of the pandemic and associated societal changes. 
One study of pregnant Canadian women reported 
increased 
psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression, post-trau- 
matic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in a sample of 
women pregnant during COIVD-19, in comparison to a pre-COVID- 
19 sample [24]. Findings from a study conducted in China, also 
indicate increased levels of depression and anxiety in pregnant 
women following declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic [25]. 
As of yet, there is no evidence regarding the potential effects of 
lockdown restrictions on antenatal maternal well-being. In the 
Republic of Ireland (ROI), a COVID-19 
 of four phases 
including required and recommended public health guidelines and 
restrictions was established [26]. For instance, during Phase Two 
(June 8th to 28th) travel was permitted within one’s home county 
or up to 20 km from home; up to 6 people from outside one’s 
household could meet and retail could begin to re-open, with 
physical distancing in place for both [26]. During Phase Three (from 


June 29th 2020) crèches and childcare re-opened for essential 
workers in a phased manner, playgrounds were re-opened, and 
small social gatherings were allowed [26]. Full information on the 
roadmap phases can be found at https://www.gov.ie/. Each phase 
was implemented simultaneously across the country on the same 
date, allowing for an examination of the impact of varying levels of 
restrictions on antenatal well-being. 

ﬁrst was to examine 
differences between antenatal stress, social support, health 
behaviours, and stress-reduction strategies of 
Irish women 
pregnant before the pandemic and during the pandemic. The 
second aim was to examine differences in these outcomes at 
different stages of pandemic-related restrictions. 


A cross-sectional survey design, including closed and open- 
ended questions, was used with data collected before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a secondary data analysis 
from a larger program of research on maternal stress, social 
support and health behaviours [27]. 

Participants were pregnant women over the age of 18 years. 
There were no exclusions based on gestational age or nationality 
during recruitment for the larger study. Only participants self- 
reporting living in the ROI were included in the current study, to 
facilitate comparison of antenatal well-being between two groups 
situated in similar cultural, societal and antenatal care contexts 
before and during the pandemic. 

Recruitment of women before the pandemic was conducted 
online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary maternity 
hospital in the South of ROI from May 2019 to February 2020. 
Recruitment of women during the pandemic was conducted 
online from June 16th to July 17th 2020. Online recruitment in 
both time periods was conducted via pregnancy forums and 
social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, 
Instagram). All 
women recruited online were provided with a link to the online 
survey, which 
they completed upon providing electronic 
informed consent. Women recruited 
in-person prior to the 
pandemic completed a hard-copy survey following provision of 
informed consent. 

Both surveys included questions on socio-demographic factors, 
stress, social support, health behaviours and stress-reduction 
strategies. The survey used prior to the pandemic included an 
assessment of women’s knowledge about stress and health 
behaviours; the survey used during the pandemic also assessed 
mental and physical well-being, perceived quality of antenatal 
care, and COVID-19 related stress, beliefs and behaviours. As this 
study is interested in differences between outcomes before and 
during the pandemic, only those measures 
in both 
surveys are outlined here. More details of the additional measures 
can be found in our complimentary papers [27].

the Revised Prenatal Distress 
Questionnaire (NuPDQ [8,28]). The NuPDQ is a 17-item scale with 
“very 
items measured on a 3-point scale ranging from 
much”. Items assess the degree to which women experience 
worries and concerns related to their pregnancy including, for 
“about whether you might have an unhealthy baby”. The 
example: 
reliability coefﬁcient of the NuPDQ in the overall sample was 
α 
 = 0.79. 



Perceived support was measured using the Multidimensional 
Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS [29]). This is a 12-item 
scale of perceived support from family, friends and loved ones, 
“very strongly 
with items measured on a 7-point scale from 
disagree” 
“very strongly agree”. The reliability coefﬁcient of the 
α

 = 0.96; reliability of the 
signiﬁcant other subscale was

Behaviours were measured using the Prenatal Health Behav- 
iours Scale (PHBS [8]), which assesses the frequency of women’s 
engagement in behaviours related to nutrition, physical activity, 
sleep, vitamins, smoking and alcohol in the last two weeks. Items 
“very 
“never” 
are measured on a 5-point scale ranging from

was created by combining data on frequency of consumption of 
fatty or oily foods, snack foods, and eating beyond the point of 
satiety. The reliability coefﬁcient of this outcome was 
 = 0.36 in 
the overall sample, which was too low for inclusion in further 
analyses. Single items were used to examine frequency of smoking, 
alcohol consumption, physical activity, taking vitamins, and sleep. 







Women responded to a single open-ended question that asked 
“When you feel stressed what do you like to do to reduce your 
stress levels?” 



Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Version 26. 
Participant demographic factors, levels of stress and social support, 
and frequency of health behaviours were descriptively summar- 
ised. 
tests of 
independence were used to examine differences between women 
who completed the survey before and during the pandemic on 
continuous and categorical socio-demographic variables respec- 
tively. Assumption testing indicated that the data were not suited 
to multivariate analysis of variance. Independent samples t-tests 
were used to examine differences 
in stress, perceived social 
support and frequency of healthy eating between women who 
were pregnant before the pandemic and those pregnant during the 
pandemic, and between women who completed the survey in 
Phase Two and Phase Three of pandemic restrictions in the ROI. 
Chi-square tests of independence were used to examine differ- 
ences in frequency of exercise, taking vitamins, and sleep. Due to 
the number of analyses conducted a Bonferroni correction was 
applied with a more stringent signiﬁcance value of p 
 0.01. 
Analysis of the strategies for coping with stress was conducted 
using a quantitative content analysis to provide a structured way of 
analysing participants open-ended response. A list of individual 
strategies was initially identiﬁed for each time period, from which 


a list of categories was then derived, with individual strategies 
grouped in accordance to comparability. Differences in stress- 
reduction strategies were not examined by lockdown phases due to 
low numbers of some reported strategies. Differences in strategies 
before and during the pandemic are presented narratively and in 
table form. 

All procedures were approved by the University College Cork 
School of Public Health Research Ethics Committee and the 
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of 
the Cork Teaching 
Hospitals. 

The study included 445 pregnant women between 19 and 46 
years (M = 33.78, SD = 4.27) and between 4 and 41 weeks pregnant 
(M = 26.99, SD = 9.34). A total of 210 women living in the ROI 
completed the survey before the pandemic; 235 women living in 
the ROI completed the survey during the pandemic. Details of the 
two groups are presented in Table 1. There were no signiﬁcant 
differences for age, gestational weeks, relationship status or 
number of children women had, between women pregnant before 
or during COVID-19. Due to the low number of women reporting 
any smoking or alcohol consumption these variables were not 
included in further analyses.

difference of 2.71 (95% CI 1.51–3.91; eta squared = 0.05). A 
difference was also observed for social support from family, with 
lower support also reported during the pandemic (t (429.39) = 3.01, 
p = 0.003); the mean difference, 1.74 (95% CI 0.61–2.88), was small 
(eta squared = 0.02). There was no difference for healthy eating 
before or during the pandemic (t (433) = 0.81, p = 0.42). Chi-square 
tests for independence indicated no differences between women’s 
frequency of exercise, taking vitamins or sleep before or during the 
pandemic (see Table 1). 
In terms of pregnant women’s stress reduction, 82.5% (n = 208) 
of women reported 49 
individual stress-reduction strategies 
before the pandemic; 89.8% (n = 211) reported 47 
individual 
stress-reduction strategies during the pandemic. As outlined in 
Table 2 the most commonly reported strategies were connecting 
with others and exercise. The proportion of women connecting 
with others remained similar in both time periods. Women were 
less likely to report using exercise (40.8%; n = 86 vs 56.3%; n = 117), 
particularly walking, and engaging with a form of entertainment 
(11.8%; n = 25 vs 22.6%; n = 47) during the pandemic (see Table 2).

During Phase Two (which included phased re-opening of retail 
and eased restrictions on travel), 138 women completed the 
survey; 97 women completed the survey during Phase Three of 
pandemic-related restrictions (which included opening of crèches 
and childcare, and easing of restrictions on small social gather- 
ings). Independent samples t-tests used to examine differences in 
continuous variables by phase of lockdown restrictions indicated 
no differences between pregnant women who completed the 
survey during Phase Two and Phase Three for antenatal stress, total 
perceived social support, perceived support from a signiﬁcant 
other, friends or family, or frequency of healthy eating. Chi square 
tests for independence, used to examine differences in categorical 
variables, also indicated no differences in frequency of exercise, 
taking vitamins, or sleep. See Table 3. 
This study examined differences between women pregnant 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for levels of stress, 
social support, frequency of health behaviours and stress-reduc- 
ﬁrst examination of 
tion strategies. To our knowledge this is the 
potential differences in these variables during the pandemic; it is 
ﬁrst examination of the potential role of pandemic-related 
also the 
ﬁndings indicate 
restrictions on outcomes during pregnancy. Our 
signiﬁcant decreases 
in pregnant women’s perceived social 
support from all sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. No 
signiﬁcant differences were observed for antenatal stress or health 
behaviours, though women pregnant during the pandemic did 
report higher levels of stress than women pregnant before the 
pandemic. There were also no differences in outcomes based on 
the phase of pandemic-related restrictions.

Though perceived antenatal social support has not been widely 
ﬁnd that nearly all participants in a 
reported to date, one study did 
Canadian survey reported feeling more alone during the pandemic 
ﬁnding that women reported reduced 
than usual [23]. Our 
perceived social support from all sources is in line with this 
ﬁnding and may relate to pandemic-related social and 
previous 
ﬁnding that women experi- 
physical restrictions. Similarly, the 
enced reduced social support from a signiﬁcant other is similar to a 
report that some women experience a strain on their relationship 
with a signiﬁcant other during the pandemic [23]. Social support 
overall, and from speciﬁc sources including family, friends and 
signiﬁcant others, is recognised as an important protective and 
resiliency factor in pregnancy and has important implications for 
ﬁnding 
perinatal mental health and obstetric outcomes [30]. Our 
that women were as likely to report connecting with others as a 
stress-reduction strategy during the pandemic further supports 
the importance of social interactions during this period. As such, 
reductions in perceived social support during the pandemic may 
have adverse maternal and child health outcomes. 
The absence of a signiﬁcant reduction in antenatal stress in the 
ﬁndings of high levels of 
current study differs from previous 
antenatal distress during the pandemic [19,22,24,31,32]. Previous 
examinations have tended to focus on depression and anxiety as 
indicators of distress 
[22,24,31,32], which may explain the 
ﬁnding. Further, examinations have mostly 
difference with our 
examined general anxiety [22,24] or anxiety related to COVID-19 
[19,31]. Pregnancy-speciﬁc stress differs in that it is speciﬁcally 
focused on the pregnancy, the baby, and antenatal care. However, 

 
 




one study reporting high levels of health anxiety among women 
pregnant during the pandemic did include worries about the self 
and the baby. The period of the pandemic examined may also 
explain differences 
the 
pandemic in our study began in June 2020, at a point when some 
restrictions (e.g., related to travel) were being eased. Earlier stages 
of 
studies 
[19,22,24,31,32], may have resulted in higher levels of distress 
due to higher perceived threat and uncertainty of COVID-19. 
ﬁrst and subsequent phases may 
Similarly, differences between the 
have resulted in larger differences in outcomes than were observed 
in this study. 






ﬁnding that phase of lockdown did not inﬂuence any 
outcomes in the current study suggests that phase of pandemic- 
related restrictions may not impact antenatal psychological well- 
being or health behaviours however. This should be considered in 
relation to development and implementation of mental health 
strategies and support for pregnant women because it cannot be 
assumed that easing of restrictions will result in improved well- 
being. Furthermore, as with other large-scale stressors such as 
natural disasters [33], the effects of the pandemic on maternal 
mental health and associated effects on 
infant health and 
development [34] are likely to be long-lasting; highlighting the 
need for future support. It should also be noted that restrictions 
applied to maternity services remained during both Phase Two and 
Three, with limitations on access to antenatal care and restrictions 
around partner access. Thus, this may also explain a lack of 
differences observed in our study. 

ﬁrst study to examine potential changes in pregnant 
women’s engagement in health promoting and protective behav- 
iours resulting from the pandemic. We found no signiﬁcant 
differences in the frequency with which women engaged in health 
behaviours during the pandemic. However participants open- 
ended responses in relation to their stress-reduction activities did 
indicate a reduction in exercise, and in particular walking. This is 
ﬁnding that 64% of survey women reported 
similar to a recent 
reduced physical activity with the onset of pandemic-related 
isolation measures 
the health 
behaviours reported by Irish women during the pandemic are 
good, with most women reporting 
frequent healthy eating, 
engaging in some exercise and taking vitamins. In addition, very 
few women report alcohol consumption or smoking cigarettes. As 
health behaviours including diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol 
consumption are associated with obstetric and child health 
outcomes [8,36–38], this is a promising 
ﬁnding that suggests 
women did not alter their behaviours in the context of the 
pandemic. 



Examination of differences between women before and during 
the pandemic was limited to those variables that were examined in 
the pre-pandemic group. As such, additional variables such as 
satisfaction with maternity care and perceived health could not be 
examined. A further limitation of the study is that we did not ask 
women in the current study if they had or suspected they had 
COVID-19. The two groups examined in the current study also 
represent distinct groups of women, rather than being part of a 
longitudinal cohort. However, our approach to examining only 
women living in the ROI who are exposed to similar social contexts 
and maternity care services served to enhance comparability of the 
two groups. The majority of participants 
in the study were 
multiparous women who were either married or in a relationship 
ﬁndings may not be generalisable beyond this group. 
and so our 
This is of particular relevance in relation to COVID-19 related 
inequalities, whereby certain groups such as obese pregnant 
women and minority groups, who are more likely to experience 
higher antenatal stress [11], also represent a higher proportion of 
COVID-19 cases [39]; this represents increased risk for certain 
groups, which could not be examined in the current study. 


ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that pregnant women 
experienced signiﬁcantly lower perceived social support from all 
sources during the pandemic, and a non-signiﬁcant increase in 
ﬁndings highlight negative impacts of 
stress. Taken together these 
the pandemic on two important psychological constructs related 
to maternal and child health [30]. Development of supports and 
intervention strategies for pregnant women during the on-going 
pandemic, and future similar large-scale stressors, should include a 
focus on both stress-reduction and promotion of social support. 
Further, many of the stress-reduction strategies women engaged 
during the pandemic are similar to those engaged in prior to the 
pandemic, suggesting that women are already familiar with and 
engage in potentially useful strategies to protect their mental 
ﬁnding that the health behaviours of pregnant women, 
health. The 
which are linked to improved maternal and child outcomes [8], 
were not impaired during the pandemic is a further positive 
ﬁnding of the current study.
