Abstract 
Objective: This study aimed to describe the emergency responses to coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) for pregnant patients at our hospital and their effect on hospital operations and 
patients’ outcomes. 
Methods: We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in 
obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient 
volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus 
was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were per- 
formed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed 
and the patients’ characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and 
anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. 
Results: No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient 
volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher 
prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological

interventions showed optimistic effects in ameliorating depression and anxiety at the beginning of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Conclusions: Our strategies were effective in preventing in-hospital infection of COVID-19 and 
reassuring women about the safety of pregnancy. Monitoring and managing psychological issues 
were necessary during this critical period.

In December 2019, clusters of patients with 
pneumonia of an unknown cause were 
reported in Wuhan, China.1 Further inves- 
tigation identiﬁed a novel coronavirus, 
initially termed 2019-nCoV, 
which was 
and was subsequently named severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The 
ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) has become a global 
health concern. As recorded by the World 
Health Organization, the number of con- 
ﬁrmed cases by 2 April 2020 has surpassed 
896,000 globally.2 Little is known about the 
effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women 
and neonates. In a report of 10 neonates 
delivered by mothers who had COVID-19 
infection, adverse perinatal outcomes, such 
as premature labor, fetal distress, and even 
death, were reported.3 Currently, the route 
of neonatal infection, such as the transpla- 
cental route, during delivery, or by postna- 
tal close contact with an infected mother, is 
unclear. 

Southeast 
Zhongda 
is an academic and tertiary 
University, 
medical 
Jiangsu 
Province. The Department of Obstetrics 
has approximately 2000 deliveries per 
year. This hospital is also designated as a 


unique Guidance Center and Quality 
Control Center for Maternal Critical Care 
of Jiangsu Province, and is a regionally 
maternal referral center for critically ill 
pregnant women. Nanjing was assessed as 
a high-risk region by the government on 26 
January 2020, with 93 COVID-19 cases 
conﬁrmed. At this time, Nanjing was ofﬁ- 
cially appointed as one of the four referring 
hospitals for COVID-19-infected patients in 
the city because of its nationally recognized 
critical care medicine. Since the outbreak of 
the pandemic COVID-19, 
three patients 
have been diagnosed with COVID-19 
infection in our hospital. Therefore, we 
developed strategies to prevent hospital- 
associated transmission in obstetric care. 


In this study, we describe our experience 
in how we prepared for the COVID-19 epi- 
demic 
infection 
among pregnant women in a regional refer- 
ring obstetric center. We also examined the 
effects of COVID-19 on patient volume and 
pregnancy outcomes in 2020. Gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational 
hypertension (GHTN), which are two of 
the most common complications of preg- 
nancy, were further analyzed and compared 
with the data in 2019. The occurrence of 
depression and anxiety in pregnant women 
was reported. 



Workflows for the outpatient clinic and 
telemedicine 
With extensive use of ﬁfth generation (5G) 
technology and hospital webapps, we had 
the ability to offer routine obstetric care 
through our clinic and telemedicine services 
for outpatients at the same level in 2020 as 
that before the COVID-19 outbreak. For 
clinic visitors, a strict pre-screening proce-

testing, 
Patients with a low risk (Class I according 


to the National Health Commission of 
China) were suggested to have a follow-up 
in the community clinic. Close monitoring 
or hospitalization was proposed when it 
was evaluated as necessary. 

For non-emergent patients (e.g., those 
with a routine examination appointment), 
an online 
through telemedicine, 
which was supported by our Information 
Technology Center, was provided. Online 
courses on education of blood glucose and 
pressure monitoring were provided to preg- 
nant women. These women were asked to 
upload their data to the National Metabolic 
Management Center, which was established 
by Professor Zhang, Zhongda Hospital, to 
create an integrated online and ofﬂine solu- 
tion for diabetes, as well as for other meta-

followed up and advised 
patients via text messages or phone calls. 
For those who required instant interven- 
tion, an on-site examination was required. 
Medication, when necessary, was pre- 
scribed and delivered directly to the 
patient’s home from the hospital through 
our delivery service system. 
The numbers of patients who visited the 
outpatient clinic, Emergency Department, 
and hospital in January and February of 
2020 were collected and compared with 
the data from the same period in 2019 to 
evaluate the effects of these strategies on 
controlling patient ﬂow. Additionally, preg- 
nancy outcomes were reviewed and com- 
pared, including GHTN and GDM. 

With regard to strategies, the obstetric ﬂoor 
was modiﬁed as per the Guideline of the 
of 
Emergency Leadership Committee 
Zhongda Hospital at the initial stage of 
the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020. 
All of the patients’ rooms were adapted to 
a single-patient unit. Additional ventilation 
equipment was installed, and air was rou- 
tinely monitored and assessed by third- 
party engineers with a centralized designed 
Airborne Infection Isolation Room in the 
hospital as a back-up unit as required. 
Guidance for in-hospital patients was 
adjusted to prevent imported COVID-19 
infections (Figure 2). At the peak of the 
epidemic, we suspended all elective opera- 
tions. Admission for elective patients was 
resumed recently when the situation was 
ameliorated. Patients with no requirement 
for surgery were accommodated in single 
rooms for a nasopharyngeal swab test 
upon admission. For semi-elective patients, 
such as those with tumors, nasopharyngeal 
swab tests were performed before surgery. 
Positive results were veriﬁed by Provincial 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and COVID-19-conﬁrmed patients were 
immediately transferred to the Nanjing 
Public Health Center. For emergencies 
without veriﬁcation of COVID-19, surgery 
was performed in a negative pressure oper- 
ating theater.5 Participating surgeons and 
medical staff were fully equipped with per- 
sonal protective gear, 
including a cap, a 
pair of goggles, an N95 mask, and shoe 
covers. Disposable surgical gowns and 
single-use gloves were also used. All medi- 
cal waste was handled by following the 
Clinical Waste Management Procedures. 
The theater was sterilized after surgery.

Post-operation 
polymerase chain reaction was performed 
to determine the presence of the virus. 

Because the maternal–fetal or maternal– 
neonatal transmission pattern of COVID- 
19 is unknown and the possibility of vertical 
transmission cannot be excluded, precau- 
tions in every aspect were conducted for 
delivery of pregnant women in whom 
COVID-19 was unconﬁrmed. Therefore, 
we opted for early, rather than delayed, 
cord clamping after labor,6 even though 
the World Health Organization considers 
that delayed clamping is highly unlikely to 
increase the risk7 (Figure 2). Samples of

Newborns were temporarily isolated from 
their mothers, and breastfeeding was tem- 
porarily not allowed until the mother tested 
negative for COVID-19. 


While the effect of mental health on preg- 
nancy outcomes was documented, maternal 
psychological changes were also evaluated 
and intervention was performed during the 
epidemic.8 At

Wearing masks, keeping social distances, 
and reducing outdoor 
activities were 
advised at the peak of the pandemic. At 
the 
clariﬁcation 
and discussion of the rumors and mislead- 
ing messages were 
be 
important for eliminating the patients’ anx- 
iety and stress. Furthermore, the outcome 
of healthy and successful deliveries in our 
department during the pandemic was 
shared among our patients. Interestingly, 
we found that ameliorating stress and 
building the patients’ self-conﬁdence were 
useful. Moreover, the patients were encour-

cient social contact over the phone or

To evaluate the mental status of our 
patients, a structured questionnaire was dis- 
tributed before and during the outbreak 
through online groups. The extent of 
depression, anxiety, and fear was graded 
as none, mild, moderate, and severe, and 
the stress level was assessed using a 0 to 
10 scoring scale. The self-evaluated results 
were collected and the characteristics of 
psychological performances were analyzed. 



The study was approved by the Ethics 
Committee and Review Board of Zhongda 
Hospital. The patients provided verbal con- 
sent for using their data. All data were col- 
lected from the Hospital 
Information 
System and analyzed by Prism 8.3.1 
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, 
USA). The t-test was used to analyze 
changes in patient ﬂow. The chi-square 
test was applied to evaluate obstetric out- 
comes, and the paired t-test was used to 
compare the psychological status before 
and after our intervention. A p value < 0.05 
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. 

Hospital-acquired infection in mothers 
and neonates 
There were 2458 outpatient visits, 316 emer- 
gent visits, 385 hospital admissions, and 271 
deliveries in the ﬁrst 2 months of 2020. 
During this time, there was no in-hospital 
infection or transmission in either mothers 
or neonates. We encountered one woman 
who reported a close contact history with 
a patient with COVID-19. According to 
our proactive protocols, emergency delivery 
was conducted in a negative pressure oper- 
ation theater. The neonate was temporarily 
separated in an individual chamber until 
samples of amniotic ﬂuid, umbilical cord 
blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs showed 
that COVID-19 was not present. The 
mother was also COVID-19-negative.

hospitalization numbers of patients

each month was collected. Patient volume

from 
Department, and hospitalization was signif- 
icantly decreased in February 2020 after ini- 
tiation of new hospital policies compared 
with January 2020 (all p < 0.05) (Figure 3). 
The new hospital policies 
signiﬁcantly 
decreased the volume of outpatient visits, 
emergency room visits, and hospitalization 
in February 2020 compared with February 
2019 (all p < 0.05).

pitalization between January and February of 2019 and 2020. *p < 0.05. ns: not significant. 



Between January and February 2020, 271 
pregnant women delivered 280 newborns in 
our department compared with 311 pregnant 
women and 317 newborns in 2019 (Table 1). 
The rate of women who were nulliparous in 
2020 was signiﬁcantly lower than that in 
2019 (p ¼ 0.009). The prevalence of GHTN 
was signiﬁcantly higher in 2020 compared 
with 2019 (p ¼ 0.002). The prevalence of 
GDM was not different between the two 
time periods. Outcomes of pregnancy, 
in January 
including neonatal outcomes, 
and February in 2020 were similar to those 
in January and February in 2019. 
Outcomes of patients with GDM and 
GHTN 
There were no changes in maternal and 
neonatal outcomes in women with GDM 
between 2019 and 2020. There were no sig- 
niﬁcant changes in maternal and neonatal 
outcomes in women with GHTN between 
2019 and 2020, except for the Apgar score 
at 1 minute (p ¼ 0.003) (Table 2).

Psychological intervention effectively 
relieves depression, fear, and stress 
in pregnant women 
The reliability values of our questionnaires 
were > 0.9 for pre- and post-intervention, 
which indicated a high reﬂection of the 
women’s psychological status. Among a 
total of 126 patients, 38.1% of them had 
depression, 28.57% of them had anxiety, 




and 67.46% of them reported fear at the 
pre- 
initial 
intervention (Table 3). Interventions via 
online consultation and education resulted 
in a signiﬁcant decrease 
in pregnant 
women’s depression (p ¼ 0.004) and fear 
(p < 0.001) compared with before interven- 
tion. The self-evaluated stress score was sig- 
niﬁcantly 
post-intervention 
compared with pre-intervention (p ¼ 0.003). 



We introduced emergency responses to the 
COVID-19 outbreak and established some 
strategies. Our study showed the following 
ﬁndings. (1) No hospital-acquired COVID- 
19 infection in pregnant women was found 
after new policies were applied in our hos- 
pital. (2) With a decrease in patients’ visits 
with the help of telemedicine, pregnancy 
outcomes were successful (3) Interestingly, 
the number of patients with GHTN was 
increased in January and February of 
and 
2020 
February of 2019. (4) Psychological issues 
were increased in 2020, and intervention 
was required and helpful, especially during 
this critical period. 



Respiratory viruses, such as H5N1 virus- 
es, are transmitted via maternal vertical 
transmission,9 while possible vertical trans- 
mission of human coronavirus was hypoth- 
esized in a pilot study.10 However, there is 
no evidence supporting vertical transmis- 
sion of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus and Middle East respiratory 
the 
syndrome 
COVID-19 epidemic, two cases of con- 
ﬁrmed neonatal infection were reported.11 
One case was diagnosed at 17 days of life 
and had a history of close contact with the 
mother and babysitter who were COVID- 
19-positive. However, another neonate was 
separated temporarily from the infected 
mother and tested positive for COVID-19 
infection 36 hours following delivery This 
prompted questions about whether 
the 
virus could spread by vertical transmis- 
sion.12 Liu et al.13 identiﬁed 13 pregnant 
patients with COVID-19 who were admit- 
ted to hospitals outside of Wuhan and Chen 
et al.14 reported nine of these patients in a 
in Wuhan. Amniotic ﬂuid, cord 
hospital 
blood, and neonatal throat swab samples 
of 
for 
COVID-19. Although preliminary evidence 
from these small groups of cases suggest 



that COVID-19 cannot be vertically trans- 
mitted, further studies with large samples 
are required to validate these ﬁndings. 
Tests of amniotic ﬂuid, cord blood, neona- 
throat swabs, as well as breastmilk 
tal 
suspected and conﬁrmed 
samples, of 
COVID-19 should always be requested. 

In a Wuhan Hospital, up to 29% of 
hospital-associated infection of COVID-19 
among medical professionals was docu- 
mented.15 
hospital-acquired 
infection is important during this critical 
period. Our ﬁnding of no hospital- 
acquired infection suggested the effective- 
ness of our policies in volume control and 
prevention of the virus. Furthermore, we 
rearranged workﬂow for hospitalization 
and surgery after preliminary COVID-19 
screening. One principle that we followed 
was isolated management of any suspected 
patients and newborns with COVID-19. 
One of our patients who had close contact 
with a patient with COVID-19 and her new- 
born was successfully managed. Therefore, 
we highly recommended interim strategies 
in volume control, workﬂow rearrange- 
ment, and screening. 
Despite the restriction, essential medical 
services were still offered and guaranteed in 
our department during the COVID-19 epi- 
demic. Our physicians operated telemedical 
platforms, individual operation and deliv- 
ery rooms were fully prepared with ventila- 
tion system, 
and personal protective 
equipment was available in case of an emer- 
gency. With the help of 5G wireless technol- 
ogy and communication, online clinics and 
remote consultation have rapidly developed 
in China. These techniques have provided 
an important supplement to facilitate med- 
ical services during the COVID-19 epidem- 
ic. 
were 
recommended to make an online appoint- 
ment and consult with our obstetricians 
with image transmission without compres- 
sion, which facilitated the accuracy in diag- 
nosis and advice as required. Psychological 




evaluation and intervention were also pro- 
vided by Apps on mobiles and question- 
naires. These strategies deﬁnitely improved 
care of the patients, at least through avail- 
able physician–patient communication, and 
their application in medical practice in such 
a scenario might be helpful. 
Generally, pregnancy outcomes, includ- 
ing maternal and neonatal outcomes, 
during the 2020 epidemic were the same as 
those in 2019. We found that the prevalence 
of GHTN in the COVID-19 epidemic was 
increased compared with that in the begin- 
ning of 2019. Indeed, hypertension and dia- 
betes are the most common comorbidities 
occurring in pregnant populations. The 
association and effects of mental status 
have 
on GHTN and 
literature.16–18 
been 
Psychological stress and depression during 
this period may play a role in pregnant 
women’s health. Therefore, psychological 
monitoring and intervention in such a 
public health situation are important. 





We were aware of the elevation in con- 
cern among our patients. According to the 
questionnaires, 38.10% of our patients suf- 
fered from mild to severe depression and 
28.57% of them showed anxiety. These 
rates are much higher than the reported 
15% to 23% under non-epidemic situa- 
tions.19 Although, our study was a single 
time-point 
further 
follow-ups, the importance of mental well- 
being of pregnant women and their preg- 
nancy outcomes have already been docu- 
mented.8 Therefore, online education and 
of 
including 
consultation, 
COVID-19 information to relieve stress 
due to a lack of knowledge, advice, and 
mentoring patients during a pandemic, as 
well as professional psychological support, 
should be emphasized in obstetric manage- 
ment. A long-term study speciﬁcally focus- 
ing on the effect of COVID-19 on mental 
health among the maternal population is 

urgently required for the public and health- 
care providers. 

Our current management strategies were 
effective in preventing hospital-acquired 
infection of COVID-19 and ensuring the 
safety of pregnant women physically and 
mentally at the same time. Our ﬁndings 
might provide useful information for pre- 
paring a hospital protocol in most similar 
scenarios outside our medical center.
