Singleton preterm birth rates for racial and ethnic 
groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic in California 
Reports from Denmark1 and the Limerick 
OBJECTIVE: 
region in Ireland2 noted dramatic reductions in preterm 
births during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We sought 
the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on preterm birth rates 
in a large racially diverse population during the peak 
months of the pandemic. Approximately 1 in 8 births in 
the United States occurs 
a 
residents, 
population that is among the most diverse in the country. 


STUDY DESIGN: 
The Hispanic or Latinx community ac- 
counts for 39% of California’s population and 46% of births 
but has experienced 61% of the state’s COVID-19 cases and 
48% of COVID-19erelated deaths; the black community, 
which constitutes 6% of the population, accounts for 4% 
of cases and 8% of deaths (https://covid19.ca.gov/data- 
and-tools/). Under the auspices of state and Stanford’s 
Institutional Review Boards, 
state of California

data on all births in California to support state-wide 
quality improvement activities.3 Race and ethnicity are 
self-identiﬁed. 
We examined birth outcomes for the months that corre- 
sponded with the peak effects of the pandemic: April 2020 to 
July 2020. A state-wide COVID-19 lockdown began in Cali- 
fornia on March 19, 2020, with caseloads peaking ﬁrst mid- 
April 2020 and followed by a much higher peak in mid-July 
2020 with more than 12,000 new cases per day (https:// 
covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/). We 
4 
months in 2020 to the same 4-month period aggregated over 
the previous 4 years (2016e2019) using logistic regression 
models to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conﬁ- 
(CIs). Analyses were performed using 
dence intervals 

Statistical Analysis System (version 9.4: SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC). 
Our ﬁndings by race and ethnicity are shown 
RESULTS: 
in the Table. Singleton preterm birth rates using standard 
categories were unchanged during the pandemic period 
except the 28þ0 to 31þ6 weeks subset, which showed a 
modest increase (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03e1.20). This was 
driven primarily by the Hispanic or Latinx population. 
The overall rate of preterm birth (<37 weeks’ gestation) 
was unchanged for all race and ethnicity categories. No 
changes in preterm birth rates were noted when analyzed 
region, or a combination with race and 
by payer, 
ethnicity (data not shown).

Preterm birth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic: population-wide and by race and ethnicity 


CONCLUSION: 
Contrary to earlier reports, we found no 
evidence of a reduction in preterm birth rates for any racial 
and ethnic groups. This ﬁnding differs from reports from 
Ireland2 and Denmark,1 which may reﬂect 
their small 
samples and lower severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates as of August 
1, 2020, compared with the reports 
from California 
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention has recently reported 
rates of preterm births among mothers with 
higher 
second-trimester 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections 
but not in asymptomatic cases.4 The ﬁnding of an 11% 
increase in the 28e32 week preterm birth rate among the 
Hispanic or Latinx population is consistent with higher 
direct and indirect pandemic effects for that community. 
However, this ﬁnding should be approached with caution 
subsets of preterm birth were not 
given that other 
increased. The 
pregnancy 
pandemic 
outcomes through indirect mechanisms by changes in 
daily 
and 
and 
utilization of healthcare services.5 More broadly, our 
ﬁndings underscore the need for caution in assessing the 
impact of the pandemic in small populations and over 
- 
short periods.
