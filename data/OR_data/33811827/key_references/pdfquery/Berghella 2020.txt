coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic 
OBJECTIVE: 
Although most studies have reported an in- 
crease in preterm birth (PTB) in pregnant women with severe 
or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection,1 
population-level European reports offer conﬂicting data on 
a decrease2,3 or stability4 in the overall rate of PTB during 
the pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence 
of PTB at our institution, in the North-East of the United 
States, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared 
with the similar period in 2019. 
STUDY DESIGN: 
Birth data at Thomas Jefferson University 
Hospital were accessed by a query of the electronic medical 
record; 2 time periods were examined: March 1 to July 31, 
2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), and March 1 to July 
31, 2019 (before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). The 
inclusion criteria were all births at (cid:1)20 weeks’ gestation, 
inclusive of 
fetal 
anomalies, and multiple gestations. Individual charts were 
accessed for women who delivered preterm to conﬁrm the

incidence of PTB between the 2 groups, before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included the 
incidences of late PTB (34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks’ gestation), 
early PTB (<34 weeks’ gestation) and very early PTB (<28 
weeks’ gestation), and perinatal death (fetal and neonatal 
death) 
of 
spontaneous and iatrogenic PTB were also performed. Chi- 
and 95%

conﬁdence intervals (CIs) was used for categorical variables 
and adjusted OR (aOR) for demographic differences using 
regression analysis. P<.05 was 
multivariable 
considered statistically signiﬁcant. 







There was a signiﬁcantly decreased incidence of 
RESULTS: 
PTB in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 
the 2019 period (9.9% vs 12.6%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.58e0.99) (Table). After adjusting for race/ethnicity, the 
signiﬁcantly 
2020 period remained associated with a 
decreased incidence of PTB (aOR, 
95% CI, 
compared with the 2019 preeCOVID-19 
0.57e0.99) 
period. There were also signiﬁcant decreases in PTB at <34 
weeks’ gestation (2.5% vs 4.7%; aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 
0.31e0.82) and PTB at <28 weeks’ gestation (0.6% vs 
1.5%; aOR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15e0.93) in 2020 compared 

with 2019. The rate of late PTB at 34e36 weeks’ gestation 
was similar between groups (Table) (Figure). Subgroup 
analyses of just spontaneous or just iatrogenic PTB did not 
reveal signiﬁcant differences, except for a 60% decrease in 
iatrogenic PTB at <34 weeks’ gestation in 2020 compared 
with 2019 (Table). The incidences of mode of delivery and 
perinatal death were similar between time periods (Table). 
Notably, 8 of 
the 118 PTB (6.8%) in the 2020 period 
occurred in COVID-19epositive women. The incidence of 
PTB in COVID-19epositive women (most diagnosed 
during pregnancy because of symptoms) was 14.5% (8 of 
55) and did not differ signiﬁcantly compared with the rest 
of the women in the 2020 group (110 of 1142; 9.6%; OR, 
1.60; 95% CI, 0.74e3.47). The incidence of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity on the labor 
and delivery universal screening between April 13, 2020 
(when we started), and July 31, 2020, was 4.5% (40 of 878). 
This United States study reported a signiﬁcant 
CONCLUSION: 
(25%) decrease in the odds of PTB during the COVID-19 
pandemic compared with a similar prepandemic period in 
the peer-reviewed literature. In particular, we identiﬁed a 
signiﬁcant decrease in early PTB (49% decrease for <34 
weeks’ 
for <28 weeks’ 
gestation), which have the highest risk of neonatal morbidity

BOX 
Possible reasons for the decrease in the incidence 
of PTB during COVID-19 pandemic 
- Less stress and anxiety: work from home 
- Other work changes: no shift work, no long hours, and less 
physical work 
- Better support systems: partner and family 
- Better nutrition 
- More exercise 
- Better hygiene and fewer social 
fections 
- Less smoking owing to being indoor and fewer chances of 
drug use because of the lockdown 
- Less car driving: less stress and fewer accidents 
- Less air pollution 
- Government ﬁnancial assistance 
- Fewer medical interventions 





and mortality (Table). When analyzing the subgroup of 
spontaneous PTB, data pointed to a decrease in spontaneous 
PTB at different cutoffs, but none was signiﬁcant, probably 
owing to a type II error. When analyzing the subgroup of 
iatrogenic PTB, most—but not all—data also pointed to a 
decrease in iatrogenic PTB at different cutoffs and by race/ 
ethnicity, with iatrogenic PTB at <34 weeks’ gestation 
signiﬁcantly decreased by 60% (Table). The incidences of 
cesarean delivery and perinatal death were not different. The 
major limitation of this study is only accounting for race/ 
ethnicity and no other sociodemographic data as possible 
confounders. The decrease in PTB, 
in particular in early 
(<34 weeks’ gestation) and very early (<28 weeks’ gestation) 
PTBs, is consistent with 2 previous reports from Denmark2 
and Ireland,3 but differs from a United Kingdom report that 
did not report changes in the incidence of PTB.4 
The reasons for a decrease in PTB during the COVID-19 
pandemic are unclear, and it is notable that the decrease 
seemed to be both in spontaneous and indicated PTBs, but 
these subgroup analyses were small and probably under- 
powered. Several hypotheses can be postulated (Box). In 
particular, reduced work hours, reduced physical and/or 
emotional stress of work, being home with support from 
family, being able to have time to exercise, and reduced 
exposure to environmental pollutants from reduced air 
pollution could all be plausible explanations, among others, 
but require further study. In particular, the decrease in iat- 
rogenic PTB could be related to reduced antepartum sur- 
veillance that would prompt a delivery. The examination of 
PTB rate should be evaluated in conjunction with fetal 
demise/neonatal morbidity and mortality rates as reduced 
access to care can certainly result in a rise in both.5 Further 
research is needed on the potential differential beneﬁt among 

racial/ethnic groups (current analysis being limited by sample 
sizes and potential for type II error) and on how practice 
changes during the pandemic affect population-level out- 
comes. If replicated in larger populations, this decrease in 
PTB opens a whole new avenue for investigation, because no 
single intervention has been shown to have such a major 
effect on the incidence of PTB in the general population.
