infected with severe acute respiratory syn- 
drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as of August 
10, 2020.1 Although the burden of maternal mortal- 
ity related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
in high-income countries appears limited, low- and 
middle-income countries may be affected differ- 
ently.2 The Mexican Ministry of Health publishes 
weekly epidemiologic reports describing the count 
of total maternal deaths, their causes, and the mater- 
nal mortality ratio.3 Using this open source, we 
aimed to estimate the weekly number, weekly per- 
centage, and total number of excess deaths from all 
causes that could be directly or indirectly attributed 
to COVID-19 based on preliminary weekly counts 
of deaths from 2011 through the 32nd week of 2020 
(August 3–9). In addition, we describe the maternal 
mortality ratio over time and causes of mortality 
since 2011.

METHODS 
Weekly maternal death counts for 2020 were com- 
pared with documented trends from prior years to 
determine whether the number of deaths was higher 
than expected. Namely, Farrington surveillance algo- 
rithms4 based on Poisson generalized linear models 
with overdispersion were used to estimate the upper 
bound (ie, upper limit of the 95% prediction interval) 
for the predicted number of deaths per week of 2020. 
This was based on weekly death counts from 2011, 
when the Mexican Ministry of Health epidemiologic 
reports first became available, 
through 2019. The 
number of excess deaths was estimated as the differ- 
ence between the observed count and the predicted 
upper bound by week. The percent excess was calcu- 
lated as the number of excess deaths divided by the 
upper bound by week. The total number of excess 
deaths reflected a summation of the number of excess 
deaths between the 1st and 32nd week of 2020. Sta- 
tistical analysis was performed using R 4.0.0. 
RESULTS 
According to predictions from the Mexican Ministry 
of Health, the anticipated maternal mortality ratio in 
Mexico for 2020 was 29.5 per 100,000 live births, a 
stark contrast to the actual maternal mortality ratio of 
42.4 that has been calculated thus far for 2020.3 
Maternal mortality stratified by cause in Mexico from 
2011 to 2020 is shown in Table 1. From the 1st 
through the 32nd week of 2020 (August 3–9), 523 
maternal deaths have been reported. Importantly, 
COVID-19 is now the leading cause of maternal mor- 
tality in Mexico.3 Compared with previous years, the 
proportion of deaths from respiratory causes (32%) is 
higher in 2020 compared with any other timepoint in 
this analysis. The weekly number and weekly percent- 
age of excess maternal deaths from all causes for 2020

Fig. 1. Excess maternal deaths in Mexico for 2020 up to the 32nd epidemiologic week. Each bar represents 1 week. The 
blue line represents the upper bound for the predicted number of maternal deaths per week of 2020, based on weekly 
maternal death counts from 2011 through 2019. The observations above this line represent the number of excess deaths, and 
those weeks are highlighted with a triangle. Mexico entered the most serious and widespread phase 3 transmission of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in week 17. Thus far, there have been 86 excess maternal deaths from all causes in 
2020, distributed as follows: 1, 12, 8, 7, 6, 2, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 14, and 15 for the 18th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 26th, 27th, 
28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and 32nd weeks, respectively. The percent excess for the weeks listed above was 6%, 75%, 50%, 
44%, 38%, 12%, 25%, 25%, 28%, 18%, 28%, 82%, and 88%, respectively.

are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. Overall, there 
were 86 excess maternal deaths reported from all 
causes thus far (weeks 1–32) in 2020. 
DISCUSSION 
In contrast with maternal outcomes in economically 
advanced countries,2 our results suggest higher mor- 
tality among pregnant women in Mexico during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, similar consequences 
were observed during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, 
where an excess of 211 maternal deaths in Mexico 
were reported for that year.5 

We acknowledge the limitations of our study. The 
data reported by the Mexican Ministry of Health are 
provisional, and there is evidence of continued 
increasing rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, 
our 
should be interpreted with caution, 
because an underestimation of maternal deaths cannot 
be ruled out. In addition, our analysis of excess deaths 
is limited to the evaluation of death from all causes. 
Similar to our findings in Mexico, it is possible 
that other low- and middle-income countries have 
experienced a disproportionate burden of maternal 
mortality related to COVID-19. Renewed focus on 
improving the structural competency of health care 
systems6 in Mexico and other underresourced coun- 
tries is urgently needed to mitigate the adverse effects 
of COVID-19 on maternal health.
