pregnant women in labour 

At a tertiary health-care level in India, which is mainly 
provided by medical colleges and advanced medical 
research 
is 
given to patients who are referred from primary and 
secondary medical care, along with general care for the 
local community.1 The maternal mortality ratio in India 
has reduced by 78%, from 556 per 100 000 livebirths 
in 1990 to 122 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015–17, 
mainly because of an increase in institutional deliveries 
(from 18% in 2005 to 79% in 2016) and an effective 
referral system for emergency obstetric care.2 As per 
one estimate, for each maternal death, approximately 
15 pregnancies develop complications that require 
tertiary obstetric care.3 


India has reported about 
198 706 cases and nearly 5598 deaths attributed to 
the novel COVID-19 pandemic. This current pandemic 
has resulted in the major allocation of health-care 
infrastructure and human resources, including emer- 
gency services and intensive care unit beds, for the care 
of patients infected with this virus; and little is known 
about how this change to the Indian health-care system 
has affected the care of pregnant women. 
Although the implementation of a lockdown by 
the government slowed the community spread of 
COVID-19, it could have inadvertently affected the 
emergency obstetric care for referred women through 
the suspension of public transport, because most 
pregnant women in India still use public transport 
for emergency visits.4 Additionally, unprecedented 
apprehension because of the rapid spread of the 
pandemic might have resulted in hospital-avoiding 
behaviour among pregnant women. 
We did a retrospective analysis of pregnant women 
across four hospitals in an integrated tertiary care 
medical college in western India during the 10 weeks 
after lockdown (March 25–June 2, 2020; lockdown was 
imposed on March 25, 2020) and compared the findings 
with a control period of the 10 weeks before lockdown 
(Jan 15–March 24, 2020, when the number of COVID-19 
attributed deaths were ≤10). 

initial analysis of women admitted during 
the lockdown period revealed a 43·2% reduction in

hospitalisation compared with the control period 
(3527 vs 6209) and a 49·8% reduction compared 
with the same calendar period from the previous 
year (3527 vs 7031; appendix). Referred obstetric 
emergencies also decreased by 66·4% (304 vs 905). 
This result was contrary to an expected increase in 
referred cases because of interrupted antenatal care 
among patients with high-risk pregnancies and the 
unavailability of emergency care at private health-care 
facilities, because most of these facilities were either 
leased by the government for patients with COVID-19 
or they themselves refused to cater such referred 
patients in view of the shortage of paramedical staff and 
intensive care unit beds. 
Among the pregnant women from the lockdown 
period, 37·03% underwent a caesarean section, which 
was significantly higher than the rate during the pre- 
lockdown period (of 6209 patients, 33·0% underwent 
a caesarean section; p=0·04). Compared with the pre- 
lockdown group, women delivering in the tertiary 
facilities after lockdown were more likely to be literate 
(64·4 vs 61·4%) and primigravidae (59·0 vs 44·0%). 
We also observed a significantly increased in-hospital 
mortality among pregnant women (0·20 vs 0·13%; 
p=0·01) and late intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth 
(3·15 vs 2·25%; p=0·02) during the post-lockdown 
period, compared with the pre-lockdown period. 
These findings of substantially reduced numbers of 
pregnant women hospitalised for labour management 
at tertiary care centres suggest that the number of 
unattended deliveries and those at lower-level facilities 
has increased. Immense media coverage along with 
stay-at-home and physical distancing advice from public 
health officials during the initial phase of the pandemic 
might have led to hospital-avoiding behaviour among 
pregnant women even before the implementation of 
the lockdown. A decrease in the proportion of referred 
cases is even more alarming, as these are the women 
in whom timely intervention decreases the maternal 
and neonatal mortality. Hospitals are now perceived 
as reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 and women are avoiding hospital visits 
even when they require tertiary-level care; and, a 



reduction of the availability of public transit systems 
during lockdown further hinders access to tertiary care 
for referred women from rural areas. This current study 
showed a substantial rise in late intrauterine fetal death 
and stillbirth, along with in-hospital maternal mortality, 
which might be because of the delayed presentation of 
women requiring emergency obstetric care. 
The current case fatality rate for COVID-19 in India is 
approximately 2·9%, which is far less than that of other 
serious ailments, and we presume that many women 
with a complex pregnancy have died at peripheral 
centres, waiting too long for a timely referral. This 
consequence shows how a public health emergency like 
COVID-19 can indirectly and adversely affect unrelated 
serious diseases. 
Given these findings, there is a dire need for patient 
educational campaigns and the encouragement of 
public health officials, media, and local physicians to 
address patients’ apprehension, and to convey that it 
is safe to come to the hospital for emergency obstetric 
care, which 
if untreated, has a higher morbidity 
and mortality rate compared with COVID-19. Also, 
government and public health officials should ensure 
separate and secure treatment pathways for the care 
of pregnant women, along with the provision of an 
adequate number of emergency ambulances at primary 
and secondary health-care facilities for patients in 
emergency obstetric care requiring urgent referral.
