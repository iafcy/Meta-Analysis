Objective The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with excess mortality and 
morbidity in adults and teenagers over 14 years of age, but there is still limited evidence on 
the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on pregnancy. We aimed to evaluate the 
effect of the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetrical emergency attendance in a 
low-risk population and the corresponding perinatal outcomes. 
Study Design This is a single center retrospective cohort study of all singleton births 
between February 21 and April 30. Prenatal emergency labor ward admission numbers and 
obstetric outcomes during the peak of the ﬁrst COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Israel were 
compared with the combined corresponding periods for the years 2017 to 2019. 
Results During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of prenatal emer- 
gency labor ward admissions was lower, both by daily count and per woman, in 
comparison to the combined matching periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (48.6 (cid:1) 12.2 
vs. 57.8 (cid:1) 14.4, p < 0.0001 and 1.74 (cid:1) 1.1 vs. 1.92 (cid:1) 1.2, p < 0.0001, respectively). A 
signiﬁcantly (p ¼ 0.0370) higher rate of stillbirth was noted in the study group (0.4%) 
compared with the control group (0.1%). All study group patients were negative for 
COVID-19. Gestational age at delivery, rates of premature delivery at <28, 34, and 
37 weeks, pregnancy complications, postdate delivery at >40 and 41 weeks, mode of 
delivery, and numbers of emergency cesarean deliveries were similar in both groups. 
There was no difference in the intrapartum fetal death rate between the groups. 
Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home policy combined with patient fear 
of contracting the disease in hospital could explain the associated higher rate of 
stillbirth. This collateral perinatal damage follows a decreased in prenatal emergency 
labor ward admissions during the ﬁrst wave of COVID-19 in Israel. 
Key Points 
(cid:129) Less obstetrical ER attendance is observed during the pandemic. 
(cid:129) There is a parallel increase in stillbirth rate. 
(cid:129) Stillbirth cases tested negative for COVID-19. 
(cid:129) Lockdown and pandemic panic are possible causes. 

Excess deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in late December 2019 is 
now well documented. Pooled estimates of all-cause mortality 
for 24 European countries/federal states, participating in the 
European monitoring of excess mortality for public health 
action network for the period March to April 2020, have shown 
excess mortality in all age groups over 14 years old.1 In Israel, 
the ﬁrst COVID-19 case was diagnosed on February 21, 2020, 
and from the beginning of March onward, strict restrictions on 
movement and gathering were imposed. On March 11, 2020, 
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO)2 and on March 23, 2020, full lockdown 
was imposed in Israel. 
The importance of routine obstetrical care is well estab- 
lished, especially in high-risk pregnancies, and health 
authorities around the world have issued instructions and 
guidance for antenatal and perinatal care not to be disrupted 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identiﬁcation of preg- 
nant women needing rapid interventions, including induc- 
tion of labor or emergency cesarean section, is considered as 
critical as interventions for cardiovascular emergencies.3–6 
Furthermore, even if most pregnant women infected with 
COVID-19, only develop mild or moderate symptoms,7–10 
early reports published in April and May 2020 showed that 
women in the third-trimester of gestation were at higher risk 
for critical illness7 and preterm cesarean delivery for mater- 
nal indications.10–12 
Recent studies have shown that most neonates born to 
infected mothers are asymptomatic, and there is only limited 
evidence suggesting vertical transmission.7,8,11,13 A small 
case series of ﬁve stillbirths in infected mother from Brazil 
has suggested that secondary chorioamnionitis due to 
COVID-19 as the cause for fetal death.14 A population-based 
descriptive study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System 
has reported a 2.5-fold increase in incidence of stillbirth at 
the beginning of the pandemic compared with the national 
rate in 2019.15 A more recent study from one center in the 
United Kingdom comparing the changes in incidence of 
stillbirth and preterm birth has also found an increase in 
stillbirths between February 1 and mid-June 2020 compared 
with October 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020.16 However, as 
there is a seasonal impact on births and stillbirths,17,18 the 
comparison of different periods of the year may have skewed 
the data in both studies. 
For a short period of time, at the start of the pandemic, access 
to antenatal clinics was limited due to the need for maternity 
services to put in place special measures required to prevent 
nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and medical staff short- 
age due to self-isolation after exposure to an infected patient or 
relative. In addition, and similarly to other medical specialities 
such as cardiovascular diseases,3–6 pregnant women’s fear of 
contracting infection during a hospital visit must have had an 
impact on prenatal consultation attendance. In the present 
study, we have evaluated the effect of the ﬁrst peak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Israel on prenatal care and obstetrical 
outcomes compared with the same periods for the year 2017, 
2018, and 2019. 


This is a retrospective cohort study of prenatal care and obstetri- 
cal outcomes between February 21 and April 30, 2020, com- 
pared with the same period of the year in 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
Study Population 
All pregnant women with singleton gestation admitted during 
the COVID-19 peak period (study group) and the corresponding 
periodin2017to2019(controlgroup)tothelabor wardinShamir 
Medical Center (Zeriﬁn, Israel), which is atertiaryanduniversity- 
afﬁliated hospital, with approximately 9,000 deliveries per ayear 
were included in the study. Premature previable deliveries <24 
weeks, multiple pregnancies, and deliveries following feticide 
were excluded from the study groups. Demographic, obstetrical, 
and neonatal data were retrieved from computerized medical 
records and the hospital’s laboratory database. Data collected for 
each participant included maternal age, gravidity, parity, and 
previous cesarean deliveries. Obstetrical and neonatal data 
collected included, induction of labor, mode of delivery and 
indication for cesarean delivery if preformed, date and time of 
birth, Apgar’s score at 5 minutes, arterial umbilical cord pH, 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and perinatal 
mortality. For stillbirth cases, stillbirth-weight percentiles were 
calculated according to nationally accepted growth curves for 
gestational week and gender.19 In addition, the following were 
reviewed:maternalCOVID-19test resultsatadmission,presence 
of meconium stained or bloody amniotic ﬂuid at the time of 
membrane rupture, pregnancy follow-up, placental and umbili- 
cal cord abnormalities as examined by the department of 
pathology, and fetal dysmorphism as noted in the labor ward 
following obstetric and midwife examination after delivery. 
The primary outcome was fetal death, categorized into 
antepartum (stillbirth) or intrapartum. Secondary outcomes 
were gestational age at birth, maternal diabetes, maternal 
pregnancy induced hypertension, induction of labor, mode 
of delivery, type of cesarean delivery (elective, nonelective, or 
intrapartum), birthweight, 5-minute Apgar’s score, umbilical 
artery cord pH, and NICU admission (for more information, 
please refer to “Deﬁnitions” in the ►Supplementary Material, 
available in the online version). 
The study was approved by the local institutional review 
board (approval no. 0134–20-ASF). Informed consent was 
waived due to the retrospective design of the study. 
Statistical Analysis 
The SAS (SAS Cooperation, Version 34.0, NC) data analysis and 
statistical software package was used to analyze the data. A 
standard Kurtosis analysis indicated that the values were 
normally distributed, and the data are therefore continuous 
variables presented as mean and standard deviation. Categori- 
cal variables are presented as count and percentages. Pearson’s 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, were used 
to compare between the study and control groups with respect 
to categorical variables. Independent samples t-test was used 
to compare the means of the two groups for continuous 
variables. All p-values were determined with two-tailed tests. 
A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

2,633 (cid:1) 1,066 g, p ¼ 0.43; gestational weeks at fetal death diag- 
nosis and stillbirth weight, study, and control groups, respec- 
tively). Women in both groups self-referred for medical 
evaluation after either experiencing decreased fetal movements 
or contractions. A stillbirth was diagnosed in the absence of fetal 
heartbeat on ultrasound examination. Women were delivered 
either vaginally or by cesarean section depending on obstetrical 
indication. All the women who experienced stillbirth in the 
study group were tested and found negative for COVID-19. 
In ﬁve out of the total 11 cases of stillbirth recorded in the 
study and control groups, histopathology ﬁndings were sug- 
gestive of placental insufﬁciency. In three of these cases in the 
study group, the fetal birthweight was below the 10th centile 
for gestational age, whereas in the controls one stillbirth 
presented with anhydramnios and one presented with both 
a birth weight below the 10th centile and anhydramnios. 
Histopathologic ﬁndings suggesting a cord accident as the 
cause of fetal death were found only in the study group 
including one case with a true knot of cord and the other 
with a pathological narrowing of a portion of the cord. One 
stillbirth from each group presented with blood in the amni- 
otic ﬂuid, suggesting a placental abruption. One stillbirth in 
the study group was diagnosed with chorioamnionitis due to 



There were 1,556 births registered during ﬁrst wave of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The control group included 1,578, 
1,545, and 1,441 newborns that were delivered during the 
same period of the year in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively 
(►Fig. 1). 
Maternal age, race/ethnicity, the rate of prior cesarean 
deliveries, maternal diabetes, and hypertensive rates were all 
similar between groups (►Table 1). The mean gravidity and 
parity were increased in the study group (3.0 (cid:1) 2.0 vs. 
2.7 (cid:1) 1.7, p < 0.0001; 1.5 (cid:1) 1.6 vs. 1.3 (cid:1) 1.3, p < .0001; gra- 
vidity and parity, for the study and control groups, respec- 
tively), and the nulliparity rate did not differ between groups 
(30.2 vs. 32.2%, p ¼ 0.15). 
During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the average number 
of prenatal emergency labor ward admission was lower, both 
by daily count and per woman, in comparison to the combined 
corresponding periods in 2017 to 2019 (48.6 (cid:1) 12.2 vs. 
57.8 (cid:1) 14.4, p < 0.0001; 1.74 (cid:1) 1.1 vs. 1.92 (cid:1) 1.2, p < 0.0001, 
respectively; ►Fig. 2). 
A signiﬁcantly (p ¼ 0.037) higher rate of stillbirth was found 
in the study group (6/1,556, 0.4%) compared with the control 
group (5/4,564, 0.1%). There was no difference in the mean 
gestational age at the diagnosis of fetal death or the postdelivery 
stillbirth mean weight between study and control groups

Escherichia coli. One case from the study group and two from 
the control group presented with meconium stained amniotic 
ﬂuid. Two women from the control group had no pathological 
ﬁndings. Two women from the study group had a previous 
stillbirth. All stillbirth infants were examined in detailed by the 
perinatal pathologist, and none showed dysmorphic signs. 
None of the women who experienced stillbirth had diabetes 
or hypertension. 
One case of intrapartum fetal death occurred in the 
control group, but none were reported in the study group 
(►Table 2). Gestational age at birth and rates of premature 
delivery at <28, 34, and 37 weeks, postdate delivery at >40 
and 41 weeks, mode of delivery, and number of emergency 
cesarean delivery were similar in both groups. The induction 
of labor rate in the study group was higher compared with 
the control group (32.3 vs. 28.2% of all deliveries, study, and 
control group respectively, p ¼ 0.0005). The study group had 
more cases of 5-minute Apgar’s score lower than 7 (0.7 vs. 
0.3%, p ¼ 0.021), but the umbilical artery pH and the NICU 
admission rates did not differ (►Table 3). 
Principal Findings of the Study 
The data of our study indicate that the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 
pandemic was associated with a decline in pregnant women 






































attendance to the obstetrical emergency room, which could 
explain a parallel increase in the stillbirth rate compared with 
the same period in the previous 3 years. As all stillbirth cases in 
the present study tested negative for COVID-19 virus, the higher 
stillbirth rate may be considered as collateral damage from the 
stay at home mandates and fear of catching the virus in the 
hospital setting during the early stage of the pandemic. 
Comparison with Existing Literature 
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous strain on 
health care systems worldwide across all medical speciali- 
ties. From the start of the outbreak, many health care work- 
ers from different medical emergency specialities noticed a 
reduction in patient admissions for diseases not directly 
related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, a decline in 
the number of hospital admissions for acute coronary syn- 
drome has been observed across Italy and United States 
during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which correlates 
with higher mortality and morbidity.3–6 A similar reduction 
in pediatric emergency department attendance with delayed 
treatment was also observed in Italy in March 2020 com- 
pared with previous years, resulting in poorer outcomes in 
many cases.20 
By contrast to countries such as Italy, Spain, China, and the 
United States, the number of hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19 in Israel was relatively low and did not impact 
on the distribution of emergency medical services for non- 
COVID-19 related conditions.21 Most health care resources 
were not relocated to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
in particular, there were no competing needs for equipment 
and lack of beds in our hospital. Our data therefore suggest 
that the decrease in prenatal emergency labor ward admis- 
sion in our study was mainly due to the fear by pregnant 
women of contracting SARS-CoV-2. This fear was particularly 
high after the media diffused the news that the infection was 
largely spread across hospitalized patients and health care 
personnel due to the lack of personal protection equipment. 
This patient factor has been reported in previous pandemics9 
and may lead to pregnant women ignoring symptoms such as 
decreased fetal movements or not getting standard obstetri- 
cal care including regular glycemic control or screening for 
hypertensive disorders, which are known to be associated 
with higher stillbirth rate.22,23 
Clinical Implications 
Most women infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and 
national survey of the outcome of 427 pregnant women 
admitted to hospital with conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
between March 1, 2020 and April 14, 2020 has found that 10% 
required intensive care support and 1% died.15 SARS-CoV-2, 
outcomes are linked to various preexisting comorbidities such 
as hypertension or diabetes and morbidity disproportionately, 
affects those of lower socioeconomic status and particularly 
ethnic minorities.24 
The recent study by Khalil et al16 found fewer nulliparous 
women and showed both a decrease in the number of pregnant 
women with hypertension and an increase in the number of 
stillbirths at the start of the pandemic compared with the 
period immediately before. Our data conﬁrm an increase in 
stillbirths at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, that 
is, February 21 and April 30, 2020 compared the same periods 
of 3 consecutive years before accounting for the seasonal17,18 
effect. By contrast, we found no differences in maternal 
hypertension and nulliparity rates between the groups. We 
also observed no difference in the premature delivery rates for 
any gestational periods at between 28 and 37 weeks, indicating 
that the increase in stillbirth rate was the main perinatal 
impact of the of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. 
None of the women with pregnancies complicated by 
stillbirth included in the present study tested positive for 
COVID-19. Women from ethnic minorities account for less 
than 10% in our population, which is much lower that the 
United States16 or the United States. Although the rates of 
stillbirths increased signiﬁcantly during the peak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in our population, it remains overall 
much lower than in the United States. These ﬁndings suggest 
that complications such as diabetes and hypertension, which 
are more common in women from ethnic minorities, did not 
inﬂuence the stillbirth rate in our study. Other confounding 
factors including as reduced mobility and exercise, increase 
smoking exposure, increased caloric intake, poor glycemic 
control for pregestational and gestational diabetic women, 
poor supervision, and control of hypertensive complications, 
as well as uncontrolled thyroid disorders23,25 could have 
indirectly contributed to risk of stillbirth during the lockdown. 

The strengths of our study lie in it being from a single center, 
with uniform data documentation and clinical evaluation 
approach. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the 
ﬁrst study investigating the association between obstetrical 
care during the COVID-19 pandemic and stillbirth. The main 
limitation of our study is its retrospective design, with limited 
data available for some parameters. In addition, multiple 
gestations, which are a major risk factor for stillbirth, were 
excluded because of their relatively small number in this short 
period. Because of religious reasons, the Israeli population often 
declines postmortem autopsies, and therefore, this information 
is limited to placental examination in both the study and control 
groups. However, all cases of stillbirth are examined externally 
by a trained perinatal pathologist and did not show evidence of 
fetal dysmorphism in both groups. A considerable reduction in 
the community clinic activity could have inﬂuenced the avail- 
ability of medical services, but these data were not available. 

The COVID-19 pandemic is a generation-deﬁning global med- 
ical phenomenon, the scope, scale, and pace of which is 
unprecedented. Despite the limited impact of SARS-CoV-2 
on the overall health of pregnant women, our data have shown 
a decrease in prenatal emergency labor ward admissions 
parallel with an increase in the number of stillbirths during 
the ﬁrst peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This collateral 
damage was not due to a reduce access to our maternity 


services during that period but is more likely due to the patient 
fear of contracting the infection during hospital visits, and like 
for other medical specialities may have discouraged them to 
access emergency medical services during the ﬁrst peak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. These ﬁndings support government 
guidance in maintaining adequate emergency prenatal care 
during pandemic and in informing pregnant women about the 
need to attend routine prenatal consultation.
