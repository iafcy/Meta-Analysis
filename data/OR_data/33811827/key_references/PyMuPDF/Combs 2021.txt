Singleton preterm birth rates for racial and ethnic
groups during the coronavirus disease 2019
pandemic in California
OBJECTIVE:
Reports from Denmark1 and the Limerick
region in Ireland2 noted dramatic reductions in preterm
births during the initial months of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We sought to assess the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on preterm birth rates
in a large racially diverse population during the peak
months of the pandemic. Approximately 1 in 8 births in
the
United
States
occurs
to
California
residents,
a
population that is among the most diverse in the country.
STUDY DESIGN:
The Hispanic or Latinx community ac-
counts for 39% of California’s population and 46% of births
but has experienced 61% of the state’s COVID-19 cases and
48% of COVID-19erelated deaths; the black community,
which constitutes 6% of the population, accounts for 4%
of cases and 8% of deaths (https://covid19.ca.gov/data-
and-tools/). Under the auspices of state and Stanford’s
Institutional
Review
Boards,

data on all births in California to support state-wide
quality improvement activities.3 Race and ethnicity are
self-identiﬁed.
We examined birth outcomes for the months that corre-
sponded with the peak effects of the pandemic: April 2020 to
July 2020. A state-wide COVID-19 lockdown began in Cali-
fornia on March 19, 2020, with caseloads peaking ﬁrst mid-
April 2020 and followed by a much higher peak in mid-July
2020 with more than 12,000 new cases per day (https://
covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/).
We
compared
these
4
months in 2020 to the same 4-month period aggregated over
the previous 4 years (2016e2019) using logistic regression
models to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conﬁ-
dence
intervals
(CIs).
Analyses
were
performed
using
Statistical Analysis System (version 9.4: SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS:
Our ﬁndings by race and ethnicity are shown
in the Table. Singleton preterm birth rates using standard
categories were unchanged during the pandemic period
except the 28þ0 to 31þ6 weeks subset, which showed a
modest increase (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03e1.20). This was
driven primarily by the Hispanic or Latinx population.
The overall rate of preterm birth (<37 weeks’ gestation)
was unchanged for all race and ethnicity categories. No
changes in preterm birth rates were noted when analyzed
by
payer,
region,
or
a
combination
with
race
and
ethnicity (data not shown).

CONCLUSION:
Contrary to earlier reports, we found no
evidence of a reduction in preterm birth rates for any racial
and ethnic groups. This ﬁnding differs from reports from
Ireland2 and Denmark,1 which may reﬂect their small
samples and lower severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates as of August
1, 2020, compared with the reports from California
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has recently reported
higher rates of preterm births among mothers with
second-trimester
symptomatic
SARS-CoV-2
infections
but not in asymptomatic cases.4 The ﬁnding of an 11%
increase in the 28e32 week preterm birth rate among the
Hispanic or Latinx population is consistent with higher
direct and indirect pandemic effects for that community.
However, this ﬁnding should be approached with caution
given that other subsets of preterm birth were not
increased.
The
pandemic
could
affect
pregnancy
outcomes through indirect mechanisms by changes in
daily
activities,
social
and
economic
effects,
and
utilization of healthcare services.5 More broadly, our
ﬁndings underscore the need for caution in assessing the
impact of the pandemic in small populations and over
short periods.
