Impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the incidence of 
preterm birth: a national quasi-experimental study

Summary
Background Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors experiencing long-term 
adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following 
implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study 
the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, 
March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth.
Methods We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from 
the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010−20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. 
Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess 
robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, 
and small-for-gestational-age status.
Findings Data on 1 599 547 singleton neonates were available, including 56 720 births that occurred after 
implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of 
preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 (± 2 months [n=531 823] odds ratio 
[OR] 0∙77, 95% CI 0∙66–0∙91, p=0∙0026; ± 3 months [n=796 531] OR 0∙85, 0∙73–0∙98, p=0∙028; ± 4 months 
[n=1 066 872] OR 0∙84, 0∙73–0∙97, p=0∙023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were 
of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the 
incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity 
analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not 
statistically significant.
Interpretation In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures 
was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement 
with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further 
substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to 
prevent the spread of infection and mitigate its population 
health effects are having an unprecedented impact on 
society. The sudden occurrence of the pandemic and the 
scale and immediacy of the policy responses taken 
provide a unique opportunity to evaluate their effects as a 
natural experiment.1 Reports from Denmark2 and Ireland3 
independently provided evidence indicating substantial 
reductions in the number of extremely preterm and very-
low-birthweight births following national COVID-19 
mitigation measures. Several potential underlying 
mecha­nisms have been proposed, including improve­
ments in ambient air quality and reductions in maternal 
stress and incidence of infections.3
The first recognised COVID-19 case in the Netherlands 
was confirmed in Noord-Brabant, one of twelve Dutch 
provinces, on Feb 27, 2020.4 The first COVID-19-related 
death occurred on March 6, and from that day, people 
living in Noord-Brabant were advised to stay indoors if 
they had possible COVID-19 symptoms. On separate 
occasions between March 9 and March 23, several 
national measures were then taken and widely 
communicated in an attempt to mitigate the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands (panel; 
appendix p 1).5–8
Globally, more than one in ten babies are born preterm, 
and preterm birth is the primary contributor to mortality 
in early life.9 Additionally, preterm birth survivors and 
their families frequently experience long-term adverse 
consequences.10–13 Very few cases of preterm birth can be 
prevented using currently available strategies.14 As such, 
exploration of the possible link between national 
lockdown measures and a decrease in preterm births is 
needed, and if confirmed, so is identification of the 
underlying mechanisms to inform and optimise future 
approaches to prevent preterm birth from devastating 
families’ lives.

Although the link between COVID-19 mitigation 
measures and reductions in the incidence of preterm 
birth identified in the aforementioned Danish and Irish 
studies has sparked substantial optimism globally 
regarding its potential to help identify new clues for 
effective prevention, the evidence base is still small.2,3 
Both studies had relatively small sample sizes and the 
methods used restrict causal interpretation.2,3 We, 
therefore, aimed to use a much larger sample, consisting 
of routinely collected data, and a quasi-experimental 
approach to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation 
measures implemented in the Netherlands on the 
incidence of preterm birth.
Methods
Study design and participants 
We did a difference-in-regression-discontinuity analysis 
to investigate the association between the national 
implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures and 
the incidence of preterm birth in the Netherlands.
According to national guidelines,15 women with uncom­
plicated pregnancies are offered at least 6–9 antenatal 
visits, the first one ideally occurring before the tenth 
week of gestation. At this visit, crown-rump length is 
measured to estimate gestational age. All women are 
offered a fetal anomaly scan at around 20 weeks gestation. 
In 2018, 8% of primiparous women and 23% of 
multiparous women had a planned home delivery.16
We obtained data on all singleton babies who had under­
gone neonatal blood spot screening in the Netherlands 
between Oct 9, 2010, and, the most recent data available at 
the time of extraction, July 16, 2020. The study period was 
set to include 10 years and 5 months before implementation 
of the first national COVID-19 mitigation measures 
(March 9, 2020; panel). Data were provided by the National 
Institute for Public Health and the Environment as 
extracted from Praeventis.17 Praeventis is a national data­
base containing data from all babies that have undergone 
neonatal blood spot screening. In the national screening 
programme, neonates are screened for a range of diseases 
after 72 h of life. Screening can take place in the hospital 
or at home. According to national guidelines, there is no 
need to delay screening for neonates born preterm or 
on parenteral feeding.18 In 2018, 37% of neonates were 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the measures taken by governments to mitigate its impact on 
population health were followed by reductions in preterm 
births, particularly those occurring at very low gestational ages. 
We searched the MEDLINE, medRxiv, and Lancet preprint online 
databases for reports published between database inception 
and July 25, 2020, in any language that studied this association 
using the following search terms: (coronavirus OR COVID OR 
SARS-COV-2 OR lockdown) AND (preterm OR premature OR low 
birth weight OR low birthweight). We identified two relevant 
uncontrolled before-after studies. One used data from the 
Danish National Screening Biobank, and a single-centre study 
from Ireland used hospital records. In Denmark, data from 
31 180 singleton births between March 12 and April 14 in the 
years 2015–20 were analysed. A reduction in births occurring 
before 28 weeks gestation from 2∙19 per 1000 births to 
0∙19 per 1000 births was identified in the 2020 cohort versus 
the 2015–19 cohorts (p<0∙001). Among 30 705 births in the 
University Maternity Hospital Limerick in Ireland, the proportion 
of babies with very low birthweight (ie, <1500 grams; used as a 
proxy for preterm birth) dropped from 8∙18 per 1000 in the 
years 2001–2019 to 2∙17 per 1000 in 2020 (p=0∙022). None of 
the 1381 babies born in 2020 had a birthweight of less than 
1000 grams, whereas an average of 3∙0 per 1000 did before 
2020. An additional single-centre study from London (UK) 
explored pregnancy outcomes between 1681 births occurring 
before and 1718 births after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 
(rather than start of the mitigation measures). An increase in 
stillbirths from 1∙2 per 1000 births to 7∙0 per 1000 births was 
noted (p=0∙01), with no significant change in preterm births.
Added value of this study
The potential association between COVID-19 mitigation 
measures and a reduction in extremely preterm and very-
low-birthweight births, as reported in the Danish and Irish 
studies, has gained substantial attention. The studies reported 
thus far have however had relatively small sample sizes 
(up to 5162 post-implementation births) and a short 
post-implementation observational period. The uncontrolled 
before-after design used also restricts causal interpretation. We 
addressed these limitations by applying a quasi-experimental 
difference-in-regression-discontinuity design to assess the 
impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures on the incidence 
of preterm birth in the Netherlands. Using a dataset of more 
than 1∙5 million singleton births, including 56 720 post-
implementation births, we found consistent reductions in 
preterm births across various time windows surrounding the 
March 9, 2020, implementation of the first set of COVID-19 
mitigation measures. Extension of the measures on March 15 
and 23 had no demonstrable effect on preterm birth incidence.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study confirms evidence from earlier preliminary studies 
indicating that substantial reductions in preterm births 
occurred following national introduction of COVID-19 
mitigation measures. International collaborative efforts are 
needed to collate evidence from across the globe to further 
substantiate these findings and to study the underlying 
mechanisms. Such efforts could help uncover new 
opportunities for preterm birth prevention with substantial 
effects on global perinatal and public health.

screened within 96 h of birth, and 99% within the first 
week of life.19 On the neonatal dried blood spot card, 
health professionals record several maternal and neonatal 
characteristics.20
Multiple births were excluded from the analysis due to 
the inherent increased risk of preterm birth. Multiple 
records registered with identical surnames, birth dates, 
and postcode indicated multiple births. We also excluded 
babies whose registered gestational age was less than 
24 weeks and 0 days or more than 41 weeks and 6 days. 
Dutch national multidisciplinary guidelines advise 
against active management of babies born at gestational 
ages of less than 24 weeks and 0 days.21
For validation purposes, characteristics of our cohort 
were cross-referenced at aggregate level against data 
from Perined for selected years. Perined is the national 
linked pregnancy and birth registry and is based on data 
provided by midwifery, general practice, and obstetric 
and paediatric practices.16 Perined data are typically made 
available 1–2 years after initial registration of pregnancies 
and births, invalidating the use of Perined data to address 
our primary research question.
According to Dutch law (Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk 
onderzoek met mensen) no formal ethical review was 
required. According to standard procedures and under 
strict conditions that were fulfilled, National Institute for 
Public Health and the Environment allows anonymised 
data registered as part of the screening programme to be 
used for research purposes with waiver of consent.22 A 
protocol for the study was developed a priori and 
approved by National Institute for Public Health and the 
Environment before data provision.
Procedures
The following individual-level data were extracted from 
Praeventis: calendar week of birth, gestational age (in 
days), birthweight (in grams), sex, and four-digit postcode. 
Four-digit postcode identifies areas with an average of 
2160 households and was used to derive province of 
residence, neighbourhood socioeconomic status, and 
level of neighbourhood urbanisation. Neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status scores are calculated by the 
Netherlands Institute for Social Research and were 
available for 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017.23 Socioeconomic 
status scores are based on mean household income, 
proportion of population with low income, proportion of 
population with low educational level, and proportion of 
population without paid work. Urbanisation was 
dichotomised, with urban areas defined as those with 
more than 2500 residential addresses per km². Individual-
level sex-specific and gestational age-specific birthweight 
centiles were calculated using national reference curves.24
Statistical analysis
Two earlier studies2,3 have identified a link between 
national implementation of COVID-19 mitigation 
measures and a reduction in extremely preterm and 
very-low-birthweight births. In these studies, data on 
post-implementation births were available for 51622 and 
1381 births.3 The Netherlands has around 170 000 births 
annually, which translates into around 60 000 births 
after implementation of mitigation measures, including 
around 4000 preterm births. Given the positive findings 
in earlier studies,2,3 which had much smaller sample 
sizes, we anticipated that our dataset would provide 
ample statistical power to identify an association of 
similar magnitude between the COVID-19 mitigation 
measures and preterm births in the Netherlands.
We tabulated characteristics of the study population 
according to the periods from which they were derived. 
We furthermore tabulated selected characteristics against 
published Perined annual reports, available up to 2018.16
We studied the association between national imple­
mentation of the COVID-19 mitigation measures and the 
incidence of preterm births using a difference-in-
regression-discontinuity approach.25,26 This quasi-experi­
mental technique can be used when the exposure of 
interest is assigned by the value of a continuously 
measured random variable and whether that variable lies 
above (or below) some cutoff value. In this study, calendar 
week of birth is the assignment variable, and the cutoff 
corresponds to the implementation dates of COVID-19 
mitigation measures. Quasi-experimental techniques 
provide a robust alternative to experimentation when

randomised assignment is not possible and facilitate 
causal inference over purely observational approaches.27 
We did separate analyses for COVID-19 mitigation 
measures implemented on March 9, March 15, and 
March 23 (panel). A separate analysis was not possible for 
measures implemented on March 12, because of the 
temporal granularity of the individual-level data 
(ie, weekly rather than daily). We a-priori hypothesised 
that any reductions in preterm birth would most likely 
have followed the measures implemented on March 15, 
because these were considered to be most comprehensive. 
We assessed four time windows in separate analyses: 
1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months before and 
after dates of implementation. Use of these relatively 
short time windows allowed us to exclude other 
interventions or major influences and assume that any 
change observed was due to the COVID-19 mitigation 
measures. The analyses accounted for underlying 
temporal trends,28 seasonal variation, and potential other 
time-variant factors affecting preterm birth incidence by 
comparing the period surrounding implementation of 
the measures in 2020 to the exact same time periods in 
each year preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2010–19). 
By following this approach there was no need to adjust for 
individual-level variables in the analysis.
The assumptions and conditions for a valid regression 
discontinuity were met; the cutoff value (March 9, 15, 
or 23, 2020) and decision rule (exposed or unexposed 
to COVID-19 mitigation measures) were known, the 
assignment variable (week of birth) is continuous around 
the cutoff and not affected by the lockdown (appendix p 2), 
the outcomes are continuous at the threshold and are 
observed for all pregnancies, and graphical analysis 
shows a discontinuity around the threshold, suggesting 
an intervention effect (appendix pp 3–14).
In the primary analyses, the outcome of interest was 
the overall incidence of preterm birth (ie, number of 
babies born at a gestational age of <37 weeks and 0 days 
per 1000 babies that underwent neonatal blood spot 
screening). In additional stratified analyses, we assessed 
whether there were differential changes in preterm birth 
incidence following the COVID-19 mitigation measures 
according to the degree of prematurity: 24 weeks and 
0 days to  25 weeks and 6 days, 26 weeks and 0 days to 
27 weeks and 6 days, 28 weeks and 0 days to 31 weeks and 
6 days, and 32 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days.
Substantial evidence indicates that the COVID-19 
pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact 
differentially affect socioeconomic groups.29,30 To assess

possible variation in impact of the Dutch COVID-19 
mitigation measures according to socioeconomic status, 
we tested for effect modification by neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status. In additional post-hoc analyses 
we explored potential effect modification by small-for-
gestational-age status and neonatal sex.
Some mechanisms potentially underlying a link 
between the COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm 
birth might not have an immediate effect. However, 
population anticipatory effects might already have 
changed their behaviour before formal implementation 
of COVID-19 mitigation measures. We therefore did two 
sets of sensitivity analyses introducing a period of 
censoring of data, thus excluding data from the first week 
and from the first two weeks directly before and directly 
following introduction of the measures.
Analyses were done using R version 4.0.2.

Results
1 707 594 records were available in the Praeventis neonatal 
screening database for the study period. 1 599 547 singleton 
neonates were included in our analysis (figure 1). 
Characteristics of this population are shown in table 1. 
Cross-validation against Perined data for selected years 
(2011, 2014, and 2017) showed that babies born at the lowest 
gestational ages and those with the lowest birthweights 
were consistently underrepresented in our cohort through­
out the study period (appendix p 15).
A clear discontinuity in the regression lines was 
observed for the initial set of COVID-19 mitigation 
measures introduced on March 9, 2020 (figure 2; 
appendix pp 3–14). Accordingly, implementation of the 
March 9 measures was consistently associated with 
substantial reductions in preterm birth in the 2-month, 
3-month, and 4-month time windows surrounding 
implementation (± 2 months [n=531 823] odds ratio [OR] 
0∙77, 95% CI 0∙66–0∙91, p=0∙0026; ± 3 months [n=796 531] 
OR 0∙85, 0∙73–0∙98, p=0∙028; ± 4 months [n=1 066 872] 
OR 0∙84, 0∙73–0∙97, p=0∙023; table 2). These reductions 
in preterm births were apparent across gestational age 
strata, but were statistically significant only in the 32 weeks 
and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days subgroup (table 2). No 
significant change in preterm birth was observed for 
measures implemented on March 15 and 23 (table 2).
Given these findings and to reduce the number of 
analyses, we explored effect modification and did sensi­
tivity analyses only for the March 9 COVID-19 mitigation 
measures, and only for the overall incidence of preterm 
birth. Although the reductions in preterm birth pre­
dominantly occurred in populations living in high-
socioeconomic-status neighbourhoods, effect modi­fi­cation 
by socioeconomic status was not statistically significant 
(appendix p 16). No statistically significant effect modi­
fication by small-for-gestational-age status or sex was seen 
(appendix pp 17–18). Sensitivity analyses, in which birth 
data from 1 or 2 weeks surrounding implementation of the 
March 9 measures were censored, generally confirmed 
the findings of the primary analyses, although several 
outcomes for 3 or 4 months before and after imple­
mentation were no longer statistically significant 
(appendix p 19).

births were observed following implementation of the 
first national COVID-19 mitigation measures in the 
Netherlands. These reductions were consistent across 
various degrees of prematurity. Extension of the COVID-19 
measures introduced 1 week and 2 weeks later had no 
significant effect on preterm births. Taken together with 
preliminary evidence from other countries,2,3 these 
findings provide opportunities to identify novel preventive 
strategies for preterm birth.
To our knowledge, our study is by far the largest to have 
assessed the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures 
on the incidence of preterm birth. Making use of national-
level routinely collected data, we included more than 
1∙5 million individual records in our analysis, including 
more than 55 000 babies born after implementation of 
COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. 
Because more than 99% of babies in the Netherlands 
undergo neonatal dried blood spot screening,19 and very 
few babies in the dataset had missing outcome data, our 
data are highly representative. By applying a quasi-
experimental approach, our study progresses substantially 
from earlier uncontrolled before-after studies, thus faci­
litating causal interpretation of the observed link between 
the COVID-19 mitigation measures and reduced preterm 
births.25–27 Additionally, our findings were robust in the 
various model specifications.
Our study also has limitations. Given the unanticipated 
nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated 
mitigation measures, we had to use a retrospective 
approach to data collection. As in any registry-based 
study, there could have been registration errors, and a 
very small proportion of individuals had missing data. 
Cross-validation against Perined suggested very little 
temporal variation in comparability of the data or missing 
variables, which if present, should have been captured by 
our 
difference-in-regression-discontinuity 
design. 
Extremely preterm and very-low-birthweight births were 
slightly underrepresented in our dataset as compared 
with Perined. This was anticipated because, unlike our 
dataset, Perined includes babies born between 22 weeks 
and 0 days and 23 weeks and 6 days and stillbirths.31 For 
obvious reasons, stillborn babies and those dying in the 
first few days after birth did not contribute data to the 
neonatal screening programme, so they were missing 
from our dataset. Our validation indicates that this 
relative underrepresentation was not differential over 
time and is therefore unlikely to have affected our 
findings. Survival of preterm babies improved over the 
study period, which would have biased our findings 
towards the null. We excluded babies born at less than 
24 weeks gestation, because they are rarely offered active 
treatment in the Netherlands.21 Given their very low 
number (n=18) this exclusion is not expected to have 
affected our findings. Our dataset did not have individual-
level information on relevant covariates, including 
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, parity, and preeclampsia. 
Therefore, we could not discern whether changes in 
demographic composition of the population following 
the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, through short-term 
migration) might have contributed to the findings. 
Absence of information on method of delivery and labour 
induction meant we could not assess whether the 
COVID-19 mitigation measures had a differential effect 
on spontaneous versus induced preterm births.
Our study builds on earlier work in several ways, 
including in the use of a robust quasi-experimental 
method and a much larger sample size.25–27 In the Irish 
study,3 proportions of extremely-low-birthweight and very-
low-birthweight births were lower in Jan 1–April 30, 2020, 
than in the same period in the preceding 19 years;3 however, 
the numbers of observed versus anticipated extremely-
low-birthweight (none vs four) and very-low-birthweight

births (three vs 11) were very small. Furthermore, lockdown 
measures were implemented on March 12 in Ireland, 
rather than Jan 1, complicating causal interpretation. 
Similar to our study, the Danish study2 used national data 
from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme. 
We calculated that only one extremely preterm birth had 
been observed in the Danish study in the first month 
following lockdown, where five to six were expected. 
Again, this is a large relative reduction but a small 
reduction in absolute terms. The observed reduction in 
preterm births in Denmark and Ireland predominantly 
affected the smallest babies,2,3 whereas the decrease was 
fairly constant across gestational age strata in our study. 
The vast majority of preterm babies are born moderately 
to late preterm (ie, 32 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 
6 days), and our data suggest that prevention might be 
possible for all levels of prematurity. A comparison of 
birth outcomes in a London (UK) hospital before and after 
the COVID-19 pandemic started revealed no changes in 
the incidence of births before 34 weeks or 37 weeks 
gestation.32 Again, this study had a small sample size and 
it did not specifically investigate the effect of the lockdown. 
The authors noted an increase in stillbirths of six per 
1000 births following the COVID-19 pandemic.32 In the 
Netherlands, stillbirth rates (from 22 weeks gestation) 
have fluctuated between 4∙6 per 1000 births and 5∙7 per 
1000 births between 2010 and 2018.16 As more recent 
information on stillbirths was unavailable, we could not 
discern whether a small part of the observed reduction in 
preterm births occurred at the expense of an increase in 
stillbirths.
The aetiology of spontaneous preterm birth, which 
accounts for roughly two-thirds of all preterm births, is 
largely obscure and probably multifactorial, hampering 
effective prevention.33 Many of the known risk factors for 
preterm birth might be affected by implementation of 
COVID-19 mitigation measures. These risk factors include 
asymptomatic maternal infection, which through vertical 
transmission, can cause intrauterine infection, initiating a 
cascade resulting in preterm birth.33 Physical distancing 
and self-isolation, lack of commuting, closing of schools 
and childcare facilities, and increased awareness of 
hygiene (eg, hand washing) all reduce contact with patho­
gens and, accordingly, risk of infection. Timing of the 
observed preterm birth reductions in our study suggests 
that hygiene measures and anticipatory behavioural 
changes might have been instrumental. Additionally, 
closure of most businesses and obligatory home assign­
ments probably resulted in less physically demanding 
work, less shift work, less work-related stress, optimisation 
of sleep duration, uptake of maternal exercise indoors and 
outdoors, and increased social support, which could all 
have a positive effect. Substantial reductions in air 
pollution have also been reported following COVID-19 
mitigation measures,34 including in the Netherlands.35 
Given the recognised increased risk of delivering preterm 
when exposed to air pollution,36 this finding could explain 
part of the observed reductions. Because a large minority 
of preterm births are induced, usually for maternal or fetal 
health concerns, changes in obstetric practice or care-
seeking behaviour of pregnant women might also have 
contributed. Relatively few women deliver by primary 
caesarean section in the Netherlands, and these are 
typically medically indicated and done near-term.37 
Changes in primary caesarean section rates are therefore 
unlikely to explain the findings. Substantial evidence 
indicates that the pandemic and associated lockdown 
measures have aggravated existing health and socio­
economic inequalities within populations.29,30 In this 
regard, the signal in our data—albeit not statistically 
significant—suggesting that the reductions in preterm 
births were confined to people living in high-socio­
economic-status neighbourhoods is of considerable 
concern and requires further study.
Preterm birth is the primary contributor to mortality 
and morbidity in early childhood.9 Survivors are at in­
creased risk of long-term negative consequences, in­
cluding adverse cognitive and motor development,11,12 
behavioural and mental health problems,10 and respi­
ratory disorders.13 Globally, the incidence of preterm 
birth is on the rise,9 and current options for prevention 
are very limited.14 Here, we show that national intro­
duction of COVID-19 mitigation measures in the 
Netherlands was associated with a considerable reduction 
in preterm births, substantiating preliminary findings 
from other countries.2,3 COVID-19 Law Lab shows that 
COVID-19 mitigation measures have been implemented 
across countries with substantial variation in timing, 
content, and comprehensiveness. Similarly, the various 
risk factors for preterm delivery that might be responsive 
to lockdown measures also vary across populations. 
Evidence suggests that the lockdown in Nepal had a 
negative effect on perinatal outcomes, highlighting the 
need for additional studies in low-resource settings.38 
International collaborative efforts now underway will be 
key to incorporating these sources of variation in 
innovative global evaluations to further study the link 
between COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm 
births. Identification of the underlying mechanisms is 
an essential next step and will require exploration of 
differential impact between spontaneous and induced 
preterm deliveries and across demographic strata, 
including socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Concom­
itant changes in stillbirths require evaluation, and 
exploration of possible links with changes in air pollution, 
mobility patterns, and care seeking and provision is 
needed. These investigations are pivotal to informing the 
development of much needed novel preventive strategies 
for preterm birth.
