Abstract
Objective: To explore whether quarantine measures and hospital containment policies 
among women giving birth in a COVID‐19 “hotspot” area in northeastern Italy enhanced 
psycho‐emotional distress in the immediate postpartum period.
Methods: We designed a non‐concurrent case–control study of mothers who gave birth 
during a COVID‐19 quarantine period between March 8 and May 3, 2020 (COVID‐19 
study group), with an antecedent group of matched postpartum women (control group) 
who delivered in the same period in 2019. Participants completed the Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on the second day postpartum.
Results: The COVID‐19 study group (n=91) had significantly higher mean EPDS scores 
compared with the control group (n=101) (8.5 ± 4.6 vs 6.34 ± 4.1; P<0.001). Furthermore, 
28.6% of women in the COVID‐19 group had a global EPDS score above 12. Analysis of 
three EPDS subscales revealed significantly higher scores among the COVID‐19 group 
compared with the control group for anhedonia (0.60 ± 0.61 vs 0.19 ± 0.36; P<0.001) 
and depression (0.58 ± 0.54 vs 0.35 ± 0.45; P=0.001).
Conclusions: Concerns about risk of exposure to COVID‐19, combined with quarantine 
measures adopted during the COVID‐19 pandemic, adversely affected the thoughts and 
emotions of new mothers, worsening depressive symptoms.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In February 2020, northern Italy became the epicenter for corona‐
virus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Europe, with many exportations 
to other countries and widespread community transmission, partic‐
ularly within the region.1 As a public health response, on February 
22, 2020, Italy imposed a lockdown for 14 days comprising shut‐
down of businesses, schools, and public places, as well as physical 
distancing in “hotspot” towns close to Milan and Venice. On March 
8, quarantine measures were expanded to all of Lombardy and 14 
other northern provinces. By March 9, 7375 laboratory‐confirmed 
cases of COVID‐19 and 366 deaths had been observed in Italy. 
Hence, on that date, quarantine was extended nationwide until April 
13 to limit viral transmission.2,3 Following the Decree of The Council 
of Ministers on April 10, 2020, all measures to counter the spread 
of coronavirus infection were extended until May 3. After this date, 
phase two began, with eased lockdown measures implemented to 
“coexist” with the coronavirus.

The municipality of Vo’ in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy 
(about 45 km from Venice) was identified as a COVID‐19 hotspot. On 
February 21, the death of one of its residents, a 78‐year‐old man, was 
registered. He became the first known Italian—and European—to die 
of COVID‐19.3 Most of the COVID‐19 victims from this area were 
elderly. Pregnant women are a minority group, with low and late fer‐
tility and high sociocultural status. On average, around 1000 neonates 
are born annually at the Policlinico Abano Terme, a suburban hospital 
located about 15 km southwest of Vo’. The hospital borders the munic‐
ipalities most devastated by the COVID‐19 epidemic.
Several studies have documented maternal psycho‐emotional 
vulnerability during catastrophic events.4 Trauma, terrorist attack, 
and natural and man‐made disasters (e.g. earthquakes, tsunamis, and 
Chernobyl) were predictors of postpartum depression symptoms for 
mothers in the general population.4–6 After the outbreak of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both healthcare work‐
ers and people who were self‐quarantined exhibited symptoms of 
post‐traumatic stress disorder.7 Hence, the effect of stress caused by 
COVID‐19 on pregnant women cannot be ignored.
Pregnant women are considered an at‐risk population for viral 
respiratory infections with possible consequences for the mother and 
fetus; however, at present, little information exists on the susceptibil‐
ity of pregnant women to the pathology of COVID‐19.8
Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 epidemic in Italy, the Italian 
central and regional government implemented primary preven‐
tion actions and tailored several restrictive measures to contain the 
spread of the infection. These measures included isolation of cases, 
contact tracing, and quarantine and mitigation measures, including 
general lockdown and social or personal distancing—lessons learned 
from China’s successful battle against COVID‐19.9 Hospitals changed 
policies around prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postnatal care, 
replacing office visits with remote checkups, sending pregnant women 
to an offsite laboratory for blood tests, cancelling birth center tours 
and other nonessential visits, and barring extra people (fathers, doulas, 
and visitors) from the delivery room and postpartum units in an effort 
to keep mothers and babies safe.10
People in quarantine may experience a wide range of feelings, 
including fear, anger, sadness, irritability, guilt, or confusion, which 
may make isolation challenging for maternal health.6,11 The aim of the 
present study was to explore whether quarantine measures and hos‐
pital containment policies among women giving birth in a hotspot area 
for COVID‐19 enhanced psycho‐emotional distress in the immediate 
postpartum period. We tested for anhedonia, anxiety, and depression 
using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the imme‐
diate postpartum period.12,13 Understanding the relationship between 
stress and maternal health is critical for the development of a complete 
support system in the setting of an extremely contagious pandemic.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was designed as a non‐concurrent case–control study on 
psycho‐emotional distress in the immediate postpartum period in 
women who gave birth at Policlinico Abano Terme (COVID‐19 study 
group) and an antecedent group of matched postpartum women 
(control group). Data collection was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) of Policlinico Abano Terme. Ethical approval was 
also obtained from the IRB. All participants were given an informa‐
tion sheet and were only included in the study if they had signed the 
consent form.
Women aged over 18 years who could read and understand Italian, 
who had delivered a singleton, healthy neonate at term at Policlinico 
Abano Terme between March 8 (start of nationwide quarantine) and 
May 3 (quarantine measures eased), 2020 were consecutively asked 
to participate. A control group of women was also recruited, compris‐
ing women aged over 18 years (able to read and understand Italian) 
who lived in the same geographic area and had delivered at the hos‐
pital in the same time period as the study group but in the previous 
year (2019). This was possible because mothers provided written per‐
mission for us to access their obstetric records, which included basic 
personal data, education, medical history, and pre‐discharge EPDS 
screening results.
The EPDS12 is a self‐administered questionnaire made up of 10 
items scored using a four‐point Likert scale (0–3) designed to screen 
for symptoms of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression rep‐
resents the end of a continuum of severity of symptoms. The present 
study used a cutoff point for depressive symptomatology risk of higher 
than 12.14 Several authors have studied the structure of the EPDS and 
found that, along with postpartum depressive symptomatology risk, it 
also measures anxiety and anhedonia.15 Tuohy and McVey13 extracted 
three subscales from the EPDS: anhedonia subscale (items 1 and 2); 
anxiety subscale (items 3–6); and depression subscale (items 7–10).
According to standard maternity routines, in the absence of 
obstetric or neonatal complications, length of hospital stay was sched‐
uled at 48 hours for both vaginal and cesarean delivery. During the 
study period (March 8 to May 3), the EPDS was distributed prior to 
discharge to 113 women (COVID‐19 study group) on the second day 
postpartum. During the corresponding period in 2019, the EPDS had 
been distributed to 106 women (control group).
A total of 11 women were excluded from the study group: 5 whose 
length of hospital stay was prolonged; 2 who underwent general anes‐
thesia; 1 who underwent psychological treatment; 1 who required 
hospitalization for COVID‐19; and 2 whose infants had jaundice. Four 
women were excluded from the control group: 3 whose length of hos‐
pital stay was prolonged and 1 whose infant had jaundice. Among eligi‐
ble mothers, seven subsequently declined to participate (6 in the study 
group and 1 in the control group). In addition, five women in the study 
group were excluded owing to incomplete data. Thus, data from 91 
women in the study group and 101 in the control group were analyzed.
SPSS version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis. 
Data are expressed as mean  ±  SD or number (percentage). EPDS 
global score and values for the three subscales of anhedonia, anxi‐
ety, and depression were determined for the study and control groups. 
Continuous variables were analyzed by independent sample t test, 
while the Fisher exact test was used to analyze qualitative variables. 
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3 | RESULTS
The sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features of 91 study 
group mothers and 101 control group mothers are shown in Table 1. 
There were no significant differences between the groups for all vari‐
ables except neonatal birth weight, which was significantly lower in 
the babies born during the COVID‐19 pandemic compared with the 
previous year (3354.51 ± 374.2 vs 3478.60 ± 409.8 g; P=0.031).
Pre‐discharge EPDS, anhedonia, anxiety, and depression subscale 
scores collected on the second day postpartum for the COVID‐19 
study group and control group are shown in Table  2. Mean EPDS 
scores were significantly higher in the COVID‐19 study group com‐
pared with the control group (8.5 ± 4.6 vs 6.34 ± 4.1; P<0.001). The 
percentage of high‐risk women, those with a global EPDS score above 
12, was also significantly higher in the COVID‐19 group compared 
with the control group (28.6% vs 11.9%; P=0.006).
EPDS subscale analysis showed that mean scores for anhedonia, 
anxiety, and depression were all higher in the COVID‐19 study group 
compared with the control group, although the differences were only 
significant for anhedonia (0.60 ± 0.61 vs 0.19 ± 0.36; P<0.001) and 
depression (0.58 ± 0.54 vs 0.35 ± 0.45; P=0.001).
4 | DISCUSSION
The present study found that women giving birth during a period of 
COVID‐19 quarantine measures adopted in a hotspot area in northeast‐
ern Italy between March 8 and May 3, 2020, presented higher EPDS 
scores compared with a control group of mothers who gave birth during 
the same period the previous year. Furthermore, almost 30% of mothers 
in the COVID‐19 group had a global EPDS score above 12, which may 
lead to a higher risk of postnatal depression. Analysis of three EPDS sub‐
scales revealed significantly higher scores for anhedonia and depression 
in the COVID‐19 study group, highlighting the additional beneficial tools 
within the EPDS that may allow better understanding of the spectrum 
of various negative psychological issues that the COVID‐19 pandemic 
might arouse among pregnant women and new mothers.
The present findings suggest that postpartum psychological 
responses during the COVID‐19 pandemic may be mediated by 
EPDS symptoms that are severe enough to predict a higher risk of 
postnatal depression. Therefore, pregnant women giving birth during 
the COVID‐19 pandemic represent a high‐risk, vulnerable population 
that needs to be carefully followed to minimize postpartum men‐
tal dysfunction, as previous studies have reported following natural 
disasters.16 Medical and mental healthcare interventions should be 
carried out immediately to prevent deterioration of maternal psycho‐
logical health, which is made more severe by social containment than 
reported for previous natural disasters.11
These data may have some clinical relevance. Pregnancy can be a 
stressful time for many expectant mothers17; however, the COVID‐19 
crisis is adding a new layer of worry about how the pandemic will

impact the birth of their baby. Research has shown fairly consistent 
evidence that exposure to a variety of stressors during pregnancy is 
associated with increased risk of postpartum depression symptoms 
and emotional problems.18 Women in the COVID‐19 group reported 
various negative psychological emotions, such as anhedonia and 
depression, and had a higher risk of postpartum depression shown by 
EPDS scores above 12 in one in three mothers. Postpartum depression 
is the result of a dynamic interplay between biological, psychological, 
and social risk factors,19 all of which may be amplified during the cur‐
rent COVID‐19 pandemic.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess EPDS scores 
in a sample of women giving birth in an area severely affected by 
COVID‐19. WHO declared that “Containment of COVID‐19 is feasi‐
ble and must remain the top priority for all countries”.20 Nevertheless, 
concerns about exposure to COVID‐19, combined with physical dis‐
tancing and containment recommendations, may adversely affect the 
thoughts, emotions, and functioning of new mothers, thereby worsen‐
ing depressive symptoms. The present study used the EPDS scale and 
subscale analysis of this group of women because they were regarded 
as a susceptible population.21 The COVID‐19 pandemic has become a 
further example of a catastrophic event that might cause symptoms of 
postpartum depression.
We recognize several limitations to this study. Although EPDS 
score and anhedonia, anxiety, and depression subscale scores were 
used to study the psycho‐emotional distress in mothers giving birth 
during the COVID‐19 pandemic, we did not confirm the diagnosis of 
postpartum depression in our sample using specific criteria defined 
in the medical literature.22 Given its small sample size, this study may 
have been underpowered to demonstrate a significant effect of the 
COVID‐19 pandemic on neonatal birth weight. Questions remain 
regarding the significance of these findings for clinical practice.23 
Furthermore, an intrinsically observational study such as this cannot 
guarantee that the observed relationships represent causal factors. 
Finally, the study sample is limited, geographically specific, and not 
generalizable. However, this should not invalidate the results because 
the general demographic variables were similar among the groups. 
Literature on this subject is limited; therefore, the present study makes 
an important contribution to understanding the impact of a natural 
infectious calamity on pregnant women.
In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that quarantine and 
hospital containment measures adopted in a COVID‐19 hotspot area in 
northeastern Italy had a strong psycho‐emotional impact on women giv‐
ing birth during this period, as indicated by increased EPDS scores and 
anhedonia and depression subscale scores in the immediate postpartum 
period. Concerns about risk of exposure to COVID‐19, combined with 
quarantine measures, can worsen depressive symptoms and adversely 
affect the thoughts, emotions, and functioning of new mothers.
