Abstract
Objective: To assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric care and 
outcomes.
Methods: A prospective observational single-center study was performed, including 
all antenatal and parturient women admitted from April to August, 2020. Data were 
collected regarding number of admissions, deliveries, antenatal visits, reason for in-
accessibility of health care, and complications during pregnancy, and compared with 
data from the pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020.
Results: There was a reduction of 45.1% in institutional deliveries (P < 0.001), a per-
centage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and 2.5-fold rise in admission to 
the intensive care unit of pregnant women during the pandemic. One-third of women 
had inadequate antenatal visits. The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lock-
down and fear of contracting infection, resulting in 44.7% of pregnancies with com-
plications. Thirty-two symptomatic women who tested positive for COVID-19 were 
managed at the center with good maternal and fetal outcomes.
Conclusion: Although COVID-19 does not directly affect pregnancy outcomes, it has 
indirect adverse effects on maternal and child health. Emergency obstetric and an-
tenatal care are essential services to be continued with awareness of people while 
maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has grossly affected the lives of people 
since its onset in December 2019 across the world.1 The pandemic 
resulted in major changes in government policies, including the 
healthcare system. There have been curfew restrictions in hotspot 
areas, and certain places have become containment zones from 
where a large cluster tested positive for coronavirus. This has also 
led to poor or inadequate delivery of many services, especially the 
health services. This mass restriction of activities was intended to 
prevent community spread of the infection and to allow for pre-
paredness of the medical services for the pandemic. On the other 
hand, the routine healthcare system was disrupted and people faced 
problems when seeking medical advice. Although COVID-19 disease 

232 |

itself does not cause increased maternal mortality compared to the 
general population directly, unsupervised pregnancies and the ab-
sence of routine antenatal visits may have indirect adverse effects 
on maternal health.2
During epidemics in the past, health systems were crippled to pro-
vide routine services to a large extent due to the sudden increase in 
demand and the redirection of the workforce towards the epidemics. 
Hence, the utilization of routine health services significantly reduces 
during every outbreak.3 As has already been said by WHO, “People, ef-
forts, and medical supplies all shift to respond to the emergency. This 
may lead to the neglect of routine essential health services. People 
with health problems unrelated to the epidemic find it harder to get ac-
cess to health care services”.4 During the Ebola virus outbreak in West 
Africa in 2014, the indirect effects of the epidemic on maternal health 
were more severe than the outbreak itself.5 It was estimated that, 
during this outbreak, there was a decrease of 22 percentage points in 
antenatal care coverage, of 8 percentage.
points in in-facility delivery, and of 13 percentage points in post-
natal care.6 This decrease was mainly due to fear of contracting 
the disease from medical staff and other patients, loss of faith in 
the health system, and the exact source of the disease being un-
known.7 A similar reduction in healthcare utilization was seen during 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In 
Taiwan, ambulatory care decreased by 23.9% and inpatient care de-
creased by 35.2%.8
The current coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2 infection) was 
declared a global pandemic by WHO on March 11, March 2020.9 
Social restrictions and isolation challenged the care of pregnant 
women. Telehealth was introduced to tide over the situation to 
some extent. Certain medical conditions can be diagnosed only on 
physical evaluation of the patient. In the absence of routine care, 
high-risk factors in pregnant women are missed, which can lead to 
dreaded complications. This pandemic has resulted in the non-ac-
cessibility of antenatal women to care providers in an emergency. 
These are major concerns in the utilization of health services for 
all.
Taking lessons from past epidemics, the Ministry of Health 
and Family Welfare, India (MOHFW) and FOGSI (Federation of 
Obstetricians & Gynecologists of India) declared pregnant women 
to be a high-risk group and mandated guidelines to provide essen-
tial maternal health services as well as to patients with suspected 
or confirmed COVID-19.10 Guidelines have been laid down for mod-
ified prenatal care.11-14 In low- and middle-income countries such 
as India, the impact of containment and other policies on maternal 
health will be more devastating. Even in the days before the pan-
demic, timely maternal healthcare services were unavailable or 
inaccessible for millions of women in low-resource settings. The 
restrictions on travel and limited health facilities with infection-con-
trol preparedness have further exacerbated the negative impact on 
women's health. There has been a drastic decline in the number of 
institutional deliveries, which ultimately deteriorates maternal and 
child care. The side effects of lockdown on maternal health have so 
far been largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the present study 
was to assess the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
health of pregnant women and fetal-maternal outcomes.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur 
for a period of 5 months from April 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020. It 
was a prospective observational single-center study that included all 
pregnant women admitted during the study period. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed con-
sent was obtained from the study participants. The number of admis-
sions, deliveries, high-risk women, and referrals was assessed. These 
data were compared with those from routine pre-COVID-19  days, 
from October 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020, just before the pan-
demic (Table 1). March 2020 was not included in the analysis as the 
lockdown started in the middle of the month and these data were 
inconclusive. During the pandemic, the institute provided antenatal 
services through telemedicine, and physical visits were scheduled as 
per regional guidelines for low-risk women. High-risk women were 
called more frequently as needed. Moreover, emergency services 
were continued and all patients were treated, whether they were reg-
istered or not. Any delays in routine antenatal checkup and reasons 
for the delay were noted in all pregnant or delivered women during 
the COVID-19 period. The effect of delay in seeking health care on 
maternal complications was assessed.
2.1  |  Statistical analysis
Data entry was carried out using MS Excel Software and analyzed 
using SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc.). The descriptive and analytical sta-
tistics are presented in frequency tables and graphs. The categorical 
variables were briefed as numbers and percentages. The Student t-
test was used to analyze the demographic data. P < 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.

3  |  RESULTS
A total of 633 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of 
Obstetrics over a period of 5 months from April to August 2020 dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. During routine pre-COVID-19 times, 
the study center had almost double the number of admissions in the 
department: a total of 1116 patients were admitted from October 
2019 to February 2020. Thus, a fall in admissions of about 43.27% 
was witnessed during the pandemic. From the end of March to the 
middle of May, the country was undergoing a strict lockdown during 
which transportation was badly affected. This was reflected in the 
significant fall in the number of institutional deliveries during April 
and May (Figure 1). When compared with pre-COVID-19 times, this 
is a fall of 45.1% in the number of deliveries at the study center, 
which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The total number of 
deliveries in pre-COVID-19 times was 1062 over 5 months (October 
2019 to February 2020), while in COVID-19 times, it was 583 (April 
to August 2020). Of these 583 deliveries during COVID-19 times, 
315 (54.03%) were vaginal deliveries and 268 (45.96%) were cesar-
ean deliveries.
During the pandemic, it was found that there was a surge in the 
number of high-risk pregnancies by 7.2 percentage points. In com-
parison to 505 (45.2%) high-risk admissions in pre-COVID-19 times, 
the institute had 332 (52.4%) high-risk admissions to the hospital 
during the pandemic. Thirty-two patients were referred from other 
hospitals due to the presence of high-risk factors. Out of the total 
number of admissions, eight patients required admission to the in-
tensive care unit (ICU) for their co-morbidities, whereas, in the pre-
COVID-19 months, only three women were admitted to the ICU in 
the same time frame (P < 0.05). There were two maternal mortalities 
in these 5 months while there were no maternal deaths between 
October 2019 and February 2020.
Thirty-two pregnant women were positive for COVID-19 in 
the described time frame; of these, 25 were referred to as COVID-
19-positive pregnancies. Seven were diagnosed using reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests at the 
study institute and they delivered with a good fetal-maternal out-
come. Three patients had vaginal deliveries while four underwent 
cesarean deliveries for obstetric indications, namely transverse 
lie, fetal distress, suspected scar dehiscence, and previous cesar-
ean not willing for a trial of labor. All the infants delivered were 
moved motherside and were negative for COVID-19. Forty-seven 
women were admitted to the isolation facility on suspicion of hav-
ing COVID-19 but were later moved back to the ward after a neg-
ative RT-PCR report.
Of the 633 admissions during the pandemic, 206 (32.5%) preg-
nant women had fewer antenatal visits than advised. Many women 
avoided routine checkups during the strict lockdown for at least 
3 months, from March to May 2020. In addition, of all admissions, 
28 (4.42%) women had no antenatal visits (Table 2). This resulted in 
missing a significant number of co-morbidities relating to pregnancy. 
The remaining 427 (67.4%) women had regular hospital visits, includ-
ing at least one visit in the third trimester. When enquired about 
the reason for delay in health-seeking, 50.9% of women quoted the 
strict lockdown and lack of transportation, while 33.4% avoided vis-
its due to the fear of catching infections (Table 3).
Of the 332 high-risk pregnancies during the pandemic, 144 
(44.7%) had one or more complications aggravated by the delay in 
seeking health care. Anemia was overlooked in most women, fol-
lowed by pregnancy-induced hypertension. It was observed that 
most of the patients preferred to wait at home until labor or pre-
ferred home deliveries during the pandemic. There were 26 post-
dated pregnancies during this time and many patients were received 
in an advanced stage of labor. In addition, a significant number of 
patients were seen with eclampsia, acute renal failure, sepsis, and 
pneumonia (Table 4).
4  |  DISCUSSION
Though COVID-19 has not directly affected maternal and fetal out-
comes, the present study shows that COVID-19 has definitely af-
fected pregnancy outcomes indirectly. It was found that there was a 
drastic fall in the number of institutional deliveries, especially during 
the period of strict lockdown. The women preferred home deliveries 
or deliveries at a nearby health facility, due to either inaccessibility,

lack of transport, or fear of contagion from big institutes. Widespread 
disruption of the healthcare system, the stay-at-home policy, and 
reduced access to hospitals and food have affected maternal out-
comes and may continue to have an impact in the future. Countries 
such as India expect to see a large increase in maternal and child 
deaths. This lockdown or stay-at-home policy has also affected the 
population economically, leading to reduced purchasing power of 
society, thus compounding the delay in seeking healthcare facilities.
When examined on a larger scale, such a major fall has challenged 
international safe motherhood programs. The reduced number of 
antenatal visits and institutional deliveries will lead to a marked in-
crease in pregnancies with complications and the need for intensive 
care. The main reason for admission to the ICU in the present study 
was an increase in morbidities such as multiorgan failure and acute 
renal failure. An increase in the maternal mortality rate was also ob-
served. Thus, it appears that the COVID-19 pandemic will indirectly 
cause a big setback to the international efforts of achieving sustain-
able development goals.
In the study by Davis et al,15 it was found that women are prefer-
ring home deliveries instead of institutional deliveries due to the fear 
of contagion from institutes. However, this should only be accepted 
in women who are considered low risk. The main reasons behind the 
home deliveries was the patients avoiding visiting hospitals until an 
emergency due to transportation issues and resistance to approach-
ing care providers.
One-third of women (32.5%) have avoided routine visits, consid-
ering pregnancy to be normal physiology and feeling safe at home. 
The reason for the delay in health-seeking was the strict lockdown 
for half of the women and their inability to leave the containment 
zone, while 33.4% avoided visits due to fear of contagion. This has 
not been elaborated in the literature so far. India is a middle-income 
country where illiteracy and ignorance about routine antenatal care 
are prevalent—this was the third reason for the delay in seeking 
health care. Lockdown and fear of catching infections due to hospi-
tal visits have worsened the scenario. Some patients avoided investi-
gations and antenatal ultrasounds, such as anomaly scans, to reduce 
the risk of exposure, even after a routine antenatal visit.
Almost half of the high-risk factors during pregnancy were 
missed due to delays in health-seeking. Among these, the majority 
of women had moderate to severe anemia. Women did not take rou-
tine iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, leading 
to anemia and its related complications and an increased number 
of blood transfusions. Women were also not having examinations; 
therefore, early diagnosis and necessary management were not 
possible. The second most common missed complication was preg-
nancy-induced hypertension.
Fakari et al16 observed that COVID-19 has increased the stress 
and anxiety of pregnant women, which can indirectly cause an in-
crease in the number of patients with pre-eclampsia, nausea and 
vomiting, preterm labor, and depression. Some additional concerns 
of the women in the study are the arranging of a birth attendant, 
excessive use of detergents and alcohol-based sanitizers that may 
cause skin problems and toxicity, avoidance of hospital visits, and 
issues relating to the postpartum period.
India has rapidly prepared itself for this pandemic by increas-
ing the number of beds, manufacturing and providing personal 
protective equipment (PPE), and setting treatment and antenatal 
visit policies. However, ignorance in society has made COVID-19 
a devastating pandemic with an exponential rise in the number of 
cases where the worst is yet to come.17 This is causing an increase 
in hospital occupancy and the need to rapidly expand the health-
care facility. This can lead to major detrimental effects on maternal 
and child health.
The strength of the present study is that it was prospective in na-
ture and all the participants were followed up until delivery without 
any recall bias. At the same time, some limitations of the study in-
clude it being a single-center study at a tertiary hospital so general-
izability cannot be ensured. Second, the women who were admitted 
to the institute were analyzed, while those coming to the outpatient 
department were not included. Lastly, the small sample size and

observational nature of the study affected the detailed analysis of 
other independent predictors of patient delay. Large multicentric 
studies and worldwide surveys are needed to confirm these findings 
and better preparedness of obstetrics.
As in other pandemics, the healthcare system faces a great chal-
lenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, showing its indirect effects on 
the vulnerable antenatal group and an increase in pregnancy-related 
complications. Along with healthcare services, there is the need to ed-
ucate patients about the importance of regular visits, precautions such 
as physical distancing, wearing masks, and personal hygiene. Leaving 
the home should be avoided but not at the cost of compromising health.
