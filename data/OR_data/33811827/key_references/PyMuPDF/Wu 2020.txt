BACKGROUND: On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic
with human-to-human transmission was ofﬁcially declared by the Chinese
government, which caused signiﬁcant public panic in China. In light of the
coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly
vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies.
Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of
pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus
disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety
symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women
across China.
STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in
early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy
using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a
unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women
before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.
A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25
hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-
sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these
women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coro-
navirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before
this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and
anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared
between the pre- and poststudy groups.
RESULTS: Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of corona-
virus disease 2019 epidemic had signiﬁcantly higher rates of depressive
symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P¼.02) than women assessed before the
epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have
thoughts of self-harm (P¼.005). The depressive rates were positively
associated with the number of newly conﬁrmed cases of coronavirus
disease 2019 (P¼.003), suspected infections (P¼.004), and deaths per
day (P¼.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy,
primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income
category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for
developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.
CONCLUSION: Major life-threatening public health events such as the
coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental
illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strate-
gies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk
communication and the provision of psychological ﬁrst aid may be
particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their
fetuses.

Introduction
Several
clusters
of
individuals
with
pneumonia of unknown etiology in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China, were
reported to the Chinese health author-
ities starting from December 8, 2019.1
The pathogen was identiﬁed as the se-
vere
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the
World Health Organization declared the
virus outbreak a public health emer-
gency of international concern.2 At the
beginning
of
the
outbreak,
much
remained unknown except that it was
transmitted by direct exposure at a local
animal market.3 Information on person-
to-person transmission of the coronavi-
rus
disease
2019
(COVID-19)
was
revealed by the government to the Chi-
nese public on January 20, 2020 and that
asymptomatic individuals were potential
sources of infection.4,5 The number of
identiﬁed cases continued to increase as
did the public
panic
and ﬂow of
misinformation.
To date, epidemiologic data on the
mental health problems of the general
population
during
the
COVID-19
outbreak have not been available and
how to best respond to challenges during
the outbreak remains unknown. Those
in
quarantine
often
experience
boredom,
loneliness,
and
anger,
in
addition, the virus has been repeatedly
described as a killer virus on social me-
dia, perpetuating a sense of danger and
uncertainty among the public. In the
early phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, a
range
of
psychiatric
morbidities,
including persistent depression, anxiety,
panic attacks, psychotic symptoms, and
even
suicidality,
were
reported.6,7

Mandatory contact tracing and 14-day
quarantine, which form part of the
public health responses to the COVID-
19 outbreak, increased anxiety, feelings
of isolation, and stigma.6,7
One
particularly
vulnerable
group
during a viral outbreak may be pregnant
women. Mental health disorders are a
common cause of morbidity during
pregnancy with approximately 12% of
women experiencing depression and up
to 22% experiencing high levels of anxiety
in late pregnancy.8,9 Pregnant women are
more vulnerable to infections because of
their naturally suppressed immune sys-
tem and are generally considered at
increased risk for severe complications.10
Moreover, pregnant women may be
further vulnerable to anxiety due to
increased concern about vertical trans-
mission to their fetus. To date, the mental
health response of pregnant women to
the COVID-19 outbreak has not been
investigated. This study aimed to examine
the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on
the prevalence of depression and anxiety
and the corresponding risk factors during
pregnancy.
Materials and Methods
Study design and data collection
Human-to-human
transmission
of
COVID-19 was ﬁrst conﬁrmed and
reported by the Chinese government on
January 20, 2020. In early December
2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak,
our team initiated a multicenter cross-
sectional
study
to
identify
mental
health concerns in pregnancy using the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS). This study provided a unique
opportunity to compare the mental sta-
tus of pregnant women before and after
the
declaration
of
the
COVID-19
epidemic. To examine the effect of a
major public health emergency on the
mental health of pregnant women, data
from January 1, 2020, to February 9,
2020, were obtained from the Perinatal
and Postpartum Depression Informa-
tion Collection System we created. For
this study, all participants were catego-
rized into 2 groups based on whether
human-to-human
transmission
of
COVID-19 had been reported when the
study
questionnaire
was
completed
(group 1, before the declaration of
human-to-human transmission; group
2, after the declaration). Information of
the number of suspected, conﬁrmed,
and death cases of COVID-19 in China
were obtained after the declaration made
on January 20, 2020. This study was
registered to the Chinese Clinical Trial
Registry (ChiCTR1900027020), and the
ethical approval was obtained from the
institutional review board of Interna-
tional Peace Maternity and Child Health
Hospital
(GKLW2019-11).
Informed
consent
was
obtained
from
all
participants.
Participants
This cross-sectional study was per-
formed in 25 public hospitals from 10
provinces across China, covering the
East, the Middle, the Northwest, the
Northeast, and the South. Pregnant
women in their third trimester of preg-
nancy were invited to complete a study
questionnaire by a trained research as-
sistant during their regular obstetrical
clinic visit. Questions pertained to soci-
odemographic characteristics, lifestyles,
reproductive history, history of mental
health
problems,
current
depressive
symptoms, marital and family support,
and pregnancy complications (threat-
ened abortion, gestational diabetes mel-
litus, hypertensive disorder, placenta
previa, intrahepatic cholestasis of preg-
nancy, oligohydramnios, and intrauter-
ine growth restriction).
Assessment criteria
Depressive symptoms were measured by
EPDS, the most frequently used and
internationally recommended screening
measure for perinatal depression.11,12
EPDS was used to evaluate feelings in
the last 7 days with a recommended
cutoff score of 10 or higher to detect
possible depression during community-
based screening.13,14 In this study, a
cutoff score of 10 or higher was used to
analyze group differences in depression
because this lower cutoff score is rec-
ommended for Asian population.12 In
addition to depression, EPDS may be
used to assess anxiety symptoms. The
accumulative score from the items 3, 4,
and 5 in EPDS (EPDS-3A) represents the
anxiety dimension.15,16
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted with R sta-
tistical software version 3.6.2 (packages
rms,
ggplot2,
ggradar,
nCOV2019,
recharts). All reported probability values
were 2-tailed, and the criterion for sig-
niﬁcance was set at P¼.05. Univariate
statistics and distribution were assessed;
AJOG at a Glance
Why was this study conducted?
A crisis such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is a major public health
event that causes signiﬁcant uncertainty and isolation. The negative impact may
be even greater among pregnant women who have increased stress owing to
concerns for their fetus.
Key ﬁndings
An increase in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was found
after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 human-to-human transmission.
Pregnant women also reported having signiﬁcantly more thoughts of self-harm.
Women at increased risk for depression after the crisis declaration included those
who were primiparous, younger than 35 years, underweight before pregnancy,
employed full time, in middle income category, and had a per capita living area of
20 m2 and decreased physical activity.
What does this add to what is known?
Major public health emergencies may increase the depression and anxiety levels
in pregnant women.

continuous variables were presented as
means and standard deviations or me-
dian and interquartile ranges (IQRs).
Categorical variables were expressed as
frequency and percentage. The crude
prevalence of depressive symptoms was
displayed from January 1, 2020, to
February 9, 2020. The chi-square test
was
used
for
categorical
variables.
Mann-Whitney U tests were applied to
continuous variables with a non-normal
distribution. We investigated the associ-
ation between the number of changes
per day (conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases,
suspected cases, or death cases) and
EPDS scores using ordinary least squares
linear regression models. We also inves-
tigated
the
risk
for
depression
(EPDS10) using logistic regression
models. The analyses were adjusted for
potential confounders such as age, body
mass index (BMI), education levels,
occupation, annual household income,
parity, investigation site, family support,
per capita living area, maternal only-
child status, pregnancy complications,
and
exercise
level.
Ordinal
logistic
regression model was used for a response
variable with each EPDS items and with
explanatory factors. Further model as-
sumptions were assessed by plotting
model residuals and evaluating R2/sum
of squared residuals.
We performed a subgroup analysis to
investigate whether the increased risk for
depressive symptoms was associated
with the declaration of the COVID-19
epidemic using radar plot and attribut-
able risk proportion and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CIs). To further examine risk
factors,
we
examined
COVID-19e
related factors, baseline variables, and
pregnancy complications using logistic
regression. The parameters included
COVID-19 epidemic declaration, edu-
cation
levels,
occupation,
annual
household income, family support, per
capita living area, maternal only-child
status, placenta previa, and exercise. We
also considered investigation sites, his-
tory of diseases, use of assisted repro-
ductive technology (ART), and twin
pregnancy as potential confounders, but
adjustment for these variables did not
change the results and therefore were not
include in the ﬁnal models. We did not
use imputing data analyses due to no
missing data.
Results
Sample characteristics
A total of 4124 pregnant women were
included in the analysis, 2839 of whom
were investigated before January 21,
2020 (group 1). The distribution of de-
mographic
characteristics,
including
geographic region, was similar between
the 2 study groups (Table 1). Owing to
the small proportion of women with a
history of anxiety or depression (<1%),
we did not exclude them in the following
analyses.
Depressive and anxiety symptoms
and coronavirus disease 2019
We found that women in group 2 had
higher mean EPDS scores (meanSD,
7.74.4 vs 7.44.3) and anxiety subscale
scores (meanSD, 3.41.7 vs 3.21.7)
than those in group 1. Furthermore,
awareness of the COVID-19 epidemic
signiﬁcantly increased the prevalence of
depressive
symptoms
(EPDS10)
(adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.20; 95% CI,
1.04e1.40; P¼.01) and the risk of
thoughts of self-harm (aRR, 2.85; 95%
CI, 1.70e8.85; P¼.005).
The
number
of
suspected
and
conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases increased
rapidly after human-to-human trans-
mission was ﬁrst reported on January 20,
2020 (Figure 1, A and B). Between
January 20, 2020, and February 9, 2020, a
stable increase in the prevalence of
depressive symptoms (EPDS10) was
found as the number of suspected and
conﬁrmed cases increased. Overall, the
prevalence of depressive symptoms was
26.0% in group 1 and 29.6% in group 2.
Subgroup analysis showed that the fre-
quency of high EPDS scores between
January 20 and February 9 was 34.2%
(n¼81, EPDS10) and 13.9% (n¼33,
EPDS13) with the largest increase in
symptoms after February 5. To further
analyze the adverse effect of the COVID-
19 epidemic, standard linear regression
models were used to examine the asso-
ciation between depressive symptoms
and the number of new infections re-
ported per day. Both number of newly
conﬁrmed infections (b¼0.09, per 1000
cases increase, P¼.003) and suspected
infections (b¼0.06, per 1000 cases in-
crease, P¼.004) per day were positively
correlated
with
the
prevalence
of
depressive symptoms (Figure 1, C and
E). A linear positive association was also
noted between EPDS scores and the
number of newly conﬁrmed infections
per day (b¼0.09, per 1000 cases increase,
P¼.04). A signiﬁcant positive correlation
was found between the number of new
deaths per day and the prevalence of
depression (b¼0.05, per 10 cases in-
crease, P¼.001) and correlation with
EPDS scores (b¼0.08, per 10 cases in-
crease, P¼.008).
Risk factors for depressive
symptoms
We explored previously identiﬁed meta-
analytic risk factors and found that in the
overall sample, women were at increased
risk if they (1) had below college edu-
cation, (2) had a low annual household
income, (3) worked part time or less, (4)
had a per capita living area of 20 m2,
(5) were an only child, (6) had perceived
poor family support, (7) reported less
than 7 hours per week of physical exer-
cise, and (8) had a placenta previa
(Table 2).
A subgroup analysis was conducted to
explore risk factors speciﬁcally associ-
ated with depressive symptoms during
the COVID-19 outbreak from January
20, 2020, to February 9, 2020 (Figure 2).
The contribution of sociodemographic
factors to the increased prevalence dur-
ing the outbreak is shown in Figure 2, B.
Women at higher risk for depressive
symptoms include those with a middle
annual household income and low levels
of physical exercise. Interestingly, preg-
nant women who were primiparous,
younger than 35 years, with a per capita
area of  20 m2, and pregestational BMI
of 18.5 kg/m2 seemed to be more
vulnerable to develop depressive symp-
toms during the COVID-19 outbreak as
were those who were employed full time.

wherein there is increased stress and fear
due to the additional concern for an
unborn fetus. After the declaration of
human-to-human transmission of the
COVID-19 by the Chinese government
on January 20, 2020, global concern and
uncertainty increased dramatically. A
clinically signiﬁcant rise in the preva-
lence of depressive symptoms was found
among pregnant women increasing from
26% before January 20, 2020, to 34.2%
between February 5 and 9, 2020. A sig-
niﬁcant increase in anxiety symptoms
was
also
found.
The
COVID-19
outbreak may contribute to a signiﬁ-
cant increase in mild depressive symp-
toms instead of severe symptoms, as we
found that the percentage of women
with EPDS scores between 10 and 12 was
higher after the COVID-19 epidemic
declaration (data not shown).
Not surprising, the prevalence of
depressive symptoms increased as the
number of death and newly diagnosed
cases also increased. Owing to the sud-
den
outbreak,
the
features
of
the
COVID-19
virus
and
symptoms
remained unknown for weeks, causing
overall heightened fear and concern for
vertical
mother-to-fetus
transmission
among pregnant women. Rapid report-
ing through the news and social media
eliminated the regional differences such
that increased rates of depressive symp-
toms
were
found
among
pregnant
women in the 10 participating provinces
independent of the number of cases
found locally.
Results in context of what is known
Consistent with previous meta-analyses,
we conﬁrmed several risk factors for
depressive symptoms in the whole sample
such as low socioeconomic status, insuf-
ﬁcient social support, and poor health
behaviors including a lack of physical
activity.17,18 In addition, maternal only-
child status, a common phenomenon in
women of reproductive age due to
China’s 1-child policy, was found to be an
independent risk factor for depression. In

transmission, subgroup analyses found
pregnant women who were younger than
35 years, underweight, primiparous, had
middle-income, were working full time,
and residing in a per capita living area of
20 m2 were now more likely to experi-
ence depressive symptoms. These women
are not typically at high risk for perinatal
mental illness as we identiﬁed in the
entire study population of pregnant
women, and this may help explain the
increased rates found in this study after
the pivotal date of January 20, 2020.
Concern for the economic fallout and
increased unemployment caused by the
COVID-19
crisis
may
explain
why
middle-class women were at increased
risk.19 Conversely, having to leave home
to work full time may have increased
concern for infection and vertical trans-
mission and thus increased risk for
depression and anxiety. A lack of physical
activity was continuously associated with
depressive symptoms independent of the
epidemic. Meta-analytic results suggest
physical activity has a protective effect on
mental health in young adults. Even small
amounts of exercise (eg, walking <150
minutes per week) decreases the inci-
dence of depressive episodes.20 These
ﬁndings suggest that 1 potentially modi-
ﬁable factor for the onset of depression is
physical activity and that programs to
support exercise across the perinatal
period are warranted. In an infectious
disease pandemic, exercises performed in
isolation or at home may help to decrease
the depressive symptoms of pregnant
women. For example, home-based exer-
cises, such as walking extra steps around
the same rooms inside the ﬂat, or exer-
cising on stairs every few hours could be
included as an essential part of the self-
isolation or protection guidelines.21
Clinical implications
Our present data revealed an increase in
the proportion of women with thoughts
of self-harm, which could potentially
result in death and injury indirectly
caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. The
interventions for perinatal mental health
should be a priority during any public-
wide epidemic. Although mental health
issues have been acknowledged during
pandemics and a guideline of psycholog-
ical crisis intervention speciﬁcally for
COVID-19 has been published by the
National Health Commission of China,
perinatal women have not been high-
lighted in this guideline as a vulnerable
population.22 Screening for
perinatal
depression and anxiety has been interna-
tionally recommended and should be a
priority during an international public
health crisis. Under the circumstances of
population-based social distancing and
isolation, psychological hotlines and on-
line counseling would be a safe and
feasible strategy to manage perinatal
mental illness. With the limited medical
resources, women who have previously
experienced perinataldepression couldbe
recruited as trained volunteers to provide
telephone-based peer support that has
been shown to have a preventive effect.23
Research implications
Further intervention studies addressing
the screening and management of peri-
natal mental health through virtual care
are warranted. From the SARS experi-
ence, we learned that the stressful impact
of an infectious disease is qualitatively
distinct in 2 ways from the stress of other
disasters. First, potential exposure to a
contagion brings social isolation. Inter-
personal isolation in an infectious dis-
ease outbreak results in (1) the required
use of personal protective equipment
and physical distancing to control the
spread of disease, (2) the strong tendency

and suspected cases have rapidly increased since January 20, 2020; b Included gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia,
gestational hypertension, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, placenta previa, malposition, fetal growth restriction, and
high-risk pregnancy status; c Included generalized anxiety disorder, panic, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, social
phobia, and depression disorder; d Participating Chinese provinces with conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases <500 included
Shanghai, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and Hainan. Provinces with conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases 500 included Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui,
Hunan, and Jiangxi.

for those who are potentially exposed to
cope with signiﬁcant stress, and (3) the
tendency of others to fear, avoid, and
stigmatize those who have been poten-
tially exposed.24,25 Second, pregnant
women have heightened fear for their
unborn fetus’s safety. Given the mental
health consequences of a dramatic life-
threatening
outbreak
for
pregnant
women, organizational and personal
resilience strategies should be investi-
gated and may include evidence-based
approaches to effective risk communi-
cation and the provision of psychological
ﬁrst aid.26 Clear communication with
regular and accurate updates about the
outbreak
should
be
provided
as
preventive strategy for mental well-
being. Emotional and behavioral re-
sponses are part of an adaptive response
to extraordinary stress and psychother-
apy techniques such as those based on
stress adaptation may be effective. In any
public health emergency, feelings of fear,
uncertainty,
and
stigmatization
are
common and may act as help-seeking
barriers to appropriate mental health
interventions.
Strengths and limitations
This study is the ﬁrst to report the
mental health response of pregnant
women during the COVID-19 outbreak
in
China.
An
ongoing
multicenter,
cross-sectional study to examine the
mental health of pregnant women pro-
vided a unique opportunity to compare
the prevalence of depression before and
after the national declaration of an
epidemic.
Although
this
innovative
study has numerous strengths, it did not
include pregnant women from Wuhan,
Hubei province. The severe situation and
strict quarantine measures in Wuhan
owing to the COVID-19 outbreak pre-
vented us from conducting a further
study. Another limitation is the assess-
ment of depressive and anxiety symp-
toms, which relied on a self-reported
measure. Although the EPDS and the
anxiety subscale is an internationally

Chinese women, it does not provide a
diagnosis of depression or anxiety.
Conclusion
This study examined the mental health
of pregnant women during the COVID-
19 outbreak. Our ﬁndings indicate a
clinically signiﬁcant increase in the
prevalence of depressive and anxiety
symptoms
after
the
declaration
of
human-to-human transmission and an
increased
threat
of
the
COVID-19
epidemic. In addition to the well-
documented perinatal mental health
risk factors, we found that primiparous
women of younger age, of middle-
income
status,
and
with
full-time
employment were at increased risk for
developing depressive symptoms during
the COVID-19 outbreak. More worry-
ingly, the percentage of women with
thoughts of self-harm was signiﬁcantly
higher during the outbreak. Our results
suggest that effective interventions to
manage the mental trauma that devel-
oped and potentially continues after
serious life-threatening public health
events are warranted.
