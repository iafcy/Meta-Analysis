Objective: To explore any apparent trends in maternal or neonatal outcomes during the Covid-19
pandemic by comparing the maternity outcomes before, during and after the pandemic.
Study design: A retrospective review was performed of maternity statistics recorded on the hospital
database of a large tertiary referral centre in Dublin with over 8000 deliveries per annum from 1st
January to 31st July 2020. This time period represented the months prior to, during the peak and
following the pandemic in Ireland.
Results: There was no correlation between the monthly number of Covid deaths and the monthly number
of perinatal deaths (r = 0.465, NS), preterm births (r = 0.339, NS) or hypertensive pregnancies (r = 0.48,
NS).
Compared to the combined numbers for the same month in 2018 and 2019, there were no signiﬁcant
changes in perinatal deaths or preterm births in the months when Covid deaths were at their height. The
rate of preterm birth was signiﬁcantly less common in January-July 2020 compared to January-July in
2018/2019 (7.4 % v 8.6 %, chi-sq 4.53, P = 0.03).
Conclusion: The was no evidence of a negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on maternity services, as
demonstrated by maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Introduction
Covid-19 has been described as the pandemic of the century [1].
The Republic of Ireland (ROI) has been successful in its endeavour
to ‘ﬂatten the curve’ and reduce transmission of the virus through
strict public health measures overseen by the National Public
Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The ﬁrst detected case of SARS
CoV2 in the Republic of Ireland was reported on 29th February
2020. Schools, colleges and childcare facilities were closed on 12th
March followed by a nationally enforced ‘lockdown’ on 27th March
which saw government-mandated closure of all non-essential
businesses, restricted non-essential journeys and advised isolation
of vulnerable individuals. Ireland’s strategy is synchronous with
global strategies endorsed by the World Health Organisation and
European Centre for Disease Control. During the containment
phase, a policy of case identiﬁcation, testing and contact tracing
was implemented. The country is now in the delay phase, with
successful suppression of the virus in the community, although
concern mounts for a possible ‘second wave [2,3]. Table 1
represents the incidence of and deaths with SARS-CoV2 in the
Republic of Ireland from January to July 2020. There was
widespread transmission and diagnosis of the virus, and virus-
related deaths from March, peaking in April and declining sharply
thereafter.
The initial response to the virus saw a radical overhaul of the
Irish healthcare system in order to mitigate the impact of the
pandemic on healthcare resources. Restrictions were placed on
elective and outpatient services with a focus on maintaining
emergent and essential clinical services [5]. As pregnancy is a time-
limited condition, provision of maternity care is an essential
service which continued to function throughout the pandemic,
albeit with adjustment to care pathways [1,6,7]. Now in the delay
phase, a retrospective analysis of the impact of the pandemic on
maternity services is appropriate. It is possible that there are direct
effects of the virus in pregnant women, but it is also plausible that
there are subtle effects resulting from the change in service
delivery, or possibly to due to maternal stress and anxiety arising
during this period.

The time is right to explore any apparent trends in maternal or
neonatal outcomes during this time period by comparing the
maternity outcomes before, during and after the pandemic.
Methods
This was a retrospective review of maternity outcomes over a
7-month period in the largest provider of women and infants
healthcare in the Republic of Ireland. The Coombe Women &
Infants University Hospital (CWIUH) is a large, stand-alone
Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Neonatal tertiary referral centre
serving a static catchment area with approximately 8000
deliveries per annum. All maternities are recorded on the
hospital database that is used to generate a published annual
report. Maternal and neonatal outcomes from 1st January to
31st July 2020 were reviewed. This time period encompasses the
time from the pre-pandemic phase, through the peak incidence
of Covid-19 cases in Ireland, to the period where national
lockdown measures were eased following successful contain-
ment of the virus.
The monthly number of covid deaths was correlated with
monthly birth statistics (Pearsons correlation co-efﬁcient) to
reveal any signiﬁcant associations with the progress and resolution
of the pandemic. In addition, the monthly perinatal mortality and
preterm birth statistics from 2018 and 2019 were combined and
then analysed against the statistics from 2020 using chi-squared
analysis or Fishers exact test as appropriate.
The aim was to identify any statistically signiﬁcant trends in
maternal or neonatal outcomes during this period and examine the
impact of the pandemic on healthcare delivery. Hospital senior
management authorised the collection and analysis of data from
the hospital database.
Results
Monthly maternity statistics for the Coombe Women & Infants
University Hospital 2020 are shown in Table 2.
Fig. 1 demonstrates the perinatal death and preterm birth rate
from January to July, contrasted with the number of Covid-19
related deaths in the ROI in the same time period.
There was no correlation between the monthly number of Covid
deaths and the monthly number of preterm deliveries <37 weeks
(r = 0.339, p = NS), preterm deliveries <26 weeks (r=0,32, p = NS)
or with the monthly number of perinatal deaths (r = 0.465, p = NS).
The mode of delivery did not show any signiﬁcant correlations
but April (the month of highest Covid-related mortality) had the
lowest normal delivery rate. The number of inductions of labour
was negatively correlated with the number of Covid deaths
(r=0.759, p < 0.05) and the lowest labour induction rate was also
seen in April. (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
The diagnosis of antenatal complications such as hypertensive
diseases of pregnancy occurred at the same rate pre-pandemic as
in the months during the pandemic (Table 3). No difference was
seen in the rate of intrapartum or postpartum complications, and
low birthweight infants were seen at the same frequency
throughout the study period (Table 4).
There was no correlation in the rate of unbooked pregnancies,
or infants born before arrival to hospital and the number of Covid
deaths in the review period (Table 3). Disclosures of domestic
violence at booking visit appear to be less during the peak
pandemic period, although this was not found to be statistically
signiﬁcant.
Table 5 outlines the hospital statistics for the same months in
2018 and 2019. If the 2018 and 2019 numbers are combined and
compared to the same month in 2020, there were signiﬁcantly less
preterm births in February 2020 and signiﬁcantly less perinatal
deaths in July 2020, however neither of these months were during
the peak pandemic period. In comparison to the preceding two
years, the rate of preterm delivery over the 7 month period in 2020
was signiﬁcantly less (7.4 % v 8.6 %, chi-sq 4.53, 1df, p = 0.03).
In summary, there is no correlation between Covid deaths
(representing the pandemic peak) and preterm births, perinatal
mortality, mode of delivery or maternity complications across the
months of January to July 2020. When 2020 monthly statistics are
compared to 2018 and 2019 combined, there is an overall reduction
in preterm births and more speciﬁcally, a difference observed in
February 2020. There is a signiﬁcant reduction in perinatal deaths
in July 2020 compared to July 2018 and 2019 combined but no
difference in the overall perinatal mortality rate during the
pandemic period reviewed compared with previous years.

Discussion
There has been a wealth of data published on Covid-19 infection
in pregnancy and our knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV2 on
maternal and neonatal outcomes has rapidly evolved, with reports
of perinatal transmission increasing [8,9]. In contrast, although
much has been written regarding potential unintended adverse
effects of the pandemic on provision of maternity services and the
resulting impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes, there has
been little actual data to support or refute these concerns,

particularly since many countries continue to experience wide-
spread infection and so are not yet in a position to perform
reﬂective analysis [7,10,11]. This study of overall hospital statistics
compares monthly outcomes and relates them to the severity of
the pandemic and also to the combined hospital statistics of the
same month in 2018 and 2019. The severity of the pandemic was
assessed by the number of Covid related deaths in the ROI. The
number of Covid deaths rather than Covid-19 infection rate was
used as a disease marker as it is a more reliable measure, being
unaffected by testing availability, inaccuracies, delayed reporting
and missing asymptomatic individuals.
Published data suggests an increase in preterm births in Covid-
19 affected pregnancies, the majority of which is iatrogenic due to
maternal illness or fetal compromise [8,9]. A large population-
based study in the UK by Knight et al. (2020) showed a 26 %
preterm birth rate amongst Covid-19 affected pregnancies and 76 %
of these were iatrogenic [9]. However, a regional maternity unit in
Ireland has described a reduction in preterm deliveries of very low
birth weight infants during the Covid-19 pandemic in their
population. The authors postulated this resulted from a socio-
environmental impact of mandated lockdown on pregnant women
unaffected by Covid-19. The study is, however, based on a four
month period from January to April 2020, which includes a 2
month period from when SARS-CoV2 was ﬁrst diagnosed in Ireland
(March and April), and a 6 week period of lockdown (from 12th
March onwards) [12].
Yet data from our unit, with almost double the delivery rate and
evaluating the complete course of the pandemic, does reveal a
reduction in preterm deliveries in comparison to the same time
period in the preceding two years. It could be reasoned that this
may be secondary to social and health behaviours amongst the
obstetric population in the midst of a pandemic with enforced
lockdown. However, February 2020 was the only month individu-
ally to demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant difference from the
same month in the preceding two years, which was prior to the
ﬁrst diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 in Ireland. The preterm delivery rate
for March and April 2020 was not signiﬁcantly different from the
same months in 2018 and 2019 and overall there was no
correlation between the preterm delivery rate in 2020 and the
peak pandemic period, represented by incidence of Covid-related
deaths. One factor which warrants consideration is the impact of
the newly enacted legislation on 1st January 2019 allowing for
termination of pregnancy in limited circumstances in Ireland.
Termination of pregnancies with chromosomal or congenital
anomalies which may have been predisposed to either spontane-
ous or iatrogenic preterm delivery may in part contribute to the
noted reduction in preterm birth rate in 2020.
The perinatal mortality rate in CWIUH remained stable
throughout the peak of the pandemic, however there was a
signiﬁcant reduction noted in July 2020 in comparison with
previous years. In contrast, Khalil et al. (2020) compared birth
trends in their London unit in a pre-pandemic and pandemic time
period and found a signiﬁcantly increased incidence of stillbirth,
none of which occurred in women diagnosed with Covid-19 [13].
However, the testing strategy in the UK at that time was limited to
symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalisation and it is noted
that surveillance data suggests up to 90 % asymptomatic infection
rate among pregnant populations [13–16]. There is also no
evidence of SARS-CoV2 testing of these women following the
diagnosis of intrauterine fetal demise, nor postmortem testing of
fetal or placental tissue.
There was a negative correlation between the induction rate
and the number of Covid deaths (p < 0.05), with the lowest rate of
inductions occurring in April (34 %), during the peak of Covid-19
case diagnoses and deaths. This may demonstrate less obstetric
intervention, however this is negated by the mode of delivery
statistics which show April had the lowest rate of normal deliveries
(49 %) and the highest rate of caesarean sections (37 %) in the seven
month period.
A statistically signiﬁcant decrease in hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy during the pandemic period was described in the
study by Khalil et al. (2020). The authors hypothesised that this,
together 
with 
the 
increased 
stillbirth 
incidence, 
may 
be
secondary to reduced antenatal surveillance or women less
likely to attend hospital during the pandemic if unwell or
concerns with fetal movements [13]. Worries regarding the
possibility of missed antenatal complications were also raised by
other publications, secondary to the rapid reconﬁguration of
maternity services during the pandemic [7]. However, as shown
in Table 4, there was no difference in pregnancy or delivery
complications in the CWIUH during this time period. Antenatal
visits continued with regular frequency and although anecdotally
women may have been deterred from attending the hospital on
an emergent basis, there was no demonstrable impact on
pregnancy outcomes.
Corbett et al. (2020), in a study performed in an obstetric
population during the ﬁrst two weeks of the pandemic delay phase
in Ireland, found that over half of women surveyed worried about
their health often or all of the time, with 63 % reporting concern
about their unborn baby. They reported an overall increased level
of health anxiety in this population, which may explain why initial
fears that women would be deterred from attending hospital or
seeking emergent care in pregnancy have not been evidenced in
our study [17]. There was no difference in unbooked pregnancies or
infants born before arrival to hospital during the months pre- and
post-pandemic peak or in the midst of it.
Concern regarding an increase in domestic violence due to the
effects of social isolation and enforced lockdown measures during
the pandemic has been well-documented [18]. The Irish Govern-
ment ran a campaign across television, radio and social media to
reassure victims of domestic violence that supports remained
available in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic [19]. Pregnancy is an
acknowledged risk factor for domestic violence which compounds
the risk in the obstetric population during this period of mandated
lockdown [7,18]. At the booking visit in our unit, all women are
asked if they have or are experiencing domestic violence to identify

those at risk. Interestingly, less women disclosed domestic
violence at booking during the peak pandemic period when
lockdown was enforced in the months of March and April, 2
women in each month, in comparison with the pre-pandemic
months of January and February where 12 and 10 women
respectively, made disclosures (Table 3). This was consistent with
a survey of 71 patients performed in the CWIUH on the effects of
isolation on mood and relationships in pregnant women during the
covid-19 pandemic (Milne et al., 2020). They found only 4.3 % of
women reported a deterioration in their relationship with their
partner during the pandemic, which is less than published reports
of DV in pregnancy, with no reports of physical violence and the
majority of women reporting improved relationships [20].
Conclusion
We continue to live through the Covid-19 era, with uncontrolled
spread and resurgence of the virus in many countries across the
world. The rapid control and ongoing successful suppression of the
Covid-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland over a short
timeframe affords us the ability to provide a unique insight into
the effects of the pandemic on maternity services in a high-income
country 
with 
universal 
access 
to healthcare. 
There 
was 
a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in the number of preterm births
over the study period in comparison to previous years, however
further research is required before attributing this ﬁnding to
behavioural and environmental changes secondary to the effects of
the pandemic. There were no differences in all other maternal and
neonatal outcomes reviewed.
It is important to realise the impact of the pandemic on
pregnant women, and information sharing with studies like ours
will assist in reassuring the obstetric population that the overall
results approximate to those 
expected. Ongoing review of
maternity statistics also allows us to remain vigilant for developing
trends or problems to enable us to adapt our services as needed. It
is also important to validate the efforts of healthcare providers who
continually strive to provide high quality healthcare in ever-
challenging circumstances.
