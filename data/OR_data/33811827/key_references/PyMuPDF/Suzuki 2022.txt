LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Psychological status during the first trimester of pregnancy under the
COVID-19 epidemic in Japan
To the Editors,
The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), a novel cor-
onavirus first reported in late 2019, has rapidly spread
across the globe becoming an epidemic [1]. In an
attempt to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 infection,
various self-restraint requests have been imposed in
Japan. Limitations are known to cause psychosocial prob-
lems, especially for those recognized as vulnerable.
For women of reproductive age, psychiatry regarding
pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing will change rap-
idly [2]. Recently, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders
have been the most common mental health problems
among these women, and they have been associated
with increased risks of maternal and infant mortality and
morbidity and been recognized as significant patient
safety issues [2]. In our earlier study [3], the incidence of
depressive and/or anxiety symptoms have been observed
to be about 20–35% in the primiparous women during
the first trimester of pregnancy.
In the current study, we compared the prevalence of
depressive and/or anxiety symptoms during the first
trimester of pregnancy screened during the COVID-19
epidemic with those at the same period last year.
The
study
protocol was
approved
by the
Ethics
Committee of Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity
Hospital. Informed consent concerning retrospective anal-
yses was obtained from all subjects.
Since April 2016, we asked all Japanese women who
gave birth at Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity
Hospital to answer the following 2 self-administered
questionnaires at 8–12 weeks of gestation (first trimester
of pregnancy).
The first questionnaire was the tale of Whooley two
questions [4], a screening instrument for depression in
the general adult population including pregnant and
postpartum women.

During the past month, have you often been both-
ered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

During the past month, have you often been both-
ered
by
having
little
interest
or
pleasure
in
doing things?

If at least one of the two questions is ‘yes’, we diag-
nose the woman as having depressive symptom.

The
second
questionnaire
was
the
2-item
Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) to
screen for generalized anxiety disorder [4].

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been
bothered by feeling nervous, anxious or on edge?

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been
bothered
by
not
being
able
to
stop
or
con-
trol worrying?
If at least one of the two questions is ‘yes’, we diag-
nose the woman as having anxiety symptom.
In this study, we compared the positive rates of the
two screening tools in the postpartum women conducted
between 9 March and 11 April 2019 (the COVID-19 con-
trol, n ¼ 134) with those conducted between 11 March
and 13 April 2020 (epidemic, n ¼ 117). In this study, we
excluded the women who had a definite diagnosis of
mental disorders before pregnancy. In addition, we exam-
ined the maternal age and parity.
Data are expressed as numbers and percentages. The
v2 or Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical varia-
bles. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were also calculated. Differences with p < .05 were con-
sidered significant.
In this study, all mothers gave us analyzable answers.
Table

shows
characteristics
of
the
women
and
the results. As shown in Table 1, the positive screening
rate of the Whooley two questions in the COVID-19 epi-
demic group increased significantly than that in control
(OR ¼ 1.96, p ¼ .036) although there were no significant
differences in others between the two groups.
Depression has been reviewed to be the most com-
mon mental health problem in the perinatal period [5]. It
had been observed to affect about 10–15 out of every
100
pregnant
women
[5].
The
COVID-19
epidemic
exposes underlying inequalities in socio-economic and
health systems. Many people with serious mental prob-
lems will suffer due to an insufficient support of medical,
social and financial resources. Based on the current
results, the worse psychological status may present dur-
ing the first trimester of pregnancy under the COVID-19
epidemic. We understand that the sample size of this
study may have been too small to compare the two peri-
ods even if the outbreak of COVID-19 had just started.
In
addition,

questionnaires for Japanese women may be unclear;
however, the current frequencies may indicate that the
mental status of Japanese women is unstable with vari-
ous physical and/or social changes under the COVID-19
epidemic in Japan.
