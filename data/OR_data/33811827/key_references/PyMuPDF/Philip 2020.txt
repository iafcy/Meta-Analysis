ABSTRACT
Background  Aetiology of births involving very low 
birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low birthweight (ELBW) 
infants is heterogeneous and preventive strategies remain 
elusive. Socioenvironmental measures implemented as 
Ireland’s response to the SARS-­CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) 
pandemic represented a national lockdown, and have 
possibly influenced the health and well-­being of pregnant 
women and unborn infants.
Methods  Regional trends of VLBW and ELBW infants in 
one designated health area of Ireland over two decades 
were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses 
with 95% CI were conducted. Regional data covering 
most of the lockdown period of 2020 were compared 
with historical regional and national data and forecasted 
national figures for 2020.
Results  Poisson regression analysis found that the regional 
historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to 
April, 2001–2019 was 8.18 (95% CI 7.21 to 9.29). During 
January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just 
2.17 per 1000 live births was observed, reflecting a rate 
ratio of 3.77 (95% CI 1.21 to 11.75), p=0.022, representing 
a 73% reduction of VLBW during the first 4 months of 2020 
compared with same period for the preceding two decades. 
There were no ELBW infants admitted to the regional 
neonatal intensive care unit. National Irish VLBW rate for 
2020 is forecasted to be reduced to approximate 400 per 
60 000 births compared with the historical 500–600 range.
Conclusion  An unprecedented reduction in regional 
births of VLBW and ELBW infants was observed in 
Ireland coinciding with the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential 
determinants of this unique temporal trend possibly 
reside in the summative socioenvironmental impact of 
the COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings, if mirrored in other 
regions that have adopted a lockdown, demonstrate the 
potential to evaluate these implicated behavioural and 
socioenvironmental modifiers to positively influence VLBW 
and ELBW rates globally.
INTRODUCTION
Over 15 million babies are born too early, 
too sick and too small in the world annually. 
One million of these infants die.1 Very low 
birth weight (VLBW <1500 g) and extremely 
low birth weight (ELBW <1000 g) contribute 
significantly to infant mortality.2–5 In 2016, 
46% of the under 5 mortality globally was 
Key questions
What is already known?
►
►Very low birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low 
birthweight (ELBW) infants contribute significantly to 
under 5 mortality globally.
►
►Currently, there is no broadly accepted and effective 
strategy to prevent the birth of premature VLBW and 
ELBW infants.
►
►Impact of cumulative socioenvironmental and ma-
ternal behavioural modifications on the incidence of 
very preterm births has not been assessed.
What are the new findings?
►
►COVID-19-­triggered national lockdown in Ireland 
created an opportunity to study the cumulative influ-
ence of socioenvironmental modifications on preg-
nant mothers.
►
►An unprecedented 73% reduction in live births of 
VLBW infants and a 100% reduction of ELBW in-
fants were noted in one designated health region of 
Ireland during January to April 2020 compared with 
the preceding 20 years.
►
►Our observations, if nationally mirrored, indicate that 
birth rate of VLBW and ELBW infants in Ireland is 
forecasted to decrease considerably in 2020.

contributed by neonatal deaths within the first 28 days 
of life and the main contributor was prematurity.5 VLBW 
and ELBW rates are increasing in most of the devel-
oped, middle-­income and low-­income countries and a 
significant proportion are of unknown aetiology.2 6 The 
frequency of preterm birth (PTB) varies from 5% to 9% 
in Europe, 10.6% in North America to 11.9% in Africa.7 8 
Most VLBW and ELBW infants are born to women with 
no prior history of premature births.5 9
Prevention of VLBW and ELBW births is considered a 
public health priority. Despite growing relevance, prog-
ress has been modest.10 Currently, there is no standardised 
and effective strategy to prevent VLBW and ELBW births, 
and implementation of socioenvironmental approaches 
to mitigate the risk of such deliveries would require better 
elucidation of non-­medical factors that are both under-­
recognised and underevaluated.11 Although the causal 
biological mechanisms mediating such births are poorly 
understood, preterm premature rupture of membranes 
(PPROM), amniotic inflammasome mediation, alter-
ations to vaginal microbiota, variations in cytokines, 
chemokines and other inflammatory modulators, as well 
as intra-­amniotic inflammation and infections have been 
suggested as the biological antecedents.12–15 Recognising 
the sources of heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in 
VLBW and ELBW births may inform eventual effective-
ness of preventive measures.16 17
Socioenvironmental 
measures 
implemented 
as 
Ireland’s response to the SARS-­CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) 
pandemic collectively constituted a national lockdown, 
and may possibly have influenced the health and well-­
being of pregnant women and their unborn infants. 
In that specific setting there existed an opportunity to 
compare the trend of VLBW and ELBW rates during the 
lockdown period with the historical data. Potential influ-
ence of a multitude of biological, physical and environ-
mental factors could cumulatively modify the births of 
VLBW and ELBW infants. We wished to assess whether 
these redefined social and behavioural boundaries have 
fostered an environment favourable to influence the 
VLBW and ELBW birth rates. These few months offered 
a unique opportunity to study the effects of a ‘Nature’s 
experiment’ of non-­medical, behavioural and socioen-
vironmental alterations as potential determinants influ-
encing overall health of the ‘intrauterine habitat’.
METHODS
Setting
A nationwide lockdown was implemented in Ireland on 
12 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and continued till 18 May. This reflected the shutdown 
of offices, shops, colleges, schools, childcare facilities and 
all other institutions deemed non-­essential. Traffic and 
mobility restrictions were imposed and most of the work-
force adapted to a new work-­from-­home (WFH) model. 
The Irish government advised the population from mid-­
February 2020 to follow strict hand hygiene measures, 
social distancing and adherence to WHO recommenda-
tions to reduce COVID-19 transmission.
Irish COVID-19 lockdown was lifted in a phased 
approach from 18 May; although most non-­essential 
services remained closed with ongoing mobility and 
social restrictions till 29 June (end of phase 2). However, 
we have maintained our observations till the end of June 
2020 (half of the year). This period of phased easing of 
the socioenvironmental measures facilitated ascertaining 
whether the observed VLBW and ELBW trends sustained 
or reverted immediately at the end of full lockdown in 
2020.
Study population
University Maternity Hospital Limerick (UMHL) is the 
only maternity facility for a population of 473 000 from 
the counties of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and 
nearby catchment areas. It provides an opportunity to 
analyse the demographic and epidemiological trends of 
births involving VLBW and ELBW infants of one of the 
designated health regions in the Ireland.18 All VLBW and 
ELBW infants of the region from 22 weeks of gestation 
are treated locally (apart from surgical or cardiac inter-
ventions). Perinatal demography and patient character-
istics of the study population have been published previ-
ously.19 All VLBW and ELBW live births at UMHL from 1 
January 2001 to 30 April 2020 were included in the study. 
No cases were excluded based on congenital anomalies, 
multiple gestations or inconsistencies around the accu-
racy of gestational age (GA) estimation.
There were no overarching significant alterations to 
the antenatal, obstetric or intrapartum care pathways 
initiated for the pregnant women at UMHL from January 
to April 2020 compared with preceding 5 years. Policies 
on antenatal steroids, antenatal magnesium sulphate, 
resuscitation of ELBW infants at the margins of viability, 
frequency of antenatal visits and obstetric ultrasound 
scans, peripartum maternal antibiotics for group B 
streptococcus prophylaxis, maternal sepsis management 
(sepsis six) and the Irish maternity early warning system 
were operational. Of note, over a 20-­year span, inter-
nationally accepted and evidence-­based practices were 
Key questions
What do the new findings imply?
►
►Our observations, if reflected in other countries that adopted 
COVID-19- prompted lockdown measures, could redefine the an-
tecedents that trigger the yet poorly understood pathways lead-
ing to very low birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low birthweight 
(ELBW) births.
►
►Socioenvironmental alterations, maternal behavioural modifica-
tions, ease of access to maternity services and the enforcement 
of lockdown measures could impact variably during pregnancy in 
different regions of the world.
►
►Reducing VLBW and ELBW rates would be the most important 
‘curve to bend’ to reduce infant mortality globally and thus promote 
the achievement of sustainable development goals for children.

implemented at UMHL compliant with national-­level 
and local-­level obstetric and neonatal guidelines.
Birthweight-based data capture and analysis
There are two established methods for cohorting high-­
risk infants, by birth weight or GA.20 A birthweight-­based 
analysis was chosen for this study, and not primarily 
based on very low GA (VLGA, <32 weeks). VLBW could 
be through pure prematurity, a combination of prematu-
rity and growth restriction/small for GA (SGA) or much 
less commonly through intrauterine growth restriction 
(IUGR) alone. We have chosen to study the VLBW and 
ELBW trends considering the following factors, (1) Accu-
rate institutional data and monthly statistics spanning 
over two decades was collected primarily on weight-­based 
criteria and later only GA added, (2) GA was calculated 
based on the best obstetric estimate and varied over 
decades based on last menstrual period, early prenatal 
ultrasound (dating scan or booking scan) or a combi-
nation, (3) For the first few years of historical data GA 
was adjusted to completed weeks (26 or 28 weeks) and 
not to exact days (25+5/7 or 28+2/7), (4) To facilitate 
later international comparison including low/middle-­
income countries having more SGA contribution and 
that the dating scan-­based accurate GA assessment may 
not be always available, and (5) To facilitate future inter-
national benchmarking studies through Vermont Oxford 
Network (VON) centres.21
Data collection
Retrospective descriptive datasets for this cohort study 
were linked for two decades from the labour ward 
register, neonatal admission register and presubmission 
data for the VON international benchmarking.21 Addi-
tional interrogation of the hospital inpatient enquiry 
system, labour ward weekly statistics for live and still-
births, early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) statis-
tics for early pregnancy loss/miscarriage information, 
inpatient ward statistics for early or late fetal loss during 
hospital admission as well as review of the hospital death 
certificate register were conducted to collate supportive 
information and to avoid ascertainment bias. We did not 
subclassify VLBW and ELBW births to spontaneous onset 
of labour with intact membranes, PPROM or medically 
initiated labour onset through induction or caesarean.7 
Our VLBW and ELBW trends were compared with the 
published National figures from the Central Statistics 
Office (CSO) and National Perinatal Epidemiology 
Centre (NPEC) of Ireland.22 23
Region-­wide search to collect data on home births 
during the lockdown and phase 1 and 2 of the easing 
of lockdown up to end of June 2020 was also conducted 
through community midwifery, ambulance centre and 
maternity emergency room database at UMHL.
Statistical analysis
Fully anonymised and deidentified dataset fulfilling 
general data protection regulation compliance was 
prepared for statistical analysis.24 Significance of 
temporal trends in the VLBW and ELBW rates per 1000 
births were assessed using Poisson regression, where time 
was entered as a continuous variable. Poisson regression 
with 95% Wald CIs and rate ratio analysis were used to 
compare the observed VLBW rate for January to April of 
2020 at UMHL to historical data. Estimates of the preva-
lence of VLBW and ELBW per 1000 births pre-2020 were 
assessed and the potential impact of January to April 
2020 regional data on the national expectation of VLBW 
for 2020 in Ireland (based on the previous published 
Irish data from VON, NPEC and CSO).21–23 All data were 
analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V.26.
Patient and public involvement
Patient and public involvement (PPI) was initiated at 
outset of research planning. Irish Neonatal Health Alli-
ance (INHA), the patient advocacy group (Registered 
Charity Number: 20100100) representing parents of 
newborn infants in Ireland and member of European 
Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants (EFCNI), 
was invited at the design stage of the study and was a 
signatory in the Research Ethics submission. INHA 
reviewed the aims of the study and confirmed that the 
issues addressed are of relevance to patients and public. 
INHA reaffirmed that the patient confidentiality is not 
breached at any stage, and specifically requested fore-
casting of National VLBW births through appropriate 
analysis in order for the advocacy group to prioritise 
family centred care programmes for 2020. INHA also 
nominated a parent of a premature VLBW infant as an 
independent external reviewer of VLBW and ELBW data 
for 2020. Designated representative of the patient advo-
cacy group is a member of the study team and authorship 
of the manuscript. Once published, the relevant findings 
of the study will be disseminated through the websites of 
INHA www.​inha.​ie and EFCNI www.​efcni.​org. Guidance 
for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public 
reporting checklist as applicable to this study has been 
fulfilled (online supplemental table).
Data verification and reporting
Considering the unprecedented and significant reduc-
tion of the VLBW and ELBW numbers observed during 
the lockdown and prelockdown phases of extra public 
health vigilance, we have verified the accuracy and 
authenticity of primary data capture with external inde-
pendent professionals and patient representative (as 
part of the PPI initiative) who are not members of the 
research team or authorship. Such measures will mini-
mise the ascertainment bias and underpins importance 
of data transparency.
RESULTS
Over the last 20 years, UMHL had 93 018 live births and 
during the 4 months of January to April from 2001 to 
2020 there were 30 705 live births. Annual live births, 
annual VLBW and ELBW rates as well as respective

numbers for 1 January to 30 April of each year for the last 
two decades are summarised in table 1. Poisson regres-
sion analyses of the 2001–2019 data did not find any 
evidence of temporal trends for UMHL January to April 
VLBW (Wald χ2=0.784, p=0.376), January to April ELBW 
(Wald χ2=0.464, p=0.496), annual VLBW (Wald χ2=0.366, 
p=0.545) or annual ELBW (Wald χ2=0.008, p=0.929).
The VLBW rate per 1000 live births (January–April) 
based on aggregate 2001–2019 data was 8.18 (95% Wald 
CI 7.21 to 9.29), representing a forecast January–April 
2020, in the absence of a temporal trend. However, the 
observed total number of only three VLBW in January–
April 2020 (all of them born before mid-­February 2020, 
with no ELBW) confirms an unusually low VLBW rate of 
just 2.17 per 1000 live births (95% Wald CI 0.70 to 6.74), 
73% lower than the forecasted rate of 8.18 (figure 1).
The rate ratio comparing the risk of VLBW in January–
April 2001–2019 to that from January to April in 2020 was 
3.77 (95% Wald CI 1.21 to 11.75), p=0.022, suggesting 
that for two decades pre-2020 there was 3.77 times 
the rate of VLBW for the months of January–April in 
comparison to 2020. The ELBW rate per 1000 live births 
for January–April using aggregated data from 2001 to 
2019 was 3.0 (95% Wald CI 2.43 to 3.70). There were no 
ELBW live births recorded for the health region during 
January–April 2020 (figure 2).
The VLBW rate per 1000 live births from the aggre-
gated regional numbers for 2001–2019 yearly data was 
computed to be 8.41 (95% Wald CI 7.83 to 9.04), providing 
a forecasted annual rate for 2020. A continuation of the

73% reduction from the January–April VLBW rate for 
the health region for the remainder of 2020 would fore-
cast a rate of 2.27 VLBW per 1000 live births. However, 
a reversal to the regional population’s prelockdown 
behavioural and socioenvironmental status quo could 
increase the rate towards historical rates.
The forecast for the 2020 national VLBW rate is taken 
from the 2014–2017 VON date for Ireland, giving a mean 
of 9.37 per 1000 live births; no trend is evident. If the 
national VLBW rate reflects the observed regional rate of 
2.17 (95% Wald CI 0.70 to 6.74) (January–April 2020), the 
upper confidence limit estimates the number of VLBW 
infants to be born in Ireland in 2020 could be reduced 
to over 400 per 60 000 births (historically 500–600). 
(table 2) However, variation in the population’s compli-
ance with lockdown, and postlockdown deterioration in 
behavioural and socioenvironmental factors or the possi-
bility of a ‘baby boom’ in late 2020, could restore the 
historical VLBW rate of over 500 per 60 000 births.
Extended data surveillance from March to June 2020 
confirmed that our initial observation sustained through 
the entire lockdown and phases 1 and 2 of the easing 
of restrictions, ELBW rate at 0.75 per 1000 live births 
(95% CI 0.11 to 5.36) and total VLBW (including ELBW) 
at 2.27 per 1000 (95% CI 0.73 to 7.03) (table 3). Mortality 
data analysis for March to June of 2016 to 2020 demon-
strated no trends for ‘shift-­to-­left’ or ‘shift-­to-­right’ in 
2020 (table  3), suggesting no evidence of early preg-
nancy loss, miscarriage or stillbirths being explanatory 
of the low rates of VLBW and ELBW in our region in 
Ireland. On the contrary, a trend towards a reduction 
in miscarriages was observed. LBW infants in the 1500–
2000 g weight distribution also showed reduced births 
during this period in 2020 compared with previous years 
(table 3).
There were no home deliveries of VLBW or ELBW 
infants during the lockdown in our region. Irish home 
birth rate is generally low and, in 2016, there were only 
180 planned home births. Overall planned home birth 
rate in our health region in Ireland from September 
2019 to June 2020 was only 15, at <0.05% of total births 
for the period.
DISCUSSION
Prematurity poses significant medical, emotional, phys-
ical, psychological and financial burden for affected 
infants, their support network, health systems, economies 
and society as a whole.25 VLBW and ELBW infants may 
be affected by significant neonatal morbidity, leading 
to long-­term health concerns during childhood.26 A 
myriad of aetiological and antecedent factors could 
trigger VLBW and ELBW births and the effectiveness of 
preventive measures depends on precise understanding 
of causation.10 A pan-­European study found rising VLBW 
and ELBW rates in most countries.27 Increase in multiple 
births as well as assisted reproduction techniques (ART) 
also contributed to the overall increase.27 Even though 
earlier literature suggests PPROM as a multifactorial 
biological process, accounting for 30%–40% premature 
births, more recent medical interventions (indicated 
PTB) account for a significant proportion of VLBW 
infants.27–29 Understanding cross-­country differences 
also could inform strategies aimed at reducing prematu-
rity.17 27

Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to encourage posi-
tive behavioural changes.30 Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System in Ireland, National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guidelines as well as the 
‘Safer Maternity Care’ document in UK are worthy initia-
tives targeting reduced VLBW and ELBW births.30–32 
Prenatal period and foetal growth could be regarded 
as a matrix for our lives and societies.33 Heterogeneous 
origins of VLBW and ELBW rates could be influenced by 
environmental changes, modifiable population factors, 
nutritional variations, stress factors and socioeconomic 
status.17 However, the yet under-­recognised, behavioural, 
sociocultural and socioenvironmental modifications 
and opportunities designed to prolong the intrauterine 
nurturing milieu could offer far more in improving birth 
rates of such high-­risk infants.
Birthweight-based data capture and analysis
Even though there has been increasing acceptance of 
GA-­based cohorting,7 29 more recent neonatal network 
and register-­based studies comparing VLBW and VLGA 
cohorts found no difference in the prediction power for 
adverse outcomes between the two groups despite the 
inherent SGA bias within the VLBW group.20 Two models 
also showed equal power to predict mortality and utility 
for benchmarking.20
The VON database and NPEC recorded 612 Irish 
infants in 2017 with gestation less than 29+6/7 weeks.21 23 
Among this national cohort only 16 (2.6%) had a birth 
weight above 1500 g, indicative of VLBW being an accept-
able proxy for significant prematurity.21–23 Contribution 
of SGA to the national VON submission in 2017 for 
VLBW was 19.5% and assuming a representative regional 
sample, our cohort of VLBW would have 80.5% prema-
ture infants who are appropriate for GA.21 23 These 
proportions could be significantly different in devel-
oping countries with relatively high SGA contribution 
among the VLBW infants.
Mortality trends: ‘shift-to-left’ and ‘shift-to-right’
Coinciding with the twenty year trend in VLBW and 
ELBW live births, we have also analysed the stillbirth 
rate (‘shift-­to-­right’) and compared with that of the lock-
down period. Even though WHO defines stillbirth for 
fetal demise >28 weeks and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention defines >20 weeks; Irish CSO and Health 
Service Executive applies >24 weeks and that definition 
was applied to the study population.22 34 In order to estab-
lish that the decline in VLBW and ELBW rate during the 
lockdown was not secondary to an unexpected increase 
in early pregnancy loss (EPL <12+6/7 completed weeks 
of gestation) or terminations or miscarriages/late fetal 
loss (<24 weeks of gestation) (collectively ‘shift-­to-­left’), 
additional EPAU statistics and labour ward level data were 
collected for 2016–2020 for the months of March to June. 
As UMHL admits all infants with birth weight <2000 g to 
the neonatal unit, we also ascertained the trend of low 
birth weight (LBW <2.5 kg) infants of 1500–2000 g cate-
gory for 2016–2019 and compared that with lockdown in 
2020.
There was no increasing trend for EPL, miscarriages 
or stillbirths at UMHL or the region during the study 
period, confirming no ‘displacement of vital statistics’ 
due to ‘shift-­to-­left’ or ‘shift-­to-­right’ in mortality as the 
main explanation for the VLBW and ELBW reduction 
(table 3).
Potential influence of termination of pregnancy on VLBW and 
ELBW rates
As one of the few developed regions of the world with 
abortion legally banned till late 2018, Ireland offers a 
unique opportunity to evaluate the natural history of 
VLBW and ELBW births and the wider relation to soci-
oenvironmental alterations.35 Could the ELBW and 
VLBW figures in early 2020 be explained partially by the 
change in termination of pregnancy (TOP) law, allowing 
for TOP beyond 12 weeks gestation in the presence of

major congenital anomalies (MCA) that limits foetal 
or neonatal viability? Examination of our regional and 
national historical data suggest not.
Historical mean prevalence of MCA among our regional 
cohort of VLBW from 2000 to 2018 (two decades of no 
TOP) was 9.2% and the national means for 2014–2017 
were 9%, 7%, 9% and 8%, respectively (55/596, 42/622, 
54/593 and 51/612).23 That is, less than 1 in every 10 
VLBW involved MCA when no TOP was available. The 
TOPs undertaken in 2019 and 2020 from January to April 
(two in 2019 and four in 2020) beyond 12 weeks of gesta-
tion in our region were for MCA, in accordance with the 
national guidelines on compassionate grounds.35
COVID-19 lockdown triggered socioenvironmental and 
behavioural modifiers
The ‘Nature’s experiment’ through the COVID-19 lock-
down could have triggered unparalleled and widespread 
socioenvironmental alterations to which pregnant 
women would have responded with appropriate behav-
ioural and lifestyle modifications. Our observational 
study is not designed to suggest causality or even asso-
ciation of specific factors or their particular influence 
exerted on the unprecedented reduction of VLBW rate 
from 8.18 (95% CI 7.21 to 9.29) to 2.17 (95% CI 0.70 to 
6.74) per 1000 live births for the January to April period. 
Potential modifiers, both facilitators and barriers, in soci-
oenvironmental settings that would have influenced the 
mother–fetus pair to reduce the rates of VLBW or ELBW 
births during the COVID-19 lockdown and prelockdown 
weeks of enhanced public health vigilance are summa-
rised as a pictorogram (figure 3). Each one of the postu-
lated reasons is supported by previous studies, often 
controlling or observing one or two variables. However, 
the COVID-19 lockdown possibly offered an unprec-
edented summative contribution of the socioenviron-
mental changes and behavioural modifications to impart 
a contemporaneous beneficial effect during pregnancy. 
An account of the previous studies favouring socioen-
vironmental and behavioural influence on VLBW and 
ELBW births is offered as an online supplemental file.
COVID-19 lockdown triggered unfavourable social issues and 
access to care
It could be argued that that the lockdown impacted nega-
tively on a subset of pregnant population due to imposed 
restrictions and constraints on timely access to hospital-­
based monitoring for fetomaternal well-­being, possibly 
resulting in delayed or deferred interventions. It is plau-
sible that such deferred choices could have contributed to

the observed reduction in VLBW and ELBW rates. Preg-
nant women may have chosen to avoid hospital visits to 
mitigate potential for COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 
triggered changes in obstetric service provision, staff 
shortage, reduced number of ultrasound scans and 
screening, all may have impacted clinical interventions.36 
However, the absence of concurrent or paired increase in 
EPL or miscarriages or stillbirths in our region, where the 
access to maternity emergency services were functioning 
uninterrupted throughout the lockdown, supports non-­
medical and societal contributions to observed signifi-
cant reduction in the VLBW and ELBW numbers.
Learning from the lockdown and societal approaches to 
influence VLBW rates
Only three VLBW and no ELBW infant admissions 
to the only neonatal intensive care unit of one of the 
health regions of Ireland from 1 January to 30 April 
2020, resulted in a reduction to zero of morbidity 
metrics primarily linked to extreme prematurity such 
as necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity 
and severe forms (grades 3 and 4) of intraventricular 
haemorrhage. While the generalisation of the morbidity 
reduction is limited by the small regional sample, our 
findings highlights the prevention of ELBW births, if not 
absolutely medically indicated, as an effective approach 
in improving the high-­risk and high-­cost complications 
associated with extreme prematurity.
Broadened preventive approaches based on socio-­
environmental alterations, stress reduction, nutritional 
optimisation and lifestyle modifications based on under-
lying individual genetic and epigenetic variations may be 
worth considering.25 These observations, if replicated in 
other regions globally during the pandemic and linked 
with varying levels of socio-­environmental restrictions 
triggered by COVID-19, could offer novel perspectives 
and promising insights facilitating analysis of yet under-­
appreciated phenotypes of VLBW and ELBW births. 
Statistical modelling approaches and big-­data analysis 
principles would also be critical.16
Our observed trend in VLBW and ELBW births, if an 
outcome of the COVID-19 enforced socioenvironmental 
and behavioural changes, suggest it is reasonable to 
postulate that, (1) the low numbers from early March 
onwards was influenced by the effects of the prelockdown 
period of extra public health vigilance that commenced 
in mid-­February, (2) effects are immediate and (3) the 
effects of lockdown will be seen in coming months and 
sustainable until such time as normality influencers are 
operating again. However, postlockdown deterioration in 
socio-­environmental factors or a ‘baby boom’ in late 2020 
could increase the VLBW and ELBW rates.
With limited international data published to date, 
emerging report from Denmark suggested a nation-
wide reduction of extremely premature births in the 
order of 90% during COVID-19 lockdown, compared 
with the preceding 5 years.37 A quasi-­experimental study 
from Netherlands is suggesting reduction in PTB of all 
strata during the various time windows of the lockdown, 
compared with the preceding ten years.38 Newspapers, 
television and radio broadcasters as well as social media 
outlets from around the world during the last 2 months 
also report the possibility of an unexpected variation in 
the very preterm and VLBW/ELBW rates from diverse 
regions where a COVID-19 lockdown was imposed.39–41 
However, reports of status quo or even an increase in 
VLBW rates from certain cities and increase in stillbirth 
rate36 also raise the possibility that it is perhaps how 
pregnant women respond to the cumulative socioenvi-
ronmental alterations and what level of medical, social, 
familial and economic support systems are offered in 
different countries or regions during the lockdown that 
influences the fetomaternal outcome.
Limitations, interpretations and generalisability
The following limitations are acknowledged: (1) 
Inherent reservations posed by retrospective nature of 
the birth cohort data spanning over two decades from 
one health region of Ireland; (2) Even though the vast 
majority of the VLBW infants would be premature, 
concurrent contribution by SGA and rarely severe IUGR 
at term could be included. However, such an inclusion 
consistently over two decades should reduce the bias and 
the weight-­based inclusion criteria would allow compar-
ison to national data by CSO, NPEC and internation-
ally through VON; (3) Inclusion of January 2020, when 
there was no lockdown or enhanced prelockdown public 
health measures. This was required to make comparison 
with the two decades of trends including the ‘first four 
calendar months’; (4) Completion of the study prior to 
the official finish of lockdown was to facilitate ease of 
comparison against the coded historical monthly data, 
timely data completion and analysis. However, we have 
extended our observation through the entire lockdown 
and the phase 1 and phase 2 of the easing as well (till end 
of June 2020) and confirmed that our initial observation 
sustained; (5) ELBW cohort could only be analysed with 
limitations considering the small number of births; (6) 
We caution the ‘no abortion policy’ that Ireland followed 
till late 2018, when making international comparisons; 
(7) The lockdown could have deferred what should 
have been medically offered early during pregnancy, 
thus arguably postponing the GA of intervention. Thus, 
it could be viewed that the potential for reduced moni-
toring opportunities or the deferred early foetoma-
ternal interventions during the lockdown could have 
also ‘shifted the band’ from ELBW and VLBW to LBW 
or normal weight and gestational category of infants; (8) 
Our observations could either be due to the cumulative 
socio-­environmental alterations and maternal behav-
ioural modifications or due to deferred early obstetric 
interventions or suboptimal timely access to the recom-
mended antenatal monitoring. Our study is not designed 
to confirm causality or reaffirm associations and the 
postulated factors summarised in figure  3 and online 
supplemental file reflects compilation of already existing

evidence; (9) Dataset from a regional sample in Ireland is 
relatively small and thus not strictly reflecting every socie-
ty’s behavioural and socioenvironmental response to the 
country-­specific components of COVID-19 lockdown and 
the offered support systems.
CONCLUSION
The Irish national lockdown in response to SARS-­CoV-2 
virus (COVID-19) pandemic and the cumulative effects 
of socioenvironmental variables such as maternal behav-
ioural modifications, opportunities to WFH, potential 
reduction in work related stresses, possible allevia-
tion of physical strain related to work and commuting, 
optimal opportunities for rest and sleep, likely increase 
in partner presence and support at home, reduced expo-
sure to infections, improved opportunities for nutritional 
support and exercise as well as the positive alterations in 
environment and air pollution, all could have possibly 
contributed to the reduction in births involving VLBW 
and ELBW infants. Potential contribution of deferred 
early obstetric interventions or suboptimal access to 
recommended antenatal monitoring, either due to insti-
tutional or patient level COVID-19-­related concerns, 
shifting the birth weight spectrum also remains a possi-
bility. Further research is needed to enhance our knowl-
edge regarding the complex ways in which environ-
mental, social, behavioural and biological factors interact 
and modify the VLBW and ELBW births. We recommend 
that WHO and national policy-­makers reflect on this 
positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic, the insight 
that it has provided, and seize the opportunity to support 
further studies from geographically diverse regions eval-
uating implicated interdependent behavioural and soci-
oenvironmental modifiers that may potentially influence 
VLBW and ELBW births.
