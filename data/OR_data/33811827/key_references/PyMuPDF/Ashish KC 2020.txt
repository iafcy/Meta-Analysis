Summary
Background The COVID-19 pandemic response is affecting maternal and neonatal health services all over the world. 
We aimed to assess the number of institutional births, their outcomes (institutional stillbirth and neonatal mortality 
rate), and quality of intrapartum care before and during the national COVID-19 lockdown in Nepal.
Methods In this prospective observational study, we collected participant-level data for pregnant women enrolled in 
the SUSTAIN and REFINE studies between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, from nine hospitals in Nepal. This period 
included 12·5 weeks before the national lockdown and 9·5 weeks during the lockdown. Women were eligible for 
inclusion if they had a gestational age of 22 weeks or more, a fetal heart sound at time of admission, and consented to 
inclusion. Women who had multiple births and their babies were excluded. We collected information on demographic 
and obstetric characteristics via extraction from case notes and health worker performance via direct observation by 
independent clinical researchers. We used regression analyses to assess changes in the number of institutional births, 
quality of care, and mortality before lockdown versus during lockdown.
Findings Of 22 907 eligible women, 21 763 women were enrolled and 20 354 gave birth, and health worker performance 
was recorded for 10 543 births. From the beginning to the end of the study period, the mean weekly number of births 
decreased from 1261·1 births (SE 66·1) before lockdown to 651·4 births (49·9) during lockdown—a reduction of 
52·4%. The institutional stillbirth rate increased from 14 per 1000 total births before lockdown to 21 per 1000 total 
births during lockdown (p=0·0002), and institutional neonatal mortality increased from 13 per 1000 livebirths to 
40 per 1000 livebirths (p=0·0022). In terms of quality of care, intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring decreased by 
13·4% (–15·4 to –11·3; p<0·0001), and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth decreased by 3·5% (–4·6 to –2·6; p=0·0032). 
The immediate newborn care practice of placing the baby skin-to-skin with their mother increased by 13·2% 
(12·1 to 14·5; p<0·0001), and health workers’ hand hygiene practices during childbirth increased by 12·9% 
(11·8 to 13·9) during lockdown (p<0·0001).
Interpretation Institutional childbirth reduced by more than half during lockdown, with increases in institutional 
stillbirth rate and neonatal mortality, and decreases in quality of care. Some behaviours improved, notably hand 
hygiene and keeping the baby skin-to-skin with their mother. An urgent need exists to protect access to high quality 
intrapartum care and prevent excess deaths for the most vulnerable health system users during this pandemic period.

Introduction
The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak has brought in 
an unprecedented change in the global and national 
landscape on daily wellbeing.1 As a result, many countries 
are responding to restrict the spread of disease through 
national or local lockdowns. As health insti­tutions show 
strain in responding to the pandemic,2 concern is 
increasing that COVID-19 will disrupt health-service 
delivery, including for maternal and new­born health 
services, particularly in resource-limited countries.3
In 2019, almost 80 million women gave birth at health 
institutions globally, which is three times the number of 
institutional births in 2000.4 Because more women and 
their babies have been able to access effective and 
respectful care before, during, and after pregnancy, 
maternal and neonatal mortality and stillbirth rates have 
all decreased substantially in the past 20 years (by 44% for 
maternal mortality, 41% for neonatal mortality, and 25% 
for stillbirth until 2019).5–7
Modelling studies have estimated the potential impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality due to reduced 
access to maternal and neonatal health services. Estimates 
by the Guttmacher Institute suggest that even a moderate 
decrease of 10% in coverage of pregnancy-related and 
neonatal health care could result in an additional 
28 000 maternal deaths and 168 000 neo­natal deaths 
globally.8 An analysis of 118 countries using the Lives Saved 
Tool suggested reductions in coverage of around 15% for

6 months could result in 253 500 addi­tional child deaths 
and 12 190 additional maternal deaths, while reductions 
of around 45% for 6 months would result in 
1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional 
maternal deaths.9
Although prioritised as an essential core health service,10 
some reports indicate that maternal and newborn health 
services are being reduced due to COVID-19 restrictions 
in low-income and middle-income countries, and that 
quality of care might be deteriorating, risking deaths and 
reversals of hard-won gains over the past two decades.11 
Reports published after the 2014–16 Ebola virus disease 
outbreaks in west Africa showed decreases in maternity 
services, including facility births, as a result of restrictions 
on travel and fear of using services.12 The full scope of the 
impact that COVID-19 is having on service delivery access 
and health outcomes, including on mortality, is difficult 
to appreciate while the pandemic is ongoing. Although 
routine data systems could be used to show changes in 
service delivery or mortality, the COVID-19 pandemic 
might have added extra strains to data col­lection in low-
income and middle-income countries.13 To date, we could 
not identify published reports of primary data showing 
reduced coverage of intrapartum care, or effects on birth 
outcomes (appendix 3 p 3).
Nepal is an example of a country that has had substantial 
gains in maternal and neonatal survival over the past two 
decades,14 yet these gains are at risk due to COVID-19. As 
of 2019, maternal mortality has decreased by 76%, stillbirth 
rate has decreased by 58%, and newborn mortality has 
decreased by 62% since 2000.14 The number of institutional 
births increased by four times between 2001 and 2016 
as a result of social mobilisation and financial incentives.13 
In Nepal, the first case of COVID-19 was detected on 
Jan 23, 2020, with additional cases detected throughout 
March, 2020.15 As a result of these additional cases being 
detected, the high-level committee for COVID-19 manage­
ment for Nepal intensified their preparations for hospitals 
to deal with the COVID-19 cases through supportive 
management and isolation.15 A country­wide lockdown was 
announced on March 21, 2020, with directives to frontline 
health-care providers to prepare for cases.15 The lockdown 
consisted of multiple restrictions including on all forms of 
travel except for emergency services, and grocery stores 
and food services with authorisation from security 
personnel from local law enforcement throughout the 
country. The lockdown was implemented abruptly, within 
a few hours of the announcement. Speculation is wide­
spread that the COVID-19 pandemic response through the 
national lockdown has had an indirect impact on women 
and babies due to travel restrictions and fear of going to 
hospitals due to COVID-19 and possible poor care.11 Health 
workers were provided with directives to use personal 
protective equipment and improve infection preventive 
practices in all hospitals to prevent transmission of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
We aimed to assess the indirect impact of the COVID-19 
lockdown on use of public health facilities for childbirth, 
quality of intrapartum care, institutional stillbirth rate, 
and neonatal mortality rate before and during lockdown.
Methods
Study design and participants
This is a prospective, observational study nested 
within two quality improvement studies, REFINE 
(ISRCTN16741720) and SUSTAIN (ISRCTN18148368), 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
During the Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa, 
the response to the outbreak reduced coverage of essential 
health services. A modelling exercise using the Lives Saved Tool 
estimated an excess of 56 700 maternal and 1 157 000 child 
deaths assuming up to 45% coverage reductions in 
118 countries for 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic 
outbreak. We searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar on 
July 5, 2020, for articles in English published in the past 5 years 
on changes in use of health facilities for childbirth, quality of 
intrapartum care, and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic 
response using the terms “COVID-19” AND “utilization of 
health services” AND “quality of intrapartum care” AND 
“mortality”. We found no published primary data regarding 
changes in coverage or quality of care, or stillbirth or neonatal 
mortality.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is one of the first and largest 
documentations of service reduction during COVID-19. We 
provide empirical evidence from nine hospitals in Nepal. 
Compared with before the COVID-19 lockdown, the number of 
institutional births was reduced by approximately half, with 
increased inequality by ethnicity. We also found a significantly 
increased risk of preterm birth, institutional stillbirth, and 
neonatal mortality during lockdown. Improvement was seen in 
the hand hygiene practices of health workers during childbirth 
and in neonatal skin-to-skin contact during the lockdown. 
During lockdown, significant reductions were seen in 
intrapartum fetal heart rate surveillance and breastfeeding 
within 1 h of birth.
Implications of all the available evidence
The COVID-19 outbreak and response has reduced coverage 
of health facility births and widened inequalities in Nepal, 
with significantly increased institutional stillbirth and neonatal 
mortality rates. These outcomes are concerning in a fragile 
health system and raise questions on policies regarding strict 
lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries during 
the COVID-19 outbreak.

being done in nine health institutions in Nepal to 
implement a safer birth bundle package for 24 months 
(from January, 2019, to December, 2020; appendix 3 p 3).16 
We report data over a period of 5 months including 
12·5 
weeks 
before 
lockdown 
implementation 
(Jan 1–March 20, 2020) and 9·5 weeks during lockdown 
(March 21–May 30, 2020).
The nine hospitals were distributed across all seven 
provinces of the country (appendix 3 p 11). The annual 
number of births in these nine hospitals covered 11·2% of 
the national number of births for 2019.16 The hospitals in 
the study provided referral obstetric services through 
Comprehensive and Emergency Obstetrics and Neonatal 
Care services. All vaginal births took place in delivery 
units and caesarean births took place in operating theatres. 
At these nine hospitals, during the study period, no cases 
of COVID-19 were reported before lockdown and 
1401 cases were reported during lockdown, but no cases 
were reported among pregnant women. There was no 
closure of any of the nine hospitals in the study as a result 
of reporting COVID-19 cases during the study period.
Participants who consented and were enrolled in the 
REFINE and SUSTAIN studies were considered for this 
study. Women at 22 weeks of gestation or more admitted 
in the labour room and whose fetal heart sound was 
heard at the time of admission were eligible for inclusion. 
For use of the participant-level data for this study, 
additional approval was sought from the ethical review 
board of Nepal Health Research Council (registration 
number 439/2020). For this study, we excluded women 
who had multiple births and their babies.
Participants provided informed written consent at the 
time of admission to the hospital. The SUSTAIN and 
REFINE studies were granted ethical approval by the 
ethical review board of Nepal Health Research Council.
Data sources and management
We extracted participant-level data from the existing data 
collection systems for the REFINE and SUSTAIN 
studies. For these studies, a validated clinical observation 
checklist was used to observe the labour and delivery 
event for all vaginal births possible, and women’s 
obstetric and neonatal information was collected from 
patient case notes. A data collection system was set up at 
each hospital and observations were done by independent 
clinical researchers using a tablet-based application. All 
the data entered in the tablet-based application were 
reviewed on a weekly basis by an independent database 
manager. For this study, data were extracted by OB into 
SPSS software (version 17.0) for cleaning of extracted 
data of all births and observed data from all vaginal 
births.
Definitions and measurements
Institutional stillbirth rate was defined as the number of 
babies born in the institution with no signs of life, with a 
gestational age of 22 weeks or more, per 1000 births. 
Institutional neonatal mortality rate was defined as the 
number of neonates who died before discharge per 
1000 livebirths. The health worker’s performance during 
intrapartum care was measured on the basis of WHO’s 
2016 Standards for improving quality of maternal and 
newborn care in health facilities quality of care statement 
and process of care.17 The nine components of these 
standards are (1) health worker’s handwashing practice 
during childbirth, defined as health-care staff who 
cleaned their hands correctly as per WHO’s five moments 
for hand hygiene; (2) health worker’s use of gloves and 
gown to reduce infection transmission during childbirth; 
(3) preparation of equipment to be used during 
childbirth; (4) health worker greeting the mother at the 
time of admission; (5) women having a companion 
during labour; (6) intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring 
at 30 min intervals; (7) neonate’s cord clamped 1 min 
after birth; (8) neonatal skin-to-skin contact with mother 
after birth; and (9) breastfeeding within 1 h of birth.
For sociodemographic characteristics, ethnicity was 
recorded on the basis of the caste system in Nepal (ie, 
relatively disadvantaged ethnic groups [Janajati, Madeshi, 
Muslim, Dalit] and relatively advantaged ethnic groups 
[Brahmin and Chhetri-Hill, and Brahmin-Tarai]).18 We 
report women’s age as mean (SD) and categorised as 
18 years or younger, 19–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, 
and 35 years or older. Parity was defined as no previous 
births, at least one previous birth, or two or more previous 
births. Obstetric characteristic measurements included 
were complication at the time of admission, induced 
labour, and mode of birth, including spontaneous vaginal 
birth, assisted vaginal birth, and caesarean birth. For 
neonatal charac­teristics, we captured preterm birth 
(defined as <37 weeks of gestation on the basis of first day 
of mother’s last menstrual period), low birthweight 
(≤2500 g), and sex of the baby (boy, girl, or ambiguous).
Data analysis
We compared demographic, obstetric, and neonatal 
characteristics before and during lockdown using 
Pearson’s χ² test. We analysed the coverage of health 
worker’s performance before and during lockdown using 
Pearson’s χ² test.
To measure the weekly change in the number of births, 
we used a segmented time series model. We checked for 
autocorrelation using the autocorrelation factor for the 
outcome variable and found no significant autocorrelation.19
We used a generalised linear model with Poisson 
distribution and log-link function to calculate the risk of 
preterm birth, institutional stillbirth, and institutional 
neonatal mortality before and during lockdown. We 
adjusted for ethnicity, maternal age, and obstetric charac­
teristics to calculate the risk of preterm birth, institutional 
stillbirth, and institutional neonatal mortality. We 
assessed the between-hospital heterogeneity on preterm 
birth, institutional stillbirth, and institutional neonatal 
mortality. We compared the weekly trend in the number

of insti­tutional births between January and May, 2019, 
and between January and May, 2020, to assess the 
difference between the two different time periods. To 
assess trends in outcome variables and health worker 
performance before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, 
we used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression 
analysis.
We imputed missing values for gestational age using 
the Classification and Regression Tree method in the 
mice package in R. We did all data analyses using R 
(version 3.6.2).

Results
During the study period, 24 167 women were admitted 
into the hospitals for delivery and 22 907 were eligible 
for enrolment, of whom 21 763 enrolled and 20 354 gave 
birth in the hospitals during the study period, 
with 13 189 (64·8%) before the COVID-19 lockdown and 
7165 (35·2%) during the COVID-19 lockdown (appendix 3 
p 12). 10 453 vaginal births were observed over the 
study period, with 8228 (78·7%) before lockdown and 
2225 (21·3%) during lockdown.
In comparison with the weekly number of institutional 
births between January and May, 2019, a substantial 
decrease was seen between January and May, 2020, 
especially after week 12·5 when the COVID-19 lockdown 
was announced (figure 1). In 2020, we observed a 
decreasing trend in the weekly number of institutional 
births since the start of the study period, before lockdown 
started, which continued to decrease sharply after the 
lockdown was announced. The average weekly reduction 
in institutional births during lockdown was 7·4%, with a 
total decrease of 52·4% by the end of lockdown (figure 1; 
appendix 3 p 4). Before lockdown, the mean weekly 
number of institutional births was 1261·1 births (SE 66·1). 
The average number of weekly institutional births 
decreased by 197·7 (SE 92·3) to 651·4 (49·9) during 
lockdown (appendix 3 p 5).
We observed an increase in the use of childbirth 
services by women of the relatively advantageous ethnic 
group Brahmain and Chhetri-Hill during lockdown 
(2429 [33·9%] of 7165 births) compared with before 
lockdown (4055 [30·7%] of 13 189 births; p<0·0001; 
appendix 3 p 6). Decrease in attendance was seen 
among the more disadvantaged ethnic group Madhesi 
during lockdown (1228 [17·1%]) compared with before 
lockdown (2840 [21·5%]; p=0·0015). The mean age of 
women giving birth across study sites before lockdown 
was 24·1 years (SD 4·4), which increased to 24·3 years 
(4·5) during lockdown. The proportion of women who 
had a complication during admission increased from 
6·7% (n=884) before lockdown to 8·7% (n=587) during 
lockdown (p=0·0126). The proportion of women whose 
labour was induced increased from 17·1% (n=2258) 
before lockdown to 32·1% (n=2282) during lockdown 
(p<0·0001). The proportion of women who had 
caesarean section increased from 24·5% (n=3234) 
before lockdown to 26·2% (n=1879) during lockdown 
(p=0·0075). The proportion of babies born preterm 
(before 37 weeks) increased (16·7% [n=2125] before 
lockdown

p=0·0016) and the proportion that were of low 
birthweight did not increase (11·1% [n=1429] vs 10·5% 
[773]; p=0·37; appendix 3 p 6).
Across the study period we recorded 3467 preterm 
births, 332 institutional still­births (179 before lockdown, 
153 during lockdown), and 43 institutional neonatal 
deaths (18 before lockdown, 25 during lockdown; 
appendix 3 p 6). The risk ratio of preterm birth for during 
lockdown versus before lock­down was 1·30 (95% CI 
1·20–1·40), after adjusting for ethnicity, maternal age, 
and complication during admission (table 1). The 
institutional stillbirth rate increased from 14 per 1000 total 
births before lockdown to 21 per 1000 total births during 
lockdown. The adjusted risk ratio of institutional stillbirth 
rate during the lockdown versus before lockdown was 
1·46 (95% CI 1·13–1·89). The insti­tutional neonatal 
mortality rate increased from 13 deaths per 1000 livebirths 
before lockdown to 40 deaths per 1000 livebirths during 
the lockdown. The adjusted risk ratio of neonatal mortality 
during the lockdown versus before lockdown was 3·15 
(95% CI 1·47–6·74). We found little between-hospital 
heterogeneity (appendix 3 p 10).
Trend analyses of the stillbirth rate show a sharp 
increase immediately at the start of lockdown from 
8 stillbirths per 1000 total births in week 1 of lockdown 
(week 12 of the study period) to 33 per 1000 total births in 
week 4 of lockdown and then some variability between 
18 per 1000 births in week 6 of lockdown to 20 per 
1000 births on week 9·5 (appendix 3 p 14).
Compared with before lockdown, during lockdown 
health workers’ hand hygiene practices during childbirth 
increased by 12·9% (95% CI 11·8 to 13·9; table 2), health 
workers greeting the mother decreased by 2·2% 
(–3·1 to –1·3), the use of gloves and gown for childbirth 
decreased by 2·4% (–3·1 to –1·9), companion­ship during 
labour decreased by 6·0% (–6·9 to –5·1), intrapartum fetal 
heart rate monitoring decreased by 13·4% (–15·4 to –11·3), 
placing the baby skin-to-skin with the mother increased by 
13·2% (12·1 to 14·5), and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth 
decreased by 3·5% (–4·6 to –2·6). Changes among the 
other standards were not significant (table 2).
Analysis of trends in health worker practices on 
infection prevention during childbirth showed that the 
use of gloves and gown and preparation of equipment for 
use during childbirth decreased between week 2 and 
week 4 of lock­down (appendix 3 pp 16, 18). We saw a 
general increase in handwashing practices 3 weeks 
before lockdown, which continued to increase during 
lockdown (appendix 3 p 17). Our analysis of intrapartum 
care showed that occurrence of health workers greeting 
mothers decreased 2 weeks before the start of lockdown 
until week 3 of lockdown (ie, week 14 of the study period), 
and then gradually increased thereafter (figure 2).

2 weeks before the start of lockdown (study week 10) and 
continued to decrease slightly during the lockdown 
period (figure 2). The analysis of trends in health workers’ 
performance on intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring 
shows a decrease from 3 weeks before the lockdown, 
which continued until week 2 of lockdown. From week 3 
of lockdown, intra­partum fetal heart rate monitoring 
increased until the end of the study period (figure 2). 
Analysis of the immediate newborn care practice of cord 
clamping 1 min after birth increased slightly from the 
beginning of the study period to the beginning of 
lockdown, after which point a decrease was seen until the 
end of the study period (figure 3). Analysis of immediate 
newborn care practice of babies receiving skin-to-skin 
contact showed an increase from 3% from week 1 of the 
study period to 30% at the end of the study period 
(figure 3). Immediately after the start of lockdown, a 
decrease was seen in the skin-to-skin contact care to 20% 
and with fluctuation across the rest of the study period 
(figure 3). Breastfeeding within 1 h of birth started to 
decrease 4 weeks before lockdown and continued 
to decrease after the start of lockdown. After week 4 of 
lockdown, the practice of breastfeeding within 1 h of 
birth gradually increased until the end of the study period 
(figure 3; appendix 3 p 8).
Discussion
During the COVID-19 lockdown period in Nepal, 
institutional births in study hospitals reduced by 
approximately half compared with the beginning of the 
study period. The adjusted risk ratio for preterm birth was 
1·30, for institutional stillbirth was 1·46, and for 
institutional neonatal mortality was 3·15 during the 
lockdown period compared with before lockdown. A 
decrease was seen in the coverage of intrapartum fetal 
heart rate monitoring during labour and in breastfeeding 
within 1 h of birth, but some improvements were seen 
in some immediate newborn care practices, such as 
skin-to-skin contact, and hand hygiene practice. Decreasing 
rates of companionship during labour might be due to 
hospital-level restrictions on visitors and patient support.
The decrease in use of health facilities started in the 
weeks before lockdown, possibly indicating a heightened 
fear of disease transmission, which might have stopped 
women from seeking care at health facilities. During 
lockdown in Nepal, the rate of decrease in the use of 
health facilities was heightened because the national 
lockdown halted public transport and restricted move­
ment of people, similar to in other countries.11 Similar 
reductions in institutional births of 33% were reported 
during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Liberia.20 In 
Sierra Leone, fear of Ebola virus disease and mistrust in 
health-care workers were reported as factors that stopped 
women from accessing care from health facilities.21 We 
found a relative decrease in the use of services compared 
with before lockdown among relatively disadvantaged 
ethnic groups high­lighting already known disparities in 
Nepal.22 Our findings indicate the need to continue 
communication with policy makers and programme 
coordinators to address such inequalities and coverage 
gaps so that additional deaths can be averted.9
The increased proportion of admitted women having 
complications during admission, including preterm birth, 
during the COVID-19 lockdown period, might suggest 
that women at high risk of complications are dispro­
portionately attending health facilities or that the number 
of complicated cases has increased due to delays and other 
challenges of the lockdown. Using the three delays of 
care model,23 the lockdown travel restrictions might have 
resulted in delays in patients reaching health facilities or 
delays in providing quality of care for those at the facility 
due to a shortage of skilled health-care workers, resulting 
in adverse outcomes among mothers and neonates. The 
increase in preterm birth could also be associated with the 
distress of COVID-19-related social restrictions, con­
sidering psycho­social stress during pregnancy.24

The decrease in coverage of preparation of equipment 
for childbirth and immediate newborn care 2 weeks 
before lockdown and until week 4 of lockdown could 
indicate the scarcity of protective equipment for 
infection prevention. This hypothesis also corroborates 
the reports of shortages in protection equipment in 
health facilities in Nepal.25 3 weeks before lockdown, 
intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring reduced

substantially, which might have been because health 
workers restricted their contact with women due to a 
scarcity of protective equipment. The inadequate use 
of gloves and equipment for managing childbirth in 
these health facilities indicates the poor readiness of 
the health facilities for maternal and neonatal care. 
The improvements observed in hand hygiene practices 
during childbirth reflect hospital COVID-19 inter­
ventions to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 
among health-care providers.16,26
We also observed that companionship during labour 
began to decrease 3 weeks before the lockdown and 
continued to drop during the lockdown. Hospital protocols 
restricted visitors and companions to women during 
labour to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of 
SARS-CoV-2.27 However, WHO recommends companion­
ship during labour and childbirth for an improved 
childbirth experience during this pandemic.28
Improvements in immediate neonatal care practice, 
such as placing neonates skin-to-skin with mothers, 
shows the promotion of immediate newborn practices 
by health workers during the pandemic. This finding is 
contradictory to the speculations that implementation 
of immediate newborn care prac­tices might decrease 
due to a lack of pandemic preparedness. However, the 
reduction in breastfeeding within 1 h of birth 3 weeks 
before lockdown might reflect health workers’ initial 
misunder­standing of breast­feeding protocols during the 
COVID-19 pandemic,29 despite global recommendations 
of breastfeeding.30 The improvement in the health 
workers’ practice of intra­partum fetal heart rate 
monitoring and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth after a 
sudden decrease before and during the initial phase of 
lockdown, followed by a later increase, can be attributed 
to the ongoing quality improvement initiatives of the 
SUSTAIN and REFINE studies in these hospitals.16
Our study has several limitations. We did not explore 
the prevalence or the direct impact of COVID-19 on 
health outcomes. None of the women admitted to the 
hospital were tested for COVID-19, so we do not know 
the prevalence of COVID-19 among the study population. 
Other limitations include that observations of health 
worker practice were only done for vaginal births, not 
caesarean births, which introduces the potential for 
selection bias. Additionally, some observer reporting bias 
might have been present, especially because the workload 
in labour and delivery rooms is generally high, which 
could be a challenging environment for the observation 
of health worker performance by an independent 
researcher. Finally, here we report service use for 
nine hospitals, and so our findings should not be 
interpreted as a population-level reduction in institutional 
births. Our study also has several strengths including a 
large sample size before and during the COVID-19 
lockdown period, with data systems in multiple hospitals 
established through existing studies. Prospective data 
collection using trained researchers to collect information 
using observation checklists strengthened our confidence 
in these findings. This study focused on understanding 
the indirect impact of COVID-19 on disruption in health 
service delivery for facility-based maternal and neonatal 
health. To our knowledge, this study provides one of the 
first and largest documentations of service reduction 
during COVID-19 and underlines the urgent need to 
protect care for women and their babies.
In summary, during the COVID-19 pandemic, women 
and their babies (both in utero and neonates) are 
susceptible and at risk due to gaps in care that can result 
in adverse birth outcomes including mortality. The 
decrease in the number of institutional births and 
increase in adverse outcomes are especially concerning 
because of Nepal’s fragile health system and raise 
questions on policies regarding strict lockdowns in low-
income and middle-income countries.13 Pandemic 
lockdowns threaten lives and jeopardise progress that 
has been made in the past two decades in Nepal, 
potentially derailing on-track efforts to achieve the 
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, especially for 
maternal and neonatal survival, and efforts to build 
stronger health systems after the pandemic.
