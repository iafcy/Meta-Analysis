Summary
At the onset of the global pandemic of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), guidelines recommended using regional
anaesthesia for caesarean section in preference to general anaesthesia. National ﬁgures from the UK suggest that
8.75% of over 170,000 caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic. We explored whether general
anaesthesia rates for caesarean section changed during the peak of the pandemic across six maternity units in the
north-west of England. We analysed anaesthetic information for 2480 caesarean sections across six maternity units
from 1 April to 1 July 2020 (during the pandemic) and compared this information with data from 2555 caesarean
sections performed at the same hospitals over a similar period in 2019. Primary outcome was change in general
anaesthesia rate for caesarean section. Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean section rates, obstetric
indications for caesarean section and regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates. A signiﬁcant reduction (7.7
to 3.7%, p < 0.0001) in general anaesthetic rates, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39–0.93), was noted across hospitals
during the pandemic. Regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates reduced (1.7 to 0.8%, p = 0.012), risk ratio
(95%CI) 0.50 (0.29–0.86). Obstetric indications for caesarean sections did not change (p = 0.17) while the overall
caesarean section rate increased (28.3 to 29.7%), risk ratio (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00–1.04), p = 0.052. Our analysis shows
that general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section declined during the peak of the pandemic. Anaesthetic
decision-making, recommendations from anaesthetic guidelines and presence of an on-site anaesthetic consultant
in the delivery suite seem to be the key factors that inﬂuenced this decline.

Introduction
The National Maternity and Perinatal Audit [1] recently
reported that over 700,000 births took place in the UK
National Health Service (NHS) across England, Wales and
Scotland during 2016–2017. In that dataset, around one in
four women delivered by caesarean section. Regional
anaesthesia, including spinal, epidural or combined spinal-
epidural was reported to be the most used anaesthetic
technique for caesarean sections in the UK. A descriptive
analysis of the National Obstetric Anaesthesia Database in
the UK from 2009 to 2014 suggested that 91% of all
caesarean sections in the UK were performed under
regional anaesthesia [2].
The World Health Organization declared the global
pandemic of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in March 2020 [3].
Since then, multiple guidelines, societies and case reviews
have encouraged use of regional anaesthesia over general
anaesthesia for surgery, including caesarean sections [4–7].
Cited advantages of regional anaesthesia, speciﬁcally in
relation to the pandemic, include: decreased risk of an
aerosol-generating procedure and its associated risks to
healthcare staff; reduced use of speciﬁc personal protective
equipment (PPE) such as ﬁltering facepiece masks; and
improving theatre turnover by avoiding the need to wait for
a speciﬁc number of air changes [8]. More data about
obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women
affected by COVID-19 have been reported across the globe
[9–10].
Limited information is available on the impact that
national and international anaesthesia guidelines have had
on general and regional anaesthesia rates for caesarean
section during the pandemic; we could only ﬁnd one single-
centre study reporting a reduction in general anaesthesia
rates [11]. We performed a retrospective analysis to
investigate if there was a change in the general anaesthesia
rate for caesarean sections across six maternity units in the
north-west of England during the peak of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Methods
Anaesthetic information for caesarean sections performed
in six hospitals across the north-west of England between 1
April and 1 July 2020 (peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in
the UK) was retrieved from hospital electronic records. We
compared this information with data from caesarean
sections performed at the same hospitals during a similar
period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Tertiary delivery units, St
Mary’s Hospital and Manchester and Liverpool Women’s
Hospital (with over 8000 deliveries annually) as well as
district general hospitals Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh
Hospital, Burnley (East Lancashire Hospitals), Preston (Royal
Preston Hospital) and Oldham (Royal Oldham Hospital)
were included in our analysis to reﬂect a reasonable mix of
hospitals
with
varying
delivery
rates.
We
speciﬁcally
planned to determine the general anaesthesia rate for
different categories of caesarean sections (as proposed by
the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [12]).
Ethical approval was not deemed necessary by the clinical
governance department of the respective hospitals, as the
review was classed as an audit as per Royal College of
Anaesthetists (RCoA) standards. Appropriate approval was
obtained from local clinical governance departments at
each
participating
hospital.
The
best
practice
RCoA
standards suggest that > 95% of category 4 caesarean
sections, > 85% of category 2–3 and > 50% of category 1
caesarean sections should receive regional anaesthesia.
Regional
to
general
anaesthesia
conversion
should
be < 1% for category 4, < 5% for category 2–3 and < 15%
for category 1 caesarean sections [13].
Information
obtained
included:
total
number
of
deliveries; total number of caesarean sections performed
along with various categories of caesarean sections;
cumulative general and regional anaesthesia utilisation rate
for various categories of caesarean sections, along with
conversion rate from regional to general anaesthesia. We
did not seek to obtain speciﬁc details of types of regional
anaesthesia utilised for caesarean sections, as our emphasis
was mainly to assess the impact on general anaesthesia rate
for caesarean sections.
Information speciﬁc to the pandemic period included:
total number of women who tested positive for COVID-19;
number of COVID-19 women who had a caesarean section;
and the type of anaesthesia that was provided to facilitate
the caesarean section. We also asked the consultants
collecting
the
data
whether
an
on-site
anaesthetic
consultant was available out of hours (20:00-08:00) during
weekdays or weekends for the duration of the study.
The
primary
outcome
was
the
rate
of
general
anaesthesia for caesarean section during the COVID-19
pandemic as compared with the pre-pandemic rate.
Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean sections
rates; obstetric indications for caesarean sections based on
categories of urgency; and regional to general anaesthesia
conversion rates for caesarean section.
Rates and effect sizes were estimated from the data as
stratiﬁed by hospital to get pooled estimates with 95%CI.
Mantel-Haenszel chi-square analysis was used to estimate
the pooled risk ratio (RR) (95%CI) stratiﬁed by hospital.
Logistic regression was used to assess differences in rates in

hospitals and to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) with
95%CI. Fisher expanded exact p value was used to compare
distributions in categories. Sample size calculations were
based on the pre-COVID general anaesthesia rate of
caesarean
sections
reported
at
St
Mary’s
Hospital,
Manchester which was 7.5% [11]. It was estimated that at
least 1900 women undergoing caesarean section would be
required in each of the two periods to ﬁnd a RR of 0.70 or
lower using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square as signiﬁcant at
p < 0.05 (two-sided) with at least 80% power. Analyses were
performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp Inc., College Station,
TX, USA) and p < 0.05 (two-sided) was used to deﬁne
statistical signiﬁcance.
Results
Across the six hospitals there were 9043 and 8381 maternal
deliveries in the pre COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods,
respectively. During these periods, there were 2555 (28.3%)
and 2490 (29.7%) caesarean sections, respectively. Data on
the number of deliveries and caesarean sections are
available in online Supporting Information Tables S1 and
S2).
Regarding
the
primary
outcome,
the
COVID-19
pandemic resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in general
anaesthesia rates for caesarean section (7.7 to 3.7%,
p < 0.0001), RR (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39–0.93) (Table 1).
Secondary outcomes included the caesarean section
rate in total maternal deliveries. There was a small rise in the
caesarean section rate during the pandemic (28.3 to 29.7%,
p = 0.052), RR (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00–1.04) (Table 2).
The regional to general anaesthesia conversion rate for
caesarean sections was reduced during the pandemic (1.7
to 0.8%, p = 0.012), RR (95%CI) 0.50 (0.29–0.86) (Table 3).
Obstetric indications as categories for caesarean section
did not signiﬁcantly change during the pandemic (p = 0.17)
(Table 4).
Again,
signiﬁcant
reductions
in
general
anaesthesia rates were seen across all categories.
Four
of
the
six
hospitals
surveyed
(Manchester,
Oldham, Burnley, Liverpool) had an extra on-site consultant
available out of hours on weekdays and this increased to ﬁve

(with the addition of Preston) on weekends during the
pandemic. All the hospitals except Liverpool (for regional to
general anaesthesia conversion for category 1 caesarean
section) met all the RCoA suggested standards pre-COVID-
19. Post COVID-19, all the hospitals met all the RCoA
standards. Pooled analysis of regional anaesthesia rates and
regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates for all
hospitals show that that all the RCoA standards were met,
with regional anaesthesia rates increasing for all caesarean
sections
categories
while
the
regional
to
general
anaesthesia conversion rates were lower, especially for
category 1 caesarean sections during the COVID-19
pandemic (p = 0.027) (Tables 5 and 6).
During the pandemic period, of the 76 women who
tested positive for COVID-19, 27 underwent caesarean
section with only one (3.7%) having a general anaesthetic,
which is similar to the overall general anaesthesia rate for all
caesarean sections (p = 0.97).

Discussion
This study has shown a reduction in general anaesthesia
rates for caesarean section (from 7.7% to 3.7%) in the north-
west of England during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
comparison, a mean general anaesthesia rate of 8.75% was
reported in the National Obstetric Anaesthesia Database
analysis of over three million births and 770,000 caesarean
sections during the period 2009–2014 [2]. Our data from a
small number of hospitals highlight the fact that the general
anaesthesia rate dropped to 3.7% during the peak of the
pandemic in these hospitals, with regional anaesthesia
utilisation rate for caesarean sections increasing to over
96%.
St Mary’s Hospital had the highest reported delivery
rate across all the hospitals both pre- and post-COVID-19,
contributing almost 25% of all deliveries. It had previously
reported a drop in general anaesthesia rates from 7.5% to
3.3% during the pandemic [11]. As a sensitivity analysis, we
removed the hospital with the largest denominator (St
Mary’s Hospital) and re-analysed using Mantel-Haenszel chi-
square to check the effect of COVID-19 on the reduction in
general anaesthesia rate for caesarean sections. This still
conﬁrmed the reduction (6.9% to 3.8%, p = 0.0001) in the
remaining hospitals, RR (95%CI) 0.58 (0.44–0.77). The larger
national caesarean section rate of 8.75% increases the
effective power to > 95%. Thus, the ﬁndings of a decline in
general anaesthesia rates are valid and replicated in all the
other ﬁve hospitals.
Multiple reasons could be attributed to the fall in
general anaesthesia rates. The advantages of regional
anaesthesia for women undergoing a caesarean section are
well known to anaesthetists. Superior peri-operative pain
relief; allowing partners in theatre during the caesarean
sections; earlier skin to skin contact with the neonate;
mitigation of difﬁcult intubation risks, aspiration and
awareness; decreased blood loss; decreased transfusion;
decreased thromboembolism risk; reduced hospital stay;
and decrease in the rate of respiratory tract and surgical site
infections, have been well established in literature reviews
of anaesthesia for caesarean section [14–16]. In low- and
middle-income countries, use of regional anaesthesia has
also been shown to decrease maternal morbidity, maternal
mortality, maternal critical care admissions and neonatal
mortality [17].
More relevant is the awareness amongst anaesthetists
that
tracheal
intubation
for
caesarean
section
(and
associated
manoeuvres)
is
an
aerosol-generating
procedure that poses one of the highest risks of viral
transmission from a suspected or a conﬁrmed case. This has
been highlighted in reviews during previous severe acute
respiratory
syndrome
(SARS)
and
Middle
Eastern
respiratory syndrome outbreaks [18]. General anaesthesia
not only puts anaesthetic staff at risk, but other healthcare
workers as well. During the SARS outbreak, 21% of infected
individuals globally were healthcare workers. Routine
maternal testing for COVID-19 was not initially available
across
all
maternity
units
in
the
UK.
Anaesthetic
recommendations published globally during the pandemic
further strengthened the advice to prefer regional over
general anaesthesia, so it is not surprising that anaesthetists
were keen to avoid general anaesthesia in any parturient
unless regarded as essential. Our analysis further highlights
that general anaesthesia was still used in 12% of our
category-1 caesarean sections across all hospitals during
the pandemic. Thus, anaesthetists were not hesitant to
provide general anaesthesia when necessary (e.g. during
fetal distress).
Anaesthetic stafﬁng changed during the pandemic.
On-site
out-of-hours
anaesthetic
consultant
support
systems were established in 80% of the hospitals we
analysed. Obstetric data collected from the accidental
awareness during general anaesthesia National Audit
Project (NAP5) suggested that many out-of-hours category-
1 and 2 caesarean sections were being performed by
trainees, with distant supervision possibly contributing to a
high general anaesthesia rate [19]. During the pandemic,

Anaesthesia 2020

most of the maternity units we studied beneﬁtted from the
presence of more experienced and skilled personnel in the
delivery suite, leading to improved on-site immediate and
local supervision. This possibly contributed to the high
regional anaesthesia rates and lower regional to general
anaesthesia conversion rates compared with the pre-COVID
group.
Obstetric decision-making, as highlighted by various
categories of caesarean sections (both pre-COVID-19 and
during COVID-19) in our study did not differ during the
pandemic. We therefore assume that anaesthetic decision-
making was the main factor in increased utilisation of
regional
anaesthesia
rates
and
a
drop
in
general
anaesthesia
rates
during
COVID-19
period.
Personal
protective equipment recommendations were different for
women needing regional anaesthesia and at low risk of a
conversion to a general anaesthesia (droplet precautions)
compared with those having general anaesthesia from the
commencement of caesarean section or those at high risk of
conversion (airborne precautions). Donning of PPE for
general anaesthesia takes time, which could theoretically
result in adverse fetal outcomes in urgent/emergency
caesarean sections. It is possible that this factor may have
contributed to decision-making by anaesthetists.
The caesarean section rate did increase during the
pandemic. The unadjusted total caesarean section rate both
pre-COVID-19 and during the pandemic was just under
30%, highlighting that it is higher than the suggested
national ﬁgure of 25%, at least in some of the hospitals in the
north-west of England. The data possibly reﬂect an inter-
hospital and geographical variation, as previous reviews
suggest that some unadjusted caesarean section rates
across the hospitals and various regions of England vary
from 14% to 32% [20]. Similar variations have been noted in
cross-sectional studies conducted in the USA and Ireland
[21, 22]. We acknowledge that our data are from a limited
cohort of hospitals in England and we would not want to
draw any conclusions from this ﬁnding.
Regional to general anaesthesia conversion decreased
from 1.7% to 0.8% during the COVID-19 study period and is
a signiﬁcant factor in the reduction of general anaesthesia
rates. The biggest reduction was seen in category-1
caesarean sections across most of the hospitals. We
postulate this to be due to on-site consultant presence,
adoption of speciﬁc strategies in hospitals following the
recommendations
by
various
societies
and
speciﬁc
decision-making with regard to the utilisation of speciﬁc
regional anaesthesia techniques for caesarean sections. A
signiﬁcant number of general anaesthesia conversions may
be potentially avoidable (though not always), and this
cohort is at higher risk of anaesthesia-related complications
[23]. So, it is in the best interests of the woman and the
peripartum team to achieve a safe reduction in these
conversions. Most of the hospitals met the RCoA standards
and current best practice guidelines for caesarean sections.
Our study presents some interesting ﬁndings on
women who tested positive for COVID-19. Seventy-six
women tested positive in our study and the caesarean
section rate for COVID-19 positive women was 35.5%. This
is much lower than the 48% reported in a systematic review
on COVID-19 pregnancies by Khalil et al. [9], whereas
Knight et al. [24] reported a caesarean section rate of almost
60% and a general anaesthesia rate of 19% in their
preliminary analysis of COVID-19 pregnant women. The
overall general anaesthesia rate for the COVID-19 positive
women is the same as the general anaesthesia rate for all
caesarean sections during the pandemic (< 4%). We would
not want to draw any speciﬁc conclusions as we do not have
the details for these women. We do not know the number of
women who were swabbed for COVID-19 and cannot
therefore estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in these
hospitals. We would like to highlight the fact that our dataset
has one of the lowest caesarean section rates reported for
COVID-19 positive pregnant women.
One strength of our study is that it is adequately
powered and thus provides valuable evidence that general
anaesthesia
rates
for
caesarean
section
decreased
signiﬁcantly in the north-west of England during the
pandemic. It highlights the factors contributing to this
ﬁnding and the impact of national and international
recommendations
on
hospitals
in
the
north-west
of
England. It also reﬂects that on-site consultant anaesthetic
cover increased out-of-hours during the pandemic and that
regional anaesthesia utilisation rates across a mix of
hospitals were much higher than previous nationally
reported
rates.
Whether
this
change
was
replicated
nationally needs further investigation. Our data afﬁrm that a
‘safe’
reduction
of
general
anaesthesia
rates
across
hospitals is possible, is in the interest of the mothers, is
advantageous to healthcare workers and has institutional
beneﬁts with regard to resource utilisation (of PPE). The data
from this study also provide food for thought regarding
variations in caesarean section rates for COVID-19 women
and whether the caesarean section rate is on the rise,
though both these ﬁndings need further investigation.
Whether the decline in general anaesthesia rates can be
sustained or whether this is a ‘one-off’ phenomenon,
possibly contributed to by on-site anaesthetic consultant
presence during the pandemic, is also an area that requires
further research.

Our study is not without limitations. It is retrospective,
observational and reﬂects the data within a small number of
hospitals in the north-west of England. No detailed
information
of
the
breakdown
of
speciﬁc
regional
anaesthesia
techniques
such
as
number
of
spinals,
epidurals
as
well
as
combined
spinal-epidurals
are
provided, nor are the conversion details of which regional
techniques (epidural top-ups or spinals) had a higher failure
rate.
No
details
of
maternal
baseline
characteristics,
maternal morbidity or mortality, obstetric or neonatal
outcomes were provided and perhaps these details would
reﬂect whether the decreased use of general anaesthesia
was indeed beneﬁcial.
Overall, we conclude that the general anaesthesia rate
for caesarean sections declined signiﬁcantly during the
peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anaesthetic decision-
making recommendations from anaesthetic guidelines and
presence of an on-site anaesthetic consultant in the delivery
suite seemed to be the key factors that potentially
inﬂuenced this decline.
