BACKGROUND: Widespread lockdowns imposed during the corona-
virus disease 2019 crisis may impact birth outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the
COVID-19 lockdown and the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Botswana.
STUDY DESIGN: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis,
Botswana enforced a lockdown that restricted movement within the
country. We used data from an ongoing nationwide birth outcomes sur-
veillance study to evaluate adverse outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth,
small-for-gestational-age fetuses, and neonatal death) and severe
adverse
outcomes
(stillbirth,
very
preterm
birth,
very-small-for-
gestational-age fetuses, and neonatal death) recorded prelockdown
(January 1, 2020eApril 2, 2020), during lockdown (April 3, 2020eMay 7,
2020), and postlockdown (May 8, 2020eJuly 20, 2020). Using
difference-in-differences analyses, we compared the net change in each
outcome from the prelockdown to lockdown periods in 2020 relative to the
same 2 periods in 2017e2019 with the net change in each outcome from
the prelockdown to postlockdown periods in 2020 relative to the same 2
periods in 2017e2019.
RESULTS: In this study, 68,448 women delivered a singleton infant in
2017e2020 between January 1 and July 20 and were included in our
analysis (mean [interquartile range] age of mothers, 26 [22e32] years).
Across the included calendar years and periods, the risk of any adverse
outcome ranged from 27.92% to 31.70%, and the risk of any severe
adverse outcome ranged from 8.40% to 11.38%. The lockdown period
was associated with a 0.81 percentage point reduction (95% conﬁdence
interval, 2.95% to 1.30%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (3%
relative reduction) and a 0.02 percentage point reduction (95% conﬁdence
interval, 0.79% to 0.75%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (0%
relative reduction). The postlockdown period was associated with a 1.72
percentage point reduction (95% conﬁdence, 3.42% to 0.02%) in the
risk of any adverse outcome (5% relative reduction) and a 1.62 percentage
point reduction (95% conﬁdence interval, 2.69% to 0.55%) in the risk
of any severe adverse outcome (14% relative reduction). Reductions in
adverse outcomes were largest among women with human immunode-
ﬁciency virus and among women delivering at urban delivery sites, driven
primarily by reductions in preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age
fetuses.
CONCLUSION: Adverse birth outcomes decreased from the prelock-
down to postlockdown periods in 2020, relative to the change during the
same periods in 2017e2019. Our ﬁndings may provide insights into
associations between mobility and birth outcomes in Botswana and other
low- and middle-income countries.

Introduction
Widespread lockdowns imposed during
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) crisis may have affected birth out-
comes worldwide, but the magnitude
and direction of these effects remain
uncertain. A hospital in Ireland re-
ported a 73% decrease in the incidence
of very low birthweight infants from
January 2020 to April 2020 compared
with the same period in the previous 2
decades,1 a study in Denmark found a
90%
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
extremely preterm birth during the
lockdown period from March 12 to
April 14 compared with the same period
during the previous 5 years,2 and a
study in the Netherlands found re-
ductions in the incidence of preterm
birth across various time windows sur-
rounding
the
implementation
of
COVID-19 mitigation measures (eg, an
odds ratio of 0.77 comparing 2 months
after and 2 months before March 9).3 In
the United States, 1 hospital in Nashville
estimated that there were 20% fewer
infants in the neonatal intensive care
unit in March than during that month
in previous years.4 However, many
hospitals around the world reported no
difference in preterm births during the
lockdown,4 and there is concern that
lockdown restrictions could also lead to
increases in more severe outcomes, such
as stillbirth and neonatal death. A study
using data from a London hospital
found a higher incidence of stillbirth
during the COVID-19 pandemic than
the period
immediately before the
pandemic, but there was no difference
in preterm birth.5 A study in 9 hospitals
across Nepal found a higher incidence
of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and
preterm birth during the 9.5-week
lockdown than in the 12.5 weeks
before the lockdown.6 Finally, a study
using data from 4 hospitals in western
India found a higher incidence of still-
birth during the 10 weeks following the
lockdown than in the 10 weeks before
the lockdown.7 The mechanisms un-
derlying all of these reported ﬁndings
are speculative and in most cases need
to be considered in the context of the
additional unknown effect of severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection itself.8
To date, there has been no study on
the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns
on adverse pregnancy outcomes in Sub-
Saharan Africa, a region with one of
the greatest burdens of adverse preg-
nancy outcomes and risk factors that are
often distinct from those in high-income
countries. Despite having only 3 re-
ported SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time,9
Botswana announced a state of emer-
gency because of COVID-19 on March
31, 2020,10 and a nationwide lockdown
started
at
midnight
on
April
2,
2020.11e13
After
the
initial
28-day
period, the lockdown was extended un-
til May 7, 2020.14 Movement restrictions
were gradually lifted between May 8,
2020, and May 22, 2020.15e19 Although
SARS-CoV-2 swept through South Af-
rica, infecting 364,328 people as of July
20, 2020,20 COVID-19 largely spared
Botswana during the early phase of the
pandemic; through July 20, 2020, there
were 522 cases of SARS-CoV-2, and
there was no conﬁrmed case in preg-
nancy.20 This provides a unique oppor-
tunity to isolate the impact of the
lockdown from any direct impact of
SARS-CoV-2.
The Tsepamo study has been con-
ducting birth outcomes surveillance at
delivery hospitals throughout Botswana
since August 2014 and includes data
from more than 119,000 births. In this
analysis, we used Tsepamo data to esti-
mate the risk of adverse birth outcomes
before (January 1, 2020eApril 2, 2020),
during (April 3, 2020eMay 7, 2020), and
after (May 8, 2020eJuly 20, 2020) the
COVID-19
national
lockdown
and
compared these risks with the same 3
periods in 2017e2019. We also exam-
ined whether the impact of the lock-
down varied by HIV status, by urban or
rural delivery hospital, and by other de-
mographic factors.
Materials and Methods
The Tsepamo study
The Tsepamo study is a birth outcomes
surveillance study in Botswana.21 Data
were abstracted from the maternity
obstetrical record (a record of antenatal
care) at the time of delivery from all
women delivering at selected hospitals
throughout the country. The Tsepamo
study included 8 sites (approximately
45% of all births in Botswana) from
August 2014 to July 2018 and 18 sites
(approximately
72%
of
all
births
nationwide) from July 2018 to July 2020.
The Tsepamo study captured data on
>99% of all births that occurred at the
included sites because almost all women
bring their antenatal medical records
(“maternity card”) to delivery.21,22 In
Botswana,
approximately
95%
of
women deliver at a hospital.23
Eligibility criteria and exposure
groups
Women who delivered a singleton baby
after at least 24 weeks’ gestation in
2017e2020 between January 1 and July
20 were included in our analysis (in
Botswana, pregnancies that end before
24
weeks’
gestation
are
considered
miscarriage and admitted to the general
medical wards). We deﬁned January 1,
2020 to April 2 as the period before the
lockdown (“prelockdown”), April 3,
2020 to May 7 as the period during the
lockdown (“lockdown”), and May 8,
2020 to July 20 as the period following
the lockdown (“postlockdown”). We
compared the lockdown year, 2020, with
the previous 3 years, 2017e2019.
Outcomes
Shelter-in-place adherence
We deﬁned the proportion of people
remaining in 1 location over a 24-hour
period as an indicator of shelter-in-
place adherence.
We
calculated
the
average number of Facebook users with
location services turned on that were
present in the same 600600-m grid
location over a 24-hour period. Presence
in the same location was deﬁned as
global positioning system pings in at
least 3 different time blocks of the
day.24e26 We created heatmaps to depict
the 24-hour staying-put percentage by
region of Botswana from February 28,
2020, to July 24, 2020.
Birth outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest were
the combined endpoints of any adverse
outcome
and
any
severe
adverse
outcome. Any adverse outcome was
composed of stillbirth, preterm birth,
small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses,
or neonatal death. Any severe adverse
was outcome composed of stillbirth,
very preterm birth, very SGA fetuses, or
neonatal death. Secondary endpoints
were the individual outcomes. Stillbirth
was deﬁned as fetal death at 24 weeks’
gestation (summed Apgar score of 0).
Preterm birth was deﬁned as a birth at
less than 37 weeks’ completed gestation
AJOG at a Glance
Why was this study conducted?
Widespread lockdowns imposed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) crisis may have affected birth outcomes worldwide.
Key ﬁndings
The postlockdown period in 2020 was associated with a 1.72 percentage point
reduction (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 3.42% to 0.02) in the risk of any
adverse outcome (stillbirth, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age [SGA] fe-
tuses, and neonatal death) and a 1.62 percentage point reduction (95% CI, 2.69
to 0.55) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (stillbirth, very preterm birth,
very SGA fetuses, and neonatal death). Reductions in adverse outcomes were
largest among women with human immunodeﬁciency virus and among women
delivering at urban sites, driven primarily by reductions in preterm birth and SGA
fetuses.
What does this add to what is known?
Our data provide an evaluation from Sub-Saharan Africa of the impact of a
COVID-19 lockdown on birth outcomes and suggest a modest reduction in
preterm birth and SGA fetuses following the lockdown period.

and very preterm was a birth at less than
32 weeks’ completed gestation. Tertiary
outcomes were birth at <34 weeks’
completed gestation27 and continuous
gestational age at delivery. Gestational
age was calculated at the time of delivery
by the midwife using the estimated date
of delivery determined during antenatal
care, typically using reported last men-
strual period. SGA fetuses were deﬁned
as fetuses less than the 10th percentile,
and very SGA fetuses were deﬁned as less
than the 3rd percentile of birthweight by
gestational age according to the Inter-
national Fetal and Newborn Growth
Consortium
for
the
21st
Century
norms.28,29 Neonatal deaths included
deaths within 28 days of birth among
infants who had never left the hospital.
Statistical analysis
We
used
a
difference-in-differences
analysis to assess the relationship be-
tween the lockdown and each outcome.
That is we compared the change in each
outcome
from
the
prelockdown
to
lockdown periods in 2020 (the ﬁrst dif-
ference)
with
the
change
in
each
outcome during the same 2 periods in
2017e2019 (the second difference). We
also compared the change in each
outcome
from
the
prelockdown
to
postlockdown periods in 2020 with the
change in each outcome during the same
2 periods in 2017e2019. We obtained
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) using a
linear probability model30 with robust
standard errors to account for clustering
within delivery sites.31,32 Relative risk
reductions were calculated using the
average baseline risk in the prelockdown
period from 2017 to 2020.
We conducted separate analyses for
the primary outcomes by maternal HIV
status, delivery location (urban, delivery
sites in Gaborone or Francistown; rural,
all other delivery sites), parity (ﬁrst child
vs 1 or more children), and occupation
(salaried vs nonsalaried). In post hoc
analyses,
we
examined
subgroups
deﬁned by multiple factors (eg, HIV
status and delivery location).
In sensitivity analyses, we adjusted our
estimates
for
individual-level
de-
mographic variables (HIV status, calen-
dar year of delivery, age, occupation,
education, parity, gravity, marital status,
delivery location, smoking status, and
use of alcohol), and extended the lock-
down period through May 21 to include
the 2-week period when restrictions
were gradually lifted.
Finally, we plotted the weekly risk of
the primary outcomes over a 28-week
period (January 3, 2020eJuly 16, 2020)
compared with the same period (January
2 to July 16) in 2017e2019.
Institutional approval for this study
was granted by the Health Research
and
Development
Committee
in
Botswana and by the institutional re-
view board of Harvard T. H. Chan
School of Public Health in Boston,
Massachusetts. Maternal consent was
waived because data were collected
anonymously and by means of medi-
cal record abstraction.
Results
Study population
A total of 68,448 women delivered a
singleton infant in 2017e2020 between
January 1 and July 20 and were included
in our analysis. Table 1 shows the num-
ber of births during the prelockdown,
lockdown, and postlockdown periods in
2020 and during the same calendar pe-
riods in 2017e2019. Comparing 2020
with the previous year, the number of
births was similar during the lockdown
period (3589 vs 3432) but slightly lower
during the postlockdown period (7162
vs 7413). Demographic characteristics
were similar across years and across pe-
riods, except the median number of
antenatal visits decreased from 10 across
all periods in 2017e2019 to 9 across all
periods in 2020 (Table 1). The median
maternal age was 26 years, 23% were
living with HIV, 38% delivered at an
urban delivery site, 62% had other chil-
dren, and 33% had a salaried occupa-
tion. Of the 15,767 women with HIV, the
proportion
who
self-reported
dis-
continuing antiretrovirals during preg-
nancy was less than 0.6% across all years
and did not differ in 2020, including
during the lockdown period (data not
shown). To our knowledge, no modiﬁ-
cation to antenatal care was put in place
during the lockdown period, and tele-
medicine was not routinely available. A
food insecurity mitigation strategy was
implemented in Botswana during the
lockdown, with food baskets provided
free of charge at locations throughout
the country.
Shelter-in-place adherence

to
40%
to
50%
when
the
nationwide lockdown was instituted on

following
the
phased
relaxation
of
extreme
social
distancing
measures
beginning on May 8, 2020, and was
consistent with prelockdown levels by
June 5, 2020. Changes in staying-put
percentage over time were consistent
across the country.
Birth outcomes
Table 2 shows the net change in the risk of
each outcome from the prelockdown to
lockdown periods in 2020 relative to the
same 2 periods in 2017e2019, and the net
change in the risk of each outcome from
the prelockdown to postlockdown pe-
riods in 2020 relative to the same 2 pe-
riods in 2017e2019. The lockdown
period was associated with a 0.81 per-
centage
point
reduction
(95%
CI, 2.95% to 1.30%) in the risk of any
adverse outcome (3% relative reduction)
and a 0.02 percentage point reduction
(95% CI, 0.79% to 0.75%) in the risk of
any severe adverse outcome (0% relative
reduction). The postlockdown period
was associated with a 1.72 percentage
point
reduction
(95%
CI,
3.42%
to 0.02%) in the risk of any adverse
outcome (5% relative reduction) and a
1.62 percentage point reduction (95%
CI, 2.69% to 0.55%) in the risk of any
severe adverse outcome (14% relative
reduction). The largest reduction associ-
ated with the lockdown period for an
individual outcome was for preterm birth
(1.52
percentage
points
[95%
CI, 3.14% to 0.10%] or 9% relative
reduction), whereas the largest reduction
associated with the postlockdown period
for an individual outcome was for SGA
fetuses (1.07 percentage points [95%
CI, 2.26% to 0.12%] or 7% relative

reduction). There was no difference in
neonatal death or stillbirth during the
lockdown
or
postlockdown
periods.
Findings were similar when evaluating
birth at less than 34 weeks’ completed
gestation and continuous gestational age
at delivery (Supplemental Table).
The reduction in both primary out-
comes during the lockdown period was
larger among women with HIV and
among women with salaried employment
(Table 3). The reduction in both primary
outcomes
during
the
postlockdown
period was larger among women with
HIV, women delivering at urban delivery
sites, and women who already had chil-
dren. The largest reductions were observed
during the postlockdown period among
women with HIV (3.86 percentage
points [95% CI, 6.32% to 1.39%] or
10% relative reduction for any adverse
outcome and 2.26 percentage points
[95% CI, 4.14% to 0.38%] or 16%
relative reduction for any severe adverse
outcome) and among women delivering at
urban delivery sites (3.37 percentage
points [95% CI, 6.30% to 0.44%] or
10% relative reduction for any adverse
outcome and 2.93 percentage points
[95% CI, 5.01% to 0.85%] or 21%
relative reduction for any severe adverse
outcome). In a post hoc analysis, we
calculated that for a woman with HIV
delivering at an urban delivery site (9.3%
of study population), there was a 6.31
percentage
point
reduction
(95%
CI, 14.21% to 1.59%) in the risk of
having any adverse outcome (16% relative
reduction) and a 2.17 percentage point
reduction (95% CI, 7.88% to 3.55%) in
the risk of having any severe adverse
outcome (13% relative reduction) during
the lockdown period. In this same sub-
group, there was a 3.43 percentage point
reduction (95% CI, 9.64% to 2.77%) in
the risk of having any adverse outcome
(9% relative reduction) and a 3.52 per-
centage point reduction (95% CI, 8.01%
to 0.96%) in the risk of having any severe
adverse outcome (22% relative reduction)
during the postlockdown period.
Adjusting
for
individual-level
de-
mographic variables and extending the
lockdown period by 2 weeks had no
material impact on our estimates (data
not shown).
Figure 2 shows the risks of any
(panel A) and any severe (panel B)
adverse outcomes from January to June
in 2017e2019 and in 2020. Although
some seasonal or calendar time varia-
tion may have been present in all years,
when
comparing
2020
with

the
weekly
risks
were
similar during the 13 weeks before the

Comment
Principal ﬁndings
We utilized a large birth outcomes sur-
veillance study in Botswana to estimate
the changes in the risk of adverse birth
outcomes following the COVID-19 na-
tional lockdown in 2020, compared to
similar time periods in 2017-2019, to
present a novel difference-in-differences
analysis. During the lockdown period, the
number of deliveries remained constant,
there was noticeable adherence to the
shelter-in-place order (40%e50%), and
no meaningful difference in adverse birth
outcomes was observed. However, we
found modest reductions in the risk of
any adverse outcome and any severe
adverse outcome from the prelockdown
to postlockdown periods, relative to
changes during the same 2 periods in
2017e2019.
These
reductions
were
mostly driven by reductions in preterm
birth, very preterm birth, SGA fetuses,
and very SGA fetuses, whereas there was
little evidence for a change in neonatal
death or stillbirth. We found evidence for
effect modiﬁcation by HIV status and
urban vs rural delivery site; the post-
lockdown period was associated with
more than 3 percentage point reduction
(approximately 10% relative reduction)
in the risk of any adverse outcome and
more than 2 percentage point reduction
(16%e21% relative reduction) in the risk
of any severe adverse outcome among
women with HIV and among women
delivering at urban sites.
Results

the risk of birth of low birthweight in-
fants1 and preterm birth2,3 following
COVID-19 lockdowns, although the
magnitude of our ﬁndings was smaller.
Our results differ from studies in Lon-
don, Nepal, and India that found an
increased risk of stillbirth during the
lockdown period.5e7 The differences
between our ﬁndings and studies con-
ducted in Western Europe and the
United States could be explained by dif-
ferences in risk factors for adverse birth
outcomes between high-income and
low- and middle-income countries. In
addition, the previous studies compared
the lockdown period with the period
immediately before the lockdown or to
the same period in previous years, even
though adverse birth outcomes vary by
season and by calendar year.33e35 For
example, several studies conducted in
Sub-Saharan Africa have found more
favorable birth outcomes in the dry
season than in the rainy season,36e42 and
previous
work
in
Botswana
found
modest reductions in adverse birth out-
comes over calendar time.43 By using a
difference-in-differences approach, we
were able to adjust for both seasonal and
calendar variation in adverse birth out-
comes. An additional strength of our
study was the inclusion of more than half
of all births in Botswana across multiple
delivery sites, ensuring a representative
sample of births in the country. Videos 1
and 2 summarize the study and key
ﬁndings.
Clinical implications
Several possible explanations have been
proposed for the favorable impact of
COVID-19 lockdown on preterm birth
and birth of low birthweight infants,
including
reducing
inﬂammation,
decreasing the risk of inﬂuenza and
other infections, decreasing physical la-
bor, decreasing stress, and decreasing
exposure
to
air
pollution.1,2,4
In
Botswana, we found that the shelter-in-
place order successfully led to more
people staying put, which could have
reduced physical labor, exposure to in-
fections and air pollution, and some
sources of stress. The food insecurity
mitigation
strategy
implemented
in
Botswana
could
have
increased

nutritional support during the lock-
down, but its impact remains unknown.
It is also possible that the lockdown led
to a reduction in preterm iatrogenic de-
livery. In addition, we did not ﬁnd any
evidence that the shelter-in-place order
negatively affected access to medications
for the 23% of women living with HIV.
We saw greater reductions in adverse
outcomes among women delivering at
urban delivery sites, women with HIV,
and women with salaried employment,
suggesting that the lockdown could have
affected the daily lives of these women to
a larger extent. Although the greater
reduction in adverse outcomes among
women with HIV could be because of
these women being more likely to deliver
at urban deliver sites, it is also possible
that sheltering in place directly affected
adverse outcomes in this population, for
example, through reducing inﬂamma-
tion. It is possible that stay-at-home or-
ders had less of an impact on women in
rural areas and women without salaried
employment because these women may
have continued physical labor, such as
farming, during the lockdown period. It
is also possible that the stay-at-home
order increased stress,44 anxiety, and
undernutrition (despite mitigation stra-
tegies), especially among those who were
food insecure and economically disad-
vantaged. The reduction in adverse
outcomes was greater (although modest)
in the postlockdown period and negli-
gible in the lockdown period. A plausible
explanation for this ﬁnding is that the
lockdown had a delayed effect on preg-
nancy outcomes, related to factors in the
second trimester of pregnancy or early in
the third trimester of pregnancy.

Research implications
Further studies are needed to identify
both the mechanism and the gestational
window for potential beneﬁts related to
decreasing movement during pregnancy
and factors associated with pregnancy
outcomes during pandemics. Although
our ﬁndings may not be generalizable to
other settings with different distribu-
tions of risk factors for adverse birth
outcomes (such as maternal nutrition,
age, and HIV prevalence45), they may
also provide insight into potential in-
terventions to reduce unknown causes of
adverse outcomes.
Strengths and limitations
Difference-in-differences analyses rely
on the assumption that the trend in
adverse outcomes in 2017e2019 would
be parallel to the trend in adverse out-
comes in 2020 in the absence of the
lockdown.46 Our ﬁnding that the weekly
trend in adverse outcomes during the
prelockdown period was similar
in
2017e2019 compared with the same
period in 2020 provides support that this
“parallel
trends”
assumption
may
approximately hold. In addition, we
found little variation in the demographic
characteristics
of
women
delivering
throughout the study period. However,
the parallel trends assumption would not
be met if other changes occurred in
Botswana at the same time as the lock-
down that also affected adverse out-
comes.
Difference-in-differences
analyses also require an assumption of
“strict exogeneity” that the choice to
impose a lockdown was not determined
by the prelockdown risk of adverse out-
comes.46 Because the lockdown was
imposed exclusively to stop the spread of
COVID-19, this assumption is likely to
hold.
Our study has important limitations.
First, our analysis only captured women
delivering at a hospital included in the
surveillance study. If women were more
likely to deliver at home or at a local
hospital not included in the surveillance
study following the lockdown, our re-
sults could be biased. We found that the
proportion of births during the post-
lockdown period in 2020 was slightly
lower than the proportion of births
during the same period in 2017e2019;
however, it is unlikely that this approxi-
mately 1% decrease would explain our
ﬁndings. Second, our analysis only cap-
tures births after at least 24 weeks’
gestation. If the risk of miscarriage
changed during the lockdown period, we
would not be able to capture this. Third,
we were not able to assess individual-
level mobility.
Although
staying-put
percentage increased during the lock-
down period, we were not able to eval-
uate
the
relationship
between
individual-level mobility and adverse
outcomes.
Conclusions
We found a 1.72 percentage point
reduction (5% relative reduction) in any
adverse outcome and a 1.62 percentage
point reduction (14% relative reduction)
in any severe adverse outcome from the
prelockdown to postlockdown periods
in 2020, relative to changes during the
same 2 periods in 2017e2019. We found
no meaningful difference in adverse
birth outcomes from the prelockdown to
lockdown periods. The greatest impact
was on preterm birth and SGA fetuses
and among women with HIV and those
delivering in urban areas. Although these
reductions were modest, they may pro-
vide insights into identifying potential
interventions to reduce adverse birth
outcomes in Botswana and in other low-
and
middle-income
countries
throughout the world.
