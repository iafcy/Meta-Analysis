## Abstract Objective The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with excess mortality and
### morbidity in adults and teenagers over 14 years of age, but there is still limited evidence on the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on pregnancy. We aimed to evaluate the effectof the first waveof the COVID-19pandemiconobstetricalemergencyattendance ina low-risk population and the corresponding perinatal outcomes. Study Design This is a single center retrospective cohort study of all singleton births between February 21 and April 30. Prenatal emergency labor ward admission numbers and obstetric outcomes during the peak of the first COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Israel were compared with the combined corresponding periods for the years 2017 to 2019. Results During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of prenatal emer- gency labor ward admissions was lower, both by daily count and per woman, in comparison to the combined matching periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (48.6 12.2 � vs. 57.8 � 14.4, p < 0.0001 and 1.74 � 1.1 vs. 1.92 � 1.2, p < 0.0001, respectively). A significantly (p 0.0370) higher rate of stillbirth was noted in the study group (0.4%) ¼ compared with the control group (0.1%). All study group patients were negative for COVID-19. Gestational age at delivery, rates of premature delivery at <28, 34, and 37 weeks, pregnancy complications, postdate delivery at >40 and 41 weeks, mode of

Excess deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in late December 2019 is
now well documented. Pooled estimates of all-cause mortality
for 24 European countries/federal states, participating in the
European monitoring of excess mortality for public health
action network for theperiod March to April 2020, haveshown
excess mortality in all age groups over 14 years old.[1] In Israel,
the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on February 21, 2020,
and from thebeginning of March onward, strict restrictions on
movement and gathering were imposed. On March 11, 2020,
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO)[2] and on March 23, 2020, full lockdown
was imposed in Israel.
The importance of routine obstetrical care is well established, especially in high-risk pregnancies, and health
authorities around the world have issued instructions and
guidance for antenatal and perinatal care not to be disrupted
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of pregnant women needing rapid interventions, including induction of labor or emergency cesarean section, is considered as
critical as interventions for cardiovascular emergencies.[3][–][6]

Furthermore, even if most pregnant women infected with
COVID-19, only develop mild or moderate symptoms,[7][–][10]

early reports published in April and May 2020 showed that
women in the third-trimester of gestation were at higher risk
for critical illness[7] and preterm cesarean delivery for maternal indications.[10][–][12]

Recent studies have shown that most neonates born to
infected mothers are asymptomatic, and there is only limited
evidence suggesting vertical transmission.[7,8,11,13] A small
case series of five stillbirths in infected mother from Brazil
has suggested that secondary chorioamnionitis due to
COVID-19 as the cause for fetal death.[14] A population-based
descriptive study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System
has reported a 2.5-fold increase in incidence of stillbirth at
the beginning of the pandemic compared with the national
rate in 2019.[15] A more recent study from one center in the
United Kingdom comparing the changes in incidence of
stillbirth and preterm birth has also found an increase in
stillbirths between February 1 and mid-June 2020 compared
with October 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020.[16] However, as
there is a seasonal impact on births and stillbirths,[17,18] the
comparison of different periods of the year may have skewed
the data in both studies.
Forashortperiodof time,atthestartofthepandemic,access
to antenatal clinics was limited due to the need for maternity
services to put in place special measures required to prevent
nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and medical staff shortage due to self-isolation after exposure to an infected patient or
relative. In addition, and similarly to other medical specialities
such as cardiovascular diseases,[3][–][6] pregnant women’s fear of
contracting infection during a hospital visit must have had an
impact on prenatal consultation attendance. In the present
study, we have evaluated the effect of the first peak of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Israel on prenatal care and obstetrical
outcomes compared with the same periods for the year 2017,
2018, and 2019.


#### Study Population
All pregnant women with singleton gestation admitted during
the COVID-19 peak period (study group) and the corresponding
periodin2017to2019(controlgroup)tothelaborwardinShamir
MedicalCenter(Zerifin,Israel),whichisatertiaryanduniversityaffiliatedhospital,withapproximately9,000deliveriesperayear
were included in the study. Premature previable deliveries <24
weeks, multiple pregnancies, and deliveries following feticide
wereexcludedfromthestudygroups.Demographic,obstetrical,
and neonatal data were retrieved from computerized medical
recordsandthehospital’slaboratorydatabase.Datacollectedfor
each participant included maternal age, gravidity, parity, and
previous cesarean deliveries. Obstetrical and neonatal data
collected included, induction of labor, mode of delivery and
indication for cesarean delivery if preformed, date and time of
birth, Apgar’s score at 5 minutes, arterial umbilical cord pH,
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and perinatal
mortality. For stillbirth cases, stillbirth-weight percentiles were
calculated according to nationally accepted growth curves for
gestational week and gender.[19] In addition, the following were
reviewed:maternalCOVID-19testresultsatadmission,presence
of meconium stained or bloody amniotic fluid at the time of
membrane rupture, pregnancy follow-up, placental and umbilical cord abnormalities as examined by the department of
pathology, and fetal dysmorphism as noted in the labor ward
following obstetric and midwife examination after delivery.
The primary outcome was fetal death, categorized into
antepartum (stillbirth) or intrapartum. Secondary outcomes
were gestational age at birth, maternal diabetes, maternal
pregnancy induced hypertension, induction of labor, mode
of delivery, type of cesarean delivery (elective, nonelective, or
intrapartum), birthweight, 5-minute Apgar’s score, umbilical
artery cord pH, and NICU admission (for more information,
please refer to “Definitions” in the ►Supplementary Material,
available in the online version).
The study was approved by the local institutional review
board (approval no. 0134–20-ASF). Informed consent was
waived due to the retrospective design of the study.

#### Statistical Analysis
The SAS (SAS Cooperation, Version 34.0, NC) data analysis and
statistical software package was used to analyze the data. A
standard Kurtosis analysis indicated that the values were
normally distributed, and the data are therefore continuous
variables presented as mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables are presented as count and percentages. Pearson’s
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, were used
to compare between the study and control groups with respect
to categorical variables. Independent samples t-test was used
to compare the means of the two groups for continuous
variables. All p-values were determined with two-tailed tests.
A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results


There were 1,556 births registered during first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The control group included 1,578,
1,545, and 1,441 newborns that were delivered during the
same period of the year in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively
(►Fig. 1).
Maternal age, race/ethnicity, the rate of prior cesarean
deliveries, maternal diabetes, and hypertensive rates were all
similar between groups (►Table 1). The mean gravidity and
parity were increased in the study group (3.0 � 2.0 vs.
2.7 � 1.7, p < 0.0001; 1.5 � 1.6 vs. 1.3 � 1.3, p < .0001; gravidity and parity, for the study and control groups, respectively), and the nulliparity rate did not differ between groups
(30.2 vs. 32.2%, p ¼ 0.15).
During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the average number
of prenatal emergency labor ward admission was lower, both
by daily count and per woman, in comparison to the combined
corresponding periods in 2017 to 2019 (48.6 � 12.2 vs.
57.8 � 14.4, p < 0.0001; 1.74 � 1.1 vs. 1.92 � 1.2, p < 0.0001,
respectively; ►Fig. 2).
A significantly (p ¼ 0.037) higher rate of stillbirth was found
in the study group (6/1,556, 0.4%) compared with the control
group (5/4,564, 0.1%). There was no difference in the mean
gestationalageat the diagnosisoffetaldeathor the postdelivery
stillbirth mean weight between study and control groups

either vaginally or by cesarean section depending on obstetrical
indication. All the women who experienced stillbirth in the
study group were tested and found negative for COVID-19.
In five out of the total 11 cases of stillbirth recorded in the
study and control groups, histopathology findings were suggestive of placental insufficiency. In three of these cases in the
study group, the fetal birthweight was below the 10th centile
for gestational age, whereas in the controls one stillbirth
presented with anhydramnios and one presented with both
a birth weight below the 10th centile and anhydramnios.
Histopathologic findings suggesting a cord accident as the
cause of fetal death were found only in the study group
including one case with a true knot of cord and the other
with a pathological narrowing of a portion of the cord. One
stillbirth from each group presented with blood in the amniotic fluid, suggesting a placental abruption. One stillbirth in
the study group was diagnosed with chorioamnionitis due to

None of the women who experienced stillbirth had diabetes
or hypertension.
One case of intrapartum fetal death occurred in the
control group, but none were reported in the study group
(►Table 2). Gestational age at birth and rates of premature
delivery at <28, 34, and 37 weeks, postdate delivery at >40


and 41 weeks, mode of delivery, and number of emergency
cesarean delivery were similar in both groups. The induction
of labor rate in the study group was higher compared with
the control group (32.3 vs. 28.2% of all deliveries, study, and
control group respectively, p ¼ 0.0005). The study group had
more cases of 5-minute Apgar’s score lower than 7 (0.7 vs.
0.3%, p ¼ 0.021), but the umbilical artery pH and the NICU
admission rates did not differ (►Table 3).

attendance to the obstetrical emergency room, which could
explain a parallel increase in the stillbirth rate compared with
the same period in the previous 3 years. As all stillbirth cases in
the present study tested negative for COVID-19 virus, the higher
stillbirth rate may be considered as collateral damage from the
stay at home mandates and fear of catching the virus in the
hospital setting during the early stage of the pandemic.

#### Comparison with Existing Literature
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous strain on
health care systems worldwide across all medical specialities. From the start of the outbreak, many health care workers from different medical emergency specialities noticed a
reduction in patient admissions for diseases not directly
related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, a decline in
the number of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome has been observed across Italy and United States
during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which correlates
with higher mortality and morbidity.[3][–][6] A similar reduction
in pediatric emergency department attendance with delayed
treatment was also observed in Italy in March 2020 compared with previous years, resulting in poorer outcomes in
many cases.[20]

By contrast to countries such as Italy, Spain, China, and the
United States, the number of hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 in Israel was relatively low and did not impact
on the distribution of emergency medical services for nonCOVID-19 related conditions.[21] Most health care resources
were not relocated to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and
in particular, there were no competing needs for equipment
and lack of beds in our hospital. Our data therefore suggest
that the decrease in prenatal emergency labor ward admission in our study was mainly due to the fear by pregnant
women of contracting SARS-CoV-2. This fear was particularly
high after the media diffused the news that the infection was
largely spread across hospitalized patients and health care
personnel due to the lack of personal protection equipment.
This patient factor has been reported in previous pandemics[9]

and may lead to pregnant women ignoring symptoms such as
decreased fetal movements or not getting standard obstetrical care including regular glycemic control or screening for
hypertensive disorders, which are known to be associated
with higher stillbirth rate.[22,23]


period immediately before. Our data confirm an increase in
stillbirths at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, that
is, February 21 and April 30, 2020 compared the same periods
of 3 consecutive years before accounting for the seasonal[17,18]

effect. By contrast, we found no differences in maternal
hypertension and nulliparity rates between the groups. We
also observed no difference in the premature delivery rates for
anygestationalperiodsatbetween28and37weeks,indicating
that the increase in stillbirth rate was the main perinatal
impact of the of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel.
None of the women with pregnancies complicated by
stillbirth included in the present study tested positive for
COVID-19. Women from ethnic minorities account for less
than 10% in our population, which is much lower that the
United States[16] or the United States. Although the rates of
stillbirths increased significantly during the peak of the
COVID-19 pandemic in our population, it remains overall
much lower than in the United States. These findings suggest
that complications such as diabetes and hypertension, which
are more common in women from ethnic minorities, did not
influence the stillbirth rate in our study. Other confounding
factors including as reduced mobility and exercise, increase
smoking exposure, increased caloric intake, poor glycemic
control for pregestational and gestational diabetic women,
poor supervision, and control of hypertensive complications,
as well as uncontrolled thyroid disorders[23,25] could have
indirectly contributed to risk of stillbirth during the lockdown.

## Strengths and Limitations


#### Clinical Implications
Most women infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and
national survey of the outcome of 427 pregnant women
admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
between March 1, 2020 and April 14, 2020 has found that 10%
required intensive care support and 1% died.[15] SARS-CoV-2,
outcomes are linked to various preexisting comorbidities such
as hypertension or diabetes and morbidity disproportionately,
affects those of lower socioeconomic status and particularly
ethnic minorities.[24]

The recent study by Khalil et al[16] found fewer nulliparous
womenand showedbothadecreaseinthenumber ofpregnant
women with hypertension and an increase in the number of
stillbirths at the start of the pandemic compared with the


The strengths of our study lie in it being from a single center,
with uniform data documentation and clinical evaluation
approach. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study investigating the association between obstetrical
care during the COVID-19 pandemic and stillbirth. The main
limitation of our study is its retrospective design, with limited
data available for some parameters. In addition, multiple
gestations, which are a major risk factor for stillbirth, were
excluded because of their relatively small number in this short
period. Because ofreligious reasons, the Israeli population often
declines postmortem autopsies, and therefore, this information
islimitedtoplacentalexaminationinboththestudyandcontrol
groups. However, all cases of stillbirth are examined externally
by a trained perinatal pathologist and did not show evidence of
fetal dysmorphism in both groups. A considerable reduction in
the community clinic activity could have influenced the availability of medical services, but these data were not available.

## Conclusion


The COVID-19 pandemic is a generation-defining global medical phenomenon, the scope, scale, and pace of which is
unprecedented. Despite the limited impact of SARS-CoV-2
on the overall health of pregnant women, our data have shown
a decrease in prenatal emergency labor ward admissions
parallel with an increase in the number of stillbirths during
the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This collateral
damage was not due to a reduce access to our maternity

services during that period but is morelikelydue to the patient
fear of contracting the infection during hospital visits, and like
for other medical specialities may have discouraged them to
access emergency medical services during the first peak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. These findings support government
guidance in maintaining adequate emergency prenatal care
during pandemic and in informing pregnant women about the
need to attend routine prenatal consultation.
