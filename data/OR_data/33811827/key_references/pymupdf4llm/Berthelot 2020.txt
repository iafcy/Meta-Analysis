### Abstract

#### Introduction: Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of preg
 nancy, fetal development, offspring development, and later psychopathologies. The

 study aimed to determine the extent to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID
 19) pandemic may aggravate the prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology

 of pregnant women.

 Material and methods: Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated,

 one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 496) through advertise
 ments in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the

 other (n = 1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from 2 April to 13 April

 2020. Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the

 Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative

 Experiences Scale (DES-II), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).

 Results: The 1754 pregnant women (Mage = 29.27, SD = 4.23) were between 4 and
 41 gestational weeks (M = 24.80, SD = 9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had

 post-high-school training), and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low
 income cut-off). A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational

 age, household income, education, and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large

 effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms
 (Wilks’ λ = 0.68, F6,1400 = 108.50, P < .001, partial η[2] = 0.32). According to post-hoc
 analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive

 and anxiety symptoms (ES = 0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES = 0.22 and ES = 0.25),

 symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES = 0.19), and negative affectivity

 (ES = 0.96), and less positive affectivity (ES = 0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort.

 Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to

 present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.94,
 χ[2][1] = 10.05, P = .002). Multiple regression analyses indicated that pregnant women

 be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.


#### Conclusions: Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported

 more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the

 pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harm

 served upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical

 surveillance.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

There is robust evidence that prenatal psychological distress is

harmful to the mother, the fetus, and, eventually, the child. Indeed,

maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with serious

negative outcomes including poor maternal psychosocial function
ing,[1] parenting difficulties,[1] lower infant birthweight,[2] earlier infant

gestational age,[2] offspring psychopathology,[3] alterations in brain

development,[4] and poorer socioemotional[5] and cognitive develop
ment.[6] The detrimental effects of prenatal maternal psychological

distress would not be limited to the most vulnerable populations as

higher levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy would be

linked to alterations in fetal and infant brain development even in

women with low-risk pregnancies, high levels of education, and high

socioeconomic status.[4,7]

Although maternal prenatal psychological distress is common in


community samples of pregnant women,[4] major stressors such as

health crises and natural disasters would increase prenatal stress

and exert long-lasting effects on child development.[8] Coronavirus

disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected everyone around the world

while often disrupting medical practices in non-COVID-19 cases and

specifically in prenatal care.[9,10]


### 2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS

 2.1 | Study design and sample


Understandably, perinatal research on COVID-19 has primarily

focused on maternal and neonatal outcomes of severe acute respira
tory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy. The impact

of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in pregnant women

remains unknown.[10] Similarly, although medical associations world
wide had to provide clinical guidelines on the clinical management

of pregnant women and their newborn during the pandemic, recom
mendations related to maternal mental health were limited by the


absence of empirical data.[10]

The aim of the present study was to provide such data. We eval

uated to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic provoked an increase

of prenatal psychological distress in pregnant women, as measured

by two domains of symptoms: (a) depressive and anxiety symptoms

(ie, high prenatal distress, high negative affectivity, low positive

affectivity) and (b) trauma-related symptoms (ie, dissociation and


A first cohort of pregnant women was recruited into a longitudinal

study in prenatal clinics before the COVID-19 pandemic, from April

2018 to 1 March 2020, through an invitation to participate in re
search on early life experiences and parenthood. A second cohort

was recruited during the active COVID-19 pandemic from 2 April to

13 April 2020 through social media (Facebook and Instagram) and

advertisements in prenatal clinics. All participants were volunteers

from the Province of Quebec, Canada, where a public health emer
gency was declared in reaction to COVID-19 on 13 March 2020.

This culminated in the closure of all non-essential businesses, self
isolation, and restriction of non-essential displacements from 24

March until 4 May. The enrolment of the COVID-19 pandemic co
hort actually took place when the pandemic was well under way.

Inclusion criteria were being 18 years or older, having sufficient

reading skills to complete self-report instruments, and being preg
nant at the time of assessment. Measures were completed on
line on a secure portal. Informed consent was obtained from all

participants.

### 2.2 | Measures

Two instruments showing strong correlations with anxiety disorders

and depression and two questionnaires of trauma-related disorders

(PTSD and dissociation) were selected for measuring prenatal psy
chological distress. Anxiety and depression were first measured

using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10).[11,12]

Higher scores at the K10 indicate more symptoms and distress and

76.3% of respondents with scores ≥30 would meet the 4[th] revision of

the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)

criteria for anxiety, affective, or substance use disorder during a di
agnostic interview.[13] Both the English and French versions have sim
ilarly satisfactory psychometric properties[11] and the instrument has

been shown to screen adequately for mood and anxiety disorders in

pregnant women.[14] Cronbach's α for the K10 in this study was 0.88.


disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or other disorder

(Table 1).


Positive and negative affect were assessed using the Positive

and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).[15,16] The Positive Affect

scale probes for feelings such as enthusiasm, energy, and dynamism

whereas the Negative Affect scale catches feelings of anger, fear,

guilt, and nervousness. Scores on the Positive Affect scale were

reversed to reflect low positive affectivity. The original and the

French version have been shown to be valid and reliable,[16,17] and

PANAS scores were shown to be associated with DSM-IV major

depressive disorder in pregnant women.[18] The Cronbach's α for the

Positive Affect and Negative Affect subscales were 0.85 and 0.89,


### 2.3 | Statistical analyses

Analyses were performed with SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM Corp.). The

characteristics of the participants across the two cohorts were com
pared using t test for continuous variables and chi-squared test for

categorical variables. To meet our first objective, we performed a

multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to evaluate whether

the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic cohorts differed on the

six symptoms. Subsequent ANCOVAs were performed to examine

group differences on the six symptoms separately. Scores were con
verted to z scores. All analyses controlled for age, gestational age,

education level, household income, and lifetime psychiatric disor
ders. We calculated effect sizes (ES) using the difference of adjusted

means between the COVID-19 and the pre-COVID-19 cohorts di
vided by a pooled standard deviation. In complement to analyses on

continuous variables, we wanted to compare the two cohorts using

categorical analyses via established cut-offs for the K10 and PCL-5


and used chi-squared tests to test homogeneity.

To meet our second objective, ie, identifying a subgroup po

respectively.

The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assessed post-traumatic


stress symptoms during the past month and is based on the PTSD

diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5.[19,20] Its 20 items can be regrouped

into four subscales corresponding to the clusters of symptoms of

a PTSD diagnosis in the DSM-5: intrusion (Cluster B; five items),

avoidance of trauma-related stimuli (Cluster C; two items), nega
tive alterations in cognitions and mood (Cluster D; seven items), and

alterations in arousal and reactivity (Cluster E; six items). Higher

scores indicate more severe symptoms (clinical cut-off ≥33).[20] The

instrument was previously used in samples of pregnant women[21]

and both the French and the original versions have equally adequate

validity and reliability.[19] The Cronbach's α for the PCL-5 in this study

was 0.92.


tentially more vulnerable to prenatal distress during the pandemic,

we first conducted in the COVID-19 cohort a factor analysis with

Varimax rotation on the six symptoms, to diminish the num
ber of meaningful symptoms to be analyzed (see Results and the

Supplementary material, Table S1). A strong factorial structure was

obtained. We then performed multiple regressions with the charac
teristics of the COVID-19 cohort of women as predictors and their

factor score on each of the three factors. Given that three regression

analyses were performed, we conservatively applied Bonferroni cor
rections and the significance level was fixed at P < .02.


### 2.4 | Ethical approval

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of

Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (#CER-20-266-10.10) on 2


Dissociation was measured with the depersonalization/dere
alization (six items) and absorption/imaginative involvement (nine

items) subscales of the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II).[22,23]

The instrument was previously used in samples of pregnant women[24]

and has good validity and reliability.[22,23] The Cronbach's α for the

DES in this study was 0.75 for the depersonalization subscale and

### 3 | RESULTS


0.83 for the absorption subscale.

A sociodemographic questionnaire was administered to assess


potentially confounding variables, including age, gestational age, ed
ucation, annual income, and history of psychiatric disorders. For the

latter, participants had to confirm all mental health disorders among

the following for which they had received a medical diagnosis at one

point in their life: major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD,

eating disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, personality


The sample consisted of 1754 pregnant women, ranging from 18 to

46 years old (M = 29.27, SD = 4.23). The characteristics of the two

cohorts are presented in Table 1. Among the participants, 91.3% had

post-high-school training and 85.3% were above the low-income

cut-off of Can$33 863 for a family with two children. The median

household income in our sample was between Can$85 000 and

Can$95 000. Our sample of pregnant women would therefore be

highly representative of Quebec's population of mothers as 91.5% of

women between 25 and 34 years have post-high-school education

was significantly more educated, had higher household income and

had slightly older gestational age (Table 1). Of the 1754 participants,

342 had missing data on at least one instrument (see Supplementary

material, Table S2). No demographic difference was found between

participants with complete data and those with missing data (see

Supplementary material, Table S3). Moreover, the analyses including

only participants with complete data (n = 1412; see Supplementary

material, Table S4) yielded the same results as the analyses in the

total sample (n = 1754) shown below.

partial η[2] = 0.08). Post hoc ANCOVAs (Table 2) revealed more severe

symptoms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of negative affec
tivity, and lower levels of positive affectivity in the COVID-19 co
hort. Pregnant women assessed during the pandemic also reported

more symptoms of PTSD and dissociation than women from the pre
COVID-19 cohort. A diagnosis of PTSD requires the combination of

four types of symptoms (see Methods), so we next analyzed PTSD

clusters of symptoms separately. We observed that the COVID-19

cohort reported more alterations in cognitions and mood (criterion

≥30).[13] Results showed that 10.9% of the COVID-19 cohort had clin
ically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression in comparison

to only 6.0% of the pre-COVID-19 cohort (OR = 1.94, χ[2][1] = 10.05,

_P = .002). However, the two cohorts were similar in PTSD symptoms_

(χ[2][1] = 1.77, P = .18).


The factor analysis of the six psychiatric symptoms yielded in

the COVID-19 cohort a strong three-factor structure explaining,

respectively, 49%, 18%, and 14% of the total variance: Factor 1 was

composed of mood and anxiety symptoms (anxiety/depression,

negative affectivity, PTSD), Factor 2 of dissociative symptoms and

Factor 3 of low positive affectivity (see Supplementary material,

Table S4). Multiple regression analyses each having a Factor as the

predicted variable (see Supplementary material, Table 3) showed

that lifetime psychiatric disorders and household income were the

best predictors of Factor 1 mood and anxiety, and of Factor 2 dis
sociative symptoms. Factor 3 low positive affectivity was predicted

by lifetime psychiatric disorders, education levels, and gestational


symptomatology to those with minimal or lower symptomatology

yielded congruent results on changes in psychiatric clinical status.

The COVID-19 pregnant women would show up as almost twice as

likely to present a level of symptoms meeting a DSM diagnosis of

affective, anxiety, or substance use disorder, but showed no risk dif
ference for a DSM diagnosis of PTSD, which was somewhat congru
ent with the previous results from the continuous analysis on PTSD

clusters of symptoms.

Our findings also have implications for developmental psychopa

Our findings have clinical meaning for primary and specialized

care. Indeed, easily measurable attributes in the clinic, such as a per
sonal history of psychiatric disorder and lower sociodemographic

status, would predict higher psychiatric symptomatology in the

pandemic, and thus definitely higher health risk for the mother and

child.[1-7] As detailed below in the conclusion, our data advocate for

special forms of clinical surveillance of pregnant women who exhibit

these characteristics, as well as targeted information in primary-care


age.

### 4 | DISCUSSION


To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a

significant surge of distress and psychiatric symptoms in pregnant

women during the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] We contrasted two large

cohorts of pregnant women from the general population, one as
sessed before and the other during the COVID-19 pandemic, by

using the same measurements. The public health and mental health

relevance of our study is markedly supported by the documented

negative impact of psychological distress during pregnancy on the

health of both mothers and offspring.[1,3-5]


Our study indeed revealed differences with small to large ES

between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 cohorts on all psy
chiatric symptoms. More specifically, during the pandemic, pregnant

women would mainly exhibit an upsurge of depressive and anxiety

symptoms (defined as high psychological distress, high negative af
fectivity, and low positive affectivity) along with some symptoms of

dissociation and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, post-hoc

analyses revealed that only the clusters of PTSD symptoms over
lapping with anxiety and depression (ie, negative mood and cogni
tions; alterations in reactivity and arousal), and not symptoms that

are more specific to PTSD (ie, intrusion symptoms and avoidance of

trauma-related stimuli), increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Remarkably, also, a history of a psychiatric disorder before the pan
demic, younger age, lower household income, and lower education

were all associated with higher maternal psychological distress. It

is noteworthy that the differences in symptomatology between the

two cohorts remained significant after controlling for the above vari
ables. This finding adds to previous results suggesting that high lev
els of prenatal distress would not be limited to the most vulnerable


thology. Prenatal psychological distress has been repeatedly shown

to be associated with poor developmental outcomes in offspring

such as alterations in brain development[4,7] and poorer socioemo
tional and cognitive development.[5,6] In that respect, it may be rele
vant to attempt a comparison of our present findings with previous

studies from the same population. For instance, previous Quebec

studies have shown that prenatal maternal distress resulting from

another stressful event at the population level (the 1998 Quebec

Ice Storm; see Supplementary material, Appendix S5) had an effect

on offspring DNA methylation,[25] metabolic pathways involved in

energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis,[26] cognitive and lin
guistic functioning,[27] and motor functions.[28] The current COVID-19

pandemic may be considered at least as stressful as the Quebec Ice

Storm and the high rates of maternal prenatal psychological distress

we reported in the current study suggest that similar developmental

outcomes will be observed in a substantial proportion of offspring

born to women that were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The implications for future studies are several. Our data call


for biological studies including environmental, epigenetic, and risk

mechanisms at play in the short- and long-term consequences of

prenatal psychological distress on offspring development.[1-7] In this

respect, future clinical research is needed to assess more thoroughly

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the maternal psychiat
ric status and offspring developmental trajectory, notwithstanding

of course the outcome studies of psychosocial and pharmacologi
cal interventions in prenatal or postnatal period targeting the child

and family, which is often neglected to the benefit of correlational

research.[29]

Moreover, our use of a categorical validated cut-off on the


symptoms scales to compare the pregnant women with higher


Our study presents limitations and strengths to be considered

when interpreting the findings. One strength was certainly the

investigation, using the same extensive array of measurements,

the same population, one that was assessed before the pandemic

cohort consisting of volunteers recruited online mainly through

social media, whereas the pre-COVID-19 cohort was recruited in

prenatal clinics. For instance, our education levels and socioeco
nomic data suggest a more privileged sample in the COVID-19

pandemic cohort. In contrast, the two cohorts were similar in

lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and age. Moreover, all comparison

analyses controlled for age, education level, household income,

gestational age, and previous psychiatric disorder, then, min
imizing potential analytic biases. A second limitation of studies

like this one is the impossibility of comparing the respondents

with the non-respondents at enrollment, which may limit the

generalizability of results. However, the level of education and

the median household income of the participants were the same

as those of women from Quebec's population. A third limitation

in the study of such large samples is that measurements were

self-reports although they were previously well tested and val
idated instruments.


### 5 | CONCLUSION

In sum, pregnant women would be particularly likely to experience

high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID
19 pandemic, which may have a deleterious impact on mothers and

fetuses even in socioeconomically privileged women with low-risk

pregnancies.[1,4,7] The present findings would call for the rapid imple
mentation of clinical and public health strategies targeting particu
larly pregnant women with a history of psychiatric disorder and a

modest income. As recently advocated regarding the mental health

impact from the COVID-19 pandemic,[30] our findings may inform

medical academies and decision-makers (a) in their recommenda
tions to practitioners, particularly in mental health surveillance of

pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as simply

inquiring about specific distress or symptoms during prenatal care,

or inquiring about the level of paternal support; (b) in their support

of different forms of telehealth assistance to women with elevated

psychological distress, such as toll-free helplines to answer the ques
tions of pregnant women and online psychological support; (c) to

encourage public health organizations to disseminate information

about distress and relief of distress in pregnant women. Ideally, our

findings would support a global approach of the family given that

both the distressed mother and child would be in need of mental


health surveillance.
