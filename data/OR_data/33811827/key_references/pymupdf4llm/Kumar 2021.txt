### 1 | INTRODUCTION


### ABSTRACT

#### Objective: To study the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown

 on the incidence, associated causes, and modifiable factors of stillbirth.

 Methods: An analytical case-control study was performed comparing stillbirths from

 March to September 2020 (cases) and March to September 2019 (controls) in a ter
 tiary care center in India. Modifiable factors were observed as level-I, level-II, and

 level-III delays.

 Results: A significant difference in the rate of stillbirths was found among cases

 (37.4/1000) and controls (29.9/1000) (P = 0.045). Abruption in normotensive women

 was significantly higher in cases compared to controls (P = 0.03). Modifiable factors

 or preventable causes were noted in 76.1% of cases and 59.6% of controls; the differ
 ence was highly significant (P < 0.001, relative risk [RR] 1.8). Level-II delays or delays

 in reaching the hospital for delivery due to lack of transport were observed in 12.7%

 of cases compared to none in controls (P < 0.006, RR 47.7). Level-III delays or delays in

 providing care at the facility were observed in 31.3% of cases and 11.5% of controls

 (P < 0.001, RR 2.7).

 Conclusion: Although there was no difference in causes of stillbirth between cases

 and controls, level-II and level-III delays were significantly impacted by the pandemic,

 leading to a higher rate of preventable stillbirths in pregnant women not infected with

 COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unabated. Unlike other elective medi
cal and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the

pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue.

multiple reasons, the main one being reduced access to healthcare

services.[1,2] The imposition of lockdown to prevent the spread of the

pandemic led to the shutdown of healthcare services and a shift of

focus to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. This

resulted in the disruption of routine care and monitoring of pregnant

women.[2] Psychological fear because of the pandemic further pre
vented pregnant women from seeking care and consulting health
care providers as well as reluctance on the part of care providers to


-----

provide care.[3] For the less fortunate living below the poverty line,

access to proper nutrition and supplements during the pandemic

also contributed to the problem.

The rate of perinatal mortality is a sensitive indicator of the

quality of care provided to women in pregnancy, during childbirth,

and to the newborns in the first week of life.[4] As part of an ongoing

study funded by the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO;

Neonatal-Perinatal Database Network) in selected hospitals of

South-East Asian countries, the data on neonatal and perinatal out
comes are collected at the study hospital. The aim of the present

study was to compare data on stillbirths occurring before the pan
demic with those during the pandemic to determine the impact of

the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown on the incidence

of stillbirth, its associated causes, and modifiable factors. This was

done to understand the sociodemographic mechanisms that come

into play in times of a pandemic, for providing insights to the policy

makers for future planning.

### 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present study is an analytical case-control study, performed

after ethical clearance from the institute's Ethical Committee for

Human Research (ECHR). All infants delivered after 20 weeks of ges
tation showing no signs of life after birth were considered stillborn.

All stillborn infants delivered at the institute during the study pe
riod of March to September 2020 were included in the study (cases).

Gestational age was calculated according to the last menstrual pe
riod or first-trimester ultrasound if the last menstrual period was not

known. The antenatal record of each case was reviewed, and all rel
evant clinical findings and investigations were recorded in a stillbirth

proforma especially designed for this purpose. The contributory

cause of death was classified under the International Classification

of Diseases [ICD]-10 PM system adopted by WHO in 2016 for use

in classifying perinatal mortality.[5] The ICD PM classification system

uses a layered approach to categorize perinatal mortality (including

stillbirth) based on the time of death (antepartum or intrapartum),

the fetal cause of death, and/or contributing maternal condition. The

total number of live births were recorded each week from the exist
ing healthcare facility registers (labor ward, admission discharge, and

operation theatre registers). On a weekly basis, healthcare provid
ers reviewed all stillbirths in the preceding week. One most relevant

contributory maternal condition and one fetal cause were attributed

to each stillbirth in these review meetings. Hypertensive disorder

of pregnancy was taken as any rise in blood pressure of 140/90 mm

Hg and above on two occasions, 4 hours apart. Pre-eclampsia was

defined according to 2013 guidelines from the American College of

Obstetricians and Gynecologists.[6] Fetal growth restriction (FGR)

was diagnosed when the birth weight was less than the 10th centile

for the gestational age according to the Intergrowth 21 chart.[7]

Apart from direct causes, modifiable causes were also deter
mined based on antenatal history and the details of the critical

events related to stillbirth The causes were divided into levels


of delay: level I if the women arrived late due to not recognizing

the need for care; level II due to failure to reach the hospital for

treatment due to lack of transport facilities; and level III due to

inadequate care by the provider.[8] Each cause was statistically an
alyzed using the Fisher exact test to calculate the P value and by

paired t-test to compare the means. The relative risk (RR) of the

significant variable was also calculated. Statistical analysis was

performed using SPSS version 20, and _P < 0.05 was considered_

significant.

### 3 | RESULTS

From March to September 2019, there were 6161 deliveries and 184

stillbirths (29.9/1000) whereas between March to September 2020,

there were 3610 deliveries and 134 stillbirths (37.4/1000 deliver
ies). There was a significant increase in the stillbirth rate during the

COVID-19 pandemic (P = 0.045) (Figure 1).

Most of the women in both cases and controls were aged

23–27 years and were primigravidae. No significant difference in ma
ternal age (P = 0.121), gravidity (P = 0.288), and number of abortions

(P = 0.193) were observed between the cases and controls (Table 1).

There were significantly fewer antenatal visits among cases com
pared to controls (P = 0.048). Significantly more women among the

cases had a history of previous cesarean delivery (24/134, 17.9% vs

14/183, 7.7%, P = 0.014).

Table 2 illustrates the details of the period of gestation, the

weight of the baby, and the mode of delivery among the cases

and controls. There were significantly more babies born at

30–40 weeks of gestation among the cases (103/134, 76.9%)

compared to the controls (122/183, 66.7%) (P < 0.001). Similarly,

significantly more babies weighed more than 3000 g among the

cases than among the controls (22/134, 16.4% vs 13/183, 7.1%;

_P < 0.001). Lower segment cesarean section (14/134, 10.4% vs_

5/183, 2.7%) and laparotomy for ruptured uterus (6/134, 4.5%

vs 1/134, 0.5%) were performed in significantly more cases com
pared to controls (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference

in the incidence of intrapartum (P = 0.105) or intramural stillbirth

(P = 0.237) between the two groups.

The causes associated with stillbirth are given in Table 3. The

causes were classified according to ICD-10 PM coding. Among the

maternal conditions, the maternal medical and surgical conditions

(M4) were comparable in the cases and controls (49/134, 36.2%

and 68/183, 37.2%, respectively). It was observed that the compli
cations of placenta, cord, and membranes (M1) were higher in the

cases compared to the controls (22/134, 16.4% and 23/183, 12.6%

respectively), but the difference was not statistically significant.

Placental abruption was higher among the cases than the controls

(16/134, 12% and 13/183, 7%, respectively) but the difference was

not statistically significant (P = 0.169). However, the incidence of

abruption in normotensive women was significantly higher in cases

than in controls (P = 0.003). The relative risk of having abruption

without hypertension was 3 69 among the cases


-----

Regarding the fetal conditions leading to stillbirth, there was

no statistical difference among the cases and controls (P > 0.05).

Disorders related to fetal growth were the most common cause in

both cases and controls (40/134, 29.9% and 59/183, 32.2%, respec
tively). All 134 mothers included in the analysis among the cases

were screened for COVID-19 infection by reverse transcription

polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) at admission: only 2/134 (1.5%)

of them were positive for COVID-19. In one case, there was severe

acute respiratory distress leading to hypoxia and acidosis leading to

intrauterine fetal death, and in the other, there was FGR and the

mother had only a mild fever.

The modifiable factors or preventable causes were noted in

102/134 (76.1%) cases and 109/183 (59.6%) controls. The differ
ence was highly significant (P < 0.001) (Table 4). The level-I delay

or the delay in recognizing the need for care was the most common

modifiable factor in both groups (43/134, 32.1% of the cases and

53/183, 29.1% of the controls); however, no antenatal check-up in

the third trimester was observed in 29/134 (21.6%) cases compared

to 11/183 (6%) controls (P < 0.001). There was no significant dif
ference in the knowledge of danger signs between the cases and

controls (P = 0.359). The delay in reaching the health facility (level-II

delay) was seen only during the period of the pandemic in 17/134

(12.7%) cases. There were 3 (2.2%) deliveries at the entrance of the

hospital due to the delay in arrival at the facility with resultant birth

trauma to the baby.


The delay in providing care at the facility by the provider (level-III

delay) was observed in 42/134 (31.3%) cases, compared to 21/183

(11.5%) controls (P < 0.001). The women were referred to multiple

hospitals in 15/134 (11.2%) cases compared to 3/183 (1.6%) controls

(P = 0.002). Suboptimal care during labor in the initial weeks of the

pandemic due to wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE),

inability to listen to the fetal heart sounds while in PPE, and shortage

of staff were the modifiable factors observed in significantly more

cases compared to controls (P = 0.034). There was a delay in un
dertaking operative procedures due to the following of COVID-19

protocols in operation theatres with consequent stillbirth in 4/134

(3%) cases.

The highest relative risk of having a stillbirth was due to delay

in reaching the hospital (RR 47.70), delay in undertaking operative

procedure (RR 12.20), and delay due to the patient being denied ser
vices and referred to more than one hospital before reaching our

hospital (RR 6.80) (Table 4).

### 4 | DISCUSSION

The present study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak

on the rate of stillbirths and its related reasons by comparing and

analyzing the data of stillbirths from a tertiary hospital between

COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. The pandemic has resulted

in a significantly higher incidence of stillbirths not due to COVID-19

infection per se, but due to delays in care at all levels. The facilities

were significantly impacted due to the lockdown and fear among

both the pregnant women and healthcare providers during the pan
demic resulting in many preventable stillbirths. The rates of stillbirth

in low-income countries are tenfold higher compared to those in

high-income countries.[9] It is important to understand how the pan
demic has impacted the rates of stillbirth in high- and low-income

countries.

The WHO SEARO Neonatal-Perinatal Database Network

study aims to establish a framework to assess the burden of still
births and neonatal deaths in low-income countries. The informa
tion generated regarding the modifiable factors contributing to

stillbirths and neonatal deaths provides the decision-makers with

guidance for changes in policy. The ICD-10 classification system

was adopted for the classification of perinatal deaths (ICD-10 PM)

to facilitate more accurate and uniform reporting of causes to en
able comparison within and between settings.[6] The most common

maternal cause contributing to stillbirth in previous studies has

been hypertension, abruption, and diabetes in pregnancy.[10–12]

Even during the pandemic, hypertension remained the most com
mon cause of stillbirth Among the fetal causes disorders related

to fetal growth were the most common. The causes of stillbirth

were comparable in both groups, except there were significantly

more cases of abruption in normotensive women during the pan
demic compared to the previous year. This could possibly be re
lated to nutritional deficiencies due to a lack of proper nutrition

and supplements during the COVID-19 period.

Only 1.5% of women among the cases were positive for COVID
19, implying that COVID-19 infection did not contribute substantially

to the increase in the rate of stillbirth in the study population. Fetal

complications of COVID-19 as reported in the literature include mis
carriage (2%), FGR (10%), and preterm birth (39%).[13]

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected maternal and neonatal

health services all over the world. Studies have identified the substan
tial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality due to disruption of

the healthcare delivery in obstetric patients.[2] The overall number of de
liveries in our hospital from March to September decreased from 6161

to 3610 (41.4%) during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods

included for analysis. Similar reductions of 33% in institutional births

were reported during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Liberia.[14]

More than three-quarters of women among the cases had a pre
ventable stillbirth, compared to half in the control group. The modi
fiable factors identify missed opportunities, building momentum for

the behavior change. This fact was brought forth by applying the scale

suggested by Thaddeus et al.[8] for estimating preventable maternal

deaths to stillbirth evaluation. The delay due to the inability to recog
nize the need for care and the patient not considering the need to visit

a facility is a level-I delay. The lack of knowledge of danger signs and

inability to be admitted to hospital due to the social cause was not sig
nificantly different in the two groups. The knowledge of danger signs

is expected to be provided during antenatal visits and is very pertinent

as women may take the symptoms as pregnancy and childbirth-related

phenomena and may not seek care urgently Hence the precious time


after the trigger event is lost.[15,16] In a review of factors associated with

stillbirth in low- and middle-income countries by Aminu et al.,[17] pov
erty, lack of education, maternal age and lack of antenatal care were

the most important modifiable factors.

It was observed that women did not attend antenatal clinics

either due to fear of contracting COVID-19 infection or due to lack

of transport in significantly more cases compared to the controls

(P < 0.001). The level-II delay or delay in reaching the hospital due

to lack of transport was observed only during the pandemic pe
riod, a phenomenon that was not observed in recent years in the

study hospital, which is in the center of the city. Women went to

local unskilled birth attendants for advice instead. Level-III delays

or provider-related causes such as the denial of care by multiple

hospitals before reaching the study hospital were observed in a

significantly greater number of women. This was because some

facilities were converted into exclusive COVID-19 hospitals with

no information to pregnant women booked there and a shortage

of staff because healthcare providers were becoming infected

themselves. Suboptimal and delayed care was observed at the fa
cility among cases due to challenges such as: the inability to hear

the fetal heartbeat by stethoscope while wearing PPE, limited

numbers of CTG machines and Dopplers, delays in the decision

to start cesarean delivery for fetal distress due to the extra time

taken to mobilize patients from COVID-19 suspect areas to the op
eration theatre and donning of PPE by healthcare providers, and

the shortage of blood and blood products in blood banks due to a

drastic fall in routine donations of blood.

The main limitation of the present study was its retrospective

nature. The strength of the present study was the uniformity in the

collection of data of all stillbirths under the WHO SEARO Neonatal
Perinatal Database Network study and comparative study design.

### 5 | CONCLUSION

The present study brings to light the untold story of the impact of

the COVID-19 pandemic on stillbirths due to COVID-19-related

causes such as delays in reaching the hospital, denial of care, and

suboptimal care leading to preventable stillbirths. More infants have

been lost due to the lockdown than the COVID-19 infection per se.
