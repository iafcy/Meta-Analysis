Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to describe the emergency responses to coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) for pregnant patients at our hospital and their effect on hospital operations and
patients’ outcomes.
Methods: We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in
obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient
volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus
was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed
and the patients’ characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and
anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared.
Results: No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient
volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher
prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological

## Introduction

In December 2019, clusters of patients with
pneumonia of an unknown cause were
reported in Wuhan, China.[1] Further investigation identified a novel coronavirus,
which was initially termed 2019-nCoV,
and was subsequently named severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The
ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) has become a global
health concern. As recorded by the World
Health Organization, the number of confirmed cases by 2 April 2020 has surpassed
896,000 globally.[2] Little is known about the
effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women
and neonates. In a report of 10 neonates
delivered by mothers who had COVID-19
infection, adverse perinatal outcomes, such
as premature labor, fetal distress, and even
death, were reported.[3] Currently, the route
of neonatal infection, such as the transplacental route, during delivery, or by postnatal close contact with an infected mother, is
unclear.
Zhongda Hospital, Southeast
University, is an academic and tertiary
medical center in Nanjing, Jiangsu
Province. The Department of Obstetrics
has approximately 2000 deliveries per
year. This hospital is also designated as a


unique Guidance Center and Quality
Control Center for Maternal Critical Care
of Jiangsu Province, and is a regionally
maternal referral center for critically ill
pregnant women. Nanjing was assessed as
a high-risk region by the government on 26
January 2020, with 93 COVID-19 cases
confirmed. At this time, Nanjing was officially appointed as one of the four referring
hospitals for COVID-19-infected patients in
the city because of its nationally recognized
critical care medicine. Since the outbreak of
the pandemic COVID-19, three patients
have been diagnosed with COVID-19
infection in our hospital. Therefore, we
developed strategies to prevent hospitalassociated transmission in obstetric care.
In this study, we describe our experience
in how we prepared for the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent in-hospital infection
among pregnant women in a regional referring obstetric center. We also examined the
effects of COVID-19 on patient volume and
pregnancy outcomes in 2020. Gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational
hypertension (GHTN), which are two of
the most common complications of pregnancy, were further analyzed and compared
with the data in 2019. The occurrence of
depression and anxiety in pregnant women
was reported.

## Materials and methods

 Workflows for the outpatient clinic and telemedicine

With extensive use of fifth generation (5G)
technology and hospital webapps, we had
the ability to offer routine obstetric care
through our clinic and telemedicine services
for outpatients at the same level in 2020 as
that before the COVID-19 outbreak. For
clinic visitors, a strict pre-screening procedure was conducted (Figure 1).
Temperature measurement and epidemic
history were acquired upon arrival to hospital. Women with symptoms were triaged
to the Fever Clinic for further COVID-19
testing, including nasopharyngeal swabs.
Patients with a low risk (Class I according


to the National Health Commission of
China) were suggested to have a follow-up
in the community clinic. Close monitoring
or hospitalization was proposed when it
was evaluated as necessary.
For non-emergent patients (e.g., those
with a routine examination appointment),
an online clinic through telemedicine,
which was supported by our Information
Technology Center, was provided. Online
courses on education of blood glucose and
pressure monitoring were provided to pregnant women. These women were asked to
upload their data to the National Metabolic
Management Center, which was established
by Professor Zhang, Zhongda Hospital, to
create an integrated online and offline solution for diabetes, as well as for other metabolic diseases.[4] Obstetricians in our

department followed up and advised
patients via text messages or phone calls.
For those who required instant intervention, an on-site examination was required.
Medication, when necessary, was prescribed and delivered directly to the
patient’s home from the hospital through
our delivery service system.
The numbers of patients who visited the
outpatient clinic, Emergency Department,
and hospital in January and February of
2020 were collected and compared with
the data from the same period in 2019 to
evaluate the effects of these strategies on
controlling patient flow. Additionally, pregnancy outcomes were reviewed and compared, including GHTN and GDM.

## Hospitalization and surgeries

With regard to strategies, the obstetric floor
was modified as per the Guideline of the
Emergency Leadership Committee of
Zhongda Hospital at the initial stage of
the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020.
All of the patients’ rooms were adapted to
a single-patient unit. Additional ventilation
equipment was installed, and air was routinely monitored and assessed by thirdparty engineers with a centralized designed
Airborne Infection Isolation Room in the
hospital as a back-up unit as required.
Guidance for in-hospital patients was
adjusted to prevent imported COVID-19
infections (Figure 2). At the peak of the
epidemic, we suspended all elective operations. Admission for elective patients was
resumed recently when the situation was
ameliorated. Patients with no requirement
for surgery were accommodated in single
rooms for a nasopharyngeal swab test
upon admission. For semi-elective patients,
such as those with tumors, nasopharyngeal
swab tests were performed before surgery.
Positive results were verified by Provincial
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and COVID-19-confirmed patients were


immediately transferred to the Nanjing
Public Health Center. For emergencies
without verification of COVID-19, surgery
was performed in a negative pressure operating theater.[5] Participating surgeons and
medical staff were fully equipped with personal protective gear, including a cap, a
pair of goggles, an N95 mask, and shoe
covers. Disposable surgical gowns and
single-use gloves were also used. All medical waste was handled by following the
Clinical Waste Management Procedures.
The theater was sterilized after surgery.
Post-operation reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction was performed
to determine the presence of the virus.

## Newborn management

Because the maternal–fetal or maternal–
neonatal transmission pattern of COVID19 is unknown and the possibility of vertical
transmission cannot be excluded, precautions in every aspect were conducted for
delivery of pregnant women in whom
COVID-19 was unconfirmed. Therefore,
we opted for early, rather than delayed,
cord clamping after labor,[6] even though
the World Health Organization considers
that delayed clamping is highly unlikely to
increase the risk[7] (Figure 2). Samples of
amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and
nasopharyngeal swabs were tested.
Newborns were temporarily isolated from
their mothers, and breastfeeding was temporarily not allowed until the mother tested
negative for COVID-19.

## Psychological care and monitoring

While the effect of mental health on pregnancy outcomes was documented, maternal
psychological changes were also evaluated
and intervention was performed during the
epidemic.[8] At the top of the list, our
patients were promptly informed about
updated information of COVID-19 from

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; NS: nasopharyngeal; CDC: Center for Disease Control.


Provincial Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention every day through webapps.
Wearing masks, keeping social distances,
and reducing outdoor activities were
advised at the peak of the pandemic. At
the same time, immediate clarification
and discussion of the rumors and misleading messages were believed to be
important for eliminating the patients’ anxiety and stress. Furthermore, the outcome
of healthy and successful deliveries in our
department during the pandemic was
shared among our patients. Interestingly,
we found that ameliorating stress and
building the patients’ self-confidence were
useful. Moreover, the patients were encouraged to maintain a normal lifestyle,


participate in regular physical exercise,
obtain sufficient sleep, and maintain sufficient social contact over the phone or
through online channels. In case of those
suffering from high stress, psychological
consultation was available at the
Department of Psychology.
To evaluate the mental status of our
patients, a structured questionnaire was distributed before and during the outbreak
through online groups. The extent of
depression, anxiety, and fear was graded
as none, mild, moderate, and severe, and
the stress level was assessed using a 0 to
10 scoring scale. The self-evaluated results
were collected and the characteristics of
psychological performances were analyzed.


-----

## Data collection and analysis

The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee and Review Board of Zhongda
Hospital. The patients provided verbal consent for using their data. All data were collected from the Hospital Information
System and analyzed by Prism 8.3.1
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA). The t-test was used to analyze
changes in patient flow. The chi-square
test was applied to evaluate obstetric outcomes, and the paired t-test was used to
compare the psychological status before
and after our intervention. A p value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

## Results

 Hospital-acquired infection in mothers and neonates

There were 2458 outpatient visits, 316 emergent visits, 385 hospital admissions, and 271
deliveries in the first 2 months of 2020.
During this time, there was no in-hospital
infection or transmission in either mothers
or neonates. We encountered one woman


who reported a close contact history with
a patient with COVID-19. According to
our proactive protocols, emergency delivery
was conducted in a negative pressure operation theater. The neonate was temporarily
separated in an individual chamber until
samples of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord
blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs showed
that COVID-19 was not present. The
mother was also COVID-19-negative.

## Outpatient, emergency, and hospitalization numbers of patients during the epidemic

The weekly summary of patient volume in
each month was collected. Patient volume
from outpatients, the Emergency
Department, and hospitalization was significantly decreased in February 2020 after initiation of new hospital policies compared
with January 2020 (all p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
The new hospital policies significantly
decreased the volume of outpatient visits,
emergency room visits, and hospitalization
in February 2020 compared with February
2019 (all p < 0.05).

## Incidence of GHTN during the epidemic

Between January and February 2020, 271
pregnant women delivered 280 newborns in
our department compared with 311 pregnant
women and 317 newborns in 2019 (Table 1).
The rate of women who were nulliparous in
2020 was significantly lower than that in
2019 (p 0.009). The prevalence of GHTN
¼
was significantly higher in 2020 compared
with 2019 (p 0.002). The prevalence of
¼
GDM was not different between the two
time periods. Outcomes of pregnancy,
including neonatal outcomes, in January


and February in 2020 were similar to those
in January and February in 2019.

## Outcomes of patients with GDM and GHTN

There were no changes in maternal and
neonatal outcomes in women with GDM
between 2019 and 2020. There were no significant changes in maternal and neonatal
outcomes in women with GHTN between
2019 and 2020, except for the Apgar score
at 1 minute (p 0.003) (Table 2).

## Psychological intervention effectively relieves depression, fear, and stress in pregnant women

The reliability values of our questionnaires
were > 0.9 for pre- and post-intervention,
which indicated a high reflection of the
women’s psychological status. Among a
total of 126 patients, 38.1% of them had
depression, 28.57% of them had anxiety,


and 67.46% of them reported fear at the
initial stage in January 2020 preintervention (Table 3). Interventions via
online consultation and education resulted
in a significant decrease in pregnant
women’s depression (p 0.004) and fear

## Discussion

We introduced emergency responses to the
COVID-19 outbreak and established some
strategies. Our study showed the following
findings. (1) No hospital-acquired COVID19 infection in pregnant women was found
after new policies were applied in our hospital. (2) With a decrease in patients’ visits
with the help of telemedicine, pregnancy
outcomes were successful (3) Interestingly,
the number of patients with GHTN was
increased in January and February of
2020 compared with January and
February of 2019. (4) Psychological issues
were increased in 2020, and intervention
was required and helpful, especially during
this critical period.
Respiratory viruses, such as H5N1 viruses, are transmitted via maternal vertical
transmission,[9] while possible vertical transmission of human coronavirus was hypothesized in a pilot study.[10] However, there is
no evidence supporting vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus. During the
COVID-19 epidemic, two cases of confirmed neonatal infection were reported.[11]

One case was diagnosed at 17 days of life
and had a history of close contact with the
mother and babysitter who were COVID19-positive. However, another neonate was
separated temporarily from the infected
mother and tested positive for COVID-19
infection 36 hours following delivery This
prompted questions about whether the
virus could spread by vertical transmission.[12] Liu et al.[13] identified 13 pregnant
patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospitals outside of Wuhan and Chen
et al.[14] reported nine of these patients in a
hospital in Wuhan. Amniotic fluid, cord
blood, and neonatal throat swab samples
of these patients tested negative for
COVID-19. Although preliminary evidence
from these small groups of cases suggest


that COVID-19 cannot be vertically transmitted, further studies with large samples
are required to validate these findings.
Tests of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, as well as breastmilk
samples, of suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 should always be requested.
In a Wuhan Hospital, up to 29% of
hospital-associated infection of COVID-19
among medical professionals was documented.[15] Preventing hospital-acquired
infection is important during this critical
period. Our finding of no hospitalacquired infection suggested the effectiveness of our policies in volume control and
prevention of the virus. Furthermore, we
rearranged workflow for hospitalization
and surgery after preliminary COVID-19
screening. One principle that we followed
was isolated management of any suspected
patients and newborns with COVID-19.
One of our patients who had close contact
with a patient with COVID-19 and her newborn was successfully managed. Therefore,
we highly recommended interim strategies
in volume control, workflow rearrangement, and screening.
Despite the restriction, essential medical
services were still offered and guaranteed in
our department during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our physicians operated telemedical
platforms, individual operation and delivery rooms were fully prepared with ventilation system, and personal protective
equipment was available in case of an emergency. With the help of 5G wireless technology and communication, online clinics and
remote consultation have rapidly developed
in China. These techniques have provided
an important supplement to facilitate medical services during the COVID-19 epidemic. Non-emergency patients were
recommended to make an online appointment and consult with our obstetricians
with image transmission without compression, which facilitated the accuracy in diagnosis and advice as required. Psychological

evaluation and intervention were also provided by Apps on mobiles and questionnaires. These strategies definitely improved
care of the patients, at least through available physician–patient communication, and
their application in medical practice in such
a scenario might be helpful.
Generally, pregnancy outcomes, including maternal and neonatal outcomes,
during the 2020 epidemic were the same as
those in 2019. We found that the prevalence
of GHTN in the COVID-19 epidemic was
increased compared with that in the beginning of 2019. Indeed, hypertension and diabetes are the most common comorbidities
occurring in pregnant populations. The
association and effects of mental status
on GHTN and pre-eclampsia have
been reported in the literature.[16–18]

Psychological stress and depression during
this period may play a role in pregnant
women’s health. Therefore, psychological
monitoring and intervention in such a
public health situation are important.
We were aware of the elevation in concern among our patients. According to the
questionnaires, 38.10% of our patients suffered from mild to severe depression and
28.57% of them showed anxiety. These
rates are much higher than the reported
15% to 23% under non-epidemic situations.[19] Although, our study was a single
time-point comparison without further
follow-ups, the importance of mental wellbeing of pregnant women and their pregnancy outcomes have already been documented.[8] Therefore, online education and
consultation, including updates of
COVID-19 information to relieve stress
due to a lack of knowledge, advice, and
mentoring patients during a pandemic, as
well as professional psychological support,
should be emphasized in obstetric management. A long-term study specifically focusing on the effect of COVID-19 on mental
health among the maternal population is


urgently required for the public and healthcare providers.

## Conclusions

Our current management strategies were
effective in preventing hospital-acquired
infection of COVID-19 and ensuring the
safety of pregnant women physically and
mentally at the same time. Our findings
might provide useful information for preparing a hospital protocol in most similar
scenarios outside our medical center.
