ABSTRACT
Background: The COVID-19 outbreak caused persons to be reluctant to seek medical care due
to fear of contracting the infection.
Objectives: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on admission rates to the delivery room and the feto-maternal unit, and to assess the effect on the nature of presenting
obstetrical complaints to the emergency department.
Study Design: A retrospective cohort study in one medical center. The population was women

- 20 weeks pregnant who presented to the obstetrical emergency department with self-complaints during 29 days at the peak of the pandemic outbreak, and a matched group during the
exact period in the previous year. We compared between the groups: clinical, obstetrical, and
demographic data, including age, area of residence, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, high-risk pregnancy follow-up, the last 30 days admissions to the obstetrical emergency
department, gestational age, chief complaints, cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, admissions
to the delivery room or feto-maternal unit, time from admissions to the delivery room to birth,
if applicable, and acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at the emergency department.
Results: During the pandemic outbreak, 398 women met study inclusion criteria, compared to
544 women in the matched period of the previous year. During the COVID-19 period, women
visited the obstetrical emergency department at a more advanced mean gestational age
(37.6 ± 3.7 vs. 36.7 ± 4.6, p ¼ .001). Higher proportions of women in the COVID-19 cohort presented in active labor, defined by cervical dilation of at least 5 cm on admission to the labor
ward [37 (9.3%) vs 28 (5.1%), p ¼ .013)] and with premature rupture of membranes [82 (20.6%)
vs 60 (11.0%), p < .001)], and consequently with more admissions to the delivery room [198
(49.7%) vs 189 (34.7%), p < .001)]. We also recorded a significant increase in urgent obstetrical
events in the emergency department during the recorded COVID-19 pandemic [23 (5.8%) vs 12
(2.2%)), p ¼ .004]. However, the rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity did not change.
During the outbreak the proportion of visits during the night was higher than during the
matched period of the previous year: [138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)), p ¼ .008]. In a multivariate
logistic regression, the higher rates of admission to the delivery room during active labor and of
urgent events during the pandemic outbreak compared to the matched period in the previous
year remained statistically significant.
Conclusions: The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 caused a behavioral change among women
who presented to the obstetrical emergency department. This was characterized by delayed
arrival to the obstetrical emergency department and the delivery room, which led to a significant increase in urgent and acute interventions. The change in behavior did not affect the rates
of maternal and neonatal morbidity.

##### Introduction

The recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 and its
worldwide effects are yet to be seen. Effects on the
obstetrical population are unique in several ways.
First, due to physiological changes of normal pregnancy [1] and according to knowledge accumulated
from infections similar to the COVID-19 [2,3], pregnant


women affected by respiratory infection could be at
increased risk for pulmonic complications and the
need for intensive care admission. However, data
more specifically related to COVID-19 infection of
pregnant women reported outcomes similar to nonpregnant women [4,5]. Suggestions have recently
been published on how to prepare obstetrical units in
face of the threatening outbreak [6].

The pandemic outbreak created global awareness
alongside social isolation and a decrease in face-to-face
communication due to concern from infection. Social
media news also enhances these concerns among the
population and have played an important role in disseminating lockdown regulations. This has worried
medical practitioners and public health functionaries
regarding delays in the presentation to emergency
medical services that are consequent to fear of contracting COVID-19 infection. Repeated warnings have
been publicized that delays could result in increased
morbidity and mortality.
Pregnant women engage in multiple interactions
with health services during pregnancy and at delivery.
During the current healthcare crisis, social media is
being used to address pregnancy follow-up [7,8].
However, some of the communication remains
through the emergency department (ED) of the
obstetrical ward. During normal times, the ED serves
as a filter for multiple complaints. Some require further evaluation or supervision at the feto-maternal
unit (FMU), some indicate upcoming labor that justifies admission to the delivery room, and some are
reassured or referred to community-based medical services.
Therefore, our objective was to compare admissions
and outcome data before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, we evaluated differences between
the periods in presentation characteristics in the obstetrical ED, and in admission rates to the delivery room
(which could result in decreased time from admission to
delivery) and to the FMU. In addition, we compared
rates of acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at
the obstetrical ED.

##### Materials and methods

This was a retrospective comparative cross-sectional
study. The first patient with COVID-19 infection was
reported in Israel on February 27, 2020. General recommendations for social awareness by the government and ministry of health were initiated at the
beginning of March 2020. The relative quarantine
started in Israel on March 15, and recommendations
changed dynamically according to infection rates over
the period. Total lockdown lasted only 24 h, during
which the ministry of health, using social media,
emphasized to all patients who seek medical help not
to refrain from visiting emergency rooms. To evaluate
the effect of the recommendations on presentations
at the obstetrical ED, we included all pregnant women
who presented to the ED during the peak of the


pandemic outbreak and the dissipation of government
and media recommendations in Israel (March 15,
2020–April 12, 2020). We compared the data to a control group of pregnant women who presented to the
obstetrical ED on the same dates in the previous year
(March 15, 2019–April 12, 2019). Charts were reviewed
by 3 investigators (NK, NC, and WA). Any disagreement was judged and revised by a fourth investigator (YS).
Included in the study were all the women above
20 weeks of pregnancy who presented to the obstetrical
ED during the study period due to an obstetrical or
nonobstetrical self-complaint. We extracted demographic and obstetrical data. The demographic data
included age and area of residence (defined as outside
the city of Haifa, or in-city residence). Data on obstetrical history included: parity and previous cesarean deliveries. Data relating to the current pregnancy included:
admissions to the obstetrical ER during the last 30 days
gestational age, the chief complaint (categorized by
those most common: active labor, defined as uterine
contractions with cervical dilatation above 5 cm [9]; uterine contractions; premature rupture of membranes;
reduced fetal movements; vaginal bleeding; and other
nonspecific complaints); high-risk pregnancy follow-up;
cervical dilatation; and cervical effacement (only for
those who had an indication and were examined). Data
relating to the women’s behavior and their journeys in
the hospital included: timing of the visit to the obstetrical ED (classified as daytime: 7 am to 11 pm and night
time 11 pm-7 am); admission to the delivery room or
FMU; time from admission to the delivery room, and
from the delivery room to birth, if applicable; and. We
assessed acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at
the ED that could have resulted from a delay in turning
to medical services. These included the need for emergent delivery/cesarean section, presentation at the
second stage of labor or after delivery, eclampsia, intrauterine fetal death, and imminent preterm delivery. We
excluded all the women with missing data and those
referred by their physicians after incidental findings at
regular surveillance or who were invited for a follow-up
visit. Women who were referred by their physicians after
presenting with acute complaints such as contractions,
vaginal bleeding, and reduced fetal movements were
included in the study. Each case of acute obstetrical
complications diagnosed in the ED was further assessed
for the maternal or neonatal outcome (surgical complication, low Apgar score or PH, a post-surgical complication that required blood products, or re-operation). We
entered all the variables that were statistically significant
in the univariate analysis into a multivariate logistic

regression model. Accordingly, the following variables
were included: gestational age, parity, age residence in
city, previous cesarean section, high-risk follow-up, ED
visits in the last 30 days, night visits, admission to the
delivery room, active labor, and urgent events.

##### Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was performed by using IBM statistics (SPSS) vs. 24. The continuous variables were presented by means and standard deviations, or by
medians and interquartile ranges. The categorical variables were presented in percentages.
Comparison between the demographical and clinical
characteristics between the two time periods was analyzed using the Chi-square test for the categorical variables and the independent t-test or Mann–Whitney, as
appropriate, for the continuous variables.
Logistic regression was used to assess the association between the time periods and the outcome of
the ED admission, controlled for the different characteristics. The crude and the adjusted odds ratio, along
with 95% confidence interval are presented. The generalized estimating equation using the binominal distribution, controlling for repeated measures (few ED
admissions for the same woman) revealed very similar
results (data not shown). p < .05 was considered statistically significant.


##### Ethical approval

The study was approved on the 5.5.2020 by the institutional review board of Carmel Medical Center
(Protocol number 0070-20-CMC).

##### Results

Patient flow is presented in Figure 1.
We identified 558 women who presented to the
obstetrical ED during the selected study period of the
pandemic outbreak. From the corresponding, period 1
year before, we identified 721 women who presented
to the obstetrical ED. We excluded all the women with
missing data and those who presented to follow-up or
with nonself-complaints. The resultant cohort comprised 398 women in the pandemic outbreak period
and 544 women in the matched period one year
before. Table 1 compares basic maternal characteristics between the groups. The mean maternal age was
similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (31.4 ± 4.3
and 31.3 ± 4.7, respectively, p .68). The mean gesta¼
tional week at presentation was higher during the
COVID-19 period than in the comparable period in the
previous year (37.6 ± 3.7 vs 36.7 ± 4.6, p .001). A
¼
higher proportion of women who presented to the
obstetrical ED during the COVID-19 period were local
rather than regional residents, compared to the

control group (35 vs 27%, p .013). Women who pre¼
sented to the obstetrical ED during the COVID-19
period were less likely to have visited the ED in the
30 days prior to the study period (114 (28.6%) vs 191
(35.1%), p .036). All other maternal characteristics
¼
were balanced between the COVID-19 period and the
comparable period.

Table 2 compares the presentation causes and
admission characteristics of the women who arrived at
the obstetrics ED during the two periods. During the
COVID-19 period, active labor (p .013) and premature
¼
rupture of membranes (p < .001) were more common
presenting complaints; however, nonspecific complaints
were less common (45 (11.3%) vs 115 (21.1%), p < .001).
Cervical dilation or effacement on presentation did not
differ between the periods. During the COVID-19 period,
the proportion of hospital admissions was higher (257
(64.6%) vs 279 (51.3%), p < .001), as was the proportion
of admissions to the delivery room (198 (49.7%) vs 189


(34.7%), p < .001). Significant differences were not found
between the groups in the time from delivery room
admission to birth (5.7 ±5.3 vs 6.5 ±7.0; p .2016), rates
¼
of admission to the FMU, and the proportions of
women refusing hospitalization. During the COVID-19
period, the proportion of women presenting to the ED
with urgent obstetrical events was higher (5.8% vs
2.2%, p .004), and the rate of night visits was higher
¼
(138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)); 0.008).
Multivariate logistic regression showed hazard
ratios for admission to the delivery room, active labor,
and urgent events during the pandemic outbreak of
1.88 (p < .001), 1.83 (p .028), and 2.72 (p .007),

the obstetrical ED or the delivery room. In addition,
seven women were transferred to the operation room
for STAT cesarean section and five home deliveries
were recorded. In the matched period one year
before, we documented six women who presented in
the second stage of labor (fully dilated), four STAT
cesarean sections, and two home deliveries.
No significant differences were observed between
the periods regarding maternal outcomes, including
surgical and obstetrical intra and postpartum complications; nor neonatal outcomes including Apgar
scores, umbilical artery blood gases, neonatal intensive
care admissions, or respiratory complications (Table 3).

##### Discussion

This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study showed
less obstetrical ED visits during the COVID-19 period
than during the parallel period in the previous year.
However, the mean gestational age of the pregnant
women presenting to the ED was greater in the former than the latter. During the period of the pandemic outbreak, the proportion of women presenting
in active labor was greater; consequently, the number
of admissions to the delivery room was also greater
than in the matched period 1 year before. During the
COVID-19 period, more women presented to the
obstetrical ED with urgent events that necessitated
acute intervention; nonetheless, no significant impact
on maternal or neonatal outcomes was observed.
During the March–April COVID-19 outbreak in Israel,
recommendations to the population emphasized social
distancing; and at certain points also restricted quarantine was issued, including one day of total lockdown. However, throughout the period, outpatient
clinics continued their regular follow-ups, and no
restrictions were made on pregnant women regarding
emergent or follow-up visits; these concurred with
healthcare activity worldwide [10], As mentioned
above, governmental and healthcare authorities, using


the media, urged patients requiring medical treatment
not to refrain from coming to emergency care rooms.
This study showed a significant and expected
decrease in ED visits during the COVID-19 period,
compared to the previous year. Nonetheless, rates of
admissions to the obstetrics ED, and specifically to the
delivery room, were significantly increased. During the
COVID-19 period, women presented to the obstetrical
ED at a significantly advanced pregnancy week and
were more often in active labor or premature rupture
of membranes. Together, these factors led to a significant increase in the rate of admission to the delivery
room; however, cervical dilation, effacement, and time
to delivery remained unchanged. Although characteristics of the women from the two time periods were
comparable, in regard to parity, age, and a history of
a cesarean section, other factors that could be relevant to the time to delivery were not assessed, such
as fetal weight and the use of epidural analgesia.
We also observed a significant increase in the visits
of women who lived closer to the hospital, compared
to outside the city. This may reflect the impact of
social distancing recommendations. It may also be
seen in a positive way and represent resource optimization expressed by workload reduction in level �
hospitals coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates
of admission to the FMU were similar between the
COVID-19 and the control groups. This indicates that
the ongoing hospitalization rate for nonemergent reasons did not change. Rates of nonspecific complaints
(mostly not related to pregnancy) were decreased during the COVID-19 period; this suggests that women
avoided coming to the obstetrical ED unless they
expected being in active labor. Moreover, the fact that
the mean gestational age of the women presenting to
the ED was greater in the pandemic period can be
seen as a desired phenomenon especially in light of
the similar maternal and neonatal outcomes.
The decrease observed in visits to the obstetrical
ED due to fewer on-going follow-up is understandable


-----

in an outbreak situation. A significant decrease in the
rates of admission for acute coronary syndrome during
the pandemic outbreak was recently reported in
northern Italy [11]. This paralleled an increase in outpatient cardiac arrest [12], thus highlighting the danger of delaying treatment. It was recently reported
that a collateral effect of COVID-19 was a decrease of
approximately 39% in the number of patients who
received evaluations for acute stroke in the United
States [13]. We observed an increased rate of women
presenting with situations that justified urgent interventions; however, neonatal and maternal morbidity
did not increase.
Pregnant women are a unique population. On one
hand, most are healthy and young. On the other
hand, they are obligated to their health and wellbeing,
and to that of their fetus. The decrease in obstetrical
ED visits might reflect confusion regarding recommendations, fear from exposure to potential COVID-19 carriers, and therefore the individual risk/benefit
strategies. Not all recommendations in the media
regarding populations at risk were clear enough, and
it is natural that young healthy women would prefer
to restrain from ED areas during the pandemic outbreak. Importantly, the line between adhering to quarantine instructions including social distancing, and
between possible morbidity due to delay in presenting
to medical services, is very thin, and not always clear
to the general population. Despite its single institute
setting, our study might reflect the mentality of the
obstetrical population and its tendency, in the situation of a pandemic, to reduce visits to obstetrical ED.
Medical authorities might use these observations and
others, to understand a general referral pattern of
pregnant women, during a general crisis. This may
promote efficient use of resources such as to address
increased night visits and urgent events that could
require immediate intervention. On the other hand,
while the outbreak continues, authorities should consider ways to decrease potentially dangerous avoidance, anxiety, and unnecessary visits, by the use of
telemedicine, and by concentrating the treatment of
COVID-19 patients in specialized centers.
This is the first study to assess the impact of the
pandemic outbreak on emergent visits of pregnant
women to the obstetrical ED. Albeit, the retrospective
design is a limitation of the study, and the possibility
of selection bias arises due to the exclusion of women
with missing data. Moreover, our study is a single-center cross-sectional view. We do not have information
as to whether similar trends were observed in other
delivery rooms in the region, or in outpatient clinics.


Though unlikely, decreased rates observed at our center could have been compensated by increased rates
of visits in other obstetrical EDs or clinics. We also do
not have information on the rates of regional home
deliveries, which could contribute to the entire picture
of social distancing. Since total maternal and neonatal
outcomes were not objectives of this study, we did
not compare differences in maternal and neonatal
morbidity that were not related to acute events in the
obstetrical ED.
In a large single-institute cross-sectional study, we
showed that the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19
caused pregnant women to delay their arrival to the
obstetrical ED and delivery room. This led to a significant increase in urgent acute interventions, without
an increase in the rates of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity. Larger nationwide studies are needed.
In addition, a third period, after the COVID-19 pandemic, should eventually be compared, to verify if the
rates of visits to obstetrical ED will return to rates
known prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.
