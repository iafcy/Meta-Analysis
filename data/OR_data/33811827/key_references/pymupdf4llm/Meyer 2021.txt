# A marked decrease in preterm deliveries during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic


OBJECTIVE: Previous studies comparing the coronavirus
disease 2019 pandemic period with prepandemic periods
reported either no change or a decrease in extremely preterm birth (PTB) rates during the pandemic.[1][,][2] These
studies evaluated a limited number of potential PTB
confounders and a short pandemic period. We aimed to
determine the change in the PTB rate and neonatal
outcomes during the pandemic period compared with
that in the prepandemic periods by evaluating multiple
obstetrical characteristics during more than 3 pandemic
months.


STUDY DESIGN: We compared maternal, obstetrical, and
neonatal outcomes of singleton pregnancies at the Sheba
Medical Center, Israel, during 3 periods: from March 20,
2020 (date of implementation of governmental state of
lockdown), to June 27, 2020 (group 1); a parallel period
in 2019 (group 2); and parallel annual periods in
2011e2019 (group 3) (Table 1). We also compared
maternal and pregnancy characteristics during the
pandemic and corresponding prepandemic periods in
2019 between pregnancies complicated by PTB at <34
0/7 and �34 0/7 weeks’ gestation (Table 2). Multivariate

regression analysis was performed to study independent
factors associated with PTB. The institutional review
board approved this study (7068-20-SMC; March 30,
2020).

RESULTS: There were 2594 deliveries during the
pandemic period (group 1) and 2742 and 28,686 deliveries
in the prepandemic periods (groups 2 and 3, respectively).
Maternal and obstetrical characteristics did not differ between groups 1 and 2. Predelivery hemoglobin levels were
higher in the pandemic period. PTB rate at <34 0/7 weeks’
gestation was significantly lower in the pandemic period
than in the parallel period (group 2) (odds ratio [OR],
0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30e0.68; P<.001), as
was the rate of composite neonatal outcome (OR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.59e0.96; P¼.023). Age, body mass index, parity,
diabetes rates, and hematologic characteristics differed between groups 1 and 3 with significantly higher predelivery
h l bi l l i 1 PTB t t <34 0/7 k ’


gestation was lower in the pandemic period (OR, 0.60; 95%
CI, 0.41e0.85; P¼.004). On multivariate regression analysis,
childbirth during the pandemic period was independently
associated with a decreased risk of delivery at <34 0/7
weeks’ gestation (adjusted OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15e0.56;
P¼.001).

CONCLUSION: We observed more than 50% reduction in
the rate of PTB at <34 0/7 weeks’ gestation, possibly resulting
in improved neonatal outcomes.
Explanations for the lower PTB rate include reduced iatrogenic PTBs, avoidance of infections, or reduced stress level
related to the lockdown policy. Another suggested etiology is
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction, caused by relative
hypoxia resulting from wearing a face mask during the
pandemic period. HO-1 enhances hemoglobin production
and has been shown to reduce spontaneous PTB rates.[3][,][4]

However, the clinical significance of hemoglobin level diff i ti bl

Although a Danish study reported lower rates of PTB at
�27 6/7 weeks’ gestation during the pandemic, it evaluated
only 1 month of the pandemic period and was based on a
national registry.[1] Another study has found a trend (P¼.07)
toward higher PTB rates during the pandemic.[2] However, the
sample size was limited, and the prepandemic period comparison was not parallel, potentially introducing seasonal
effects.[5]

Further research is required to better understand the
pathogenesis underlying lower PTB rates during the
pandemic period.

# Enhanced recovery after cesarean: impact on postoperative opioid use and length of stay


OBJECTIVE: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) refers to
a comprehensive program to improve surgical outcomes.[1] ERAS
typically includespreoperativehealth optimization,preoperative
patient education, and perioperative interventions to reduce
pain, nausea, vomiting, infection, thromboembolism, and
overall morbidity. The ERAS Society recently published
guidelines for enhanced recovery after cesarean (ERAC).[2]

ERAC may reduce postoperative opioid use[3] and shorten
length of stay (LOS),[4] although these benefits are not always
obtained.[5] The purpose of this quality improvement project
was to develop, implement, and evaluate an ERAC program at
our level 3 community hospital. Several specific goals were
prospectively stated: to reduce postoperative opioid use, to
promote earlier removal of bladder catheters (a surrogate for
mobilization), and to shorten postoperative LOS.

STUDY DESIGN: Preexisting unit standards (applied
routinely for virtually all cesarean deliveries) included some
typical ERAS components, such as preoperative prophylactic
cefazolin, early postoperative feeding, and routine postoperative use of abdominal binder. A bundle of new


interventions was phased in from August 2018 to November
2018, as summarized in the Figure. Some interventions
became new unit standards: allowing clear liquids until 2
hours before surgery, povidone-iodine vaginal cleansing,
intraoperative underpatient warming, postoperative chewing
gum to prevent nausea, and a new anesthesia preoperative
order set that included routine famotidine and
acetaminophen plus optional antiemetics and gabapentin.
For patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, the dose of
intrathecal morphine was standardized to 150 mcg. A new
ERAC postoperative order set was used at individual
obstetricians’ discretion. It included prophylactic ketorolac,
ibuprofen, and acetaminophen given around the clock;
early removal of bladder catheter; and prophylactic
antiemetic medications. ERAC patients were offered an
optional 30-minute one-on-one teaching session 1 to 3 days
preoperatively and a carbohydrate-loading drink (50 g
maltodextrin and fructose in 300 cc) 3 to 4 hours
preoperatively (except patients with diabetes). The ERAC
order set was available for all cesarean deliveries whether or
not the patient had a scheduled procedure, preoperative
