Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions can adversely impact antenatal maternal
well-being and health behaviours.
Aim: To examine antenatal stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support, and health behaviours
between women pregnant before and during the pandemic in Ireland.
Methods: 210 pregnant women were recruited online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary
maternity hospital before the pandemic, and 235 women recruited online during the pandemic. Only
women resident in Ireland were included in this study. Women completed measures of stress, social
support, health-behaviours, and self-reported stress-reduction strategies. Differences in outcomes were
examined between women pregnant before and during the pandemic, and between Phase 2 and Phase 3
of the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions.
Findings: Women pregnant during the pandemic reported lower perceived social support, including
support from a significant other, friends and family, than women pregnant before the pandemic. There
were no significant differences in stress in health behaviours but women reported higher stress and less
physical activity during the pandemic. Women reported a range of comparable stress-reduction
strategies before and during the pandemic. No differences were observed between phases of pandemicrelated restrictions for any outcome.
Discussion: Our findings highlight negative impacts of the pandemic on social support, stress, and
physical activity, which can have implications for maternal and child health. Lack of differences between
restriction phases suggests on-going negative effects for antenatal well-being and behaviours.
Conclusion: Development of supports for pregnant women during the pandemic should include socialsupport and stress-reduction components.

High antenatal stress, low social support, and inappropriate
health behaviours can have negative impacts on maternal
and child health.

What is already known

COVID-19 and related restrictions are linked to adverse
mental health outcomes in general populations and can
increase antenatal anxiety and depression.

What this paper adds

This is the first examination of differences in pregnancyspecific stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support
and health behaviours before and during the pandemic. This
is also the first examination of the impact of phased
pandemic-related restrictions on antenatal outcomes.


1. Introduction

Antenatal stress is estimated to impact up to 30% of women
during pregnancy [1] and is associated with poor postpartum
mental and physical health [2,3], obstetric outcomes [4,5], and
child health and neurodevelopment [6,7]. Antenatal stress is also
associated with maternal perinatal health behaviours, which can
also have direct impact on child health and development [8].
Positive factors, such as social support, are argued to have a
protective effect however by buffering effects of stress on maternal
and child outcomes [9,10]. Antenatal stress can arise from multiple
psychological, physiological, social and socio-demographic factors

[11,12]. It can also result from experiencing significant and/or
stressful life events, such as bereavement [13], and natural
disasters [14], and is a likely outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Ireland, at the time of writing, the national cumulative incidence
of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 974.98 per 100,000 population; the
national cumulative incidence of confirmed deaths is 33.31 per
100,000 population [15].
There is already evidence that COVID-19, which was announced
as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March
2020 [16], has led to adverse mental health consequences in
general populations [17]. A recent review indicates that stress,
anxiety, depression, and disrupted sleep are common mental
health outcomes of COVID-19 [18]. Such outcomes may be due to
multiple COVID-19 related factors, including perceived risk of
infection, concerns about loved ones [19], and the implementation
of full and partial lockdowns globally that have restricted
movement and social interactions [20]. For pregnant women,
the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to changes in maternity care
access and procedures [21], which when coupled with broader
COVID-19 concerns, have the potential to significantly impact
pregnant women’s stress and behavioural responses [20]. There is
some emerging evidence supporting this, with reports that women
pregnant during the pandemic experience increased concern and
feelings of vulnerability [19], depression, and anxiety [22,23].
To date, there are limited data on antenatal stress, social
support, and health behaviours during the pandemic in comparison to before the pandemic; this is largely due to the rapid and
unexpected onset of the pandemic and associated societal changes.
One study of pregnant Canadian women reported increased
psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in a sample of
women pregnant during COIVD-19, in comparison to a pre-COVID19 sample [24]. Findings from a study conducted in China, also
indicate increased levels of depression and anxiety in pregnant
women following declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic [25].
As of yet, there is no evidence regarding the potential effects of
lockdown restrictions on antenatal maternal well-being. In the
Republic of Ireland (ROI), a COVID-19 ‘roadmap’ of four phases
including required and recommended public health guidelines and
restrictions was established [26]. For instance, during Phase Two
(June 8th to 28th) travel was permitted within one’s home county
or up to 20 km from home; up to 6 people from outside one’s
household could meet and retail could begin to re-open, with
physical distancing in place for both [26]. During Phase Three (from


June 29th 2020) crèches and childcare re-opened for essential
workers in a phased manner, playgrounds were re-opened, and
small social gatherings were allowed [26]. Full information on the
roadmap phases can be found at [https://www.gov.ie/.](https://www.gov.ie/) Each phase
was implemented simultaneously across the country on the same
date, allowing for an examination of the impact of varying levels of
restrictions on antenatal well-being.
This study had two main aims. The first was to examine
differences between antenatal stress, social support, health
behaviours, and stress-reduction strategies of Irish women
pregnant before the pandemic and during the pandemic. The
second aim was to examine differences in these outcomes at
different stages of pandemic-related restrictions.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Study design

A cross-sectional survey design, including closed and openended questions, was used with data collected before and during
the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a secondary data analysis
from a larger program of research on maternal stress, social
support and health behaviours [27].

2.2. Participants

Participants were pregnant women over the age of 18 years.
There were no exclusions based on gestational age or nationality
during recruitment for the larger study. Only participants selfreporting living in the ROI were included in the current study, to
facilitate comparison of antenatal well-being between two groups
situated in similar cultural, societal and antenatal care contexts
before and during the pandemic.

2.3. Procedure

Recruitment of women before the pandemic was conducted
online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary maternity
hospital in the South of ROI from May 2019 to February 2020.
Recruitment of women during the pandemic was conducted
online from June 16th to July 17th 2020. Online recruitment in
both time periods was conducted via pregnancy forums and
social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram). All
women recruited online were provided with a link to the online
survey, which they completed upon providing electronic
informed consent. Women recruited in-person prior to the
pandemic completed a hard-copy survey following provision of
informed consent.

2.4. Survey

Both surveys included questions on socio-demographic factors,
stress, social support, health behaviours and stress-reduction
strategies. The survey used prior to the pandemic included an
assessment of women’s knowledge about stress and health
behaviours; the survey used during the pandemic also assessed
mental and physical well-being, perceived quality of antenatal
care, and COVID-19 related stress, beliefs and behaviours. As this
study is interested in differences between outcomes before and
during the pandemic, only those measures included in both
surveys are outlined here. More details of the additional measures
can be found in our complimentary papers [27].

2.4.1. Sociodemographic data
Participants provided information on age, nationality, relationship status, gestation, parity and the number of other children.


-----

2.4.2. Antenatal stress
This was measured using the Revised Prenatal Distress
Questionnaire (NuPDQ [8,28]). The NuPDQ is a 17-item scale with
items measured on a 3-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “very
much”. Items assess the degree to which women experience
worries and concerns related to their pregnancy including, for
example: “about whether you might have an unhealthy baby”. The
reliability coefficient of the NuPDQ in the overall sample was
α = 0.79.

2.4.3. Social support
Perceived support was measured using the Multidimensional
Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS [29]). This is a 12-item
scale of perceived support from family, friends and loved ones,
with items measured on a 7-point scale from “very strongly
disagree” to “very strongly agree”. The reliability coefficient of the
MSPSS in the overall sample was α = 0.96; reliability of the
significant other subscale was α = 0.98, the friends subscale was
α = 0.96, and the family subscale was α = 0.95.

2.4.4. Health behaviours
Behaviours were measured using the Prenatal Health Behaviours Scale (PHBS [8]), which assesses the frequency of women’s
engagement in behaviours related to nutrition, physical activity,
sleep, vitamins, smoking and alcohol in the last two weeks. Items
are measured on a 5-point scale ranging from “never” to “very
often”. A composite ‘healthy eating’ outcome was created by
combining data on frequency of consumption of dairy, fluids, fibre,
balanced meals and eating to satiety. The reliability coefficient of
this outcome was α = 0.73. A composite ‘unhealthy eating’ outcome
was created by combining data on frequency of consumption of
fatty or oily foods, snack foods, and eating beyond the point of
satiety. The reliability coefficient of this outcome was α = 0.36 in
the overall sample, which was too low for inclusion in further
analyses. Single items were used to examine frequency of smoking,
alcohol consumption, physical activity, taking vitamins, and sleep.

2.4.5. Stress-reduction strategies
Women responded to a single open-ended question that asked
“When you feel stressed what do you like to do to reduce your
stress levels?”

2.5. Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Version 26.
Participant demographic factors, levels of stress and social support,
and frequency of health behaviours were descriptively summarised. Independent samples t-tests and Chi square tests of
independence were used to examine differences between women
who completed the survey before and during the pandemic on
continuous and categorical socio-demographic variables respectively. Assumption testing indicated that the data were not suited
to multivariate analysis of variance. Independent samples t-tests
were used to examine differences in stress, perceived social
support and frequency of healthy eating between women who
were pregnant before the pandemic and those pregnant during the
pandemic, and between women who completed the survey in
Phase Two and Phase Three of pandemic restrictions in the ROI.
Chi-square tests of independence were used to examine differences in frequency of exercise, taking vitamins, and sleep. Due to
the number of analyses conducted a Bonferroni correction was
applied with a more stringent significance value of p < 0.01.
Analysis of the strategies for coping with stress was conducted
using a quantitative content analysis to provide a structured way of
analysing participants open-ended response. A list of individual
strategies was initially identified for each time period, from which


a list of categories was then derived, with individual strategies
grouped in accordance to comparability. Differences in stressreduction strategies were not examined by lockdown phases due to
low numbers of some reported strategies. Differences in strategies
before and during the pandemic are presented narratively and in
table form.

2.6. Ethical approval

All procedures were approved by the University College Cork
School of Public Health Research Ethics Committee and the
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching
Hospitals.

3. Results

The study included 445 pregnant women between 19 and 46
years (M = 33.78, SD = 4.27) and between 4 and 41 weeks pregnant
(M = 26.99, SD = 9.34). A total of 210 women living in the ROI
completed the survey before the pandemic; 235 women living in
the ROI completed the survey during the pandemic. Details of the
two groups are presented in Table 1. There were no significant
differences for age, gestational weeks, relationship status or
number of children women had, between women pregnant before
or during COVID-19. Due to the low number of women reporting
any smoking or alcohol consumption these variables were not
included in further analyses.

3.1. Differences between women pregnant before and during the
pandemic

Results of independent-samples t-tests demonstrated no
difference for levels of antenatal stress (t (425) = �2.19,
p = 0.028) though women pregnant during the pandemic had
higher levels than those pregnant before the pandemic (mean
difference = �1.19 (95% CI: �2.27 to �1.3), eta squared = 0.01). A
difference was observed for total perceived social support (t
(420.49) = 3.86, p < 0.005) with lower social support reported by
women during the pandemic; though the mean difference of 5.88
(95% CI: 2.89–8.88) was small (eta squared = 0.03). A difference was
observed for perceived social support from a significant other, with
lower support reported during the pandemic t (420.67) = 2.77,
p = 0.006); the mean difference,1.44 (95% CI: 0.42–2.47), was small
(eta squared = 0.02). Social support from friends demonstrated a
significant difference, with lower support reported during the
pandemic (t (433.65) = 4.44, p < 0.005), with a moderate mean
difference of 2.71 (95% CI 1.51–3.91; eta squared = 0.05). A
difference was also observed for social support from family, with
lower support also reported during the pandemic (t (429.39) = 3.01,
p = 0.003); the mean difference, 1.74 (95% CI 0.61–2.88), was small
(eta squared = 0.02). There was no difference for healthy eating
before or during the pandemic (t (433) = 0.81, p = 0.42). Chi-square
tests for independence indicated no differences between women’s
frequency of exercise, taking vitamins or sleep before or during the
pandemic (see Table 1).
In terms of pregnant women’s stress reduction, 82.5% (n = 208)
of women reported 49 individual stress-reduction strategies
before the pandemic; 89.8% (n = 211) reported 47 individual
stress-reduction strategies during the pandemic. As outlined in
Table 2 the most commonly reported strategies were connecting
with others and exercise. The proportion of women connecting
with others remained similar in both time periods. Women were
less likely to report using exercise (40.8%; n = 86 vs 56.3%; n = 117),
particularly walking, and engaging with a form of entertainment
(11.8%; n = 25 vs 22.6%; n = 47) during the pandemic (see Table 2).

a Alcohol and smoking were not included in further analyses due to the low number of participants reporting engaging in these behaviours.


3.2. Differences based on phase of pandemic-related restrictions

During Phase Two (which included phased re-opening of retail
and eased restrictions on travel), 138 women completed the
survey; 97 women completed the survey during Phase Three of
pandemic-related restrictions (which included opening of crèches
and childcare, and easing of restrictions on small social gatherings). Independent samples t-tests used to examine differences in
continuous variables by phase of lockdown restrictions indicated
no differences between pregnant women who completed the
survey during Phase Two and Phase Three for antenatal stress, total
perceived social support, perceived support from a significant
other, friends or family, or frequency of healthy eating. Chi square
tests for independence, used to examine differences in categorical
variables, also indicated no differences in frequency of exercise,
taking vitamins, or sleep. See Table 3.


4. Discussion

This study examined differences between women pregnant
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for levels of stress,
social support, frequency of health behaviours and stress-reduction strategies. To our knowledge this is the first examination of
potential differences in these variables during the pandemic; it is
also the first examination of the potential role of pandemic-related
restrictions on outcomes during pregnancy. Our findings indicate
significant decreases in pregnant women’s perceived social
support from all sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. No
significant differences were observed for antenatal stress or health
behaviours, though women pregnant during the pandemic did
report higher levels of stress than women pregnant before the
pandemic. There were also no differences in outcomes based on
the phase of pandemic-related restrictions.

a Alcohol and smoking were not included in further analyses due to the low number of participants reporting engaging in these behaviours.


Though perceived antenatal social support has not been widely
reported to date, one study did find that nearly all participants in a
Canadian survey reported feeling more alone during the pandemic
than usual [23]. Our finding that women reported reduced
perceived social support from all sources is in line with this
previous finding and may relate to pandemic-related social and
physical restrictions. Similarly, the finding that women experienced reduced social support from a significant other is similar to a
report that some women experience a strain on their relationship
with a significant other during the pandemic [23]. Social support
overall, and from specific sources including family, friends and
significant others, is recognised as an important protective and
resiliency factor in pregnancy and has important implications for
perinatal mental health and obstetric outcomes [30]. Our finding


that women were as likely to report connecting with others as a
stress-reduction strategy during the pandemic further supports
the importance of social interactions during this period. As such,
reductions in perceived social support during the pandemic may
have adverse maternal and child health outcomes.
The absence of a significant reduction in antenatal stress in the
current study differs from previous findings of high levels of
antenatal distress during the pandemic [19,22,24,31,32]. Previous
examinations have tended to focus on depression and anxiety as
indicators of distress [22,24,31,32], which may explain the
difference with our finding. Further, examinations have mostly
examined general anxiety [22,24] or anxiety related to COVID-19

[19,31]. Pregnancy-specific stress differs in that it is specifically
focused on the pregnancy, the baby, and antenatal care. However,


-----

one study reporting high levels of health anxiety among women
pregnant during the pandemic did include worries about the self
and the baby. The period of the pandemic examined may also
explain differences in findings. Data collection during the
pandemic in our study began in June 2020, at a point when some
restrictions (e.g., related to travel) were being eased. Earlier stages
of lockdown, as were examined in previous studies

[19,22,24,31,32], may have resulted in higher levels of distress
due to higher perceived threat and uncertainty of COVID-19.
Similarly, differences between the first and subsequent phases may
have resulted in larger differences in outcomes than were observed
in this study.
Our finding that phase of lockdown did not influence any
outcomes in the current study suggests that phase of pandemicrelated restrictions may not impact antenatal psychological wellbeing or health behaviours however. This should be considered in
relation to development and implementation of mental health
strategies and support for pregnant women because it cannot be
assumed that easing of restrictions will result in improved wellbeing. Furthermore, as with other large-scale stressors such as
natural disasters [33], the effects of the pandemic on maternal
mental health and associated effects on infant health and
development [34] are likely to be long-lasting; highlighting the
need for future support. It should also be noted that restrictions
applied to maternity services remained during both Phase Two and
Three, with limitations on access to antenatal care and restrictions
around partner access. Thus, this may also explain a lack of
differences observed in our study.
This is the first study to examine potential changes in pregnant
women’s engagement in health promoting and protective behaviours resulting from the pandemic. We found no significant
differences in the frequency with which women engaged in health
behaviours during the pandemic. However participants openended responses in relation to their stress-reduction activities did
indicate a reduction in exercise, and in particular walking. This is
similar to a recent finding that 64% of survey women reported
reduced physical activity with the onset of pandemic-related
isolation measures [35]. Overall we found that the health
behaviours reported by Irish women during the pandemic are
good, with most women reporting frequent healthy eating,
engaging in some exercise and taking vitamins. In addition, very
few women report alcohol consumption or smoking cigarettes. As
health behaviours including diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol
consumption are associated with obstetric and child health
outcomes [8,36–38], this is a promising finding that suggests
women did not alter their behaviours in the context of the
pandemic.
Examination of differences between women before and during
the pandemic was limited to those variables that were examined in
the pre-pandemic group. As such, additional variables such as
satisfaction with maternity care and perceived health could not be
examined. A further limitation of the study is that we did not ask
women in the current study if they had or suspected they had
COVID-19. The two groups examined in the current study also
represent distinct groups of women, rather than being part of a
longitudinal cohort. However, our approach to examining only
women living in the ROI who are exposed to similar social contexts
and maternity care services served to enhance comparability of the
two groups. The majority of participants in the study were
multiparous women who were either married or in a relationship
and so our findings may not be generalisable beyond this group.
This is of particular relevance in relation to COVID-19 related
inequalities, whereby certain groups such as obese pregnant
women and minority groups, who are more likely to experience
higher antenatal stress [11], also represent a higher proportion of


COVID-19 cases [39]; this represents increased risk for certain
groups, which could not be examined in the current study.

5. Conclusion

The findings of this study demonstrate that pregnant women
experienced significantly lower perceived social support from all
sources during the pandemic, and a non-significant increase in
stress. Taken together these findings highlight negative impacts of
the pandemic on two important psychological constructs related
to maternal and child health [30]. Development of supports and
intervention strategies for pregnant women during the on-going
pandemic, and future similar large-scale stressors, should include a
focus on both stress-reduction and promotion of social support.
Further, many of the stress-reduction strategies women engaged
during the pandemic are similar to those engaged in prior to the
pandemic, suggesting that women are already familiar with and
engage in potentially useful strategies to protect their mental
health. The finding that the health behaviours of pregnant women,
which are linked to improved maternal and child outcomes [8],
were not impaired during the pandemic is a further positive
finding of the current study.
