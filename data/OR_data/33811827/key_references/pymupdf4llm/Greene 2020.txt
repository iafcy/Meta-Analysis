## Impact of labor and delivery unit policy modifications on maternal and neonatal outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic

Naomi H. Greene, PhD; Sarah J. Kilpatrick, MD, PhD; Melissa S. Wong, MD, MHDS; John A. Ozimek, DO; Mariam Naqvi, MD


BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019
pandemic, hospitals nationwide have implemented modifications to labor
and delivery unit practices designed to protect delivering patients and
healthcare providers from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Beginning in March 2020, our hospital instituted
labor, and delivery unit modifications targeting visitor policy, use of personal protective equipment, designation of rooms for triage and delivery of
persons suspected or infected with coronavirus disease 2019, delivery
management, and newborn care. Little is known about the ramifications of
these modifications in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether labor
and delivery unit policy modifications we made during the coronavirus
disease 2019 pandemic were associated with differences in outcomes for
mothers and newborns.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all
deliveries occurring in our hospital between January 1, 2020, and
April 30, 2020. Patients who delivered in January and February 2020
before labor and delivery unit modifications were instituted were
designated as the preimplementation group, and those who delivered
in March and April 2020 were designated as the postimplementation
group. Maternal and neonatal outcomes between the pre- and
postimplementation groups were compared. Differences between the
2 groups were then compared with the same time period in 2019 and
2018 to assess whether any apparent differences were unique to the
pandemic year. We hypothesized that maternal and newborn lengths
of stay would be shorter in the postimplementation group. Statistical
analysis methods included Student’s t-tests and Wilcoxon tests for
continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables.


RESULTS: Postpartum length of stay was significantly shorter after
implementation of labor unit changes related to coronavirus disease 2019.
A postpartum stay of 1 night after vaginal delivery occurred in 48.5% of
patients in the postimplementation group compared with 24.9% of the
preimplementation group (P<.0001). Postoperative length of stay after
cesarean delivery of 2 nights occurred in 40.9% of patients in the
�
postimplementation group compared with 11.8% in the preimplementation group (P<.0001). Similarly, after vaginal delivery, 49.0%
of newborns were discharged home after 1 night in the postimplementation group compared with 24.9% in the preimplementation
group (P<.0001). After cesarean delivery, 42.5% of newborns were
discharged after 2 nights in the postimplementation group compared
�
with 12.5% in the preimplementation group (P<.0001). Slight differences
in the proportions of earlier discharge between mothers and newborns
were due to multiple gestations. There were no differences in cesarean
delivery rate, induction of labor, or adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes
between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Labor and delivery unit policy modifications to protect
pregnant patients and healthcare providers from coronavirus disease
2019 indicate that maternal and newborn length of stay in the hospital
were significantly shorter after delivery without increases in the rate of
adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. In the absence of long-term
adverse outcomes occurring after discharge that are tied to earlier
release, our study results may support a review of our discharge protocols
once the pandemic subsides to move toward safely shortening maternal
and newborn lengths of stay.

##### Introduction
By March 2020, coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was
spreading widely in many regions in the
United States. Against the backdrop of
rapidly changing recommendations

from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), hospital leadership in regions expecting a surge of
COVID-19 cases implemented changes
to accomplish the following 2 major
goals: to ensure adequate capacity to
safely care for infected patients and to
prevent unaffected patients, families,
and hospital staff from contracting the
virus.[1][e][5]

California issued a statewide stay-athome order on March 19, 2020, and
shortly after, the Society for MaternalFetal Medicine and Society for Obstetric Anesthesiology and Perinatology


issued guidelines on safe delivery of
obstetrical care during the COVID-19
pandemic.[6] In light of these recommendations, a multidisciplinary team of
obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine
specialists, pediatricians, anesthesiologists, infectious disease specialists, and
nursing leadership was assembled at our
institution to create guidelines for
maternal and neonatal care during this
time period. These guidelines addressed
the use of personal protective equipment, designation of rooms for triage
and delivery of persons suspected or
infected with COVID-19, delivery
management, and newborn care. Patients without COVID 19 were


-----

performed under the supervision of an
attending physician. The labor and delivery unit policy modifications made in
response to COVID-19 at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center were implemented
beginning March 2020 (Box).
To assess the impact of these changes
on delivery outcomes, we conducted a
retrospective cohort study of all deliveries occurring in our hospital between January 1, 2020 and April 30,
2020. We divided the cohort into the
following 2 groups: patients who delivered before implementation of these
guidelines in January and February 2020
(preimplementation) and patients who
delivered during or after their implantation in March and April 2020
(postimplementation).
Maternal demographic information,
delivery information, and maternal and
neonatal outcome data were extracted
from the medical record and compared
between the preimplementation and the
postimplementation groups. Obstetrical
outcomes included time to delivery, delivery analgesia, mode of delivery, indications for cesarean delivery, and
compliance with the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
(ACOG/SMFM) Guidelines for when
cesarean delivery was performed for arrest of labor.[7] The ACOG/SMFM


permitted 1 support person during delivery and no visitors postpartum. This
policy was modified on April 20, 2020, to
allow a single support person during the
postpartum stay.
The objective of this study was to
compare maternal and neonatal outcomes before and after the implementation of stay-at-home orders and
our institutional COVID-19 obstetrical
and neonatal policy changes in the labor
and delivery unit. Given that efforts to
protect staff and patients from infection
with SARS-CoV-2 would aim to reduce
face-to-face exposure time, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 labor and


delivery modifications directed at
reducing the in-hospital transmission
rate would be associated with shorter
lengths of stay for mothers and newborns compared with mothers and
newborns delivered before the modifications were made.

##### Materials and Methods
This study was performed at a tertiary
care, academic hospital with approximately 6200 deliveries a year staffed by
130 academic and community physicians. Certified nurse midwives, residents, and fellows are involved with
intrapartum care, and all deliveries are


COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.

Guidelines provide definitions for arrest
of labor in the first and second stages of
labor, and compliance with these
guidelines was determined by independent review of each nulliparous term
singleton vertex (NTSV) cesarean delivery record by a trained departmental
quality assessor. These data are routinely
gathered as part of our institutional
quality improvement program aimed at
safely lowering the NTSV cesarean rate.
Postpartum outcomes included length of
stay, opioid use, and exclusive breastfeeding on discharge. Adverse outcomes
included markers of severe maternal
morbidity (defined as transfer to an
intensive care unit or transfusion of 4 or
more units of packed red cells), rate of
transfusion of any number of units of
packed red cells, and readmission within
30 days. Neonatal outcomes included
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
d i i A t l


hypoglycemia, abnormal cord blood gas
(pH <7 or base excess <�13), unexpected term newborn complications
(The Joint Commission Perinatal Core
Measure 06),[8] neonatal length of stay,
and readmission within 28 days.
To account for yearly variation in our
outcomes, we compared the identified
differences between pre- and postimplementation outcomes during the
pandemic year to the same time period
(JanuaryeApril) in 2018 and 2019. To
identify potential differences in postpartum or postoperative lengths of stay
owing to changes to our hospital visitation
policy on April 20, 2020, we compared the
lengths of stay for deliveries in the postimplementation period between March 1,
2020, and April 19, 2020, to the same from
April 20, 2020, through April 30, 2020, the
end of our study period.
Statistical methods included the use of
St d t’ t t t Wil t t f


continuous variables and chi-square or
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate. To correct for
multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni
correction was applied (corrected significance probability value of <0.0016).
Statistical analysis was performed using
SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC). This study
was approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board (Study 00000768,
approved June 15, 2020).
We included all patients in the 2020
study period, regardless of laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 status. We
accounted for potential differences in
outcomes attributable to infection status
rather than labor and delivery unit practice modifications by rerunning analyses
without laboratory test-positive cases.

population in the preimplementation and


postimplementation time periods are
described in Table 1. There were no demographic differences between the 2
groups.
Postpartum length of stay was significantly shorter in the postimplementation


group. A postpartum stay of 1 night after

maternal lengths of stay between
JanuaryeFebruary and MarcheApril in
2018 and 2019, regardless of the mode of

The first SARS-CoV-2 tests in our
hospital were reported on March 21,
2020. There were 2 laboratory testpositive cases during the study period.
When excluding these 2 cases from the
length of stay analyses, the reduction in
postpartum and postoperative maternal
stays and newborn lengths of stay
after vaginal and cesarean deliveries
remained significant (P<.0001 for all
comparisons).

##### Structured Discussion or Comment Principal findings
Similar to many hospitals nationwide,
our labor unit instituted internal practice
modifications intended to protect patients and healthcare providers from
COVID-19 in March 2020. In this study,
we found that maternal and newborn
lengths of stay were significantly shorter
after implementation of these changes to


delivery of �2 nights occurred in 40.9% of
patients in the postimplementation group
compared with 11.8% in the preimplementation group (P<.0001)
(Table 2). The proportion of patients
transfused �1 unit of packed red
blood cells was higher in the postimplementation group than in the preimplementation group (3.3% vs 1.6%),
but this was no longer statistically different
after correction for multiple comparisons.
There were no other differences in
obstetrical, maternal, or adverse outcomes
between the preimplementation and
postimplementation groups (Table 2).
Newborn length of stay was also
significantly shorter after implementation
of practice modifications compared with
the preimplementation group. After
vaginal delivery, 49.0% of newborns were
discharged home after 1 night in the
postimplementation group compared
with 24.9% in the preimplementation
group (P<.0001, Table 3). After cesarean
delivery, 42.5% of newborns were discharged after �2 nights in the postimplementation group compared with
12 5% in the preimplementation group


(P<.0001). There were no differences in
NICU admissions, abnormal cord blood
gas, neonatal hypoglycemia, unexpected
newborn complications, and newborn
readmission within 28 days between the 2
time periods.
When comparing postpartum length
of stay after easing of visitor restrictions
on April 20, 2020, there were no differences in maternal postpartum length of
stay after vaginal delivery (1.6 vs 1.5
nights; P¼.25) or after cesarean delivery
(2.8 vs 2.7 nights; P¼.6). Newborn
length of stay after cesarean delivery was
shorter after easing the visitor policy (4.4
vs 3.2 nights; P¼.02), and there was no
difference after vaginal delivery (1.9 vs
2.8 nights; P¼.48).
To adjust for month-to-month variation in length of postpartum hospitalization for the mother and the newborn,
we compared the proportion of patients
who were discharged home after 1 night
following vaginal delivery and after �2
nights following cesarean delivery in the
pandemic year to the patients who
delivered during the same time period in
2018 and 2019 (Figure) There were no

the labor unit, and that shorter lengths of
stay in March and April were not seen in
previous years when compared with
January and February in the same year.
We did not find an increase in adverse
maternal or neonatal outcomes despite
the shorter postpartum lengths of stay
for mother and newborn.

##### Clinical and research implications
As hospitals nationwide work to
effectively protect patients and
healthcare providers from COVID-19,
it remains important to determine
whether labor and delivery practice
modifications designed to reduce
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are
associated with adverse maternal and
neonatal outcomes. A recent comprehensive summary of international
obstetrical practice modifications


indicates that professional societies in
USA, Italy, and Spain are encouraging
early postdelivery discharge.[9] In our
hospital, early discharge was not
among the practice modifications we
made. Nevertheless, our study results
revealed discharge after 1 or 2 nights for
vaginal and cesarean deliveries, respectively, and this allowed us to study potential short-term adverse outcomes that
could be associated with the shorter
lengths of stay. Our labor and delivery
practice modifications aimed at reducing
COVID-19 transmission to patients and
staff were not associated with time from
admission to delivery, altered rates of
induction of labor, delivery analgesia,
cesarean delivery, vaginal birth after cesarean, operative delivery, compliance
with ACOG/SMFM guidelines for
reducing cesarean delivery because of


dystocia, postpartum analgesia, or
exclusive breastfeeding at discharge. The
policy modifications in the labor and
delivery unit in our institution during
the COVID-19 epidemic were associated
with a significant reduction in postpartum and neonatal length of stay
without an increase in the rate of
maternal and neonatal complications.
The reasons for this reduction in
postpartum length of stay are likely
multifactorial but may be attributed
partially to changes to our visitor policy
enacted in early March, which allowed
only a single support person during labor and delivery and prohibited any
postpartum visitors. Although this policy was later liberalized on April 20,
2020, to allow for 1 healthy visitor on the
postpartum unit, it is likely that the
initial restrictions may have motivated

Short length of stay was defined as discharge after 1 night after vaginal delivery (postpartum day 1) and discharge after 2 nights after cesarean delivery
�
(postoperative day 1 or 2). There was a significant increase in short lengths of stay for both mothers and neonates after both types of delivery with
implementation of the guidelines in the era of COVID-19 (year 2020, all P values <.0001). There were no significant differences in neonatal or maternal
lengths of stay between January to February and March to April in 2018 and 2019, regardless of mode of delivery (P values, .35e.93).

patients and providers toward an earlier
discharge. This study suggests that it is
reassuring that these early discharges
were not associated with an increased
rate of readmissions or postpartum
medical complications, although future
studies are needed to determine what
long-term effects the shorter stay might
have on other outcomes such as
maternal mental health, bonding, and
ongoing breastfeeding.

##### Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study was the timely
evaluation of the impact of rapidly
implemented labor unit alterations
focused on reducing COVID-19 transmission on mothers and their infants at a
single institution. As a large-volume


labor and delivery unit, we have the
capability to assess outcomes on a scale
that would be challenging with fewer
numbers of total deliveries.
This study is not without limitation. It
is possible that this study was underpowered to assess differences in less
common but severe adverse outcomes,
including severe maternal morbidity or
stillbirth. Our patient population may
also not be generalizable to patients
admitted to other labor and delivery
units.
It is plausible that the reduction in
postpartum hospital stay was a random
event, owing to normal month-tomonth variation. However, the marked
reduction in length of stay seen in 2020
compared with no such change in the


same months of 2018 and 2019 lends
support for the association between
shorter lengths of stay and either
COVID-19 practice modifications or
unmeasurable factors related to the
pandemic as a whole, including the
statewide lockdown.

##### Conclusions
Labor and delivery unit policy modifications implemented to protect pregnant patients and healthcare providers
from COVID-19 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles indicate that
maternal and newborn length of stay in
the hospital were significantly shorter
after delivery without increases in the
rate of adverse maternal or neonatal
outcomes. n
