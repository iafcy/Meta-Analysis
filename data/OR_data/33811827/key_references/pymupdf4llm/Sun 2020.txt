**K E Y W O R D S :  COVID‐19; Delays; Obstetric delivery; SARS‐CoV‐2**


Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 quarantine in São Paulo, Brazil,

our institution has noticed that some pregnant women, particularly

those that were recommended elective cesarean sections for reasons

such as repeated cesarean deliveries or abnormal fetal presentation,

were admitted to São Paulo Hospital in the second stage of labor and

then went on to have vaginal deliveries (Table 1). Therefore, we con‐

ducted a comparative cohort study between March 11 and June 11,

2019 and March 11 and June 11, 2020 in order to evaluate whether

the quarantine period led to pregnant women with spontaneous

labor arriving at our hospital in a more advanced phase of labor. The

Institutional Review Board of UNIFESP provided ethical approval for

this study (No. 33734620.7.0000.5505).

In 2019 there were 143 deliveries during the period of study,

41 of which were initiated by spontaneous labor. By contrast, during

the same period in 2020, there were 122 deliveries and 40 patients

arrived at the hospital in labor. Delivery within 3 hours of hospital

admission occurred in 26.8% (11/41) and 40% (16/40) of cases in

2019 and 2020, respectively. Gestational age was over 37 weeks

in 81% of patients in both years. Paradoxically, in 2020 there were

more nulliparous women (9% versus 12.5%), fewer women with two

or more previous births (54.5% vs 43.7%), and a lower percentage

of newborns weighing less than 2500 g (18.1% vs 12.5%). Most of

the patients had received prenatal care at the institution (54.5% vs

75%). One potential explanation for the increase in deliveries within

3 hours in 2020 might be related to the reduction of public trans‐

port during the pandemic, given that most of the patients reside far

from the hospital (median 14 km). Moreover, patients are reluctant to

attend treatment at hospitals due to fear of exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2.


This phenomenon appears to occur worldwide—it has been reported

that delayed care in 12 children in Italy resulted in four deaths and

delayed care among patients with ST‐segment‐elevation myocardial

infarction.[1–3] Regarding pregnancy, it has been reported that one

third of pregnant women started working from home due to fear of

being infected.[4]

Based on this, our preliminary perception is that our population

also feared COVID‐19 infection. As a result, these patients under‐

went initial labor at home until their concerns about exposure were

outweighed by their concerns regarding the wellbeing of their babies.

Although our results are limited due to the small sample size, the fact

that pregnant women arrived at the hospital in advanced stages of

labor with no adverse maternal and neonatal outcome leads us to

think that patients should be encouraged to go to the hospital at the

active stage of labor under a shared decision model.

The COVID‐19 pandemic is challenging health systems across the

world. The potential for devastating consequences in resource‐lim‐

ited low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) is just beginning to be

understood.[1] In the majority of LMICs, maternal healthcare is focused

outside a health center through the use of community health work‐

ers and birth attendants. These essential workers provide the majority

of maternal health care around the globe and are ill prepared for the

highly transmissible nature of this novel virus and its consequences for

their communities.[2] Little attention has been focused on their training

and responsiveness during this pandemic.

Since the emergence of COVID‐19, the Guatemala Ministry of

Health (MOH) has reported a decreased uptake of antenatal care

(ANC) at clinics and health posts in Sololá, a mainly indigenous region

in the Western Highlands of Guatemala, due to both fear of interper‐

sonal contact and limited availability of MOH staff due to COVID‐19


infection. This is alarming given that Mayan women living in rural

Guatemala have a maternal mortality rate double that of their non‐

Mayan counterparts (163 per 100 000 compared to 78 per 100 000).[3]

Saving Mothers Guatemala has piloted an ANC protocol aimed

at safe maternal antenatal care for low‐literacy community health‐

care workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Fig. 1). A total of eight

traditional birth attendants skilled in ANC delivery were trained

in the protocol that was adapted from WHO, CDC, ACOG, and

Guatemalan national guidelines and applied to this low‐resource set‐

ting in Guatemala.

Implementation of the training was feasible due to: (1) an exist‐

ing long‐standing collaboration between the municipal branch of the

MOH in Santiago Atitlan and Saving Mothers Guatemala, a local NGO

with vast experience in training traditional birth attendants in basic

ANC[4]; and (2) the acceptance by the community of receiving essential
