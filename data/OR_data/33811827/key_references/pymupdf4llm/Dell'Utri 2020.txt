Objective: During the lockdown period, the fear about the risk of infection in hospital has reduced the
admission to Emergency Services (ES) with possible negative health effects. We have investigated the
changes in the emergency flow occurred during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an obstetrics and gynecological
ES and the short-term adverse outcomes on women’s and reproductive health.
Study design: The study was conducted in the OBGYN ES of the Clinica Mangiagalli, the largest maternity
clinic of Milan, Lombardy, Northern Italy. We analyzed retrospectively the records of all women
consecutively admitted at the ES from February 23rd to June 24th 2019, and compared them with the
admissions during the lockdown executive order from February 23rd to June 23rd, 2020. Patients were
assessed in terms of demographic features, presentation times, triage classification (urgent/not urgent),
reason for admission and outcome of the visit (discharge/admission to the ward). A total of 9291 data
were retrieved from ES files and automation system, 5644 from 2019 and 3647 from 2020. Categorical
variables were compared by the chi-square test calculating the p value and computed were percentage
changes (with 95 % Confidence interval, CI).
Results: During the period February 24 [th] - May 31 [th] 2020 the admissions at the ES decreased by 35.4 % (95
% CI—34.1–36.6) compared with the corresponding period in 2019. The reduction was more marked for
gynecological complaints (-63.5 %, 95 %CI -60.5 to -66.5): in particular we observed a reduction of
admissions for genital infection/cystitis of 75.7 % (95 %CI -71.4 to -80.1). The admission for complaints
associated with pregnancy decreased by 28.5 % (95 %CI -27.2 to-29.9). In the index period, five fetal deaths
were diagnosed compared with one observed in the reference period in 2019 (chi square computed using
as denominator all observed pregnancies = 4.29, p = 0.04). The frequency of admission for elective
caesarean section/labor induction increased from 47.5 % in 2019 to 53.6 % in 2020: this difference was
statistically significant.
Conclusion: The lockdown negatively influenced ES admissions and consequently the women’s/
reproductive health. As possible short-term consequences, we observed an increase of intrauterine
deaths and a decrease of natural births.

The respiratory disease that emerged in December 2019 caused
by a novel coronavirus SARS�COV-2 rapidly spread from the
Chinese city of Wuhan worldwide, causing a serious public health
emergency [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a
warning and declared a world health emergency on January 31st
2020, and on March 11th 2020 declared the state of pandemic.
Northern Italy became one of the epicenters of SARS CoV-2

pandemic in Europe, Lombardy being the most affected region. On
23th February 2020, the Italian National Health Authority imposed
in Lombardy limitations to movement of the population followed
on 9th March by a national lockdown, including also the temporary
closure of non-essential shops and businesses. In the period 18th
May to 2nd June, factories, bars, restaurants and barbers were
reopened, but limitations to social contact were still present.
During the whole period any movement for health reasons was
always allowed.
During the lockdown period the national health system faced
a difficult situation. With the purpose of managing the state of
emergency the National Health system had to relocate resources
in order to reorganize human and logistic aids. Most of the
health workers had to deal with the severe cases, threated in the
intensive care units. Thus, causing a decrease of healthcare
resources for the treatment of mild or nonurgent cases. Further,
the lockdown and the fear about the risk of infection in
the hospital has lowered the admission to Emergency Services
(ES) [2,3]
The scientific community questions the possible effects of these
changes on the population health. Oncologists have warned of
possible future increases in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer due
to a reduction in screening programs leading to a diagnostic delay
with a detection of cancers at more advanced stages [4]. Two
studies conducted in Northern Italy recorded a significantly
decreased rate of hospital admissions for Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS) and described a reduction rate in ED visits for
angina or myocardial diseases of 30 % and 50 % depending on the
study [2,3]. Paediatricians warned the population about the
possible complications of the underdiagnosed Kawasaki Disease
(KD) and its potentially severe SARS-Cov-2 infection related
inflammation syndrome. the hesitation of the parents to go to
the hospital, influenced by the fear of in-hospital contagion, lead to
the manifestation of more severe forms [5].
Limited data on the impact of lockdown on obstetrics and
gynecological ESs are available so far. This study analyses all the
patients’ visits of the Obstetrics and Gynecology ES in the major
maternity hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy, during the lockdown
period and retrospectively compares the clinical data with the
same period in the previous year. The main objective was to
investigate the changes in the emergency flow occurred during
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compared to the same period in the
previous year. Secondarily we tried to identify short term
measurable adverse outcomes on women/reproductive health.

Material and methods

We retrospectively collected the data of women who were
admitted respectively from February 23rd to June 24th, 2019, and
3647 during the lockdown executive order from February 23rd to
June 23rd, 2020, in the Obstetrics and Gynecology ES of the Clinica
Mangiagalli, the largest maternity clinic in Milan, Lombardy, Italy,
The difference between dates is due to the presence of the leap
year in 2020, total days of observation where the same.
All consecutive women admitted to the ES during the
considered periods were included, independently of their age or
reason for admission.
We retrieved data from ES files and automation system. Patients
were assessed in terms of demographic features, presentation
times, triage classification (urgent/not urgent), reason for admission and outcome of the visit (discharge/admission to the ward).
The staff of the ES comprises registered obstetricians and
gynecologists. Triage was conducted using a-four-level-classifications with corresponding colors (red/immediate priority, yellow/
urgent priority; green/ less urgent priority, white/not urgent).


The number of newly diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases
in Lombardy was obtained by official data of Regional Health
Authority [6].
Categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers,
percentages and compared by the chi-square test calculating the
p value.
Percentage changes (with the corresponding 95 % Confidence
interval) in the absolute numbers observed in 2020 vs 2019 were
also computed.
Given the retrospective observational nature of the study based
on anonimous routine data base, approval by the Local Ethics
Committee was not necessary.

Results

During the period February 24th and June 23th 2020 a total of
3647 admissions were registered at the ES with a 35.4 % reduction
(95 % CI -34.1 to-36.6) compared with the equivalent period in
2019.
The highest reduction rate was observed during the 5th week
analyzed, from March 22nd to March 28th 2020, which corresponds to the maximum increase of newly infected cases
registered in Lombardy (Fig. 1).

Table 1 shows the distribution of admissions according selected
demographic characteristics and reported complaints.
The decrease was about double among Italian than foreign
women. In particular no decrease was observed among African
women.
The reduction was more marked for gynecological complaints
(-63.5 %, 95 %CI: -60.5 to -66.5) : in particular the admissions for
vulvovaginal infections, uro-gynecological conditions and/or
cystitis decreased of 75.7 % (95 %CI: 71.4 to -80.1)
Regarding the gynecological visits for menorrhagia/atypical
blood loss we observed a reduction of -41.4 % (95 %CI: -31.7%–
51.1%). Despite the reduction of the visits, the number of
hospitalizations for blood transfusion increased from 4 to 6 during
quarantine, this difference, however, was not statistically significant (chi square 2.43, p = 0.12.)
The reduction observed during the lockdown for ectopic
pregnancy was of -20.6 % (95 %CI: -11.0 % to-30.2 %), and the
absolute number of hospitalizations decreased from 20 to 16 in
2020. Of those 9 and 11 respectively in 2019 and 2020 underwent
urgent laparoscopy for salpingectomy and drainage of abdominal
free fluid and 11 and 5 were treated with methotrexate, this
difference, however, was not statistically significant (chi-square
2.0306. p = 0.15)
Finally, we observed 13 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease in
2019 and 5 in 2020, corresponding to reduction of 61.5 % (95 %CI:
-35.1 to -88.0).
The admission for complaints of pregnancy decreased of 28.6 %
(95 %CI: -27.2–29.9).
In the study period five fetal deaths were diagnosed at our ES, in
comparison with one fetal death observed in the corresponding
period in 2019 (chi square computed using as denominator all
observed pregnancies = 4.29, p = 0.04).
We have also considered the changing trends in the main
reasons of admission among pregnant women. The admissions due
bleeding in pregnancy decreased by -46.6 % (95 %CI -51.9 to -41.3;
from 339 cases to 181 cases) and those for gestational diabetes by
-47.1 % (95 %CI -0.57 to -0.38; from 104 to 55 cases). Otherwise, the
admissions for hypertensive disorders/preeclampsia/eclampsia
were substantially unchanged being increased of 2.1 % (95 %CI-1
to+11.0; from 48 to 49 cases). Finally, the cases of threat of pretermbirth increased of +13.7 % (95 %CI + 4.1 to +22.3; from 49 to 53
cases).

Discussion

This study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on an
OBGYN ES.
In comparison to 2019, the ES admission rate observed during
the lockdown period decreased significantly by 35.4 %, the
frequency of intrauterine fetal deaths diagnosed at admission
increased and of natural deliveries decreased. The highest
reduction rate was observed during the 5th week analyzed, from
March 22nd to March 28th 2020, which corresponds to the
maximum increase of newly infected cases registered in our
region.
During that weeks, the frightening effect that aroused from the
media campaign reporting the struggle of the National Health
Service, the constant display of dramatic images of hospitalized
patients in intensive care units and the daily report of increasing
number of deaths, critically increased the fear of the population
and thus influenced the attitudes of women toward the search of
care. This phenomenon has been recognized in Italy also for other
specialties, such as cardiology [2,3].
The reduction of the patient visits was higher in Italian than in
foreign women. In particular no reduction was observed among
African women. This difference may be due to the fact that African


women live in a closed community, and most of them have less
access to media information due to a language barrier. Moreover,
analyzing the reasons for visits to ES of African women it appears
that they seek urgent care either for pregnancy related complications or for delivery and/or for severe menorrhagia, not for
nonurgent issues (data not shown). During the whole lockdown
period, private practice was allowed. Thus it is possible that Italian
women, to avoid hospital access, chose more frequently a safer
environment by asking for their General Practitioner or private
gynecologist.
The reduction observed was allocated primarily to visits for
minor gynecological problems (such as vulvovaginal infections,
menstrual-cycle irregularities, uro-gynecological conditions) and
secondly for obstetric controls of an uncomplicated pregnancy
Regarding the gynecological visits, despite the observed
reduction of visits for menorrhagia/ atypical blood loss, the
number of hospitalizations for blood transfusion increased from
four to six during quarantine, although this increase was not
statistically significant. This opposite trend can be explained by the
fear of in-hospital contagion: this reluctance caused a worsening of
patients’ physical conditions, resulting in an increase of blood
transfusion and potentially serious adverse effect.
Women showing with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease
were less than half compared to the previous year. This reduction
in numbers may be due to the quarantine, that forced people to
stay home, reducing promiscuous relationships. Nevertheless,
some women may not have adequately treated the infection,
increasing the risk of possible long-term complications, which can
negatively impact women’s quality of life and increase the risks of
complications and repercussions on fertility [7].

Within all pregnant women, there was a decrease related to
issues during the first and second trimester (up until week 24). On
the other hand, as expected, the number of hospitalizations for
births was substantially unchanged.
The number of women diagnosed with intrauterine fetal deaths
at the ES confirmed by the absence of the heartbeat during the
ultrasound at admission was relevant, increased from one case in
2019 to five cases in 2020. We hypothesize that the increase could
have been due to the inclination of the women to wait longer for
the visit, which resulted in underestimating important signs, such
as the reduction of fetal movements felt by the mother, for hours or
days.
The data shows a change in the mode of delivery, favoring the
pre-planned induced births and the hospitalizations for chosen csections, compared to the natural births. It could have been due to
the doctors advising the pregnant women to preplan their birth, so
that they could feel safer knowing they would have a prefixed birth
plan, given the uncertainty and the continuous changes related to
the emergency situation of COVID-19.


Potential limitations of this analysis should be considered. We
have analyzed data obtained by a routine data base, including only
the main diagnosis/complaint of the woman attending the ES. This
limitation is, however, similar in both the considered periods.
Among strengths we have to considered the large sample size.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis shows that lockdown has had
relevant impact on ES admission and consequently on the woman’s
health such as an increase of intrauterine fetal death, a decrease of
natural birth and an increase, although in a not statistically
significant way, of admission for menorrhagia requiring blood
transfusion.
At the moment it is not possible to estimate the effect that the
reduction of patient visits at the ES have on the long term health of
the women general population, but some consequences due to
under- or delayed diagnosis, for example of infections, can be
expected.


-----

We believe it’s necessary to raise awareness to the correct use of
hospitals and ESs, informing the population on how and when to
use hospital services. An important focus should be teaching not to
underestimate important signs and symptoms that could bring
serious consequences, in the medium and long run, putting the
mother and the fetus at risk also in case of a new lockdown.
