## Decreased incidence of preterm birth during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic


OBJECTIVE: Although most studies have reported an increase in preterm birth (PTB) in pregnant women with severe
or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection,[1]

population-level European reports offer conflicting data on
a decrease[2][,][3] or stability[4] in the overall rate of PTB during
the pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence
of PTB at our institution, in the North-East of the United
States, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared
with the similar period in 2019.


STUDY DESIGN: Birth data at Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital were accessed by a query of the electronic medical
record; 2 time periods were examined: March 1 to July 31,
2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), and March 1 to July
31, 2019 (before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). The
inclusion criteria were all births at �20 weeks’ gestation,
inclusive of those with intrauterine fetal death, fetal
anomalies, and multiple gestations. Individual charts were
accessed for women who delivered preterm to confirm the


-----

indication for delivery. The primary outcome was the
incidence of PTB between the 2 groups, before and during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included the
incidences of late PTB (34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks’ gestation),
early PTB (<34 weeks’ gestation) and very early PTB (<28
weeks’ gestation), and perinatal death (fetal and neonatal
death) between periods. Analyses by subgroups of
spontaneous and iatrogenic PTB were also performed. Chisquare analysis using odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) was used for categorical variables
and adjusted OR (aOR) for demographic differences using
multivariable logistic regression analysis. P<.05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS: There was a significantly decreased incidence of
PTB in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with
the 2019 period (9.9% vs 12.6%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.58e0.99) (Table). After adjusting for race/ethnicity, the
2020 period remained associated with a significantly
decreased incidence of PTB (aOR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.57e0.99) compared with the 2019 preeCOVID-19
period. There were also significant decreases in PTB at <34
weeks’ gestation (2.5% vs 4.7%; aOR, 0.51; 95% CI,
0.31e0.82) and PTB at <28 weeks’ gestation (0.6% vs
1.5%; aOR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15e0.93) in 2020 compared


with 2019. The rate of late PTB at 34e36 weeks’ gestation
was similar between groups (Table) (Figure). Subgroup
analyses of just spontaneous or just iatrogenic PTB did not
reveal significant differences, except for a 60% decrease in
iatrogenic PTB at <34 weeks’ gestation in 2020 compared
with 2019 (Table). The incidences of mode of delivery and
perinatal death were similar between time periods (Table).
Notably, 8 of the 118 PTB (6.8%) in the 2020 period
occurred in COVID-19epositive women. The incidence of
PTB in COVID-19epositive women (most diagnosed
during pregnancy because of symptoms) was 14.5% (8 of
55) and did not differ significantly compared with the rest
of the women in the 2020 group (110 of 1142; 9.6%; OR,
1.60; 95% CI, 0.74e3.47). The incidence of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity on the labor
and delivery universal screening between April 13, 2020
(when we started), and July 31, 2020, was 4.5% (40 of 878).

CONCLUSION: This United States study reported a significant
(25%) decrease in the odds of PTB during the COVID-19
pandemic compared with a similar prepandemic period in
the peer-reviewed literature. In particular, we identified a
significant decrease in early PTB (49% decrease for <34
weeks’ gestation and 63% decrease for <28 weeks’
gestation), which have the highest risk of neonatal morbidity

and mortality (Table). When analyzing the subgroup of
spontaneous PTB, data pointed to a decrease in spontaneous
PTB at different cutoffs, but none was significant, probably
owing to a type II error. When analyzing the subgroup of
iatrogenic PTB, most—but not all—data also pointed to a
decrease in iatrogenic PTB at different cutoffs and by race/
ethnicity, with iatrogenic PTB at <34 weeks’ gestation
significantly decreased by 60% (Table). The incidences of
cesarean delivery and perinatal death were not different. The
major limitation of this study is only accounting for race/
ethnicity and no other sociodemographic data as possible
confounders. The decrease in PTB, in particular in early
(<34 weeks’ gestation) and very early (<28 weeks’ gestation)
PTBs, is consistent with 2 previous reports from Denmark[2]

and Ireland,[3] but differs from a United Kingdom report that
did not report changes in the incidence of PTB.[4]

The reasons for a decrease in PTB during the COVID-19
pandemic are unclear, and it is notable that the decrease
seemed to be both in spontaneous and indicated PTBs, but
these subgroup analyses were small and probably underpowered. Several hypotheses can be postulated (Box). In
particular, reduced work hours, reduced physical and/or
emotional stress of work, being home with support from
family, being able to have time to exercise, and reduced
exposure to environmental pollutants from reduced air
pollution could all be plausible explanations, among others,
but require further study. In particular, the decrease in iatrogenic PTB could be related to reduced antepartum surveillance that would prompt a delivery. The examination of
PTB rate should be evaluated in conjunction with fetal
demise/neonatal morbidity and mortality rates as reduced
access to care can certainly result in a rise in both.[5] Further
h i d d th t ti l diff ti l b fit


racial/ethnic groups (current analysis being limited by sample
sizes and potential for type II error) and on how practice
changes during the pandemic affect population-level outcomes. If replicated in larger populations, this decrease in
PTB opens a whole new avenue for investigation, because no
single intervention has been shown to have such a major
effect on the incidence of PTB in the general population.
