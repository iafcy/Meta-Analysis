# Increased rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancy in COVID-19 pandemic: analysis from the North of Italy

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread at
an exponential rate in several countries. Due to its
high transmissibility, several preventive strategies were
implemented worldwide, with many national and regional
authorities reducing activities that could be a source
of contagion. These included non-urgent medical care
activities such as elective surgical intervention and
outpatient visits. In our region, Emilia-Romagna in
the North of Italy, all women are guaranteed two
ultrasound scans during pregnancy; one in the first
trimester (11–13 weeks) and one in the second trimester
(19–21 weeks). Our regional health system continued
to guarantee these scans throughout the COVID-19
lockdown period.
Whereas our understanding of the clinical consequences, prevention and management of COVID-19 is
increasing[1–4], little is known about the collateral damage
caused by the actions taken to limit the spread of the
pandemic. Restrictive measures and health system disruption due to the pandemic may have deleterious effects
on women’s and children’s health[5]. We conducted a retrospective study at the Sant’Orsola-Malpighi University
Hospital in Bologna, Italy, to compare the proportion of
women who underwent emergency surgical intervention
for a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy, before and during
the COVID-19 lockdown period, from 1[st] January 2014
until the lockdown in our region on 29[th] February 2020
and from 1[st] March to 30[th] April 2020, respectively.
Emergency surgical intervention was defined as one
performed less than 6 h after the patient’s presentation at
the hospital. In our clinic, all women with tubal ectopic
pregnancy were admitted to the hospital once diagnosed
during both time periods. There were no reductions in
the number of personnel nor the resources needed for the
management of obstetric and gynecological emergencies
in our region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall,
210 women with tubal ectopic pregnancy were admitted to our clinic in the first (n = 201) and second (n = 9)
time period. The proportion of ruptured ectopic pregnancies was significantly higher during the lockdown in


comparison with the pre-lockdown period (6/9; 66.7% vs
52/201; 25.9%, Fisher’s exact test P = 0.02).
Our data raise serious concerns regarding the potential
deleterious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in
women of reproductive age. Explaining the link between
the pandemic and our findings is not straightforward.
Possible explanations could be women’s reluctance
to seek medical advice or the reduction of early
first-trimester scans, which are quite popular but elective
in our region. We think that monitoring the indirect
potential consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is
imperative in order to avoid unexpected deleterious health
complications in the population.
