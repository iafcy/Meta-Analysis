###### INTRODUCTION
lmost 20 million people worldwide have been
infected with severe acute respiratory syn# A
drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as of August
10, 2020.[1] Although the burden of maternal mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in high-income countries appears limited, low- and
middle-income countries may be affected differently.[2] The Mexican Ministry of Health publishes
weekly epidemiologic reports describing the count
of total maternal deaths, their causes, and the maternal mortality ratio.[3] Using this open source, we
aimed to estimate the weekly number, weekly percentage, and total number of excess deaths from all
causes that could be directly or indirectly attributed
to COVID-19 based on preliminary weekly counts
of deaths from 2011 through the 32nd week of 2020
(August 3–9). In addition, we describe the maternal
mortality ratio over time and causes of mortality
since 2011.

###### METHODS
Weekly maternal death counts for 2020 were compared with documented trends from prior years to
determine whether the number of deaths was higher
than expected. Namely, Farrington surveillance algorithms[4] based on Poisson generalized linear models
with overdispersion were used to estimate the upper
bound (ie, upper limit of the 95% prediction interval)
for the predicted number of deaths per week of 2020.
This was based on weekly death counts from 2011,
when the Mexican Ministry of Health epidemiologic
reports first became available, through 2019. The
number of excess deaths was estimated as the difference between the observed count and the predicted
upper bound by week. The percent excess was calculated as the number of excess deaths divided by the
upper bound by week. The total number of excess
deaths reflected a summation of the number of excess
deaths between the 1st and 32nd week of 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using R 4.0.0.

###### RESULTS
According to predictions from the Mexican Ministry
of Health, the anticipated maternal mortality ratio in
Mexico for 2020 was 29.5 per 100,000 live births, a
stark contrast to the actual maternal mortality ratio of
42.4 that has been calculated thus far for 2020.[3]

Maternal mortality stratified by cause in Mexico from
2011 to 2020 is shown in Table 1. From the 1st
through the 32nd week of 2020 (August 3–9), 523
maternal deaths have been reported. Importantly,
COVID-19 is now the leading cause of maternal mortality in Mexico.[3] Compared with previous years, the
proportion of deaths from respiratory causes (32%) is
higher in 2020 compared with any other timepoint in
this analysis. The weekly number and weekly percentage of excess maternal deaths from all causes for 2020

needs to be confirmed, and 25 deaths due to other respiratory diseases.


Fig. 1. Excess maternal deaths in Mexico for 2020 up to the 32nd epidemiologic week. Each bar represents 1 week. The
blue line represents the upper bound for the predicted number of maternal deaths per week of 2020, based on weekly
maternal death counts from 2011 through 2019. The observations above this line represent the number of excess deaths, and
those weeks are highlighted with a triangle. Mexico entered the most serious and widespread phase 3 transmission of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in week 17. Thus far, there have been 86 excess maternal deaths from all causes in
2020, distributed as follows: 1, 12, 8, 7, 6, 2, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 14, and 15 for the 18th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 26th, 27th,
28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and 32nd weeks, respectively. The percent excess for the weeks listed above was 6%, 75%, 50%,
44%, 38%, 12%, 25%, 25%, 28%, 18%, 28%, 82%, and 88%, respectively.

are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. Overall, there
were 86 excess maternal deaths reported from all
causes thus far (weeks 1–32) in 2020.

###### DISCUSSION
In contrast with maternal outcomes in economically
advanced countries,[2] our results suggest higher mortality among pregnant women in Mexico during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, similar consequences
were observed during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009,
where an excess of 211 maternal deaths in Mexico
were reported for that year.[5]

We acknowledge the limitations of our study. The
data reported by the Mexican Ministry of Health are
provisional, and there is evidence of continued
increasing rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore,
our results should be interpreted with caution,
because an underestimation of maternal deaths cannot
be ruled out. In addition, our analysis of excess deaths
is limited to the evaluation of death from all causes.
Similar to our findings in Mexico, it is possible
that other low- and middle-income countries have
experienced a disproportionate burden of maternal
mortality related to COVID-19. Renewed focus on
improving the structural competency of health care
systems[6] in Mexico and other underresourced countries is urgently needed to mitigate the adverse effects
of COVID-19 on maternal health.
