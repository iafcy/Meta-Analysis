# Singleton preterm birth rates for racial and ethnic groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in California


OBJECTIVE: Reports from Denmark[1] and the Limerick
region in Ireland[2] noted dramatic reductions in preterm
births during the initial months of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We sought to assess the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on preterm birth rates
in a large racially diverse population during the peak
months of the pandemic. Approximately 1 in 8 births in
the United States occurs to California residents, a
population that is among the most diverse in the country.


STUDY DESIGN: The Hispanic or Latinx community accounts for 39% of California’s population and 46% of births
but has experienced 61% of the state’s COVID-19 cases and
48% of COVID-19erelated deaths; the black community,
which constitutes 6% of the population, accounts for 4%
[of cases and 8% of deaths (https://covid19.ca.gov/data-](https://covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/)
[and-tools/). Under the auspices of state and Stanford’s](https://covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/)
Institutional Review Boards, the state of California
Center for Health Statistics provides provisional monthly

data on all births in California to support state-wide
quality improvement activities.[3] Race and ethnicity are
self-identified.
We examined birth outcomes for the months that corresponded with the peak effects of the pandemic: April 2020 to
July 2020. A state-wide COVID-19 lockdown began in California on March 19, 2020, with caseloads peaking first midApril 2020 and followed by a much higher peak in mid-July
[2020 with more than 12,000 new cases per day (https://](https://covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/)
[covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/).](https://covid19.ca.gov/data-and-tools/) We compared these 4
months in 2020 to the same 4-month period aggregated over
the previous 4 years (2016e2019) using logistic regression
models to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confid i t l (CI ) A l f d i


Statistical Analysis System (version 9.4: SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS: Our findings by race and ethnicity are shown
in the Table. Singleton preterm birth rates using standard
categories were unchanged during the pandemic period
except the 28þ0 to 31þ6 weeks subset, which showed a
modest increase (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03e1.20). This was
driven primarily by the Hispanic or Latinx population.
The overall rate of preterm birth (<37 weeks’ gestation)
was unchanged for all race and ethnicity categories. No
changes in preterm birth rates were noted when analyzed
by payer, region, or a combination with race and
th i it (d t t h )


-----

CONCLUSION: Contrary to earlier reports, we found no
evidence of a reduction in preterm birth rates for any racial
and ethnic groups. This finding differs from reports from
Ireland[2] and Denmark,[1] which may reflect their small
samples and lower severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates as of August
1, 2020, compared with the reports from California
[(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The Centers for](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
Disease Control and Prevention has recently reported
higher rates of preterm births among mothers with
second-trimester symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections
but not in asymptomatic cases.[4] The finding of an 11%
increase in the 28e32 week preterm birth rate among the
Hispanic or Latinx population is consistent with higher
direct and indirect pandemic effects for that community.
However, this finding should be approached with caution
given that other subsets of preterm birth were not
increased. The pandemic could affect pregnancy
outcomes through indirect mechanisms by changes in
daily activities, social and economic effects, and
utilization of healthcare services.[5] More broadly, our
findings underscore the need for caution in assessing the
impact of the pandemic in small populations and over
short periods.
