### 1 | INTRODUCTION


### Abstract

#### Objective: To compare mental distress and COVID-19-related family environment

 changes among pregnant women before and during the pandemic.

 Methods: In a survey-based study in Lishui City, Zhejiang, China, pregnant women

 were recruited before (March–December, 2019; n = 2657) and during (January–

 August, 2020; n = 689) the COVID-19 pandemic. They completed the Symptom Check

 List-90 Revised (SCL90-R) questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),

 and were asked about their families via the Family Environment Scale (FES).

 Results: Higher SCL90-R scores of somatization (P = 0.003), depression (P = 0.043),

 anxiety (P = 0.041), hostility (P = 0.009), and others (P = 0.025) were reported by

 women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep disorder also occurred more frequently

 among pregnant women during the pandemic (P = 0.002). Social environmental char
 acteristics of families showed impaired family cohesion, and increased levels of con
 flict and independence during the pandemic (all P < 0.05). The FES score for family

 cohesion was negatively related with obsessive–compulsive, depression, anxiety, and

 hostility symptoms, whereas that for conflict was positively related with these symp
 toms (all P < 0.001).

 Conclusion: The mental health, sleep, and family environment of pregnant women

 was impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential protective factors including

 increased social support might help to mitigate long-lasting negative consequences.

Since first confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS
CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout the

world. As of August 30, 2020, it has infected more than 20 million

individuals globally, leading to death, shortage of medical resources,

unemployment, economic distress, and a marked change in daily life.

Individuals have found themselves suddenly reduced to the ‘sur
vival’ level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.[1] They have been isolated

from family and friends, and social connections have been disrupted

over long periods. Many people have been laid off work and small

businesses have been severely affected, resulting in financial hard
ship. Therefore, it is important to realize that the COVID-19 pan
demic is not only an epidemiologic, but also a psychologic crisis. The

psychologic and social consequences caused by the virus may be

equally destructive as the infection itself.

As compared with men, women tend to show higher symptoms

of anxiety and depression during disease outbreaks.[2,3] In particular,


-----

pregnant women are prone to mood swings due to the influence of

hormone levels during pregnancy. During this vulnerable time, perina
tal mood and anxiety disorders have become the most common psy
chologic distress, which may negatively affect both mother and fetus.[4]

Although most evidence to date indicates that there is no danger of

COVID-19 transmission to the fetus,[5] there remains limited informa
tion on the potential effects of the virus on pregnant women and fetus.

It has been reported, however, that psychologic, cultural, and

environmental stressors encountered during pregnancy may be

harmful to pregnancy, and maternal and child health, and recent

research shows that prenatal stress may have consequences across

generations.[6] The supportive effect of a good family environment

can buffer the impact of pregnancy stress, and reduce the impact of

prenatal anxiety and depression symptoms on the stress response

system of the mother and newborn.[7] Similarly, accumulated evi
dence shows that negative family relationships may cause stress,

affect mental health, and even cause physical symptoms. Therefore,

the mental health and daily family environment of pregnant women

during an epidemic require more attention.

Given the potential for negative sequelae in terms of psychologic

state, health, and offspring, the primary aim of the current study

was to explore psychologic distress and mental symptoms related to

COVID-19 among pregnant women during the pandemic. Secondary

aims were to examine the connections between sleep disorders and

the pandemic, in addition to changes in the family environment of

pregnant women related to the crisis.

### 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

 2.1 | Study design and participants

In an online survey-based study, pregnant women in Lishui City,

Zhejiang, China, were recruited via social media or during a hospi
tal visit between March 1, 2019, and August 30, 2020. The Ethics

Committee of Lishui Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital

approved all data collection. All study women gave consent to

participation.

The first cohort of participants was recruited between March 1

and December 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The sec
ond cohort was recruited during the pandemic from January 1 to

August 31, 2020. The inclusion criteria were age at least 18 years,

able to read and write Chinese, having a confirmed pregnancy at less

than 38 gestational weeks, and able to make an informed decision.

### 2.2 | Scales and measurement

Sociodemographic variables and pregnancy information were ob
tained during the study. All participants in both cohorts completed

the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL90-R),[3] Pittsburgh Sleep

Quality Index (PSQI),[8] and Family Environment Scale (FES)[9] ques
tionnaires online


The SCL90-R is used to evaluate various psychologic problems

and symptoms of psychopathology. It is a 90-item self-rating inven
tory with 10 clinical scales, 7 of which were applied in the present

study: somatization, interpersonal sensitiveness, obsessive-compul
sive behavior, hostility, anxiety, depression, and ‘others’ (e.g., forag
ing status and sleep). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from

0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely likely). A subscale score of 2 or higher

indicates a potential psychologic issue.[3]

The PSQI is used to measure sleep quality and help distinguish

between those with poor sleep and those with good sleep.[8] It is

a 24-item self-reporting measure of general sleep quality in the pre
ceding 1-month period. Each item is rated from 0 (no difficulty) to 3

(severe difficulty), resulting in a total score for each scale. The score

ranges from 0 to 21, and a score higher than 5 is considered a serious

sleep disorder.

The FES is a measure of a respondent's perceptions of their fam
ily life, and has been extensively used in different clinical samples.[9]

It comprises 10 subscales in 3 dimensions: family relationship, per
sonal growth, and system maintenance. Four subscales, cohesion,

expressiveness, conflict, and independence, were measured in the

current study.

### 2.3 | Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted by using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp.,

Armonk, NY, USA). Before analysis, the accuracy and consistency of

the survey data were manually checked and invalid records were re
moved. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic and

main research variables. Mental health symptoms were reported as

continuous variables. The independent t test was used to compare

means between the two groups. Pearson correlation coefficient

was used to evaluate the association between variables. A P value

of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### 3 | RESULTS

 3.1 | Sociodemographic characteristics

The cohort recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic comprised

2800 pregnant women, whereas that recruited during the pandemic

comprised 700 women. Of these 3500 participants, 154 records

were invalid because the respondents did not provide consent,

did not complete the full survey, or provided an invalid expiration

date. Thus, data were assessed from 2657 (94.9%) and 689 (98.4%)

women in the first and second cohorts, respectively. Neither the

women nor their families were infected with the virus at the time

of the study.

The median (range) age of the whole sample was 28 years

(18–45 years) (SD, 4.9 years) and the gestational age was 16 weeks

(4–38 weeks) (SD, 6.14 weeks). The median age of the pre-Covid-19

cohort was 28 years (18–45 years) (SD, 6.4 years) and the gestational

age was 16 weeks (4–38 weeks) (SD, 5.1 weeks), whereas those of

the Covid-19 group were 28 years (18–45 years) (SD, 4.9 years) and

16 weeks (6–37 weeks) (SD, 5.0 weeks), respectively. Thus, the me
dian maternal age and gestational week were the same in the two

groups (Table 1).

### 3.2 | Mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic

The women in the COVID-19 cohort had significantly higher

scores for somatization (P = 0.003), depression (P = 0.040), anxiety

(P = 0.041), hostility (P = 0.008), and others (P = 0.023) scales as

compared with the pre-COVID-19 group. There were no significant

differences in obsessive-compulsive behavior or interpersonal sen
sitivity between the pregnant women before and during the COVID
19 pandemic (Table 2). The incidence of depressive symptoms in the

cohort after the outbreak of COVID-19 was 13.5% (n = 93) as com
pared with 10.2% (n = 271) in the population before the pandemic.

The incidence of anxiety symptoms was 16.2% (n = 112) among

women during the pandemic, as compared with 11.5% (n = 306)

among those before the outbreak.

### 3.3 | Sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic

According to the results, 1837 (69.1%) women reported sleep disor
ders in the pre-pandemic group, and 513 (74.5%) women reported

sleep problems in the pandemic group. The average PSQI score was

significantly higher among pregnant women recruited during the

COVID-19 pandemic than among those recruited before the pan
demic (6.35 vs. 5.98, P = 0.002) (Table 2).

### 3.4 | Family support status before and during the crisis

The mean FES scores during the COVID-19 pandemic were signif
icantly different from the pre-COVID-19 scores in 3 of the 4 FES

subscales (Table 3). The scores for cohesion (P = 0.024), conflict

(P = 0.017), and independence (P = 0.045) in families were much

lower during the pandemic. Only the score for the expressiveness

subscale did not differ between the two groups. The scores for fam
ily cohesion were negatively related with obsessive-compulsive be
havior, depression, anxiety, and hostility symptoms, whereas those

for conflict were positively related with these symptoms (Table 4).

### 4 | DISCUSSION

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, pregnant women have

needed to cope with the impact of this virus, in addition to dealing

with the stressors in their daily lives. Studies from different regions

have begun to focus specifically on the mental health of pregnant

women during the COVID-19 outbreak [10-15] However most studies

have assessed only data collected during the pandemic. By contrast,

the current study has examined and compared psychologic distress

among pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe illness from

COVID-19, as well as other adverse consequences such as preterm

birth, relative to the non-pregnant population.[16,17] Pregnant women

are often prone to anxiety and fear concerning their fetus, and more

likely to establish obsessive-compulsive behaviors.[18] To reduce the

risk of infection, pregnant women need to avoid close contact with

anyone who might be sick and distance themselves from individuals

outside their family, and thus they may more frequently show hos
tility toward outsiders.

In the present study, the incidence of depressive and anxiety

symptoms in the cohort recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic

were markedly higher than those in the cohort recruited before

the virus pandemic, suggesting that the outbreak has significantly

led to anxiety and depression among pregnant women and may

have a long-term impact on their infants. In a Chinese survey of the

general population early in the epidemic (Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020),

17% of participants reported moderate or severe depression, and

29% reported moderate to severe anxiety.[2] A Canadian study also

found a substantially higher incidence of anxiety and depressive

symptoms as compared with a similar cohort recruited pre-pan
demic: 37% of pregnant women self-reported clinically relevant

symptoms of depression, and 57% self-reported clinically relevant

symptoms of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] There is no

doubt that higher quality prenatal care and increased social sup
port are required to reduce the incidence of symptoms and allevi
ate the subsequent long-term negative impact of COVID-19.

The stress of COVID-19 is also exacerbating sleep disorders

among pregnant women. In a previous study, women who reported

more sleep disturbances in late pregnancy were more likely to have

clinically significant depressive symptomatology at 2–4 weeks post
partum as compared with those with few sleep disturbances.[19] It has

also been observed that poor sleep quality in the first trimester is

associated with increased depressive symptoms.[20] Increased sleep

disorders may further affect the mental health of pregnant women

and cause long-term harm in the future.

Psychologic needs, such as feelings of security, mental bal
ance, and serenity, are an important requirement in pregnancy.

The mother's mental health is influenced by her family environ
ment, and compatibility between the woman and her environment

is very important Therefore it is essential to evaluate if the family


environment changes during a pandemic. The present data indi
cated that family cohesion was impaired, and the levels of conflict

and independence were elevated in the cohort recruited during

the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed

that the unusual family environment was associated with mental

disorders among pregnant women. Solid programs offering sup
port and assistance for pregnant women and their families are

necessary.

The study has some limitations. First, the participants were re
cruited from a single city, and may not represent the whole popula
tion of pregnant women in China. Second, the questionnaires were

presented online in Chinese; therefore, it was not possible to collect

data from women who were less educated or unable to access the

internet.

Despite the limitations, the present data reflect concerns about

the mental state of pregnant women faced with the epidemic of

COVID-19. They remind us that special attention should be paid to

specific subgroups of the population—especially pregnant women—

when they have to deal with situations resulting in more depression

and anxiety than usual. The findings highlight the fact that pregnant

women and their families need more help than ever during the pan
demic. It is extremely urgent to develop professional support for

these women at this time. Without sufficient support, stress from

COVID-19 might have a long-term, multi-generational impact on

pregnant couples and their children.
