**INTRODUCTION**
Over 15 million babies are born too early,
too sick and too small in the world annually.
One million of these infants die.[1] Very low
birth weight (VLBW <1500 g) and extremely
low birth weight (ELBW <1000 g) contribute
significantly to infant mortality.[2–5] In 2016,
46% of the under 5 mortality globally was

**ABSTRACT**
**Background** Aetiology of births involving very low
birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low birthweight (ELBW)
infants is heterogeneous and preventive strategies remain
elusive. Socioenvironmental measures implemented as
Ireland’s response to the SARS-­CoV-2 virus (COVID-19)
pandemic represented a national lockdown, and have
possibly influenced the health and well-­being of pregnant
women and unborn infants.
**Methods** Regional trends of VLBW and ELBW infants in
one designated health area of Ireland over two decades
were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses
with 95% CI were conducted. Regional data covering
most of the lockdown period of 2020 were compared
with historical regional and national data and forecasted
national figures for 2020.
**Results** Poisson regression analysis found that the regional
historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to
April, 2001–2019 was 8.18 (95% CI 7.21 to 9.29). During
January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just
2.17 per 1000 live births was observed, reflecting a rate
ratio of 3.77 (95% CI 1.21 to 11.75), p=0.022, representing
a 73% reduction of VLBW during the first 4 months of 2020
compared with same period for the preceding two decades.
There were no ELBW infants admitted to the regional
neonatal intensive care unit. National Irish VLBW rate for
2020 is forecasted to be reduced to approximate 400 per
60 000 births compared with the historical 500–600 range.
**Conclusion** An unprecedented reduction in regional
births of VLBW and ELBW infants was observed in
Ireland coinciding with the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential
determinants of this unique temporal trend possibly
reside in the summative socioenvironmental impact of
the COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings, if mirrored in other
regions that have adopted a lockdown, demonstrate the
potential to evaluate these implicated behavioural and
socioenvironmental modifiers to positively influence VLBW
and ELBW rates globally.


**Key questions**


**What is already known?**

- Very low birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low
birthweight (ELBW) infants contribute significantly to
under 5 mortality globally.

- Currently, there is no broadly accepted and effective
strategy to prevent the birth of premature VLBW and
ELBW infants.

- Impact of cumulative socioenvironmental and maternal behavioural modifications on the incidence of
very preterm births has not been assessed.

**What are the new findings?**

- COVID-19-­triggered national lockdown in Ireland
created an opportunity to study the cumulative influence of socioenvironmental modifications on pregnant mothers.

- An unprecedented 73% reduction in live births of
VLBW infants and a 100% reduction of ELBW infants were noted in one designated health region of
Ireland during January to April 2020 compared with
the preceding 20 years.

- Our observations, if nationally mirrored, indicate that
birth rate of VLBW and ELBW infants in Ireland is
forecasted to decrease considerably in 2020.

**Key questions**


**What do the new findings imply?**

- Our observations, if reflected in other countries that adopted
COVID-19- prompted lockdown measures, could redefine the antecedents that trigger the yet poorly understood pathways leading to very low birthweight (VLBW) and extremely low birthweight
(ELBW) births.

- Socioenvironmental alterations, maternal behavioural modifications, ease of access to maternity services and the enforcement
of lockdown measures could impact variably during pregnancy in
different regions of the world.

- Reducing VLBW and ELBW rates would be the most important
‘curve to bend’ to reduce infant mortality globally and thus promote
the achievement of sustainable development goals for children.


contributed by neonatal deaths within the first 28 days
of life and the main contributor was prematurity.[5] VLBW
and ELBW rates are increasing in most of the developed, middle-­income and low-­income countries and a
significant proportion are of unknown aetiology.[2 6] The
frequency of preterm birth (PTB) varies from 5% to 9%
in Europe, 10.6% in North America to 11.9% in Africa.[7 8]
Most VLBW and ELBW infants are born to women with
no prior history of premature births.[5 9]

Prevention of VLBW and ELBW births is considered a
public health priority. Despite growing relevance, progress has been modest.[10] Currently, there is no standardised
and effective strategy to prevent VLBW and ELBW births,
and implementation of socioenvironmental approaches
to mitigate the risk of such deliveries would require better
elucidation of non-­medical factors that are both under-­
recognised and underevaluated.[11] Although the causal
biological mechanisms mediating such births are poorly
understood, preterm premature rupture of membranes
(PPROM), amniotic inflammasome mediation, alterations to vaginal microbiota, variations in cytokines,
chemokines and other inflammatory modulators, as well
as intra-­amniotic inflammation and infections have been
suggested as the biological antecedents.[12–15] Recognising
the sources of heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in
VLBW and ELBW births may inform eventual effectiveness of preventive measures.[16 17]

Socioenvironmental measures implemented as
Ireland’s response to the SARS-­CoV-2 virus (COVID-19)
pandemic collectively constituted a national lockdown,
and may possibly have influenced the health and well-­
being of pregnant women and their unborn infants.
In that specific setting there existed an opportunity to
compare the trend of VLBW and ELBW rates during the
lockdown period with the historical data. Potential influence of a multitude of biological, physical and environmental factors could cumulatively modify the births of
VLBW and ELBW infants. We wished to assess whether
these redefined social and behavioural boundaries have
fostered an environment favourable to influence the
VLBW and ELBW birth rates. These few months offered
a unique opportunity to study the effects of a _‘Nature’s_


experiment’ of non-­medical, behavioural and socioenvironmental alterations as potential determinants influencing overall health of the ‘intrauterine habitat’.

**METHODS**
**Setting**
A nationwide lockdown was implemented in Ireland on
12 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
and continued till 18 May. This reflected the shutdown
of offices, shops, colleges, schools, childcare facilities and
all other institutions deemed non-­essential. Traffic and
mobility restrictions were imposed and most of the workforce adapted to a new work-­from-­home (WFH) model.
The Irish government advised the population from mid-­
February 2020 to follow strict hand hygiene measures,
social distancing and adherence to WHO recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission.
Irish COVID-19 lockdown was lifted in a phased
approach from 18 May; although most non-­essential
services remained closed with ongoing mobility and
social restrictions till 29 June (end of phase 2). However,
we have maintained our observations till the end of June
2020 (half of the year). This period of phased easing of
the socioenvironmental measures facilitated ascertaining
whether the observed VLBW and ELBW trends sustained
or reverted immediately at the end of full lockdown in
2020.

**Study population**
University Maternity Hospital Limerick (UMHL) is the
only maternity facility for a population of 473 000 from
the counties of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and
nearby catchment areas. It provides an opportunity to
analyse the demographic and epidemiological trends of
births involving VLBW and ELBW infants of one of the
designated health regions in the Ireland.[18] All VLBW and
ELBW infants of the region from 22 weeks of gestation
are treated locally (apart from surgical or cardiac interventions). Perinatal demography and patient characteristics of the study population have been published previously.[19] All VLBW and ELBW live births at UMHL from 1
January 2001 to 30 April 2020 were included in the study.
No cases were excluded based on congenital anomalies,
multiple gestations or inconsistencies around the accuracy of gestational age (GA) estimation.
There were no overarching significant alterations to
the antenatal, obstetric or intrapartum care pathways
initiated for the pregnant women at UMHL from January
to April 2020 compared with preceding 5 years. Policies
on antenatal steroids, antenatal magnesium sulphate,
resuscitation of ELBW infants at the margins of viability,
frequency of antenatal visits and obstetric ultrasound
scans, peripartum maternal antibiotics for group B
streptococcus prophylaxis, maternal sepsis management
(sepsis six) and the Irish maternity early warning system
were operational. Of note, over a 20-­year span, internationally accepted and evidence-­based practices were


-----

implemented at UMHL compliant with national-­level
and local-­level obstetric and neonatal guidelines.

**Birthweight-based data capture and analysis**
There are two established methods for cohorting high-­
risk infants, by birth weight or GA.[20] A birthweight-­based
analysis was chosen for this study, and not primarily
based on very low GA (VLGA, <32 weeks). VLBW could
be through pure prematurity, a combination of prematurity and growth restriction/small for GA (SGA) or much
less commonly through intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR) alone. We have chosen to study the VLBW and
ELBW trends considering the following factors, (1) Accurate institutional data and monthly statistics spanning
over two decades was collected primarily on weight-­based
criteria and later only GA added, (2) GA was calculated
based on the best obstetric estimate and varied over
decades based on last menstrual period, early prenatal
ultrasound (dating scan or booking scan) or a combination, (3) For the first few years of historical data GA
was adjusted to completed weeks (26 or 28 weeks) and
not to exact days (25+5/7 or 28+2/7), (4) To facilitate
later international comparison including low/middle-­
income countries having more SGA contribution and
that the dating scan-­based accurate GA assessment may
not be always available, and (5) To facilitate future international benchmarking studies through Vermont Oxford
Network (VON) centres.[21]

**Data collection**
Retrospective descriptive datasets for this cohort study
were linked for two decades from the labour ward
register, neonatal admission register and presubmission
data for the VON international benchmarking.[21] Additional interrogation of the hospital inpatient enquiry
system, labour ward weekly statistics for live and stillbirths, early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) statistics for early pregnancy loss/miscarriage information,
inpatient ward statistics for early or late fetal loss during
hospital admission as well as review of the hospital death
certificate register were conducted to collate supportive
information and to avoid ascertainment bias. We did not
subclassify VLBW and ELBW births to spontaneous onset
of labour with intact membranes, PPROM or medically
initiated labour onset through induction or caesarean.[7]
Our VLBW and ELBW trends were compared with the
published National figures from the Central Statistics
Office (CSO) and National Perinatal Epidemiology
Centre (NPEC) of Ireland.[22 23]

Region-­wide search to collect data on home births
during the lockdown and phase 1 and 2 of the easing
of lockdown up to end of June 2020 was also conducted
through community midwifery, ambulance centre and
maternity emergency room database at UMHL.

**Statistical analysis**
Fully anonymised and deidentified dataset fulfilling
general data protection regulation compliance was


prepared for statistical analysis.[24] Significance of
temporal trends in the VLBW and ELBW rates per 1000
births were assessed using Poisson regression, where time
was entered as a continuous variable. Poisson regression
with 95% Wald CIs and rate ratio analysis were used to
compare the observed VLBW rate for January to April of
2020 at UMHL to historical data. Estimates of the prevalence of VLBW and ELBW per 1000 births pre-2020 were
assessed and the potential impact of January to April
2020 regional data on the national expectation of VLBW
for 2020 in Ireland (based on the previous published
Irish data from VON, NPEC and CSO).[21–23] All data were
analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V.26.

**Patient and public involvement**
Patient and public involvement (PPI) was initiated at
outset of research planning. Irish Neonatal Health Alliance (INHA), the patient advocacy group (Registered
Charity Number: 20100100) representing parents of
newborn infants in Ireland and member of European
Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants (EFCNI),
was invited at the design stage of the study and was a
signatory in the Research Ethics submission. INHA
reviewed the aims of the study and confirmed that the
issues addressed are of relevance to patients and public.
INHA reaffirmed that the patient confidentiality is not
breached at any stage, and specifically requested forecasting of National VLBW births through appropriate
analysis in order for the advocacy group to prioritise
family centred care programmes for 2020. INHA also
nominated a parent of a premature VLBW infant as an
independent external reviewer of VLBW and ELBW data
for 2020. Designated representative of the patient advocacy group is a member of the study team and authorship
of the manuscript. Once published, the relevant findings
of the study will be disseminated through the websites of
[INHA www.​inha.​ie and EFCNI www.​efcni.​org. Guidance](http://www.efcni.org/)
for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public
reporting checklist as applicable to this study has been
[fulfilled (online supplemental table).](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003075)

**Data verification and reporting**
Considering the unprecedented and significant reduction of the VLBW and ELBW numbers observed during
the lockdown and prelockdown phases of extra public
health vigilance, we have verified the accuracy and
authenticity of primary data capture with external independent professionals and patient representative (as
part of the PPI initiative) who are not members of the
research team or authorship. Such measures will minimise the ascertainment bias and underpins importance
of data transparency.

**RESULTS**
Over the last 20 years, UMHL had 93 018 live births and
during the 4 months of January to April from 2001 to
2020 there were 30 705 live births. Annual live births,
annual VLBW and ELBW rates as well as respective

numbers for 1 January to 30 April of each year for the last
two decades are summarised in table 1. Poisson regression analyses of the 2001–2019 data did not find any
evidence of temporal trends for UMHL January to April
VLBW (Wald χ[2]=0.784, p=0.376), January to April ELBW
(Wald χ[2]=0.464, p=0.496), annual VLBW (Wald χ[2]=0.366,
p=0.545) or annual ELBW (Wald χ[2]=0.008, p=0.929).
The VLBW rate per 1000 live births (January–April)
based on aggregate 2001–2019 data was 8.18 (95% Wald
CI 7.21 to 9.29), representing a forecast January–April
2020, in the absence of a temporal trend. However, the
observed total number of only three VLBW in January–
April 2020 (all of them born before mid-­February 2020,
with no ELBW) confirms an unusually low VLBW rate of
just 2.17 per 1000 live births (95% Wald CI 0.70 to 6.74),
73% lower than the forecasted rate of 8.18 (figure 1).
The rate ratio comparing the risk of VLBW in January–
April 2001–2019 to that from January to April in 2020 was
3.77 (95% Wald CI 1.21 to 11.75), p=0.022, suggesting
that for two decades pre-2020 there was 3.77 times
the rate of VLBW for the months of January–April in
comparison to 2020. The ELBW rate per 1000 live births
for January–April using aggregated data from 2001 to
2019 was 3.0 (95% Wald CI 2.43 to 3.70). There were no


ELBW live births recorded for the health region during
January–April 2020 (figure 2).
The VLBW rate per 1000 live births from the aggregated regional numbers for 2001–2019 yearly data was
computed to be 8.41 (95% Wald CI 7.83 to 9.04), providing
a forecasted annual rate for 2020. A continuation of the

73% reduction from the January–April VLBW rate for
the health region for the remainder of 2020 would forecast a rate of 2.27 VLBW per 1000 live births. However,
a reversal to the regional population’s prelockdown
behavioural and socioenvironmental status quo could
increase the rate towards historical rates.
The forecast for the 2020 national VLBW rate is taken
from the 2014–2017 VON date for Ireland, giving a mean
of 9.37 per 1000 live births; no trend is evident. If the
national VLBW rate reflects the observed regional rate of
2.17 (95% Wald CI 0.70 to 6.74) (January–April 2020), the
upper confidence limit estimates the number of VLBW
infants to be born in Ireland in 2020 could be reduced
to over 400 per 60 000 births (historically 500–600).
(table 2) However, variation in the population’s compliance with lockdown, and postlockdown deterioration in
behavioural and socioenvironmental factors or the possibility of a ‘baby boom’ in late 2020, could restore the
historical VLBW rate of over 500 per 60 000 births.
Extended data surveillance from March to June 2020
confirmed that our initial observation sustained through
the entire lockdown and phases 1 and 2 of the easing
of restrictions, ELBW rate at 0.75 per 1000 live births


(95% CI 0.11 to 5.36) and total VLBW (including ELBW)
at 2.27 per 1000 (95% CI 0.73 to 7.03) (table 3). Mortality
data analysis for March to June of 2016 to 2020 demonstrated no trends for ‘shift-­to-­left’ or ‘shift-­to-­right’ in
2020 (table 3), suggesting no evidence of early pregnancy loss, miscarriage or stillbirths being explanatory
of the low rates of VLBW and ELBW in our region in
Ireland. On the contrary, a trend towards a reduction
in miscarriages was observed. LBW infants in the 1500–
2000 g weight distribution also showed reduced births
during this period in 2020 compared with previous years
(table 3).
There were no home deliveries of VLBW or ELBW
infants during the lockdown in our region. Irish home
birth rate is generally low and, in 2016, there were only
180 planned home births. Overall planned home birth
rate in our health region in Ireland from September
2019 to June 2020 was only 15, at <0.05% of total births
for the period.

**DISCUSSION**
Prematurity poses significant medical, emotional, physical, psychological and financial burden for affected
infants, their support network, health systems, economies
and society as a whole.[25] VLBW and ELBW infants may
be affected by significant neonatal morbidity, leading
to long-­term health concerns during childhood.[26] A
myriad of aetiological and antecedent factors could
trigger VLBW and ELBW births and the effectiveness of
preventive measures depends on precise understanding
of causation.[10] A pan-­European study found rising VLBW
and ELBW rates in most countries.[27] Increase in multiple
births as well as assisted reproduction techniques (ART)
also contributed to the overall increase.[27] Even though
earlier literature suggests PPROM as a multifactorial
biological process, accounting for 30%–40% premature
births, more recent medical interventions (indicated
PTB) account for a significant proportion of VLBW
infants.[27–29] Understanding cross-­country differences
also could inform strategies aimed at reducing prematurity.[17 27]

Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to encourage positive behavioural changes.[30] Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System in Ireland, National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence guidelines as well as the
‘Safer Maternity Care’ document in UK are worthy initiatives targeting reduced VLBW and ELBW births.[30–32]
Prenatal period and foetal growth could be regarded
as a matrix for our lives and societies.[33] Heterogeneous
origins of VLBW and ELBW rates could be influenced by
environmental changes, modifiable population factors,
nutritional variations, stress factors and socioeconomic
status.[17] However, the yet under-­recognised, behavioural,
sociocultural and socioenvironmental modifications
and opportunities designed to prolong the intrauterine
nurturing milieu could offer far more in improving birth
rates of such high-­risk infants.

**Birthweight-based data capture and analysis**
Even though there has been increasing acceptance of
GA-­based cohorting,[7 29] more recent neonatal network
and register-­based studies comparing VLBW and VLGA
cohorts found no difference in the prediction power for
adverse outcomes between the two groups despite the
inherent SGA bias within the VLBW group.[20] Two models
also showed equal power to predict mortality and utility
for benchmarking.[20]

The VON database and NPEC recorded 612 Irish
infants in 2017 with gestation less than 29+6/7 weeks.[21 23]
Among this national cohort only 16 (2.6%) had a birth
weight above 1500 g, indicative of VLBW being an acceptable proxy for significant prematurity.[21–23] Contribution
of SGA to the national VON submission in 2017 for
VLBW was 19.5% and assuming a representative regional
sample, our cohort of VLBW would have 80.5% premature infants who are appropriate for GA.[21 23] These
proportions could be significantly different in developing countries with relatively high SGA contribution
among the VLBW infants.


**Mortality trends: ‘shift-to-left’ and ‘shift-to-right’**
Coinciding with the twenty year trend in VLBW and
ELBW live births, we have also analysed the stillbirth
rate (‘shift-­to-­right’) and compared with that of the lockdown period. Even though WHO defines stillbirth for
fetal demise >28 weeks and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention defines >20 weeks; Irish CSO and Health
Service Executive applies >24 weeks and that definition
was applied to the study population.[22 34] In order to establish that the decline in VLBW and ELBW rate during the
lockdown was not secondary to an unexpected increase
in early pregnancy loss (EPL <12+6/7 completed weeks
of gestation) or terminations or miscarriages/late fetal
loss (<24 weeks of gestation) (collectively ‘shift-­to-­left’),
additional EPAU statistics and labour ward level data were
collected for 2016–2020 for the months of March to June.
As UMHL admits all infants with birth weight <2000 g to
the neonatal unit, we also ascertained the trend of low
birth weight (LBW <2.5 kg) infants of 1500–2000 g category for 2016–2019 and compared that with lockdown in
2020.
There was no increasing trend for EPL, miscarriages
or stillbirths at UMHL or the region during the study
period, confirming no ‘displacement of vital statistics’
due to ‘shift-­to-­left’ or ‘shift-­to-­right’ in mortality as the
main explanation for the VLBW and ELBW reduction
(table 3).

**Potential influence of termination of pregnancy on VLBW and**
**ELBW rates**
As one of the few developed regions of the world with
abortion legally banned till late 2018, Ireland offers a
unique opportunity to evaluate the natural history of
VLBW and ELBW births and the wider relation to socioenvironmental alterations.[35] Could the ELBW and
VLBW figures in early 2020 be explained partially by the
change in termination of pregnancy (TOP) law, allowing
for TOP beyond 12 weeks gestation in the presence of


-----

major congenital anomalies (MCA) that limits foetal
or neonatal viability? Examination of our regional and
national historical data suggest not.
Historical mean prevalence of MCA among our regional
cohort of VLBW from 2000 to 2018 (two decades of no
TOP) was 9.2% and the national means for 2014–2017
were 9%, 7%, 9% and 8%, respectively (55/596, 42/622,
54/593 and 51/612).[23] That is, less than 1 in every 10
VLBW involved MCA when no TOP was available. The
TOPs undertaken in 2019 and 2020 from January to April
(two in 2019 and four in 2020) beyond 12 weeks of gestation in our region were for MCA, in accordance with the
national guidelines on compassionate grounds.[35]

**COVID-19 lockdown triggered socioenvironmental and**
**behavioural modifiers**
The ‘Nature’s experiment’ through the COVID-19 lockdown could have triggered unparalleled and widespread
socioenvironmental alterations to which pregnant
women would have responded with appropriate behavioural and lifestyle modifications. Our observational
study is not designed to suggest causality or even association of specific factors or their particular influence
exerted on the unprecedented reduction of VLBW rate
from 8.18 (95% CI 7.21 to 9.29) to 2.17 (95% CI 0.70 to


6.74) per 1000 live births for the January to April period.
Potential modifiers, both facilitators and barriers, in socioenvironmental settings that would have influenced the
mother–fetus pair to reduce the rates of VLBW or ELBW
births during the COVID-19 lockdown and prelockdown
weeks of enhanced public health vigilance are summarised as a pictorogram (figure 3). Each one of the postulated reasons is supported by previous studies, often
controlling or observing one or two variables. However,
the COVID-19 lockdown possibly offered an unprecedented summative contribution of the socioenvironmental changes and behavioural modifications to impart
a contemporaneous beneficial effect during pregnancy.
An account of the previous studies favouring socioenvironmental and behavioural influence on VLBW and
[ELBW births is offered as an online supplemental file.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003075)

**COVID-19 lockdown triggered unfavourable social issues and**
**access to care**
It could be argued that that the lockdown impacted negatively on a subset of pregnant population due to imposed
restrictions and constraints on timely access to hospital-­
based monitoring for fetomaternal well-­being, possibly
resulting in delayed or deferred interventions. It is plausible that such deferred choices could have contributed to

the observed reduction in VLBW and ELBW rates. Pregnant women may have chosen to avoid hospital visits to
mitigate potential for COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19
triggered changes in obstetric service provision, staff
shortage, reduced number of ultrasound scans and
screening, all may have impacted clinical interventions.[36]
However, the absence of concurrent or paired increase in
EPL or miscarriages or stillbirths in our region, where the
access to maternity emergency services were functioning
uninterrupted throughout the lockdown, supports non-­
medical and societal contributions to observed significant reduction in the VLBW and ELBW numbers.

**Learning from the lockdown and societal approaches to**
**influence VLBW rates**
Only three VLBW and no ELBW infant admissions
to the only neonatal intensive care unit of one of the
health regions of Ireland from 1 January to 30 April
2020, resulted in a reduction to zero of morbidity
metrics primarily linked to extreme prematurity such
as necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity
and severe forms (grades 3 and 4) of intraventricular
haemorrhage. While the generalisation of the morbidity
reduction is limited by the small regional sample, our
findings highlights the prevention of ELBW births, if not
absolutely medically indicated, as an effective approach
in improving the high-­risk and high-­cost complications
associated with extreme prematurity.
Broadened preventive approaches based on socio-­
environmental alterations, stress reduction, nutritional
optimisation and lifestyle modifications based on underlying individual genetic and epigenetic variations may be
worth considering.[25] These observations, if replicated in
other regions globally during the pandemic and linked
with varying levels of socio-­environmental restrictions
triggered by COVID-19, could offer novel perspectives
and promising insights facilitating analysis of yet under-­
appreciated phenotypes of VLBW and ELBW births.
Statistical modelling approaches and big-­data analysis
principles would also be critical.[16]

Our observed trend in VLBW and ELBW births, if an
outcome of the COVID-19 enforced socioenvironmental
and behavioural changes, suggest it is reasonable to
postulate that, (1) the low numbers from early March
onwards was influenced by the effects of the prelockdown
period of extra public health vigilance that commenced
in mid-­February, (2) effects are immediate and (3) the
effects of lockdown will be seen in coming months and
sustainable until such time as normality influencers are
operating again. However, postlockdown deterioration in
socio-­environmental factors or a ‘baby boom’ in late 2020
could increase the VLBW and ELBW rates.
With limited international data published to date,
emerging report from Denmark suggested a nationwide reduction of extremely premature births in the
order of 90% during COVID-19 lockdown, compared
with the preceding 5 years.[37] A quasi-­experimental study
from Netherlands is suggesting reduction in PTB of all


strata during the various time windows of the lockdown,
compared with the preceding ten years.[38] Newspapers,
television and radio broadcasters as well as social media
outlets from around the world during the last 2 months
also report the possibility of an unexpected variation in
the very preterm and VLBW/ELBW rates from diverse
regions where a COVID-19 lockdown was imposed.[39–41]
However, reports of status quo or even an increase in
VLBW rates from certain cities and increase in stillbirth
rate[36] also raise the possibility that it is perhaps how
pregnant women respond to the cumulative socioenvironmental alterations and what level of medical, social,
familial and economic support systems are offered in
different countries or regions during the lockdown that
influences the fetomaternal outcome.

**Limitations, interpretations and generalisability**
The following limitations are acknowledged: (1)
Inherent reservations posed by retrospective nature of
the birth cohort data spanning over two decades from
one health region of Ireland; (2) Even though the vast
majority of the VLBW infants would be premature,
concurrent contribution by SGA and rarely severe IUGR
at term could be included. However, such an inclusion
consistently over two decades should reduce the bias and
the weight-­based inclusion criteria would allow comparison to national data by CSO, NPEC and internationally through VON; (3) Inclusion of January 2020, when
there was no lockdown or enhanced prelockdown public
health measures. This was required to make comparison
with the two decades of trends including the ‘first four
calendar months’; (4) Completion of the study prior to
the official finish of lockdown was to facilitate ease of
comparison against the coded historical monthly data,
timely data completion and analysis. However, we have
extended our observation through the entire lockdown
and the phase 1 and phase 2 of the easing as well (till end
of June 2020) and confirmed that our initial observation
sustained; (5) ELBW cohort could only be analysed with
limitations considering the small number of births; (6)
We caution the ‘no abortion policy’ that Ireland followed
till late 2018, when making international comparisons;
(7) The lockdown could have deferred what should
have been medically offered early during pregnancy,
thus arguably postponing the GA of intervention. Thus,
it could be viewed that the potential for reduced monitoring opportunities or the deferred early foetomaternal interventions during the lockdown could have
also ‘shifted the band’ from ELBW and VLBW to LBW
or normal weight and gestational category of infants; (8)
Our observations could either be due to the cumulative
socio-­environmental alterations and maternal behavioural modifications or due to deferred early obstetric
interventions or suboptimal timely access to the recommended antenatal monitoring. Our study is not designed
to confirm causality or reaffirm associations and the
postulated factors summarised in [figure 3 and online](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003075)
[supplemental file reflects compilation of already existing](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003075)

evidence; (9) Dataset from a regional sample in Ireland is
relatively small and thus not strictly reflecting every society’s behavioural and socioenvironmental response to the
country-­specific components of COVID-19 lockdown and
the offered support systems.

**CONCLUSION**
The Irish national lockdown in response to SARS-­CoV-2
virus (COVID-19) pandemic and the cumulative effects
of socioenvironmental variables such as maternal behavioural modifications, opportunities to WFH, potential
reduction in work related stresses, possible alleviation of physical strain related to work and commuting,
optimal opportunities for rest and sleep, likely increase
in partner presence and support at home, reduced exposure to infections, improved opportunities for nutritional
support and exercise as well as the positive alterations in
environment and air pollution, all could have possibly
contributed to the reduction in births involving VLBW
and ELBW infants. Potential contribution of deferred
early obstetric interventions or suboptimal access to
recommended antenatal monitoring, either due to institutional or patient level COVID-19-­related concerns,
shifting the birth weight spectrum also remains a possibility. Further research is needed to enhance our knowledge regarding the complex ways in which environmental, social, behavioural and biological factors interact
and modify the VLBW and ELBW births. We recommend
that WHO and national policy-­makers reflect on this
positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic, the insight
that it has provided, and seize the opportunity to support
further studies from geographically diverse regions evaluating implicated interdependent behavioural and socioenvironmental modifiers that may potentially influence
VLBW and ELBW births.
