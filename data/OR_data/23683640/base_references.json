            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The principles of community-based participatory (CBPR) research challenge traditional scientific standards of objectivity and neutrality. Little work has been done to evaluate the quality of data obtained from CBPR studies.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We examined factors associated with the completeness and quality of data that participants collected for the Community Health Effects of Industrial Hog Operations (CHEIHO) study, a community-based, participatory, longitudinal, epidemiologic investigation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twice daily for 2 weeks, 101 eastern North Carolina residents collected data on odor from industrialized hog operations, physical health, and mood. Data collected at a single point in time constitute a record. For each record, participant responses were classified as error free or not and missing or not. We used mixed models to quantify associations between errors or missing values and time of day, odor rating, week-in-participation, and presence of a person to assist with data collection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants collected data out of order in 2% of 2,949 total records. On average, individual variables were incomplete in 2% of records. Errors and missing data were most common for lung function measurements. Missing data for lung function and blood pressure were less common after the first week of participation (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.84). Saliva samples were more frequently missing when participants reported odor than when they did not (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.97-2.59). For women, the odds that yes/no variables were missing in week 2 records were higher relative to week 1 (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.01-2.12).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Community members collected relatively complete and consistent data. Better training in use of mechanical devices and more frequent input from researchers could help to improve data quality in CBPR studies."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite ample evidence that HIV has entered the general population, most HIV awareness programs in India continue to neglect rural areas. Low HIV awareness and high stigma, fueled by low literacy, seasonal migration, gender inequity, spatial dispersion, and cultural taboos pose extra challenges to implement much-needed HIV education programs in rural areas. This paper describes a peer education model developed to educate and empower low-literacy communities in the rural district of Perambalur (Tamil Nadu, India).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From January to December 2005, six non-governmental organizations (NGO's) with good community rapport collaborated to build and pilot-test an HIV peer education model for rural communities. The program used participatory methods to train 20 NGO field staff (Outreach Workers), 102 women's self-help group (SHG) leaders, and 52 barbers to become peer educators. Cartoon-based educational materials were developed for low-literacy populations to convey simple, comprehensive messages on HIV transmission, prevention, support and care. In addition, street theatre cultural programs highlighted issues related to HIV and stigma in the community.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The program is estimated to have reached over 30,000 villagers in the district through 2051 interactive HIV awareness programs and one-on-one communication. Outreach workers (OWs) and peer educators distributed approximately 62,000 educational materials and 69,000 condoms, and also referred approximately 2844 people for services including voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), care and support for HIV, and diagnosis and treatment of sexually-transmitted infections (STI). At least 118 individuals were newly diagnosed as persons living with HIV (PLHIV); 129 PLHIV were referred to the Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine (in Tambaram) for extra medical support. Focus group discussions indicate that the program was well received in the communities, led to improved health awareness, and also provided the peer educators with increased social status.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Using established networks (such as community-based organizations already working on empowerment of women) and training women's SHG leaders and barbers as peer educators is an effective and culturally appropriate way to disseminate comprehensive information on HIV/AIDS to low-literacy communities. Similar models for reaching and empowering vulnerable populations should be expanded to other rural areas."

Maternal and child health nurses (MCHN) in Victoria, Australia are community-based nurse/midwives who see over 95% of all mothers with newborns. MCHN are in an ideal position to identify and support women experiencing IPV, or refer them to specialist family violence services. Evidence for IPV screening in primary health care is inconclusive to date. The Victorian government recently required nurses to screen all mothers when babies are four weeks old, offering an opportunity to examine the effectiveness of MCHN IPV screening practices. This protocol describes the development and design of MOVE, a study to examine IPV screening effectiveness and the sustainability of screening practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      MOVE is a cluster randomised trial of a good practice model of MCHN IPV screening involving eight maternal and child health nurse teams in Melbourne, Victoria. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was incorporated into the design, implementation and evaluation of the MOVE trial to enhance and evaluate sustainability. Using NPT, the development stage combined participatory action research with intervention nurse teams and a systematic review of nurse IPV studies to develop an intervention model incorporating consensus guidelines, clinical pathway and strategies for individual nurses, their teams and family violence services. Following twelve months' implementation, primary outcomes assessed include IPV inquiry, IPV disclosure by women and referral using data from MCHN routine data collection and a survey to all women giving birth in the previous eight months. IPV will be measured using the Composite Abuse Scale. Process and impact evaluation data (online surveys and key stakeholders interviews) will highlight NPT concepts to enhance sustainability of IPV identification and referral. Data will be collected again in two years.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      MOVE will be the first randomised trial to determine IPV screening effectiveness in a community based nurse setting and the first to examine sustainability of an IPV screening intervention.

The participatory ergonomics program included an initiative, problem identification, a selection of solutions, an implementation and evaluation. Twenty-eight women, all operators on an assembly line of cell phone boards, voluntarily participated in the design and evaluation of a device before implementing the device to all 215 employees performing that job. Prior to and after the intervention, RULA, comfort experiences and interviews were used. After introducing an adjustable angled small counter, these measurements showed both posture and comfort improvements. 90% of the 215 workers preferred the new work station and the neck complaints were reduced in 75% of the group. It also showed that the initial prototype needed to be modified as to reduce its sharp edges/compression points for the forearm. This project shows the importance of iterative testing and that an initiative by workers enlarges the chance of successful implementation."

            "abstract": "In South Africa, both HIV and gender-based violence are highly prevalent. Gender inequalities give men considerable relational power over young women, particularly in circumstances of poverty and where sex is materially rewarded. Young women are often described as victims of men, but this inadequately explains women's observed sexual agency. This paper takes a different approach. We use qualitative interviews and ethnographic observation among 16 young women from the rural Eastern Cape to explore ways young women construct their femininities and exercise agency. The data were collected as part of an evaluation of Stepping Stones, which is a participatory behavioural intervention for HIV prevention that seeks to be gender transformative. Agency was most notable in particular stages of the dating 'game', especially relationship initiation. Constructions of desirable men differed but generally reflected a wish to avoid violence, and a search for mutual respect, sexual pleasure, romance, modernity, status and money. Agency was constrained once relationships were consented to, as men expected to control their partners, using violent and non-violent methods. Women knew this and many accepted this treatment, although often expressing ambivalence. Many of the women expressed highly acquiescent femininities, with power surrendered to men, as a 'choice' that made their lives in cultural terms more meaningful. In marked contrast to this was a 'modern' femininity, centred around a desire to be 'free'. A visible third position, notably emerging after the Stepping Stones intervention, rested not on a feminist challenge to patriarchy, but on an accommodation with men's power whilst seeking to negotiate greater respect and non-violence within relations with men. These multiple and dynamic femininities open up possibilities for change. They demonstrate the need to engage with women, both as victims of patriarchy and active supporters of the gender order. The multiplicity of women's hopes and desires and circumstances of emotional and relational fulfillment provides potential for interventions with women that acknowledge existing gender inequalities, validate women's agency, reduce violence and prevent HIV."

This article uses concepts from Amartya Sen's work on inequality to frame gender issues in science and technology policy. Programs that focus on increasing the number of women in science and engineering careers have not generally addressed a broader set of circumstances that intersect with gender at various economic levels and stages of life. The agendas in research and innovation policies also need to reflect these issues, and fair allocation of resources within both science and technology needs to be on the agenda. Getting women into high-level positions is not enough. Articulating the full research and innovation agendas for women will require broader participatory processes."

Women of reproductive age were recruited from Eastern Cape and Gauteng Provinces, South Africa. Information on women's fertility desires and pregnancy planning was collected through participatory workshop, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews. Three main themes emerged. Women living with HIV require information on the impact of HIV on pregnancy outcomes and vice versa. Women who are young, lost a child, not consistently using contraception or who have not been seriously ill have positive reproductive aspirations. Ambivalent attitudes of health care workers towards pregnancy impacts women's fertility aspirations. Unbiased pre-conceptual communication should form part of HIV treatment and care services, despite expressed pregnancy intentions."

However, only 35% of pregnant women in the study were screened in the practices. Changes required throughout the whole care pathway make wider implementation more difficult than at first realised. The cost within general practice is greater than initially appreciated owing to a perceived need to provide counselling about other issues at the same time. Practitioners considered that other ways of early screening should be explored, including preconceptual screening. The research approach was able to bring into view unexpected effects of the innovation, but health workers were unfamiliar with the participatory processes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Antenatal screening for haemoglobinopathies in general practice lowers the gestational age at which an at-risk pregnancy can be identified.

Government and organization-sponsored fish advisories have had limited success in changing behaviors. Participatory approaches may enhance the understanding of complex issues and the adoption of new behaviors. Here we used social network analysis to investigate the adoption of dietary changes within the context of a community participatory research project. In the Brazilian Amazon, many communities are highly exposed to methylmercury from fish consumption. A participatory intervention based on dietary changes aimed at reducing methylmercury exposure while maintaining fish consumption was initiated in 1995. In 2001, we collected data on individual participation in the research, on the discussion network regarding mercury issues and on changes in fish consumption from 96 of the 110 village households. More than half of men and women had adopted new fish consumption behavior to reduce mercury exposure. Adoption was associated with participation in the research project for both women and men, and with a higher number of discussion partners about mercury issues for women. Adoption was likewise associated with the presence of a female communication partner in the personal networks of both men and women. At the household level, men and women who considered their spouse as a discussion partner were more likely to adopt than those who did not. Opinion le]adership was associated with change in fish consumption only for women. We discuss the contribution of community participation and communication networks to overcome the difficulties in generating complex messages that take into account both health benefits and risks of fish consumption. We also discuss the relevance of building preventive health programs based on participatory research approaches and the roles and relations specific to men and women."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of 12-month risk-based multifactorial fall prevention program on postural control of the aged. Five hundred and ninety-one (97%) eligible subjects were randomized into an intervention group (IG) (n=293) and a control group (CG) (n=298). The effects of the program were measured on standing, dynamic, and functional balance. In standing balance, the velocity moment of semi-tandem standing decreased in IG (median change -0.54 mm(2)/s) but increased in CG (+3.84 mm(2)/s) among all women (p=0.011) and among the women aged 65-74 years (-1.65 mm(2)/s and +2.80 mm(2)/s, correspondingly) (p=0.008). In a dynamic test, performance distance tended to decrease in IG (-26.54 mm) and increase in CG (+34.10mm) among all women (p=0.060). The women aged 75 years or over, showed marginally significant differences between the groups as regards changes in performance time (-2.66 s and -0.90 s) (p=0.068) and distance (-92.32 mm and +76.46 mm) (p=0.062) of the dynamic balance test in favor of IG. Men showed no significant differences in the changes between the groups in any balance measures."

            "abstract": "This paper examines the concept and practice of community participation in World Bank-supported health sector reforms in Asia, and how far such participation has strengthened accountability with regard to provision of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. It argues that the envisaged scope of community participation within a majority of reforms in Asia has been limited to programme management and service delivery, and it is occurring within the boundaries of priorities that are defined through non-participatory processes. Setting up of community health structures, decentralization and community financing are three important strategies used for promoting participation and accountability within reforms. The scant evidence on the impact of these strategies suggests that marginalized groups and sexual and reproductive rights based groups are poorly represented in the forums for participation, and that hierarchies of power between and amongst health personnel and the public play out in these forums. Community financing has not lead to enhanced service accountability. As a result of the above limitations, community participation in health sector reforms has rarely strengthened accountability with respect to provision of comprehensive SRH services. In this context, rights (including sexual and reproductive) based groups and researchers need to engage with design, monitoring and evaluation of health sector reforms, both from inside as participants and outside as pressure groups. Participation contracts enhancing powers of civil society representatives, quotas for participation (for women, other marginalized groups and rights-based organizations), and investment in capacity building of these stakeholders on leadership and sexual reproductive rights and health are pre-requisites if participation is to lead to health and SRH service accountability. Community participation and service accountability hence requires more and not less investment of resources by the state."

The present study contains data from a participatory evaluation of a multisite national demonstration project on family violence (the Greenbook Initiative), funded jointly by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice. The goal of this initiative was to increase community capacity to assist dually victimized families. This article focuses on the DV service organizations in the demonstration with regard to collaborations with other agencies and work within the DV system to respond to dually victimized families.

Using a community-based participatory approach, academic and community-based partners conducted an iterative process to assess barriers, facilitators and potential mediating interventions for breastfeeding in the African-American community in Durham, North Carolina. METHODS: Eight focus groups were conducted with African-American mothers, fathers and grandmothers. Researchers transcribed and coded each focus group and analyzed using Atlas ti. 5.2. Patterns and themes that emerged informed the development of community stakeholder interviews; 41 interviews were conducted with community representatives. These findings informed the development of a support group pilot intervention. The pilot support groups were evaluated for increase in knowledge of attendees. RESULTS: Focus group and community interviews indicate that African Americans may disproportionately experience inadequate support for breastfeeding. This lack of support was reported in the home, the workplace, among peers, and from healthcare providers. The pilot support groups resulted in increased knowledge of breastfeeding among group participants OR=3.6 (95% CI: 2.5, 5.2). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this research underscore the importance of a multi-level approach to breastfeeding support for African American women to address breastfeeding disparities."

This paper describes the current situation of abortion and contraception in Romania, based on national statistics, recent reproductive health surveys and the findings of a strategic assessment led by the Ministry of Health in late 2001. This rapid assessment employed a participatory, qualitative methodology. Over 500 people were interviewed from 145 institutions in 25 cities, towns and villages in Romania, about the range of actions needed to prevent unwanted pregnancies, reduce abortion-related morbidity and mortality and improve the quality, accessibility and availability of abortion and contraceptive services. Although much progress has been made in contraceptive services over the past ten years, improvements in abortion care have lagged considerably The assessment played an important role in raising team members' awareness and motivation to take action. Some of the issues identified are already being addressed by the institutions that took part. National standards and guidelines for comprehensive abortion care have been developed, contraceptive services have been expanded at primary health care level, sexual and reproductive health education provided by classroom teachers has been introduced in schools, and a study to test a model of comprehensive abortion care services for Romania is planned."

Ethnic groups gave details of nutrition-related beliefs and practices; the teams found that many of these are likely to be amenable to change through relatively low-cost nutrition promotion informed by these findings. In particular, barriers to exclusive breastfeeding, food taboos and hygiene behaviour could be addressed.

These four different cost figures match four different types of potentially relevant decisions contexts. Depending on the decision context the total costs, and hence the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a health promotion intervention, could differ considerably.

Health education sessions were used to instruct community members to select female CDHWs in Masya Parish and to stress their potential importance in Karangara Parish; this subject was not raised in Mukono Parish. In all, 403 mature women who were randomly selected from the three parishes were interviewed as to their: (1) knowledge of the classes of people not eligible to take ivermectin; (2) knowledge and beliefs about the benefits of ivermectin; (3) participation in decision-making; and (4) attitudes on the performance of female CDHWs. For analysis, the respondees were divided into: (1) those who had or had not taken ivermectin treatment during the previous year; and (2) those who had or had not attended health education sessions. During the period when face-to-face interviews with women in randomly selected households were being carried out, participatory evaluation meetings (PEMs) were conducted in selected communities from the same parishes in order to reach a consensus on issues which could not easily be included in individual face-to-face interviews. Participant observations were also made regarding: how communities selected their CDHWs; how the CDHWs organised the distribution exercise and treated community members; and how the CDHWs kept records in order to understand issues which were deliberately hidden from the researchers during face-to-face interviews and PEMs. Significantly, the women who had been treated or health educated in Masya Parish were: (1) more knowledgeable on the groups which were not supposed to be treated; (2) aware of women's involvement in mobilisation of other community members; (3) involved in CDTI decision-making; and (4) had a better attitude towards female CDHWs' performance compared with males when compared with those from Karangara and Mukono parishes. There were no differences between the attitude of women in Karangara and Mukono parishes towards performance of female CDHWs. Face-to-face interviews and records from all parishes indicated that female CDHWs achieved as good a coverage as their male counterparts, and sometimes better, in about the same time. Health education increased the number of female CDHWs from nine to 52 in Masya Parish, from 7 to 22 in Karangara Parish and from 6 to 20 in Mukono Parish. Health education improved the attitude of women towards female CDHWs, but the actual experience of having and observing female CDHWs in action in Masya Parish had a more significant positive impact on the womenfolk, as well as on the rest of the community members, and created an impetus for more of them to become actively involved in actual ivermectin distribution. The present authors conclude that recruiting more female CDHWs and supervisors would reduce the current male domination of the health delivery services, greatly strengthening the activities of CDTI programmes."

Our research interest has focused on how community nurses can assist people living with chronic conditions to live 'well'. In this paper we describe the way in which we have applied the principles of participatory action research (PAR) when working with women who live with multiple sclerosis (MS) and urinary incontinence.

In terms of tentative findings, men and women living with a chronic illness appear to be involved in an ongoing process of transition toward incorporating the illness into their lives.

This provides a detailed examination of the demolition of Baina, one of India's large red-light areas, in 2004, and one of the first accounts of the effect of dismantling the red-light area on the organisation of sex-work and sex-workers' sexual risk. The results suggest that the concentrated and homogeneous brothel-based sex-work environment rapidly evolved into heterogeneous, clandestine and dispersed modes of operation. The social context of sex-work that emerged from the dust of the demolition was higher risk and less conducive to HIV prevention. The demolition acted as a negative structural intervention; a catastrophic event that fragmented sex-workers' collective identity and agency and rendered them voiceless and marginalised. The findings suggest that an abolitionist approach to sex-work and legislation or policy that either criminalises this large group of women, or renders them as invisible victims, will increase the stigma and exclusion they experience. For the targeted HIV prevention approaches advocated by the National AIDS Control Programme to be effective, there is a need for legislation and policy that supports sex-workers' agency and self-organisation and enables them to create a safer working environment for themselves."

            "abstract": "In this article, the author explores the importance of participatory, respectful, and community-specific approaches to research relationships across differences in social location and experience. Drawing on transcripts from group interviews with 6 young Aboriginal mothers from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside who had experienced substance use during pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome/fetal alcohol effects, she discusses three practical strategies used in her doctoral research to address the empirical and methodological implications of this work: the provision of honoraria, collaborating with community leaders in participant recruitment, and the use of shared analysis in group interviews. Shared analysis in the group interviews was integral to supporting policy analysis that challenges the privatization of mothering and substance use. Group interviews can benefit both the participants and the research, support womens' agency, and democratize the research process while mitigating the potential for the misrepresentation and appropriation of women's experiences."

It explores alternative psychological 'practices', for example participatory action research, with groups historically marginalized from access to power and resources. Selected lenses for crafting a liberatory psychology include: discourse of human rights and mental health; cultural and constructivist psychological theory; and reflexivity. Specific examples from the author's work with Mayan women in rural Guatemala in the context of ongoing war and subsequent efforts at peace building are discussed to clarify possible contributions of psychologists committed to accompanying local communities in creating more just futures.

            "abstract": "Executive summary:\n        \n      \n      Background A great burden of infant and under-five childhood mortality occurs during the neonatal period, usually within a few days of birth. Community based behavioural change communication (such as interpersonal, group and mass media channels, including participatory methods at community level) intervention trials have been shown to be effective in reducing this mortality. However, to guide policy makers and programme planners, there is a need to systematically appraise and synthesise this evidence.Objective To systematically search, appraise and synthesise the best available evidence on the effect of community based behavioural change communication intervention to improve neonatal mortality in developing countries.Inclusion Criteria This review considered randomised controlled community trials on the effectiveness of community based behavioural change communication interventions aimed at decreasing neonatal mortality that were conducted in developing countries.Search Strategy This review considered English language articles on studies published between December, 2006 to January, 2011 and indexed in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mednar, popline, Proquest, or Hinari.Methodological quality Studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistical Assessment and Review Instrument by two independent reviewers. Data were analysed using a fixed effects model with RevMan5 software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Community based behavioural change communication interventions were found to be associated with a significant reduction in neonatal mortality of 19% (average OR 0.81; 95%CI 0. to 0.88), early neonatal mortality by 20% (average 0.80; 95%CI 0. to 0.91), late neonatal mortality by 21% (average 0.79; 95%CI 0. to 0.99). In addition, the intervention also resulted in significant improvement of newborn care practice; breast feeding initiation, clean cord cutting and delay in bathing were improved by 185%, 110% and 196% respectively.Conclusions Community-based behavioural change communication interventions such as health education, information education and communication, behavioural change communication, social mobilisation, community mobilisation, community conversation, and home based counselling were found to be associated with a significant reduction in neonatal mortality, early neonatal mortality and post neonatal mortality. The findings of this systematic review call for integration of such interventions into conventional strategies in developing countries.Implications for practice This systematic review has shown that community based behavioural change communication interventions that are implemented through community health volunteers and other community based health workers, targeted at pregnant women and also involving influential people such as mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law and husbands/partners, consistently demonstrated that community based intervention packages significantly reduced early neonatal, late neonatal and neonatal mortality rates and also have a pivotal role in improving household newborn care practice. Thus, this review provides encouraging evidence of the value of integrating newborn care and neonatal mortality reduction strategies into community based approaches.Implications for research The review findings were largely derived from a limited number of community trials from developing regions, particularly the African setting. Thus, there is a clear need for additional research on a larger scale and in more varied settings. There is also a need for more evidence based on higher quality research. The cost effectiveness of these community based interventions may impact on their adoption; however it was outside the scope of this review. Cost-effectiveness of these interventions should become a priority area for future research."

            "abstract": "Depression is a topic that is often avoided in discussions among Black women for a myriad of reasons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the midlife health of Black women living in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. This paper will present one of the key findings of this research; midlife depression. It will examine the factors associated with depression among mid-life African Canadian women and how these women deal with depression. A triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods guided by the principles of participatory action research (PAR) was used in the study. Data collection methods included 50 in-depth interviews of mid-life African Canadian women aged 40-65, focus groups, and workshops as well as the CES-D structured instrument. Purposive sampling method was the primary recruitment strategy and 113 people participated in the study. Although the women rarely openly discussed depression, they described depression as emotional feelings that range from \"feeling blue\" to being clinically depressed. Women viewed midlife depression as the consequence of a complex set of circumstances and stressors that they face. At midlife, Black women frequently recognize the importance of greater self-care and the need to pay more attention to their health, but they are reluctant to do so because they have to be \"strong\" in order to deal with their daily experiences of racism. Racism, among other things, leads to accumulated stress and undermines Black women's ability to cope and make healthy life choices. This signifies the implications of these research findings for clinical practice."

The design and implementation of the project were influenced by Paulo Freire's pedagogy in the Latin American tradition of 'popular' education, by Bandura's self-efficacy concepts, and by David Warner's 'barefoot doctor' community health care methodology. Using these approaches the participants were directly involved in the development of teaching materials, and curriculum content and implementation of the project. The programme was evaluated quantitatively using NIDA's AIDS Intake and Follow-up Assessment (AIA/AFA) questionnaires, and qualitatively using open ended interviews. While the AIA/AFA questionnaires detected small changes in the frequency of condom use among the participants, ethnographic interviews detected significant changes in the nature of the behaviours which were placing the women at risk. The changes seem to stem from an increase in the degree of self-esteem, self-efficacy and awareness of the social, economic, and political constraints of their lives. These results demonstrate the need for qualitative measures to be incorporated in the evaluation of community based health education programmes. A series of recommendations is presented to facilitate further development and replication of the programme in similar populations."

Collected from 12 study work sites, baseline data indicated that IPV rates were higher among blue-collar women in eastern North Carolina than national population-based rates suggest. IPV victims reported higher levels of perceived stress, psychological distress, somatic complaints, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than did nonvictimized coworkers. As for the relationship of the flood to IPV, no significant increase in IPV incidence occurred after the flood. Regardless of their flood experience, however, IPV victims consistently reported greater stress, PTSD symptoms, and somatic and psychological problems. Moreover, IPV victims may be at higher risk for stress-mediated chronic illnesses and for using negative coping behaviors.

We conducted an intervention in rural South Africa that combined group-based microfinance with participatory gender and HIV training in an attempt to catalyze changes in solidarity, reciprocity and social group membership as a means to reduce women's vulnerability to intimate partner violence and HIV. A cluster randomized trial was used to assess intervention effects among eight study villages. In this paper, we examined effects on structural and cognitive social capital among 845 participants and age and wealth matched women from households in comparison villages. This was supported by a diverse portfolio of qualitative research. After two years, adjusted effect estimates indicated higher levels of structural and cognitive social capital in the intervention group than the comparison group, although confidence intervals were wide. Qualitative research illustrated the ways in which economic and social gains enhanced participation in social groups, and the positive and negative dynamics that emerged within the program. There were numerous instances where individuals and village loan centres worked to address community concerns, both working through existing social networks, and through the establishment of new partnerships with local leadership structures, police, the health sector and NGOs. This is among the first experimental trials suggesting that social capital can be exogenously strengthened. The implications for community interventions in public health are further explored."

It also explores important implications for future research. Shedding light on the circumstances, perspectives, and lived realities of Indigenous women of childbearing age, could encourage further qualitative investigation and mitigate negative outcomes through improved understanding of the topic, targeted culturally appropriate interventions, and recommendations for future policy and programming reformations."

It articulates that physician-patient communication style mediates the positive relation between health orientation and relationship satisfaction. Based on a nationally representative sample of 2,636 respondents (48% men and 52% women) gathered in 1999, the study results support the mediating mechanism for key health-orientation variables such as health-consciousness attitude, health-information orientation, health-oriented beliefs, and healthy activities. As opposed to the development of universal communicative interventions that equip patients with communication skills, the project documents the importance of tailoring the health care provider's communicative style depending on the needs of the patient."

            "abstract": "Before the 1920s, a birth control movement arose in the United States out of socialist, feminist, and other radical groups concerned with women's rights and sexual freedom. After 1920 the birth control movement became gradually transformed into a respectable, nonradical reform cause, the recipient of large grants from big business, with women's rights secondary to an overriding concern with medical health and population control. This transformation was achieved through the professionalization of the birth control movement-that is, its takeover by professional experts, almost all male, in place of the radical amateur women, fighting for their own interests, who initiated it. The article examines two groups of professionals who were particularly influential in this transformation: doctors and academic eugenists. The former made birth control a medical issue, held back the development of popular sex education, and stifled a previously developing feminist approach to women's birth control needs. The later contributed racism to the birth control movement, helping to transform it into a population control movement with racist and anti-feminist overtones. Both groups, while they made contributions to the technology of contraception, simultaneously held back the spread of birth control by transforming the campaign for it from a popular, participatory cause to a professional staff lobbying operation."

            "abstract": "Internationally, there is an increasing focus on quality and sustainability measures oriented to reducing inefficiencies in health provision. The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for older women represents a case study in this area. This paper analyses the constructions of evidence brought to bear by ART physicians in the context of deliberative stakeholder engagements (held 2010) around options for restricting public subsidy of ART in Australia. Physicians participated in two deliberative engagements during which they were presented with results of a systematic review of ART effectiveness, as well as ethical and cost analyses. These sessions were part of a broader research program of engagements held with policymakers, community members and consumers. Physicians deliberated around the data presented with a view to formulating an informed contribution to policy. The ensuing discussions were transcribed and subject to discourse analysis. Physicians questioned the evidence presented on the grounds of 'currency', 'proximity', 'selectivity' and 'bias'. We outline physicians' accounts of what should count as evidence informing ART policy, and how this evidence should be counted. These accounts reflect implicit decisions around both the inclusion of evidence (selection) and the status it is accorded (evaluation). Our analysis suggests that participatory policy processes do not represent the simple task of assessing the quality/effectiveness of a given technology against self-evident criteria. Rather, these processes involve the negotiation of different orders of evidence (empirical, contextual and anecdotal), indicating a need for higher-level discussion around 'what counts and how to count it' when making disinvestment decisions."

Our objectives are to: (1) gender-disaggregate data about stakeholders' risk perceptions associated with human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in a participatory conservation context, and (2) highlight insights from characterizing gendered similarities and differences in the way people think about HWC-related risks. Two communal conservancies in Caprivi, Namibia served as case study sites. We analyzed data from focus groups (n = 2) to create gendered concept maps about risks to wildlife and livelihoods and any associations of those risks with HWC, and semi-structured interviews (n = 76; men = 38, women = 38) to measure explicit risk attitudes associated with HWC. Concept maps indicated some divergent perceptions in how groups characterized risks to wildlife and livelihoods; however, not only were identified risks to wildlife (e.g., pollution, hunting) dissimilar in some instances, descriptions of risks varied as well. Study groups reported similar risk perceptions associated with HWC with the exception of worry associated with HWC effects on local livelihoods. Gendered differences in risk perceptions may signal different priorities or incentives to participate in efforts to resolve HWC-related risks. Thus, although shared goals and interests may seem to be an obvious reason for cooperative wildlife management, it is not always obvious that management goals are shared. Opportunity exists to move beyond thinking about gender as an explanatory variable for understanding how different groups think about participating in conservation activities."

Sam Houston (63% for men and 74% for women). An intervention program was initiated with two AIT Battalions (BN) in an effort to reduce overuse injuries. The purpose of this paper is to describe methods of tracking the participation of supervisors during the intervention program. Methods used to monitor participation included recording the number of coordinating meetings, keeping minutes of advisory committee meetings, and conducting perception surveys. Over an 18-month period, the number of coordinating meetings decreased. Surveys identified the opinions, values, and self-identified roles of supervisors (drill sergeants and cadre) in regard to injury prevention with their assigned student-soldiers before and after an intervention program. At the initiation of the injury control program, 103 individuals completed a 27 question, anonymous survey to assist planners with developing a strategy that would encourage participation of cadre and drill sergeants in preventing injuries. One year later, 191 individuals from the same battalion completed the same survey. Results revealed a slight, statistically insignificant, decrease in supervisors' perception of the presence of overuse injuries in their BN (31.4% vs. 27.4%, p>0.05), and the level of acceptable injuries moved from the 16-30% range to the 1-10% range (chi2=4.65, p<0.05). Post-intervention, more supervisors believed their physical training programs could impact overuse injuries (pre 20.4% vs. post 31.6%, Chi2=6.7, p<0.01). The results reveal several methods to track the involvement of participants, to develop intervention strategies, and to monitor cultural shifts necessary to the injury control process."

This study aims to determine effective strategies for increasing breast cancer screening in at-risk underserved Arab American women. AMBER utilizes a community based participatory approach to conduct formative research and program interventions, including culturally appropriate Arabic language breast cancer education, screening coordination, and cultural competency training for healthcare professionals in New York City. In 2 years, 597 women were educated, 189 underserved women were identified as being in need of assistance, 68 were screened, one new case of breast cancer was detected, and four active cases in need of follow-up reconnected with care. The AMBER model is an important intervention for breast cancer screening and care in the underserved Arab American community."

            "abstract": "The NGO Service Delivery Program (NSDP), a USAID-funded programme, is the largest NGO programme in Bangladesh. Its strategic flagship activity is the essential services package through which healthcare services are administered by NGOs in Bangladesh. The overall goal of the NSDP is to increase access to essential healthcare services by communities, especially the poor. Recognizing that the poorest in the community often have no access to essential healthcare services due to various barriers, a study was conducted to identify what the real barriers to access by the poor are. This included investigations to further understand the perceptions of the poor of real or imagined barriers to accessing healthcare; ways for healthcare centres to maximize services to the poor; how healthcare providers can maximize service-use; inter-personal communication between healthcare providers and those seeking healthcare among the poor; and ways to improve the capacity of service providers to reach the poorest segment of the community. The study, carried out in two phases, included 24 static and satellite clinics within the catchment areas of eight NGOs under the NSDP in Bangladesh, during June-September 2003. Participatory urban and rural appraisal techniques, focus-group discussions, and in-depth interviews were employed as research methods in the study. The target populations in the study included males and females, service-users and non-users, and special groups, such as fishermen, sex workers, potters, Bedes (river gypsies), and lower-caste people-all combined representing a heterogeneous community. The following four major categories of barriers emerged as roadblocks to accessing quality healthcare for the poor: (a) low income to be able to afford healthcare, (b) lack of awareness of the kind of healthcare services available, (c) deficiencies and inconsistencies in the quality of services, and (d) lack of close proximity to the healthcare facility. Those interviewed perceived their access problems to be: (a) a limited range of NGO services available as they felt what are available do not meet their demands; (b) a high service-charge for the healthcare services they sought; (c) higher prices of drugs at the facility compared to the market place; (d) a belief that the NGO clinics are primarily to serve the rich people, (e) lack of experienced doctors at the centres; and (f) the perception that the facility and its services were more oriented to women and children, but not to males. Others responded that they should be allowed to get treatment with credit and, if needed, payment should be waived for some due to their poverty level. While the results of the study revealed many perceptions of barriers to healthcare services by the poor, the feedback provided by the study indicates how important it is to learn from the poorest segment of society. This will assist healthcare providers and the healthcare system itself to become more sensitized to the needs and problems faced by this segment of the society and to make recommendations to remove barriers and improvement of access. Treatment with credit and waived payment for the poorest were also recommended as affordable alternative private healthcare services for the poor."

            "abstract": "Around 1990, when in other countries mangrove protection took off, massive conversion of mangrove forest into shrimp ponds started in the Mahakam delta. To identify constraints to and options for sustainable management we analysed institutions and constraints with stakeholders. In 3 sites we used participatory tools and a complementary survey to assess the livelihood framework. Since 1970, ponds for shrimp farming gradually replaced 75% of mangrove forested area. After 2004, recovery of mangrove took off, as, mainly due to low shrimp yields, ponds were abandoned. In 2008, 54% of the delta was dedicated to ponds for shrimp production. Around 80% of livelihood activities of pond-farmers, pond caretakers, and fishermen was related to mangroves. The involvement of men and women in these activities varied between sites and types. Poor households depended more on mangroves. Most activities resulted in seasonal income peaks; only a few activities resulted in a full daily livelihood. Ponds, on the other hand, provide 50% of households' livelihood, but this remains vulnerable in the context of the risky shrimp production. Skewed land holding, unequal sharing of benefits, competing claims and vested interests of stakeholders pose a great challenge to a transition to a more sustainable use of the mangrove area. In particular, ponds located on peat soils are non-sustainable and would require full restoration into mangrove; ponds on other soils could best be transformed into a mixed mangrove-pond system using a 'green-water' technology."

The purpose of this study was to describe how women talked about living through PPD in the context of a peer support group. This focused ethnography was a component of a larger participatory action study in northern Ontario, Canada. The seven members of a 5-week peer support group described their postpartum experiences through written, visual, and spoken stories. Using structural narrative analysis, stories about recovery were identified across the data. Three groups of recovery stories were labelled as illness, mothering wisdom, and mobilizing. The findings suggested that women actively sought and established a therapeutic space for PPD recovery with peers.

The MOCEH network includes one coordinating center, four local centers responsible for recruiting pregnant women, and four evaluation centers (a nutrition center, bio-repository center, neurocognitive development center, and environment assessment center). At the local centers, trained nurses interview the participants to gather information regarding their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, complications related to the current gestation period, health behaviors and environmental factors.

Methods included participant observation of food and nutrition practices in the homes of five socially disadvantaged families and at a community drop-in center in a low-income neighborhood; in-depth individual interviews with family members; and group interviews with an additional 28 participants at the community center. Tape recordings and field observation notes were analyzed thematically, preserving the perspectives of the research participants. The explication began with the examination of the everyday household work of feeding the family which provided an entry point to broader social relations working outside of the households, but evident within them. At the household level, the gendered, 'invisible' nature of feeding work became readily apparent. The class context of feeding work became particularly evident upon examination of the practice of procuring food. The apparently simple act of buying groceries was complicated by limited access to inexpensive stores. The families developed innovative strategies to enhance their abilities to procure food within their limited means. However, because of inadequacies of subsistence welfare policies, they frequently were sufficiently short of funds to necessitate reliance on charity for food. Analysis of such social policy revealed that public and professional discourses organizing nutritional inequities were informed by individualistic ideology. Yet, individualistic discourses could not provide an adequate understanding of the experiences of the research participants. The impact of individualistic professional discourse included the irrelevance of nutrition education practices based upon information dissemination. In sum, the research revealed nutritional inequities as embedded within social constructs such as gender, class, commerce, policy and discourse. The educative nature of the participatory research process empowered study participants to initiate structural change in commercial pricing practices. Through making the analysis available to others, including policy makers, it may be possible to work toward changing the oppressive social organization which perpetuates inequities. The research calls for a reorientation in community educational practice from the dominant individual orientation to a social orientation."

Between 1995 and 1999, a multisectoral intervention called Plan Cayo Hueso was launched in the inner-city community of Cayo Hueso in Havana, Cuba, to address a variety of health determinants. To provide a better understanding of the political structures and processes involved, the Cuban context is described briefly. The interventions included improvements in housing, municipal infrastructure, and social and cultural activities. A qualitative study, consisting of interviews of key informants as well as community members, was conducted to evaluate the community participatory process. Questions from an extensive household survey pre- and postintervention that had been conducted in Cayo Hueso and a comparison community to assess the effectiveness of the intervention also informed the analysis of community participation, as did three community workshops held to choose indicators for evaluating effectiveness and to discuss findings. It was found that formal leaders led the interventions, providing the institutional driving force behind the plan. However, extensive community involvement occurred as the project took advantage of the existing community-based organizations, which played an active role in mobilizing community members and enhanced linkage systems critical to the project's success. Women played fairly traditional roles in interventions outside their households, but had equivalent roles to men in interventions within their household units. Most impressive about this project was the extent of mobilization to participate and the multidimensional ecosystem approach adopted. Indeed, Plan Cayo Hueso involved a massive mobilization of international, national, and community resources to address the needs of this community. This, as well as the involvement of community residents in the evaluation process, was seen as resulting in improved social interactions and community well-being and enhanced capacity for future action. While Cuba is unique in many respects, the lessons learned about enhancing community participation in urban health intervention projects, as well as in their evaluation, are applicable worldwide."

A landmark analysis on the effect of cancer-directed surgery on survival after adjusting for patient and disease characteristics demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.68 (p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of malignant pleural mesothelioma has remained constant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The rate of surgical intervention in the community is lower compared with tertiary referral centers. Age, stage, and race predict the likelihood of receiving cancer-directed surgery. A lower rate of cancer-directed surgery and worse overall outcome were observed in black patients. As part of quality assurance, referral of patients to centers with multidisciplinary programs that include thoracic surgical expertise should be considered."

            "abstract": "Hospitalisation can be a traumatic experience for any child and family but the experience can be significantly more so for Indigenous parents and children from remote areas of Australia. Despite the importance of this issue for child and family health and for Indigenous health, the hospitalisation experiences of Indigenous families and children have received almost no research attention. This paper describes selected findings from a recently completed Honours research study which used the participatory and collaborative Indigenous research approach of Dadirri to explore this question. Following a brief description of the methodology of Dadirri, the paper presents the participating families' depictions of their experiences of 'Coming Down' and 'Being in Hospital', where they revealed the extent and effects of marked culture shock. The significant cultural differences between staff and Indigenous families contributed to the parents' sense of fear, powerlessness and isolation from their child, home community and culture. For these families this isolation was not merely geographic but intricately linked to their health and wellbeing."

However, very little attention has been paid to the socio-economic factors that are likely to influence the outcome of the interventions in the control of these diseases. Thus, this study was designed to investigate these factors, mainly the intra-household factors influencing decision-making in the control of Vector-borne diseases in the pastoralist areas of Uganda. These factors included: indigenous technical knowledge, household economic factors, and gender. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the collection and analysis of data. The tools used for data collection included among others, participatory learning and action (PLA), and Case studies. The findings included the following: In pastoralist households, a big proportion of the household budget was allocated to vector-borne diseases control. In the male-headed households, men dominated decision-making on vector-borne diseases control, although the goals and priorities of men and women in these households were not the same. Also, vector-borne disease control was predominantly by use of modern veterinary drugs, and pastoralists treated sick cattle by themselves even in situations where there were veterinary personnel."

Yet the notion of inclusion has not been critically interrogated within this field, resulting in the perpetuation of assumptions that oversimplify it. We provide qualitative evidence on inclusion as a health-promotion strategy from the perspectives of women living in poverty. We collected data with women engaged in a 6-year community-based health promotion and feminist participatory action research project. Participants' experiences illustrated that inclusion was a multidimensional process that involved a dynamic interplay between structural determinants and individual agency. The women named multiple elements of inclusion across psychosocial, relational, organizational, and participatory dimensions. This knowledge interrupts assumptions that inclusion is achievable and desirable for so-called recipients of such initiatives. We thus call for critical consideration of the complexities, limitations, and possibilities of facilitating inclusion as a health-promotion strategy."

Secondly, we consider the implications of these findings for health promotion activities and models of health education. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews, focus groups and a participatory workshop. Findings demonstrate that, to address child feeding practices which have an effect on nutrition, attention must be paid to the broader context that influences child nutrition, including extended family relations. Paternal grandmothers have a powerful and multifaceted role within the extended family in northern Malawi, both in terms of childcare and in other arenas such as agricultural practices and marital relations. Grandmothers often differ in their ideas about early child feeding from conventional Western medicine. Some practices have existed in the area at least since colonial times, and have strong cultural significance. Despite the important integrated role, older women have within households and communities in this part of Malawi, hospital personnel often have disparaging and paternalistic attitudes towards 'grannies' and their knowledge. Health education rarely involves grandmothers, and even if they are involved, their perspectives are not taken into consideration. Hospital staff often reject grandmother knowledge as part of a broader modernization paradigm which views 'traditional knowledge' as backward. Grandmothers view current child health conditions within a broader context of changing livelihood conditions and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges of involving grandmothers in health education, and the difficulties of incorporating local knowledge into a medical system that largely rejects it."

By emphasizing education and the promotion of new participatory health systems, most such programs aim to enhance the conditions of women as principal community care givers. Yet village-level health assistance in Africa is not without shortcomings. This is exemplified in a case study of two nongovernment programs in Burkina Faso's Namentenga Province. Although both programs have contributed to maternal health and infant survival, they have also induced new ties of donor dependency. This appears to present a conundrum for the sponsoring agencies which espouse self-reliance as a development assistance goal. In fact, however, where the intervention of nongovernment organizations helps to improve rural health, new dimensions of dependency may prove to be a positive first stage in the mobilization of women and the development of locally managed health systems. For this to be so, much is contingent on the capacity of these organizations to integrate local participation in their own planning and management processes, and to augment the professional status of indigenous health workers."

Qualitative and participatory methods, such as focus group discussions, in-depth individual interviews and ranking exercises, were used. The study found that women who lacked either short- or long-term economic support from male relatives, or disagreed with their husbands or family elders about appropriate treatment-seeking, faced difficulties in accessing health care for children with malaria. This illustrates the significant influence of women's access to resources and decision-making power on treatment-seeking behaviour for children with febrile illnesses, and the importance of approaching malaria management in the community or household from a gender perspective."

Reproductive social capital includes features such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate optimal reproductive health within a community. 100 Acts was designed and developed by the Healthy African American Families project, using community participatory methods, to increase local community and social network support for pregnant women. Dialog groups with pregnant women identified specific actions that families, friends, and strangers might do to support pregnancies. Participants primarily wanted emotional and instrumental support from family and friends. From strangers, they wanted respect for personal space and common courtesy. Based on these results, the 100 Acts was created for use in the Los Angeles community. 100 Acts encourages and engages active participation from community members in promoting healthy pregnancies. By seeking to increase community-level reproductive social capital, 100 Acts shifts the provision of social support during pregnancy from a high-risk approach to a population approach. 100 Acts also establishes new social norms about how pregnant women are valued, treated and respected."

The attention of a febrile episode was better in those who had contact with the intervention than in the nonintervened ones who had resided in the area for more than six months. Those without contact and with less than six months stay in the area reported lower use of bed-nets (OR:0.46; 95% CI:0.23-0.93) and less fumigation practices (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.19-0.75). The analysis of the malaria case trend showed a reduction in the proportion of cases contributed by the intervened communities, from 25% to 17%, six years after the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An educational strategy is effective to enhance knowledge and modify the practices of the urban population of Buenaventura with respect to malaria."

            "abstract": "Agriculture is main source of livelihood for majority of the population in India. Agriculture has been established as one of the drudgery prone occupation of unorganized sector due to lack of access to improved agricultural technologies. The present study was planned to assess intervention of drudgery reducing technologies in agriculture and its impact evaluation. The drudgery areas/activities in agriculture were identified. Participatory field level skill training for proper use of the ergonomically improved farm technologies were given to men and women in separate groups. An intervention package consisting of improved sickle, wheel hand hoe, capron, cot bag and protective gloves was introduced in village Shahpur. Data were collected to quantify the impact of intervention on the level of drudgery of worker before and after the technology intervention from sample of 30 respondents (15 male and 15 female) selected randomly from village Shahpur. Gain in knowledge and change in awareness level were calculated after the training.Evaluation of field validation of technology on drudgery of men & women was done after its use in the field conditions. A significant gain in awareness was observed among both men(2.6) & women (3.0) whereas the gain in knowledge was more among men (6.6) than women (4.5). In evaluation of field validation of technology on drudgery it was found that all the five technologies reduced the drudgery of men as well as women. However wheel hand hoe was used successfully by men in comparison to women who preferred to use their conventional technology i.e improved long-handled hoe. Evaluation of validation trials of the technologies reported that improved sickle was used successfully by both men & women farmers. More than half of the men farmers (53.3%) & only 13.3 percent women farmers preferred the wheel hand hoe over the traditional one as they found it four times more efficient in terms of time, energy & money saving. Cot bag was preferred by the entire sample. Capron was preferred by four-fifth of the men farmers (80.0%) whereas women farmers did not prefer it much. Only one third of men (33.3%) & 26.7 percent of women farmers preferred using gloves while harvesting of guar & picking of cotton."

While their observations are acknowledged to be from the unique perspective of an oncology setting, this is a timely and welcome lead article with significance in other settings. The authors invite opinions on transferability, thus forming the basis of this commentary. In response, this commentary offers a number of supportive and differing views. Complex, adaptive systems (CAS) theory is first addressed as an appropriate lens to reframe our conceptualization of the health system. Then, in contrast to negotiation, dialogue through participatory planning and decision-making is introduced. Evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) and knowledge translation (KT) are expanded upon in the context of CAS and participatory environments. Finally, concrete suggestions are offered on how to structure multiple-stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process, including the growing role of consumers in the new complex, adaptive systems reality of healthcare."

Although participatory peer educational approaches have increased in both popularity and practice among sexual health promoters in Asia, they have met with varying degrees of success. A clear understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying these approaches' successes or failures is still in its infancy. This study presents a case of a community-led, participatory peer education program that aims to reduce HIV transmission among commercial sex workers in the city of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The purpose of this study is to consider the relevance of capacity building through peer education for HIV/AIDS prevention among high risk groups such as sex-workers. Despite the expressed commitment to community participation in the development of culturally relevant interventions, much remains to be learned about the complexities of translating theoretical notions of \"community participation\" and \"into practice among hard-to-reach groups.\""

Prevailing views of health and illness, including indigenous knowledge and traditional beliefs, are an important component of the broad context of disease transmission. Participatory action research was used to explore the explanatory model of HIV illness of 31 seropositive Ghanaian women. Also interviewed were 5 HIV seropositive men, 2 traditional healers, 8 nurses, and 10 professionals, individually and in focus groups, to reflect on the women's comments and the themes emerging from the data. In this article, the women's beliefs about HIV illness will be discussed and their views about the etiology, pathophysiology, symptomology, course of illness, and methods of treatment for their illness will be described. Findings illustrate areas of divergence and convergence between traditional and biomedical explanations of, and treatment for, HIV illness. The necessity for health professionals, particularly nurses, to understand individual and community perceptions about HIV illness is highlighted by the study findings."

            "abstract": "Community-based behavioural interventions aimed at reducing risky sexual behaviour have yet to be shown to be effective in the developing world. Stepping Stones is a participatory STI/HIV prevention workshop programme based on empowerment techniques, which has been adapted to an infertility prevention framework for The Gambia. This paper describes a preliminary evaluation in two villages where the intervention was carried out compared to two control villages. Methods used include: participatory evaluation; 84 in-depth interviews; seven focus group discussions; a knowledge, attitudes and practice questionnaire administered to a random sample of 25% of the adult population at three time points; and monitoring of condom supply. The structure of the evaluation is based on the themes derived from the qualitative data. The infertility prevention approach made it possible to overcome resistance to discussing the topics of sexual and reproductive health. An atmosphere of trust was created and men were persuaded to participate in the programme as they felt that their own needs were being addressed. Participants enjoyed the programme and found the content relevant. Knowledge of the modes of transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and levels of risk awareness increased. The value of condoms in particular situations was recognised: for sex before marriage, within marriage (when the woman is breastfeeding) and with non-marital partners. Women reported that they would insist on condom use outside marriage and even ask their husbands to use condoms for non-marital sex. Condom monitoring data suggested that condom uptake had increased. It was reported that there was significant increase in dialogue within marriage with the consequence that there were fewer disagreements and incidents of domestic violence. Diffusion of the messages of Stepping Stones appeared to have taken place with non-participants including children. The evaluation techniques used can now be refined in order to generate further evidence on a larger scale and over a longer period."

Through an analysis of the political economy of participatory praxis within current neoliberal contexts, we focus on three main areas: (i) reconceptualizing the pragmatics of participation; (ii) the microeconomic implications of participatory research, including ethical issues in payment for research participation; and (iii) the value and limits of using research as a tool for activism and empowerment. We conclude with a brief discussion of what we see to be some of the most salient social justice implications arising from feminist and participatory approaches to health research within neoliberal political spaces."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This study took place in a remote community on the Ngaanyatjarra Lands, Western Australia. Ngaanyatjarra women's cultural practices have been subject to erosion during the past 70 years. Women are now expected to birth hundreds of kilometres from home and, due to financial barriers, without family support. Older women lament their lack of input into, and control of, contemporary birthing services.\n    \n\n\n          Research question:\n        \n      \n      In order to provide culturally appropriate maternity services we asked: What issues would the Ngaanyatjarra women of the community like to see resolved in the area of antenatal and birthing services?\n    \n\n\n          Participants and methods:\n        \n      \n      Eligible participants were any Ngaanyatjarra women of the study community who had birthed at least once.

The role is important in many ways. Ngaanyatjarra women did not traditionally have their support persons with them during labour and birth, nor do they necessarily expect them to be present in current times. Most women do, however, wish to have a support person with them during antenatal checkups and when they travel to town to await birth.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Aboriginal women from remote communities should be able to have a support person with them when they access regional birthing services, but the nature of this role must not be assumed. A culturally appropriate service has input from the community, provides options and respects choices."

They were hospitalized in the High-risk pregnancy Department from January 1999 till January 2000. All pregnant women were admitted to the hospital in each trimester of pregnancy for control of carbohydrate metabolism and follow-up of pregnancy. All pregnant women were treated by intensified Insulin regime-type basal-prandial. The diet was set according to the needs during pregnancy. 30 pregnant women (group 1) were educated according to the specificity of diabetes during pregnancy. The education was repeated every time the patient was admitted to the hospital. The aim of education was to reach and maintain good metabolic control (HbA1c < 7.5%) in the course of pregnancy. The values of HbA1c before education in group 1 and after final education in group 2 (not educated) were determinated. The incidence of some maternal and perinatal complication-the progress from diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy into proliferative retinopathy, the development of preeclampsia as a causative factor for delivery before 37 g.w, the development of RDS and perinatal deaths were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a significant difference in the mean values of glycosylated Hb. In the group of educated women a good metabolic control was achieved--HbA1c = 7.5%. In the non-educated group the metabolic control was poor--HbA1c = 8.4%, irrespective of the insulin and diet treatment. 25 (84.4%) of the babies born to educated mothers had normal birthweight between 3000 and 4000 grams. 2 (6.6%) of the newborn had birthweight under 3000 gr. and 3 (10%) over 4000 gr. In the group of educated women there was no progress of nonproliferative retinopathy into proliferative type. There was such a progression in 3 women from the noneducated group. There were 22 cases of preeclampsia in both groups. In the group of educated women the preeclampsia was mild, compared to the noneducated group where the form was severe. All women with severe form of preeclampsia (n=8) delivered before 37g. w. There were no perinathal deaths in the educated group, compared to 3 (11.5%) deaths in group 2. 2 babies died antenatally and one after an operative correction for severe congenital heart defect. There were 6 (6.6%) cases of RDS from the educated group compared to 99 (16.6%) from group 2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The education is a key factor in the complex plan of treatment of pregnant women with diabetes.

The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 14% in this population-based sample of Central Harlem adults. Respondents with asthma reported remarkably high rates of emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, but women were more likely than men to report two or more ED visits in the year prior to interview (38% vs. 18%). Women with asthma were also more likely than men with asthma to report activity restrictions because of asthma (61% vs. 26%). The burden of asthma among adults in Central Harlem is considerable.

The sample includes 7,963 men and women between the ages of 20 and 59 from ten Asian countries. An overall low level of relative concern toward ethics in science was reported. Lower educational attainment was associated with lower odds of concern. Christian religious affiliation and moderate religious involvement were also associated with lower odds of concern. This article highlights the importance of more active research into social perspectives on ethics in science."

While some opportunities were similar across research phases for PRAs (e.g., skill building), distinct challenges emerged in qualitative and quantitative phases. For example, our training did not adequately prepare PRAs with focus group facilitation skills; at times, survey implementation became counseling sessions. Researchers should assess how best to support PRAs as part of multi-method research processes."

            "abstract": "Emphasis in health policy has shifted from curative intervention to prevention and health promotion through personal responsibility for lifestyle choices and, most recently, to the social determination of health. These shifts draw attention to and legitimize women's health research that moves beyond biomedical, epidemiological, and subjective knowledge to question previously unquestioned societal norms and structures that influence women's health. The challenge is to avoid relying solely on population-based studies that support relationships between social determinants and indicators of women's health and to find ways to illuminate the processes by which social determinants interact with the health of specific groups of women. Without such research, our knowledge of how social factors that underpin women's health interact will be faceless and will not address the interplay of health and social policy within women's lives. One research method that may be useful for exploring the interplay between such policies and women's health is grounded theory. Grounded theory is a widely used approach in women's health research. The goal of grounded theory is the discovery of dominant social and structural processes that account for most of the variation in behavior in a particular situation. Despite the usefulness of this method for capturing the interaction between social conditions and women's health experiences, many grounded theory researchers restrict themselves to women's subjective experiences as a source of data for theory development. Consequently, the resultant theory's capacity to illuminate the effects of the social determinants of health is limited. The purpose of this article is to discuss how the grounded theory method can be used in a participatory way to theoretically sample structural conditions at many levels. Using examples from completed and ongoing women's health research where data have and have not been collected primarily from women themselves, we outline the benefits and process for using grounded theory to influence health and public policy in women's health."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to enhance contraceptive acceptance among currently-married women of reproductive age (CMWRA) through empowerment training of female community health volunteers (FCHVs). Seventeen FCHVs, who were working in Kakani Village Development Committee in the hills of central Nepal, attended an empowerment training that used participatory action research and reinforcement mechanisms. Following the training, the FCHVs were expected to empower the CMWRA to increase their contraceptive use. The impact of the intervention was assessed in a sample of 241 CMWRA, who were neither pregnant nor using contraceptives at the time of selection, by interviewing them before and six months after the intervention. The implementation of the intervention significantly increased the proportion of CMWRA knowing at least one contraceptive method (chi2(ldr)=71 .7, p=0.001). The use of modern contraceptives among the CMWRA from none before the intervention increased to 52.3% six months following the intervention. Satisfaction of the CMWRA with services provided by the FCHVs also significantly increased. The study concludes that empowerment training of FCHVs using participatory action research and peer reinforcement help increase the acceptance of contraceptives among CMWRA."

            "abstract": "As child mortality declines globally, neonatal mortality (death in the 1st month of life) has become an increasingly important cause of under-5 deaths. Emerging evidence showing the effectiveness of low-cost community-based interventions proves that expensive hospital interventions are not needed to make progress with newborn survival in low-income countries where the vast majority of deaths occur. This paper discusses the use of two approaches to community-based interventions: home visits by community health workers and participatory women's groups. Both are shown to reduce neonatal mortality but they might also have synergy when combined. Although further research is needed to explore contextual factors which might amplify or limit the degree of effect achievable, these interventions look very promising as a low-cost and sustainable approach towards Millennium Development Goal 4."

Often those who are left without care are those who need it most. Existing health services are managed without taking into account acceptance and need perspectives. This further reduces the effectiveness of and equity in health care. In order to guide the planning of reproductive health services by a national NGO, health needs were assessed in a district in Sindh using a combination of participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and qualitative and quantitative research methods. PRA is considered as a better framework to assess, analyse and develop programs with communities.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of PRA was to initiate community involvement and to understand the needs of health care from a community perspective.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      PRA was conducted with groups of men and women from three rural areas in a district of Sindh, Pakistan using a life cycle framework.

The aim of this paper is to consider constructions of sexuality when chronic illness such as MS intervenes.\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      In previous studies women placed their sexuality on the agenda for discussion, claiming that their concerns had not previously been vocalized nor understood.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      This participatory inquiry was framed by the principles of 'look, think and act'. These principles are operationalized as looking at ourselves, reflecting and questioning aspects of our lives, and then taking action to resolve the issues identified. Twelve women aged between 30 and 60 years who lived with MS joined the three researchers for five group sessions. Each session lasted 3 hours. In addition, several women opted to be interviewed individually. In this paper we describe the way in which women have constructed and articulated their sexuality since acquiring MS.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Sexuality has multiple meanings that are shaped and influenced by life experiences. When MS intrudes in a woman's life, sexuality is reshaped against a foundation of previous sexual experiences and expectations. Constructions of sexuality encompassed physical sexual responses, perceptions of appearance and attractiveness to self and others, communication and relationships, self-image and self-esteem, and the sense of affirmation and acknowledgement that women experienced from others in their everyday lives.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This paper reveals that sexuality was not privileged by women but was regarded as an ordinary part of life. Often sexual activity was placed on hold as other aspects of living with a chronic illness intervene, for instance an exacerbation of MS. Whilst this paper has a focus on constructions of sexuality, there is a close relationship to shifts in self and identity.

            "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the social and gender determinants of the risk of exposure to Cryptosporidium from urban dairying in Dagoretti, Nairobi. Focus group discussions were held in six locations to obtain qualitative information on risk of exposure. A repeated cross-sectional descriptive study included participatory assessment and household questionnaires (300 randomly selected urban dairy farming households and 100 non-dairying neighbours). One-hundred dairy households randomly selected from the 300 dairy households participated in an additional economic survey along with 40 neighbouring non-dairy households. We found that exposure to Cryptosporidium was influenced by gender, age and role in the household. Farm workers and people aged 50 to 65 years had most contact with cattle, and women had greater contact with raw milk. However, children had relatively higher consumption of raw milk than other age groups. Adult women had more daily contact with cattle faeces than adult men, and older women had more contact than older men. Employees had greater contact with cattle than other groups and cattle faeces, and most (77 %) were male. Women took more care of sick people and were more at risk from exposure by this route. Poverty did not affect the level of exposure to cattle but did decrease consumption of milk. There was no significant difference between men and women as regards levels of knowledge on symptoms of cryptosporidiosis infections or other zoonotic diseases associated with dairy farming. Awareness of cryptosporidiosis and its transmission increased significantly with rising levels of education. Members of non-dairy households and children under the age of 12 years had significantly higher odds of reporting diarrhoea: gender, season and contact with cattle or cattle dung were not significantly linked with diarrhoea. In conclusion, social and gender factors are important determinants of exposure to zoonotic disease in Nairobi."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      The negative effect of social deprivation and poverty on mental health has been the subject of numerous publications since the 1960s, with studies generally showing a higher prevalence of mental health disorders in homeless, unemployed or low income populations. Women in perinatal contexts are also at greater risk for psychopathology: the relative risk for being hospitalised is up to 60% higher in the perinatal period than during the two years preceding pregnancy. Access to social care and informal support is therefore particularly important for pregnant women in vulnerable social conditions. In France, socially excluded mothers access shelter and accommodation in maternal centres. Over the last few years, staff in these centers report what they perceive to be as an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems in the mothers using these services. The current study, CEMAT, set out to examine this question.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      Based on a participatory research method, a qualitative and epidemiological study was carried out in order to evaluate the reality and needs in terms of mental health care in this population, as well as to evaluate available care and support networks. The study took place in 2005. All stakeholder groups in six maternal centres agreed to participate in focus groups and, in addition, residents were invited to respond to epidemiological and qualitative questionnaires, including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 5.0.0) and its qualitative questions aimed at evaluating use of medical and social network resources. Overall, 95 women took part in this study, representing 61% of all residents. Subjects were young (64% under 26) and 57% had been living in their centre for over 12 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A percentage of 68% (N=65) of the participants were identified as having a mental health disorder, according to the MINI. Of these 65 women, 55 (85%) had consulted a physician (mainly general practitioners and gynecologists) during the preceding two months. Ninety seven per cent of women validating one or more MINI diagnoses had specifically looked for help for these disorders, 17% seeking only professional help (GP, psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, expert in non conventional medicine or traditional care), 23%looking for an informal source of support (partner, family, friends) and 57% using both professional care and informal support. High rates of satisfaction (69% for professional services, 81% for informal support) showed the capacity of this population to request relevant social and medico-social support.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Results tend to confirm the links between psychosocial vulnerability and mental health disorders. On the other hand, the women's ability to ask for and to access specific psychological care, whether it be from professionals or informally from friends and family is to be underlined. The high satisfaction rates tend to prove that, though psychologically vulnerable, this population has coping capacities that should be recognized and valorized. Options open to such structures do not necessarily involve the sole development of internal mental health resources, but need to acknowledge and strengthen existing support networks."

For measuring the effects of BIG on the empowerment of participating women, qualitative semi-structured interviews with 15 women participating in BIG were conducted. For data analysis, qualitative content analysis was used. Results showed the empowerment of the women on the individual level as they gained different competencies and perceived self-efficacy. These effects were supported through the empowerment process on the organizational and community levels where women gained control over their life situations and over policies influencing them. Therefore, the participatory approach of BIG is a key success factor for empowerment promotion of women in difficult life situations."

Our Hmong sample was frequently unclear about what \"mental\" health meant, indicating a low level of mental health literacy. Results confirmed that there are significant mental health needs in this refugee and immigrant population. Participants described problems consistent with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, and severe social stress and acculturation difficulties in every generation. Elder people and male adolescents were described as the most disaffected and in need of immediate services.

Research findings about disease prevalence, risk factors and observed risky and risk-mitigating practices were analysed by a team comprising researchers, community members and local policy- and decision-makers. Using participatory planning, multiple strategies were developed for disseminating key information. We identified five vulnerable groups at higher risk of exposure to cryptosporidiosis and other cattle zoonoses with similar transmission pathways (women, children, elderly people, immunosuppressed people and male farm workers). For each group, targeted messages were developed. Good practices already in use, as were also practices as practices to improve environmental conditions. These messages were disseminated through printed material, in a workshop, through community campaigners and also an edutainment soap opera episode broadcast on Kenyan television.

Reference is made to how water and sanitation as technical interventions have drawn upon the natural sciences, notably concepts of race and sex, and the social sciences including culture and gender, for their authority and legitimacy. A new and apparently progressive movement, the Water Decade sought to challenge the powerful and enduring high tech image of development on which much western environmental and social transformations have been based. Beginning as a critique of modernism with a commitment to basic needs as human rights, it was driven by a recognition that sophisticated technology could not satisfy human health needs. Alternative technologies would, by contrast, cater for a more extensive and varied market and would promote participatory approaches to service delivery. The paper demonstrates how, during the course of the Decade, sections of the aid community began to redefine basic needs as commodities involving the efficient marketing and delivery of a product with minimal state intervention. Within a shifting international political and economic context, it examines the changing role of the expert and the links being forged between large donors, non-governmental organisations and the private sector. The significance of this reformulated progressivism for the development debate is then considered, notably in relation to concepts of citizenship, consumer choice and the role of the state."

Audiotapes were analyzed using the Multi-Dimensional Interaction Analysis coding system. Results demonstrate that exercise was discussed in 13% of visits and the subject was raised equally by patients and physicians. Exercise was significantly more likely to be discussed in dyadic visits (14.7%) than in triadic visits (4.1%). Patient level of education, patient overall physical health, and the physician's being female were significant predictors of the occurrence of exercise discussion.

Nine of 45 departments participated in a work environment improvement program, including planning workshops, implementation and monitoring, between July and December 2005 (intervention group, n=321). The remaining 36 departments served as the control group (n=750). Outcomes (job stressors, worksite support, psychological distress, etc.), measured using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire, as well as sick leave days taken from the company record, were recorded before and six months after the program for both groups. Among women, skill underutilization, supervisor and coworker support, psychological distress, and job satisfaction changed more favorably in the intervention group than in the control group (p<0.05). No significant favorable effect of the program was observed among men. Improvements in the outcomes were more prominent among departments with a 50% or higher rate of worker participation in the planning workshops and among departments with a 50% or higher rate of implemented vs. planned actions.

            "abstract": "All over the world, plant domestication is continually being carried out by local communities to support their needs for food, fibre, medicine, building materials, etc. Using participatory rapid appraisal approach, 150 households were surveyed in 5 villages selected in five ethnic groups of Benin, to investigate the local communities' motivations for plant domestication and the contributions of this process to in situ conservation of genetic resources. The results indicated differences in plant domestication between agroecological zones and among ethnic groups. People in the humid zones give priority to herbs mainly for their leaves while those in dry area prefer trees mostly for their fruits. Local communities were motivated to undertake plant domestication for foods (80% of respondents), medicinal use (40% of respondents), income generation (20% of respondents) and cultural reasons (5% of respondents). 45% of the species recorded are still at early stage in domestication and only 2% are fully domesticated. Eleven factors related to the households surveyed and to the head of the household interviewed affect farmers' decision making in domesticating plant species. There is gender influence on the domestication: Women are keen in domesticating herbs while men give priority to trees."

A sample of 516 female clients (283 of housewives and 233 of working women) were chosen from nine different out patient clinics offering health services to women in Tanta city. Three structured questionnaire sheets were used, namely: (1) Health promoting life style questionnaire (HPLQ), (2) Health value scale (HVS), and (3) self-efficacy. The results showed that a minority of housewives and working women groups correctly tended to practice more health promotion activities. However, the total mean scores of working women were slightly higher ( 362.03 +/- 33.55 out of 522) than that among housewives group (332.77 +/- 31.18). Multiple regression analysis indicated a significant correlation between women scores regarding most of the studied items related to self reported health promotion activities and demographic variables. Higher education (p = 0.004), family income (p = 0.005), and duration of marriage (p = 0.031) were associated significantly with working women who sought more health promotion activities, while education (p = 0.003) and family income (p = 0.028) were associated significantly with housewives group. Finally, the present study proved that work of women (p = 0.000) significantly related to the practice of health promotion behaviors."

Transaction was considered to be part of what was expected within a \"natural romantic relationship\". Condom use was less likely in relationships where a great amount of gifts were exchanged, as men were more likely to negotiate sex on their terms, and this often led to unprotected sex.\n    \n\n\n          Originality/value:\n        \n      \n      The study contributes much-needed insight into motivations behind young women participating in SFSL.

These technicians work with students presenting behavioral and learning difficulties as well as developmental and mental health problems. Eighteen technicians were interviewed and the work of seven technicians and two teachers was observed. Technicians prevent and manage crisis situations and help students acquire social skills. Coordination with teachers is made difficult by the fact that most technicians work part time, part year, and many technicians' work areas and classrooms are physically distant one from another. Most technicians change schools each year and must continually reconstruct work teams.

While it is possible to measure individual attitudes around sensitive behaviours through questionnaire surveys, studies suggest that responses may be subject to social desirability bias and may not reflect community norms. This study used a novel tool to collect data on community norms relating to the acceptability of concurrency in rural Zimbabwe. Six questions exploring general concurrency concepts and 28 scenarios in which multiple-partnerships might occur were developed and translated into Shona. Participatory attitudinal ranking (PAR), an approach adapted from participatory wealth ranking, was used to conduct group discussions (n=24) with 170 participants recruited in a household survey. Participants discussed and ranked scenarios according to the acceptability of the multiple-partnering described in the short accounts. Data analysis followed grounded theory principles. Qualitative data were examined against quantitative survey data collected from a representative sample of 18-44-year olds. While discussants indicated that concurrency was common among both males and females, self-reports from survey participants indicated that 37.1% of males (n=717/1931; 95% CI: 35.0-39.3%) and only 7.3% of females (n=215/2948; 95% CI: 6.4-8.3%) were in concurrent relationships suggesting under-reporting of this behaviour, particularly by women. We found that concurrency is an accepted community norm for men but never for women. Concurrency is considered more acceptable in specific social contexts, including infertility and lack of a male heir. Having protected rather than unprotected sex with a concurrent partner does not render this behaviour more acceptable. Using PAR, we managed to gain a more nuanced understanding of socially sanctioned concurrency, knowledge that could prove useful for improving behaviour change interventions targeting this behaviour. PAR allowed us to rank attitudes in terms of acceptability, which would enable us to compare attitudes between communities and evaluate changes over time."

Ninety-five community-specific seafood consumption surveys were administered to low-income African-American women (ages 16-49) residing in the Southeast community of Newport News, VA, USA, for the purpose of assessing potential dietary mercury exposure. Only the results of the seafood consumption surveys are presented in this manuscript. Approximately 65% of the women surveyed do not fish; however, 83% had consumed seafood within the last 7 days. Whiting, shrimp, and canned tuna were the three items most frequently consumed. Ninety-three percent of the women surveyed stated that grocery/seafood markets were the main sources of the seafood items generally consumed. The mean seafood consumption rate for the women surveyed was 147.8 g/day (95% CI: 117.6-185.8), a rate substantially higher than the mean seafood consumption rate reported for US women (1.8 g/day 95% CI: 1.51-2.04). Shrimp, croaker, and blue crab were the top three seafood items with the highest summed amount (g/day) consumed. There was no significant association between demographic variables (age, income, education, and weight) and total number of seafood items listed, ingestion rate (g/meal), exposure frequency (meals/year), and seafood consumption rate (g/day). By using CBPR to assess seafood consumption in this community, we learned that even though women in Southeast Newport News, Virginia are not subsistence fishers, they consume seafood at a subsistence fisher rate. Of the three seafood items most frequently consumed, canned tuna potentially plays a significant role in dietary mercury exposure for women in this community. Future work includes determining mercury concentrations in seafood items consumed and generating community-specific statements of dietary mercury risks."

To achieve these goals, maternal and family planning programs were strengthened in both rural and urban settings through three intervention strategies--policy reform, affecting behaviors and improving services. The fundamental premise in each project was to strengthen the weakest part of the maternity care pyramid, ensuring linkages among all levels of service--from community through to the referral hospital level. In rural Andean populations of Bolivia, knowledge of danger signs and women's response to them improved, increasing in use of prenatal and family planning services through a participatory problem-solving and community-based strategy. In West Java, Indonesia, bringing professional midwifery services and facilities closer to women together has resulted in a positive response to their use. Augmenting this intervention with a transport and intercommunication system together with improved hospital practice through perinatal mortality meetings and in-service training for doctors and midwives has reduced the maternal and perinatal mortality over a four year period. Hospital practice has improved in Uganda and in two states of Nigeria, maternal mortality and morbidity have been reduced in the training facility where seminars for physicians, training of midwives in life saving midwifery and interpersonal communication skills have taken place, and equipment and supplies have been improved. Furthermore, in rural Guatemala, implementation of norms and protocols, expert supervision and sensitization of hospital staff to the needs of the community has increased referral by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to the hospital and reduced perinatal mortality."

We lack research into how these dynamics are compounded by intersecting forms of oppression faced by Aboriginal women, to impact on their birthing experiences and outcomes. The findings of this study of rural Aboriginal maternity care in 4 communities in British Columbia show how diminishing local birthing choices and women's struggles to exert power, choice, and control are influenced by centuries of colonization. The research questions focus on rural Aboriginal women's experiences of birthing and maternity care in this neocolonial context and their desire for supportive birthing environments. A community-based participatory and ethnographic design was employed. Individual interviews, focus groups, and participant observation were the primary data sources. Although the women's experiences in each community were shaped by distinct histories and traditions, economics, politics, and geographies, the impacts of colonization and medical paternalism and the struggle for control of women's bodies during birth intersect, placing additional stress on women. The implications for nurses of accounting for the intersecting dynamics that shape Aboriginal women's experiences and birth outcomes are discussed."

Mammography is currently the best procedure available for mass screening of breast cancer. However, underutilization of mammography is a problem among older women in the United States. Elders are at the greatest risk for developing and dying from breast cancer but they are the least likely group to be screened routinely with mammograms or to practice breast self-examination, particularly if they are African-American.

Methods. Four focus groups were conducted in two diverse settings with a purposive sample of 23 participants (N = 23). The overall sample was predominantly African-American (87%) with mean age of 71 ± 7.9 years and mean education completed of 12 ± 3.4 years. Results. Five major themes emerged from group discussions: usability and appeal of the intervention, fear and empowerment, personal relevance and intergenerational sharing, impact on screening behaviours, and story telling. Conclusions. Analyses suggest that customized media materials constructed especially for older African-American women empowered participants in this sample to action regarding their own breast health. Relevance to clinical practice. These findings may translate to global populations where risk is increasing but screening programmes are not widely available. Given that older women are historically difficult to access and impact, further design and evaluation of innovative and sensitive educational programmes such as the one described here are recommended."

Capacity building occurred among farmers, technical personnel, and students from multiple disciplines. Involvement of research users occurred throughout: women and men farmers, non-governmental development organizations, Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and, in Ecuador, the National Council on Social Participation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pesticide poisonings were more widespread than existing passive surveillance systems would suggest. More diversified, moderately developed agricultural systems had lower pesticide use and better child nutrition. Greater understanding among women of crop management options and more equal household gender relations were associated with reduced farm pesticide use and household pesticide exposure. Involvement in more organic agriculture was associated with greater household food security and food sovereignty. Markets for safer produce supported efforts by smallholder farmers to reduce hazardous pesticide use.Participatory interventions included: promoting greater access to alternative methods and inputs in a store co-sponsored by the municipality; producing less harmful inputs such as compost by women farmers; strengthening farmer organizations around healthier and more sustainable agriculture; marketing safer produce among social sectors; empowering farmers to act as social monitors; and using social monitoring results to inform decision makers. Uptake by policy makers has included: the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health rolling out pesticide poisoning surveillance modeled on our system; the Ecuadorian Association of Municipalities holding a national virtual forum on healthier agriculture; and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture promulgating restrictions on highly hazardous pesticides in June 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Work with multiple actors is needed to shift agriculture towards greater sustainability and human health, particularly for vulnerable smallholders."

CBPR can effectively be used to target local community populations in increasing knowledge and improving behaviors in cancer prevention as participants have a voice and active role in the research process. This article describes how CBPR was used in the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pilot intervention for breast and cervical cancer screening among a Vietnamese female population. The authors outline the use of CBPR in three phases: (a) the identification of preventive health topics important in the local Vietnamese community, (b) the development and administration of a survey to gain a deeper understanding of barriers to breast and cancer screening among Vietnamese women, and (c) the development of a culturally appropriate pilot intervention to promote cancer screening behavior among a local Vietnamese population. In Study 1, it was found that Vietnamese women experienced disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening. In Study 2, it was found that having health insurance and a regular physician were predictive of breast and cervical cancer screening. It was also found that participants had low levels of acculturation and lacked cancer screening knowledge. In Study 3, it was found that the culturally relevant intervention used in this study improved cancer screening-related outcomes in knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, and behavior."

This study aimed at exploring the context, reasons, and choices in patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviour of the hill tribal population of Bangladesh to present the obstacles and challenges faced in accessing healthcare provision in the tribal areas. Participatory tools and techniques, including focus-group discussions, in-depth interviews, and participant-observations, were used involving 218 men, women, adolescent boys, and girls belonging to nine different tribal communities in six districts. Data were transcribed and analyzed using the narrative analysis approach. The following four main findings emerged from the study, suggesting that the tribal communities may differ from the predominant Bengali population in their health needs and priorities: (a) Traditional healers are still very popular among the tribal population in Bangladesh; (b) Perceptions of the quality and manner of treatment and communication can override costs when it comes to provider-preference; (c) Gender and age play a role in making decisions in households in relation to health matters and treatment-seeking; and (d) Distinct differences exist among the tribal people concerning their knowledge on health, awareness, and treatment-seeking behaviour. The findings challenge the present service-delivery system that has largely been based on the needs and priorities of the plainland population. The present system needs to be reviewed carefully to include a broader approach that takes the sociocultural factors into account, if meaningful improvements are to be made in the health of the tribal people of Bangladesh."

Although the group was brought together to discuss incontinence, other emergent themes were raised by the women. These themes were: women's ad hoc experience with community services, their problems concerning access to toilets for the disabled, concern with health professionals' lack of knowledge about MS, their formidable experiences of hospitalisation and respite care admissions, their individual efforts in maintaining wellness in the context of chronic illness and the effect of MS on sexual relationships."

However, those women with high intensity pain and high level disability had a mean (SD) score of 28.5 (5.7) and 24.8 (5.7) respectively, which reflects greater negativity about back pain and its consequences. There was an association between negative beliefs and high pain intensity (OR = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), p = 0.01) and high level disability (OR = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97), p = 0.001), after adjusting for confounders.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study highlights that although women living in the community were generally positive about back pain, subgroups of women with high pain intensity and high level disability were identified who had more pessimistic views.

A total of 10.5% of children suffered from thiamine deficiency, and 5.7% of the children were insufficient in thiamine supply. Low Kaup target (<25%) was significantly associated with lack of guidance by doctors, lack of nutrition knowledge, lack of knowledge of causes of malnutrition and local culture food taboos. The status of child nutrition has been improved significantly since the intervention measure implementation. The change of prevalence of underweight children aged 6-17 months prior to and after the intervention was significant: 20.5% before and 13.7% after the intervention in infants aged 6-11 months, and 39.0% before and 26.4% after the intervention in young children aged 12-17 months. Prevalence of girls was higher than that of boys. Some women began to eat vegetables and pork from the market, which were forbidden by the culture food taboos.

A household comprised 4.8 +/- 2.5 members with arable land of approximately 2.6 ha. In addition to chickens, households grew maize, cotton and sunflower and kept large animals. Flocks ranging from 1 to 50 village chickens per household were reared under a scavenging system of management with suboptimal housing, inadequate feeding and poor health care. The use of ethno-veterinary medicine was common in treating sick chickens. The largest flock sizes were observed in the hot-wet season. Over 90% of an average of 5.4 entries/household per month were from hatched chicks. Mortality claimed an average of 80% of the total exits. Chicken production potential (CPP), which defined the proportion of chickens that could be utilized by a household, averaged 50%. Chicken production efficiency (CPE) was approximately 15% of the CPP.

Partnering with three community organizations in 2007-8, we implemented the Community Connections and Collaboration Project to address health disparities that Somali refugees experienced. Specifically, we examined factors that influenced Somali women's health experiences. Utilizing a socio-ecological perspective and a social action research design, we conducted six community-based focus groups with 57 Somali women and interviewed 11 key informants including Somali healthcare professionals. Inductively coding, sorting and reducing data into categories, we analyzed each category for specific patterns. The categorical findings on healthcare experiences are reported here. We found that Somali women's health beliefs related closely to situational factors and contrasted sharply with the biological model that drives Western medicine. These discordant health beliefs resulted in divergent expectations regarding treatment and healthcare interactions. Experiencing unmet expectations, Somali women and their healthcare providers reported multiple frustrations which often diminished perceived quality of health care. Moreover, silent worries about mental health and reproductive decision making surfaced. To provide high quality, transcultural health care, providers must encourage patients to voice their own health explanations, expectations, and worries."

Use of the MSM is illustrated in the development of ethnic-specific weight loss interventions for low-income postpartum women. The MSM may be useful in designing future health programs designed for other special populations for whom existing interventions are unavailable or lack relevance."

            "abstract": "People living in informal settlements do not realise that they could make a significant change in their circumstances by first engaging in introspection and secondly identifying their intellectual resources. In this study, participatory research was done, whereby emphasis was placed on the importance of active participation by all concerned in the project. The participants were women from the community who were able to identify the problems they encountered in their daily living that threatened their health and that of their families. After reflecting on their intellectual resources, an awareness of the power they had over their current situation surfaced. This awareness enabled them to find solutions to their problems. Participatory research is a means of community participation that ultimately leads to empowerment of the community as a whole."

The Partnership for Cancer Prevention (PCP) was established to build partnerships and community capacity to address cervical cancer early detection and control among the growing Latina population in SC. In this paper we report on the initial PCP community-based participatory research (CBPR) project.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PCP members engaged in a multi-method, participatory research project to assess cervical cancer related resources and needs among Latinas and healthcare providers. To explore attitudes and behaviors related to women's health in general and more specifically, female cancer, PCP members conducted 8 focus group sessions with 38 Spanish-speaking women. To assess the availability and perceived importance of culturally and linguistically appropriate services, PCP members conducted a survey of providers (n=46) and support personnel (n=30) at 14 clinical sites that provide cancer screening services.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Health care access issues were Latinas' main concerns. For information and assistance in accessing and navigating the health care system, they relied on informal social networks and community outreach workers. Latina participants voiced misunderstandings about cancer risk and most appeared to lack a prevention orientation. Practitioners’ concerns included the assessment and documentation of patients' language preference and ability, provision of language assistance for limited-English-proficient (LEP) patients, and bilingual staff.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Building on the findings of this participatory research initiative, PCP members identified the following action strategies to promote cervical cancer screening among Latinas in SC: culturally appropriate cervical cancer awareness messages and outreach strategies geared towards increasing participation in cervical cancer screening and follow-up; maintenance of active community partnerships for health promotion, cancer risk reduction, and improved access to care; and increasing the capacity of the health care systems in SC to address Hispanic health concerns."

Many developed countries have provided various patterns of care processes for the elderly. India too is feeling the impact of ageing population and is trying to cope with the demands of this population. Various problems have to be faced by the ageing population and one of them is the abuse of the elderly. This abuse is overt or covert and in different areas of their life style, that is economic, social or religious and occurs in daily life patterns. Often the abuse could also be included in legal patterns of transactions between the aged and their relatives. Because the aged are a surplus or the greying population they are helpless and unable to combat these situations. Stereotypes also work against the aged. It is therefore necessary to make aged legally literate and allow them to live in dignity."

The reproductive rights of Mexicans with HIV are formally protected by the constitution and by health and anti-discrimination legislation, as well as by international conventions. However, the reproductive rights of women with HIV continue to be violated in public clinics and hospitals. This paper discusses three violations identified as priority problems by Mexican women with HIV, illustrating these problems with cases identified during a participatory skills building workshop. The violations cover the following rights: the right to non-discrimination, the right to adequate information and informed consent to medical procedures, and the right to choose the number and spacing of children. Physicians can either violate or promote reproductive rights. Unfortunately, in many instances Mexican physicians continue to perpetrate reproductive rights abuses against women with HIV. Collaborations between women with HIV, civil society, government, and international organizations are needed to educate and sanction health care providers and to support women with HIV in their pursuit of reproductive rights. Demanding accountability from health care practitioners and the State to guarantee reproductive rights in countries where these rights are formally protected will improve the quality of life of people with HIV and can demonstrate that rights-based approaches are compatible with and indeed, crucial for public health."

The last decade has seen the use of rape as a weapon of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women and girls to brutalising attacks, rape, torture and mutilation. Survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) are often further traumatised by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation. Substantial evidence exists showing an association between social determinants (e.g., poverty, stress and trauma, stigma, lack of access to health care) and health; however, limited research has been conducted to elucidate these relationships or to develop and test interventions to change social determinants of health, especially in conflict and post-conflict settings such as the DRC. The purpose of this article is to present a Congolese-US community-academic research partnership to obtain evidence to develop and implement a sustainable intervention to begin to address the social determinants of health, including poverty and traumatic stress for survivors of SGBV and their families in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC."

It shows that adolescent girls in these communities have dreams and aspirations for a better future and that adults acknowledge and support these ideals. However, social norms and institutions are restrictive, especially for girls, who are often unable to realise their hopes for continuing education, finding better-paid work or delaying marriage and childbearing, and this directly impacts reproductive outcomes. Insight into the broader context of adolescent girls' lives provides a valuable framework for designing positive programmatic actions which take as their entry point the disjuncture between girls' aspirations and realities. Interventions begun in these communities include youth clubs for safe social interaction and literacy classes; training of peer educators to teach life-skills, including for married adolescents; forums for parents, teachers and health service providers to discuss their own concerns and those of adolescents; and work with the community to design programmes that will contribute to greater financial independence and employment opportunities for adolescents."

Appropriateness of health care services vis-a-vis the gender specific cultural norms that influence clients' needs are not very visible and are more difficult to monitor. Programs and services need to be sensitively designed to facilitate women's access to physical and social needs. This paper narrates the experience of working with health providers from public and private sectors, community, local government representatives and community-based organizations. Through transformative learning, this endeavour focused on initiating a process of sensitization on gender related health issues for women.\n    \n\n\n          Approach:\n        \n      \n      The initiative was primarily based on the use of the following two standardized tools: 'Health Workers for Change' for working with health providers and 'Initiating Women Empowerment for Health' for interacting with the community. Both tools focus primarily on women's health and social issues affecting their health status. The research methodology used was predominantly qualitative, using focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal and interactive workshops.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      This approach endeavours to sensitize the health service providers to the health needs of female clients and encourages behavioural changes. Simultaneously, it creates an opportunity to raise awareness among women and the community in general regarding appropriate health-seeking behaviour and the timely use of health services. The information collected is evidence for policy makers regarding the gender-based problems faced by women who are seeking health care and it suggests how to overcome these problems."

            "abstract": "A rich literature exists on local democracy and participation in South Africa. While the importance of participation is routinely built into the rhetoric of government, debate has increasingly focused on the dysfunctionality of participatory mechanisms and institutions in post-apartheid South Africa. Processes aimed ostensibly at empowering citizens, act in practice as instruments of social control, disempowerment and cooptation. The present article contributes to these debates by way of a critique of the approach used by the South African state, in partnership with the non-governmental sector, in what are called abortion \"values clarification\" (VC) workshops. This article examines the workshop materials, methodology and pedagogical tools employed in South African abortion VC workshops which emanate from the organization Ipas — a global body working to enhance women's sexual and reproductive rights and to reduce abortion-related deaths and injuries. VC workshops represent an instance of a more general trend in which participation is seen as a tool for generating legitimacy and \"buy-in\" for central state directives rather than as a means for genuinely deepening democratic communication. The manipulation of participation by elites may serve as a means to achieve socially desirable goals in the short term but the long-term outlook for a vibrant democracy invigorated by a knowledgeable, active and engaged citizenry that is accustomed to being required to exercise careful reflection and to its views being respected, is undermined. Alternative models of democratic communication, because they are based on the important democratic principles of inclusivity and equality, have the potential both to be more legitimate and more effective in overcoming difficult social challenges in ways that promote justice."

Midwives desire to create the ideal birth space was hampered by a prevailing biomedical discourse which emphasised risk. Midwives in all three groups saw themselves as the gatekeepers, 'holding the space' or 'providing a bridge' for women, often in the face of a hierarchical hospital structure with obstetricians governing practice. This situation did not differ significantly after the relocation to the new hospital. Despite a warmer, more spacious and private birth space midwives felt the care was still influenced by the old hierarchical hospital culture. Caseload midwives felt they had the best opportunity to make a difference to women's experience because they were able, through continuity of care, to build trusting relationships with women during the antenatal period.\n    \n\n\n          Key conclusions and implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      although the physical environment can make a marginal contribution to an optimal birth space, it has little effect on clinical risk management practices within a major public hospital and the way in which this impacts midwives' practice.

In addition 242 respondents were interviewed with respect to knowledge on safe motherhood issues and their perception of the SMP's performance. Skilled delivery attendance was our primary outcome; secondary outcomes included antenatal care attendance and knowledge on Safe Motherhood issues.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Deliveries with skilled attendant significantly increased from 34.1% to 51.4% (rho < 0.05). Early ANC booking (4 to 16 weeks) rose significantly from 18.7% at baseline to 37.7% in 2005 and 56.9% (rho < 0.001) at final assessment. After two years 44 (88%) of the SMPs were still active, 79% of pregnant women were visited. Further benefits included the enhancement of male involvement in safe motherhood issues.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The study has demonstrated the effectiveness of community-based safe motherhood intervention in promoting the utilization of obstetric care and a skilled attendant at delivery. This improvement is attributed to the SMPs' home visits and the close collaboration with existing community structures as well as health services."

            "abstract": "The Farmer Life School (FLS) is an innovative approach to integrating HIV education into life skills and technical training for farmers. This study aims to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this relatively new approach, through the implementation of an adapted version in South Africa. The results are presented of a pilot with three groups of community gardeners, predominantly women, attending weekly sessions. Impact was assessed in terms of three key elements: participation, learning, and empowerment. Data were collected through extensive session reports, follow-up interviews, and reflection exercises with facilitators and participating groups and individuals. The results suggest that a group-based discovery learning approach such as the FLS has great potential to improve food security and wellbeing, while allowing participants to explore issues around HIV/AIDS. However, the analysis also shows that HIV/AIDS-related illness and death, and the factors that drive the epidemic and its impact, undermine farmers' ability to participate, the safety and trust required for learning, and the empowerment process. Participatory approaches such as the FLS require a thorough understanding of and adaptation to the context."

The participatory action research project was conducted in the main short sentence minimum/medium security women's prison located in a Western Canadian province. An ethnographic multi-method approach was used for data collection and analysis. Quantitative data was collected by surveys and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was collected from orientation package entries, audio recordings, and written archives of research team discussions, forums and debriefings, and presentations. These data and ethnographic observations were transcribed and analysed using iterative and interpretative qualitative methods and NVivo 7 software. Up to 15 women worked each day as prison research team members; a total of 190 women participated at some time in the project between November 2005 and August 2007. Incarcerated women peer researchers developed the research processes including opportunities for them to develop leadership and technical skills. Through these processes, including data collection and analysis, nine health goals emerged. Lessons learned from the research processes were confirmed by the common themes that emerged from thematic analysis of the research activity data. Incarceration provides a unique opportunity for engagement of women as expert partners alongside academic researchers and primary care workers in participatory research processes to improve their health."

Inorganic arsenic is a known neurotoxin that has both neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive consequences. The aim of this study was to examine the potential association between current and long-term arsenic exposure and detailed neuropsychological functioning in a sample of rural-dwelling adults and elders. Data were analyzed from 434 participants (133 men and 301 women) of Project FRONTIER, a community-based participatory research study of the epidemiology of health issues of rural-dwelling adults and elders. The results of the study showed that GIS-based groundwater arsenic exposure (current and long-term) was significantly related to poorer scores in language, visuospatial skills, and executive functioning. Additionally, long-term low-level exposure to arsenic was significantly correlated to poorer scores in global cognition, processing speed and immediate memory. The finding of a correlation between arsenic and the domains of executive functioning and memory is of critical importance as these are cognitive domains that reflect the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Additional work is warranted given the population health implications associated with long-term low-level arsenic exposure."

Despite this large increase in participation, no scientific evidence exists to quantify any physiologic response to the activity. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to assess the energy expenditure of snowshoeing at selected low-level speeds and evaluate its acceptability as a form of aerobic conditioning exercise. Ten habitually active subjects (7 men, 3 women, mean age = 24 +/- 3.9 years, mass = 76.6 +/- 14.5 kg, height = 173.7 +/- 9.6 cm) were recruited. Steady state heart rate data were determined from 2 treadmill tests at 4 and 6 mph. Steady state heart rates at 4 mph and 6 mph from treadmill speeds were then reproduced outdoors under 2 snow conditions, packed, and unpacked snow, while caloric expenditure and speed were determined. Expired gases were collected in Douglas bags for both snowshoe and treadmill trials and then analyzed and corrected indoors for the fractional concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Data analyses indicate that caloric expenditure during snowshoeing may be considerably higher than previously reported. Snowshoeing on packed snow at 2.95 mph elicited a similar heart rate and energy expenditure response as walking on a treadmill at 4 mph or snowshoeing in unpacked snow at 2.04 mph (Vo(2) = 18.18 +/- 0.8 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Snowshoeing on packed snow at 3.97 mph elicited the same heart rate and energy expenditure response as walking on a treadmill at 6 mph or snowshoeing on unpacked snow at 2.87 mph (Vo(2) = 36.72 +/- 0.8 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Furthermore, increasing walking speed on snow by just 1 mph at slow speeds (2 and 3 mph) resulted in approximately twice the energy expenditure. Our data indicate that current estimates of energy expenditure while snowshoeing underestimate by greater than 50%. Apparently the energy expenditure during snowshoeing is much higher than previously considered and varies considerably because of snow terrain. Furthermore, energy expenditure levels similar to walking can be achieved on snowshoes at much slower speeds. This study represents an original investigation into energy expenditure during snowshoeing."

Nevertheless, communication around this issue has not been sufficient enough to be effective in mobilising women to participate, especially among those who are underprivileged. In fact, there are many constraints and obstacles, including women's opinions, beliefs and perspectives about these types of cancer and their screening. How can communication be designed in order to better respond to their specific concerns? How can one facilitate a greater understanding and awareness of the need and utility for gynaecological regular follow-up and early screening? It is through attempting to answer these questions that a research project was established to develop specific communications activities through a participatory peer-education process. Two groups of disadvantaged women participated in the development and management of a community-based communication programme. The programme's effectiveness is demonstrated. For 9 out of 10 women participating in the programme acknowledged a real awareness of the need for gynaecological follow-up and the usefulness of early screening, and 20% of them had a gynaecological visit with a practitioner as a result. Furthermore, we were able to highlight the impact of the participatory approach on the development of the psychosocial skills of the women involved as partners and volunteers in the programme. Today, the use of this model is being implemented as the participatory method to build a network of health mediators in the Lorraine region where they are responsible for developing local communication and health education at the grass roots level."

While many of the studies that have investigated this population's high risk for early childbearing have focused predominantly on micro-level factors, a growing body of research has demonstrated the importance of neighborhood-level factors in shaping risk for this outcome. In order to elucidate the role of neighborhood context with regards to early childbearing among adolescent Mexican-American women, it is important to understand what these young women consider to be their neighborhood context and how they experience these contexts. This study utilized a mixed-methods design incorporating participatory photography, photo-elicitation, and focus groups in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of how neighborhood context is conceptualized and experienced by Mexican-American young women, and how these experiences may influence risk for early childbearing. Major findings include: (1) participants view the blocks on which they live as their neighborhood, but their exposure to neighborhood context extends beyond these blocks and includes the transient spaces they move through daily; and (2) within their neighborhood contexts, participants are influenced by experiences of discrimination and the presence of gangs and violence. These findings point to the importance of neighborhood-level factors in the lives of adolescent Mexican-American women, and may be used to inform future studies looking at the role of neighborhood context in shaping risk for early childbearing among this population."

In this article, the authors describe the experiences of the University of Ottawa School of Nursing and its Chinese partner, the Yunnan Provincial Public Health Bureau, in developing and implementing a comprehensive referral system for impoverished rural women and children as part of the Yunnan Maternal and Child Health Project, a six-year dollar 6-million bilateral initiative implemented across 10 counties (population 2.2 million) in Yunnan province, China. Through engaging government officials, health workers, local leaders and village women in dialogue and reflection, Canadian and Chinese partners developed a common understanding about underlying determinants affecting maternal and child health services; explored appropriate intervention options; and developed an innovative comprehensive referral system."

The aim of the intervention was to contribute to improving infant feeding counselling services for HIV positive women in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Formative research using a combination of qualitative methods preceded the development of the intervention and mapped existing practices, perceptions and attitudes towards HIV and infant feeding (HIV/IF) among mothers, counsellors and community members. Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol guided the development of the overall intervention strategy. Theories of behaviour change, a review of the international HIV/IF guidelines and formative research findings contributed to the definition of performance and learning objectives. Key communication messages and colourful graphic illustrations related to infant feeding in the context of HIV were then developed and/or adapted from existing generic materials. Draft materials were field tested with intended audiences and subjected to stakeholder technical review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      An integrated set of infant feeding counselling tools, referred to as 'job aids', was developed and included brochures on feeding methods that were found to be socially and culturally acceptable, a Question and Answer Guide for counsellors, a counselling card on the risk of transmission of HIV, and an infant feeding toolbox for demonstration. Each brochure describes the steps to ensure safer infant feeding using simple language and images based on local ideas and resources. The brochures are meant to serve as both a reference material during infant feeding counselling in the ongoing prevention of mother to child transmission (pMTCT) of HIV programme and as take home material for the mother.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The study underscores the importance of formative research and a systematic theory based approach to developing an intervention aimed at improving counselling and changing customary feeding practices. The identification of perceived barriers and facilitators for change contributed to developing the key counselling messages and graphics, reflecting the socio-economic reality, cultural beliefs and norms of mothers and their significant others."

Themes were explicated and analyzed from interviews until data saturation was reached. Content analysis from focus groups revealed three themes: personalizing learning, participatory learning, and group trust/safe environment. Storytelling provided students with an opportunity to become more actively involved, provided a forum to relate real life examples to concrete didactic data, served as a trigger for information recollection, and made material seem more realistic. The increased discussion and interaction within the classroom setting enabled students to probe alternative views and perspectives in the class room.

In this study, we have asked men about this transition and about what it is like to live with diabetes. We aimed to understand how people with type two diabetes incorporate chronic illness into their lives. Utilizing the processes of PAR, we created a conducive environment for the voices of people with diabetes to be clearly heard in relation to their health. Men who live with type two diabetes met with a researcher and two Clinical Nurse Consultants, for two hours, once a week, for four weeks, during November 1998. The men expressed that diabetes had made a positive impact on their lifestyle; they viewed diabetes as part of life and not as an illness. Men chose foods with confidence; their concern about potential complications meant they chose to take better care of themselves. They were confident in their knowledge of diabetes, and while they took responsibility for themselves, being supported by their partner was helpful in managing their diabetes.

The 286 women and 75 men who participated had a mean age of 49 years; 53% had hypertension, 65% had dyslipidemia, and 51% met criteria for metabolic syndrome. Their dietary intakes were compared with American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute nutrition parameters to identify areas for improvement to reduce CVD risk in this group of urban church members in Dallas, TX. Results from administration of the Dietary History Questionnaire indicated median daily intakes of 33.6% of energy from total fat, 10.3% of energy from saturated fat, 171 mg cholesterol, 16.3 g dietary fiber, and 2,453 mg sodium. A beneficial median intake of 2.9 cups fruits and vegetables per day was coupled with only 2.7 oz fish/week and an excessive intake of 13 tsp added sugar/day. These data indicate several changes needed to bring the diets of these individuals--and likely many other urban African Americans--in line with national recommendations, including reduction of saturated fat, sodium, and sugar intake, in addition to increased intake of fatty fish and whole grains.

A shift in dietary patterns from indigenous, high fiber, healthy local food to energy-dense, imported food with low nutritional value, and increased sedentary lifestyles are expediting this process. Essential to counteract this trend is an understanding of how people make food decisions. This participatory assessment utilized a quantitative and qualitative approach to capture diet patterns and knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices of food consumption. A structured 7-day food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to quantify the diets of 293 adult Pohnpeian women attending an island-wide education/disability screening program. An ethnographic approach, including in-depth interviews, informal focus groups and observations documented food behavior practices and contributed to the design of the FFQ. Of those responding to the FFQ, 96% reported eating rice frequently (3-7 days/week) whereas 75% reported eating locally grown carbohydrate foods frequently. Factors associated with culture change, including availability, affordability, convenience, and status of food items were found to determine food decisions. Food-based, culturally sensitive and innovative strategies that utilize existing resources are required to promote local food production and consumption. Prevention programs with an information, education and communication (IEC) approach are needed to provide accurate and available health and nutrition knowledge and to increase the demand for local foods. Behavior modification requires the continued collaboration of the national, state, and community organizations that partnered on this research to strategize programs in order to target individual food choices and to transform the environment to support these decisions."

Both prospective and retrospective intervention and genetic/marriage counseling was done through local PHC doctor.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Study revealed high occurrence of hemoglobinopathies in Bhuyan (9.8%) and Kharia (13.3%) tribes, including uncommon hemoglobin variants like hemoglobin D, E, beta-thalassemia, and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). G-6-PD enzyme deficiency was high in Dhelki Kharia (30.7%) and in Dudh Kharia (19.2%), whereas, it was recorded to be 21.1%, 16.3% and 13.7% in Paraja, Paik and Paudi Bhuyan subtribes, respectively. Use of antimalarials was cautioned in these tribal communities. Due to low frequency of Rhesus (D) negative (0.2-1.2%), the Rhesus (D) incompatibility problem seemed to be absent. Impact of methodical and prudent intervention and preventive strategies was found positive and encouraging.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Adoption of a biomedical anthropological approach for implementing and evolving health seeking cooperative strategy that was tribal-oriented, tribal-friendly and tribal-participatory for intervention and prevention of common hemolytic disorders was found effective. Success of this strategy was apparent with overwhelming response of tribal people towards changing the traditional mindset, improving the health and quality of life. Health must meet the needs and perception of the people."

            "abstract": "## IMPORTANCE\nCommunity-based interventions can reduce neonatal mortality when health systems are weak. Population coverage of target groups may be an important determinant of their effect on behavior and mortality. A women's group trial at coverage of 1 group per 1414 population in rural Bangladesh showed no effect on neonatal mortality, despite a similar intervention having a significant effect on neonatal and maternal death in comparable settings.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effect of a participatory women's group intervention with higher population coverage on neonatal mortality in Bangladesh.\n## DESIGN\nA cluster randomized controlled trial in 9 intervention and 9 control clusters.\n## SETTING\nRural Bangladesh.\n## PARTICIPANTS\nWomen permanently residing in 18 unions in 3 districts and accounting for 19 301 births during the final 24 months of the intervention.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nWomen's groups at a coverage of 1 per 309 population that proceed through a participatory learning and action cycle in which they prioritize issues that affected maternal and neonatal health and design and implement strategies to address these issues.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nNeonatal mortality rate.\n## RESULTS\nAnalysis included 19 301 births during the final 24 months of the intervention. More than one-third of newly pregnant women joined the groups. The neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the intervention arm (21.3 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births vs 30.1 per 1000 in control areas), a reduction in neonatal mortality of 38% (risk ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.43-0.89]) when adjusted for socioeconomic factors. The cost-effectiveness was US $220 to $393 per year of life lost averted. Cause-specific mortality rates suggest reduced deaths due to infections and those associated with prematurity/low birth weight. Improvements were seen in hygienic home delivery practices, newborn thermal care, and breastfeeding practices.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nWomen's group community mobilization, delivered at adequate population coverage, is a highly cost-effective approach to improve newborn survival and health behavior indicators in rural Bangladesh.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN01805825.\n"

            "abstract": "Qualitative research methods are systematic approaches to knowledge development that do not involve quantification. Such methods are used widely in nursing to understand the lived experience and the socioeconomic contexts of cardiovascular health and illness. The evolution of qualitative methods through three phases - traditional, modern and postmodern - frames the discussion. Three common qualitative methods - ethnography, phenomenology and grounded theory - are presented. Applications of qualitative methods have contributed to an understanding of such phenoma as adjustment after myocardial infarction, the experience of an acute cardiac event, the experience of chronic heart disease, the family and the cardiac illness experience, family adjustment to heart transplantation, physical activity practices of working women and family influence on individual health-related decisions in response to heart health intiatives. Postmodern approaches are briefly discussed. Participatory research is presented as an example of a postmodern approach to knowledge development. It is posited that interdisciplinary and multimethod cardiovascular research programs that incorporate qualitative methods will strengthen knowledge development in the cardiovascular field by contributing to an understanding of complex issues related to cardiovascular health and illness for individual persons, families, communities and populations, and to program and policy development."

The reliability and validity were studied based on the participants' opinions, complemented by qualitative observation of the work. There was consensus in acceptance of the technique based on \"acquisition of knowledge\" and the fact that it was participatory, democratic, and dynamic. The positive evaluation agrees with a previous study that interviewed municipal health secretaries, with a smaller preference of formal cognitive activities that were also part of the workshop. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of this innovative technique in training programs, since it is accepted by different target publics, allows for designing the program contents, and is useful in relation to new and controversial issues since it favors practical and reflexive experiences."

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular health research has been dominated by medical and patriarchal paradigms, minimizing a broader perspective of causes of disease. Socioeconomic status as a risk for cardiovascular disease is well established by research, yet these findings have had little influence. Participatory research (PR) that frames mixed method research has potential to bring contextualized clinically relevant findings into program planning and policy-making arenas toward developing meaningful health and social policies relevant to primary prevention. In this article we provide an overview of a PR program that included two quantitative and one qualitative studies and then we discuss lessons learned. The PR process we found was empowering for lone mothers, and transformative for lone mothers and researchers. Further, PR as an approach to research opened spaces in practice and policy-making arenas to raise upstream issues relevant to the health of low income lone mothers. We conclude that while PR is an effective approach to social determinants research, as a time-intensive endeavor, and one that does not easily align with research tradition, researchers must consider the strengths and drawbacks of PR when planning to implement such an approach."

            "abstract": "Over the period 1997-2000, an evaluation was made, in 10 districts of Uganda, of the onchocerciasis-control programme based on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). This programme is supported by the Ministry of Health, the African Progamme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) and The Carter Center Global 2000 River Blindness Programme. The data analysed came from: (1) monthly and annual reports; (2) annual interviews, in randomly-selected communities in selected districts, with heads of household, community leaders and ivermectin distributors; (3) participatory evaluation meetings (PEM); (4) participant observation studies; and (5) key informants. The percentage of treated communities in the 10 study districts achieving satisfactory treatment coverage [i.e. > or = 90% of the annual treatment objective (ATO)] rose from 46.0 in 1997 to 86.8 in 2000. This improvement was largely attributable to the adoption of collective CDTI decision-making by community members, avoidance of paving monetary incentives to the ivermectin distributors, and the satisfaction with the programme of those who had been treated. Coverage improved as the numbers of community members who were involved in choosing the method of distribution and in selecting their own community-directed health workers (CDHW) increased. Health education was also critical in improving individual members' involvement in decision-making, and in mobilizing other community members to take part in CDTI. Involvement of kinship groups, as well as educated community members as supervisors of CDHW, also helped to increase coverage. In a regression model, satisfaction with the programme was revealed as a significant predictor of the achievement of the target coverage (P<0.001). Cost per person, as an indicator for sustainability, varied with the size of the population under treatment, from at least U.S. $0.40 when the district ATO was <15,000 people, to U.S. $0.26 with an ATO of 15,000-40,000 and less than U.S. $0.10 when the district ATO exceeded 40,000 people. These results cast doubt on the validity of the current APOC indicator for sustainability, of a cost of no more than U.S. $0.20/person for all CDTI projects, whatever the size of the population to be treated. Although some women were involved in decision-making, their current involvement as supervisors or CDHW was minimal. Most of the present data were obtained through monitoring and operational-research activities that have been carried out, in an integrated fashion, within the Ugandan CDTI programme since its launch. It is recommended that assessment, monitoring and evaluation be widely used within all CDTI efforts. Operational research should remain focused and appropriate and directly involve the personnel who are executing the programme."

In a rural midwestern region where social and community resources for the sexual health of men who have sex with men (MSM) are relatively few, the patterns of partner-seeking and sexual behavior, and their relations to sexual compulsivity, may be different than findings from other assessments of men in urban centers. Using a community-based participatory approach (CBPR), data were collected from 309 men who were primarily white, identified as gay or homosexual, and had a mean age of 29.37 years (SD = 11.33), to explore relations between scores on a measure of sexual compulsivity and their sexual partner-seeking, drug and alcohol use, and sexual behaviors with men and women. The majority of men reported having engaged in sexual activity with men in the past 30 days. Those scoring higher than the sample mean (1.65 [SD = 0.66]) on the sexual compulsivity measure reported patterns of having sex with partners met online and having been the insertive or receptive partner in unprotected anal intercourse. Given the unique patterns of sexual partner-seeking in this area, interventions to decrease sexual risk-taking should take into account that the vast majority of men in rural areas are using the Internet to locate sexual partners, and prevention messages focused on rural contexts need to be tailored to include men who have a propensity for sexually compulsive behaviors. Additionally, interventions created for virtual spaces may be more sustainable with rural communities than traditional approaches to HIV/STI prevention."

            "abstract": "This paper describes the traditional breeding objectives and practices of West African Dwarf goat, Djallonke sheep, and N'dama cattle keepers in The Gambia and discusses the implications of these on the design of breeding-related interventions to improve livestock productivity. Data were collected via surveys implemented within three study sites in The Gambia, where traditional mixed crop-livestock smallholder farming predominates. The surveys comprised a participatory rural appraisal conducted in nine communities and a household questionnaire targeting 238 households. Livestock-keeping households were classified as 'poorer' or 'wealthier' based on the number of cattle owned. The most important objectives for keeping all species of livestock for the poorer groups (0 to 10 cattle) was 'savings and insurance', followed by 'income' and 'ceremonial/dowry' for the small ruminants and 'manure' and 'draught' for both cows and bulls. In contrast, for the wealthier group (more than 10 cattle), savings and insurance was the fourth to seventh ranked production objective (depending on species), with the most important production objectives being ceremonial/dowry for goats, income for sheep and manure for cows and bulls. An analysis of breeding practices indicated that breeding animals are selected on criteria which partially align to the breeding objectives, animals are rarely purchased for the purpose of breed improvement, knowledge of the cause and consequence of inbreeding is low and breeding decision makers may not necessarily be the livestock owner, particularly if the livestock owner is a women. Given this, it is suggested that capacity building on breeding-related issues, particularly in relation to the selection of breeding animals and specifically targeted at the different socioeconomic groups of livestock keepers, may be an appropriate, effective and relatively low-cost breeding intervention."

            "abstract": "Participatory rural appraisal (PRA), supported by checklists and intensive case studies on individual households, was carried out in three villages at three different altitudes in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The chicken production system in each village is described and the problems are discussed. More than 60% of the families kept chickens, and in most cases the women owned and managed the birds and controlled the cash from the sales. The production systems followed were mainly low-input and small-scale, with 7-10 mature birds per household, reared in the back yards with inadequate housing, feeding and health care. The average egg production per clutch was 15-20, with 3-4 clutches per year. The mean number of eggs set per bird was 12.9 +/- 2.2 (n = 160), depending on the size of the bird and season, and the hatching rate was 80.9% +/- 11.1%, range 44%-100% (n = 160). Poultry meat and eggs were generally accepted and appreciated in all three villages. In addition to the small amount of cash income they provide, scavenging chickens have nutritional, cultural and social functions. The flock composition, price of poultry and poultry products, disease outbreaks and hatching of chicks were strongly affected by season. Disease was cited as the most important problem by most of the members of the community, followed by predation, lack of feed, poor housing, insufficient water and parasites. Disease periodically decimated the flocks, and consequently, about 50% of the eggs produced were incubated in order to replace the birds that had died. The major source of loss in the system was the high mortality of chicks (61%) that occurred between hatching and the end of brooding at 8 weeks of age. The system was characterized by no or few inputs and a low output level. The major input was the cost of foundation stock, but after that virtually no cost was involved. The major source of feed for the birds was from the scavenging feed resource base, which comprised table leftovers, small grain supplements and anything edible from the immediate environment."

Mixed methods were used to gather information on meat safety and related socioeconomic factors. These methods included a participatory urban appraisal, focus group discussions with eight butchers' associations, in depth discussions with six key informants, a questionnaire study of 269 meat sellers and a cross-sectional survey of meat quality (200 samples from ten associations). We found that slaughter, processing and sale of beef meat take place under unhygienic conditions. The activities involve both men and women, with some task differentiation by gender. Meat sold by association members is of unacceptable quality. However, some groups have consistently better quality meat and this is positively correlated with the proportion of women members. Women also have significantly better food safety practice than men, though there was no significant difference in their knowledge of and attitude towards food safety. Most meat sellers (85 %) reported being ill in the last 2 weeks and 47 % reported experiencing gastrointestinal illness. Eating beef, eating chicken, eating offal, consuming one's own products and belonging to a group with poor quality of meat were all strong and significant predictors of self-reported gastrointestinal illness. We include that gender and group membership influence meat quality and self-reported gastrointestinal illness and that butchers' associations are promising entry points for interventions to improve food safety."

Since 1998, the Participatory Livestock Development Project (PLDP) has used this strategy to increase poultry production and household income in the northwest and north-central regions of Bangladesh. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the PLDP on the food and nutrient intakes of females in the PLDP-adopting households. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted using data for 35 women of reproductive age and 35 girls (5-12 y old) from both the PLDP-adopting and nonadopting households. Data was collected in 1999 on food consumption as well as poultry production, household socioeconomic status and food preferences, using quantitative and qualitative questionnaires. High-yielding parent poultry stock and egg production were significantly higher in the PLDP households (P < 0.001). Intakes of chicken and eggs were similar in both groups and negligible compared to other foods, especially rice, vegetables and fish. Fish intake was higher in the PLDP-adopting women (P < 0.08) and girls (P < 0.06) compared to their nonadopting counterparts. Women had a higher preference for small fish compared to other animal foods. The results of this study suggested that if a project such as the PLDP, which increases animal food production and income in rural Bangladesh, also aims to increase intakes of animal source foods in females, then the accessibility of small fish must be ensured."

Racial/ethnic disparities are well documented and the subject of intense research and intervention. Our understanding of disparities related to awareness and perceptions about causes, risk factors, and screening for CRC among subgroups of blacks in the United States is limited. This may be in part because grouping US-born blacks and foreign-born blacks as one homogeneous group obscures possible within-group differences. This study aimed to explore the cultural perceptions of CRC among 3 ethnic subgroups of blacks: African Americans (US born), foreign-born blacks from English-speaking Caribbean countries, and Haitian-born blacks. The study was informed by a community-based participatory research approach, using a cross-sectional mixed qualitative and quantitative methods design. A total of 62 individuals from the 3 ethnic subgroups participated in semistructured, in-depth qualitative and structured quantitative interviews. Qualitative findings revealed no stark differences among the 3 ethnic subgroups in their overall perceptions of cancer as well as their attitudes related to barriers, motivation, and resources for CRC screening. However, there were subtle differences in perceptions of curability, preventive practices, and preferred sources of information among the three ethnic subgroups of US blacks.

A 95-item questionnaire was developed and pilot tested for content validity and reliability. An in-person data collection approach was utilized and participants were given choice in responding in English or their native language. Of the 815 participants, 79.1% (N=645) reported never-screened, 7.9% (N=64), non-compliance, and 13.0% (N=106) compliance. Education was significantly associated with never-screened for CRC for Vietnamese and Chinese; employment status for Cambodians and Koreans; lack of health insurance for Cambodians, Korean and Chinese; English fluency and years lived in the U.S. for Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese. Less acculturated Asian Americans were more likely to be never screened, but differentially across ethnic subgroups. Barriers to screening included lack of knowledge, language, transportation, and time. Increased culturally-targeted public awareness and education programs are needed to improve CRC screening and compliance among high risk Asian American ethnic subgroups."

Beginning in 1997, the Program launched the Community Research Collaboration (CRC) Program, a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) program intended to foster community-researcher collaboration on all aspects of the research process, essentially placing the community in the center of the research paradigm. The CBCRP conducted a process evaluation of the CRC Program to assess success and identify areas for improvement. The evaluation included community-researcher collaborations and the award process. The evaluation identified successes that speak to the effectiveness of the collaboration concept: empowering women to formulate and initiate research; involving underserved and hard-to-reach populations; addressing important and useful research questions; increasing communities' skills and expertise, and enabling lasting collaborations. The greatest weakness identified was the involvement of the broader community (beyond the group/organization involved) in these projects. The evaluation identified strengths in CBCRP's award process, including technical assistance and feedback, the emphasis on collaboration in the review process, and awarding funds directly to community groups. Barriers included: power imbalances due to the community's lack of experience in the dominant research funding culture; funding limits and award delays; and the increased service demand beyond the funding limits of the award that is created. The CBCRP has been able to incorporate many of the evaluation findings to improve the CRC Program."

The programme was directed primarily to households composed of men, women and children, with particular attention given to women and children, who have the primary responsibility for household hygiene. A participatory approach was employed that used teams of volunteers chosen by and from the population, and who visited households twice during each campaign. Audiovisual materials and messages for each campaign were developed in collaboration with the population. The field teams were motivated by a regular programme of training, an intense support and monitoring system, and the availability of audiovisual materials for hygiene education, as well as a system of prizes that was added recently. After 18 months of experience, it is possible to say that the approach is both feasible and effective. The population reacted positively to the hygiene education that was offered and a degree of behaviour change was observed."

The study was conducted, using conventional and participatory methods, in 10 purposively selected Bhar villages. Two distinct varieties of tinni ('tinni patali' and 'tinni moti') with differing habitats and phenotypic characters were identified. Seven microecosystems (Kari, Badaila, Chammo, Karmol, Bhainsiki, Bhainsala and Khodailia) were found to support these varieties in differing proportions. Tinni rice can withstand more extreme weather conditions (the highest as well as lowest temperatures and rainfall regimes) than the 'genetically improved' varieties of rice (Oriza sativa L.) grown in the region. Both tinni varieties are important bioresources for the Bhar's subsistence livelihoods, and they use distinctive conservation approaches in their maintenance. Bhar women are the main custodians of tinni rice agrobiodiversity, conserving tinni through an institution called Sajha. Democratic decision-making at meetings organized by village elders determines the market price of the tinni varieties. Overall, the indigenous institutions and women's participation seem to have provided safeguards from excessive exploitation of tinni rice varieties. The maintenance of tinni through cultural knowledge and institutions serves as an example of the importance of locally maintained crop varieties in contributing to people's resilience and food security in times of rapid social and environmental change."

The WAS has been conducted annually by the Department of Sociology at the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba) since 1981. The household was the primary sampling unit. An eligible respondent was an individual 18 years of age or older who lived at that address, matched a randomly preassigned sex and provided consent. Respondents were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed by a physician with colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome. They were also asked, 'In the past 12 months have you experienced accidental leakage of liquid or solid stool?' Respondents were asked not to consider short-term diarrheal illness. Finally, respondents were asked to rank eight attributes of bowel habit on a 10-point scale. Answers ranking 5 points or greater were defined as having the attribute.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the city of Winnipeg, population 650,000, 1153 households were contacted. Of these, 727 (63%) agreed to participate and formed the study sample. Of the respondents, 361 were men and 366 were women (mean age 47 years). The sociodemographics of these respondents were comparable with those reported in previous WAS samples and the 2001 Canadian census data. Respondent cooperation, high interview quality and willingness for repeat contact were rated by the interviewers at 93%, 89% and 90%, respectively. FI was reported by 3.7% of the sample. There was no difference in sex or age of those reporting FI when compared with the rest of the sample. With physician-diagnosed gastrointestinal conditions removed from the analysis, 2.0% of the sample reported FI. Of the gastrointestinal conditions, only irritable bowel syndrome demonstrated a significant correlation with FI (one-sided X(2) test 11.567, degrees of freedom = 1; P=0.001). Four bowel habit attributes demonstrated strong correlation with FI (P=0.0001 for each t test): admission to any type of bowel accident, inability to delay toileting, inability to control passage of stool and need to wear a pad due to soiling. These four bowel habit attributes were reported (ranked 5 points or greater) by 1.5%, 22%, 2.4% and 1.5% of the sample, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of idiopathic FI in a well-defined community sample was 2.0%. There was no sex preference and the mean age of affected individuals was 47 years - demographic variables that did not vary among the sample. These findings suggest the need to develop a new paradigm beyond aging and childbirth injury to study the pathophysiology of FI. It is imperative to control for subjects with known irritable bowel syndrome in epidemiological studies because their inclusion in the present analysis doubled the calculated prevalence of FI."

Amongst the participatory qualitative methods used were 15 group discussions, eight semi-structured interviews, a number of opportunistic informal discussions and observation. The information gathering was complemented by a detailed review of project documents. Field visits for data collection took place over a six day period in March 2005. The project was effective in raising awareness about maternal health, and the social, economic and health consequences of various harmful traditional practices (HTPs). It has also mobilised the community to monitor and report HTPs and has strengthened referral systems for counselling, support and treatment. A number of effective strategies were identified as having contributed to project success. These are presented using the framework offered by the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion which presents five areas of public health action: developing personal skills; strengthening community action; building healthy public policy; re-orienting health services; and, creating supportive environments. This evaluation contributes to and strengthens the expanding body of literature about effective development practices to reduce HTPs. It demonstrates that addressing HTPs takes time and long term investment; both are necessary to enable better understanding of the social and cultural reasons for HTPs before attempting to address them, and to build the community trust necessary to overcome the natural resistance to challenging such deeply entrenched practices. The project also highlighted the importance of developing a multi pronged strategy based on engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and supportive legislation."

TLS men consumed less milk (p=4.2x10(-4)), and TLS women less vegetables (p=0.042). TLS men reported more physical activity at work (p=0.042) and TLS women less physical activity at leisure (p=0.0023). Total cholesterol (Men: 220 vs 244 mg/dl, p=0.0031; Women: 225 vs 246 mg/dl, (p=0.049) and LDL cholesterol levels (Men: 134 vs 153 mg/dl, p=0.012; Women: 133 vs 146 mg/dl, p>0.05) were higher in the blood serum of TLS men and women than in the MLS comparison group. While TLS women showed a higher rate of myocardial infarction (5% vs 16%, p=0.024), TLS men reported a dramatically higher frequency of body pain consistently, for example in the lower back (0% vs 25%; p>0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A consistent pattern was found of differences between individuals living a traditional versus modern lifestyle and between the sexes, identifying specific health risks for each group. Women with a traditional lifestyle were exposed to a greater risk for cardiovascular disease (especially myocardial infarction) and men with a traditional lifestyle reported higher rates of orthopedic symptoms (eg body pain). We also show that studies of rural populations can make a substantial contribution to basic research into understanding the environmental and genetic determinants of disease. The European Special Populations Research Network (EUROSPAN) provided an excellent example of a platform combining studies of rural populations from different parts of Europe that can leverage these for collaboration with large international consortia."

Most injecting drug users (IDUs) are men, an estimated 40% are married, and death rates have been high in the last five years, consequently the number of widows of IDUs has increased. Many of these widows and their children are HIV-infected and experience poor health, discrimination, and impoverishment; all factors likely to be compromising their mental health. People with poor mental health are more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviours. Mental health can be promoted by public health actions with vulnerable population groups.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We designed an intervention study to assess the feasibility and impact of a participatory action process to promote the mental health and well-being of widows of IDUs in Manipur and Nagaland, as a strategy for reducing the risk of engagement in HIV risk behaviours.

            "abstract": "The lifetime risk of acquiring HIV infection in many rural as well as urban areas of southern Africa is currently as high as two-in-three. For women, much of this risk still accrues rapidly at young ages despite high levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Thus, programmes that are more participatory and address underlying structural and community-level factors appear to be essential. We use cross-sectional data from a large-scale, population-based survey in rural eastern Zimbabwe to describe the relationships between membership of different forms of community group and young women's chances of avoiding HIV. Our results show that participation in local community groups is often positively associated with successful avoidance of HIV, which, in turn, is positively associated with psychosocial determinants of safer behaviour. However, whether or not these relationships hold depends on a range of factors that include how well the group functions, the purpose of the group, and the education level of the individual participant. We identify factors that may influence the social capital value of community groups in relation to HIV prevention at the individual, group, and community levels. Young women with secondary education participate disproportionately in well-functioning community groups and are more likely to avoid HIV when they do participate. Longitudinal studies are needed: (i) to establish whether community group membership supports the development of safer lifestyles or merely has greater appeal to individuals already predisposed towards such lifestyles, and (ii) to pinpoint directions of causality between hypothesised mediating factors. In-depth research is needed on the specific qualities of community groups that enhance their contribution to HIV control. However, our findings suggest that promotion of and organisational development and training among community groups could well be an effective HIV control strategy."

The data analysed came from interviews with 260 adult women (one from each of 260 randomly-selected households in 20 onchocerciasis-endemic communities), community informants, and participatory evaluation meetings (PEM) in eight communities. The women who had been treated with ivermectin in 1999 generally had more knowledge of the benefits of taking ivermectin, were more likely to have attended the relevant health-education sessions and were more involved in community decisions on the method of ivermectin distribution than the women who had not received ivermectin in that year. There were fewer female community-directed health workers (CDHW) than male CDHW in the communities investigated. The reasons for not attending health-education sessions, not participating in community meetings concerning the CDTI, and the reluctance of some women to serve as CDHW were investigated. The most common reasons given were domestic chores, a reluctance to express their views in meetings outside their own kinship group, suspicions that other women might take advantage of them, and a lack of interest. Most of the women interviewed (as well as other community members) felt that there were relatively few women CDHW. The women attributed this to a lack of interaction and trust amongst themselves, which resulted in more men than women being selected as CDHW. The rest of the community members were not against women working as CDHW. It is recommended that communities be encouraged to select women to serve as CDHW in the CDTI, and that the performances of male and female CDHW be compared."

The methodology included a comparative case study using in-depth interviews and participatory research with young women living in urban and rural Kilimanjaro. Along with important findings about how menstrual onset creates challenges for girls attending school emerged findings about the significant gaps in girls' knowledge about body changes, sexual health and HIV/AIDS.

Physical health was focussed on ensuring a healthy diet and exercise, yet most adult women in the study experienced stress around goals that are seen as relatively unattainable. The data produced in this study should be utilized to develop and test survey questions that can be applied to a larger portion of the Métis population. The Aboriginal Life Promotion Framework is useful as an organizing tool for systematically exploring elements of living."

The aim of the Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) study was to assess a structural intervention that combined a microfinance programme with a gender and HIV training curriculum.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Villages in the rural Limpopo province of South Africa were pair-matched and randomly allocated to receive the intervention at study onset (intervention group, n=4) or 3 years later (comparison group, n=4). Loans were provided to poor women who enrolled in the intervention group. A participatory learning and action curriculum was integrated into loan meetings, which took place every 2 weeks. Both arms of the trial were divided into three groups: direct programme participants or matched controls (cohort one), randomly selected 14-35-year-old household co-residents (cohort two), and randomly selected community members (cohort three). Primary outcomes were experience of intimate-partner violence--either physical or sexual--in the past 12 months by a spouse or other sexual intimate (cohort one), unprotected sexual intercourse at last occurrence with a non-spousal partner in the past 12 months (cohorts two and three), and HIV incidence (cohort three). Analyses were done on a per-protocol basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00242957.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      In cohort one, experience of intimate-partner violence was reduced by 55% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.91; adjusted risk difference -7.3%, -16.2 to 1.5). The intervention did not affect the rate of unprotected sexual intercourse with a non-spousal partner in cohort two (aRR 1.02, 0.85-1.23), and there was no effect on the rate of unprotected sexual intercourse at last occurrence with a non-spousal partner (0.89, 0.66-1.19) or HIV incidence (1.06, 0.66-1.69) in cohort three.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      A combined microfinance and training intervention can lead to reductions in levels of intimate-partner violence in programme participants. Social and economic development interventions have the potential to alter risk environments for HIV and intimate-partner violence in southern Africa."

            "abstract": "Although new contraceptive technology has the potential for providing women with expanded options for fertility control, the historical record of international family planning shows that, in practice, introduction of new methods has not always broadened reproductive choice. Using the example of introduction of intrauterine devices into the Indian family planning program in the 1960s, we show that an exclusive focus on the technology itself is problematic and argue that methodologies are needed that relate introduction of new methods to user needs and program capacities. We summarize key findings from the Indonesian experience with Norplant introduction. Although an effort was made to address problems with previous approaches, major deficiencies in both the technical and interpersonal dimensions of care arose when the implants were made broadly available within the program. We subsequently present a methodology for contraceptive introduction developed by the World Health Organization. This methodology emphasizes the social and institutional context in which technology is used and suggests a participatory and research-based approach to program and policy development. We illustrate results from this new approach in its implementation in Vietnam and suggest areas for further evaluation."

This innovative culturally congruent approach to HIV prevention involves one of the most influential social structures in the African American community-the African American church. Using the ADAPT-ITT model, and principles of community-based participatory research, this faith-based HIV intervention was adapted from a CDC-defined evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for young African American women. Results of data assessing the feasibility of implementing this faith-based HIV intervention suggests that young African American women are receptive and willing to participate in a faith-based HIV intervention. Results show that fidelity to intervention implementation (97%) and participant attendance to both sessions (92%) was high, and the HIV risk behaviors targeted in the faith-based intervention matched the participants' HIV behavioral risk profile. Given the vulnerability of young African American women to HIV sustainable efforts, in particular, the institutionalization of this intervention within the church structure could halt the persistent increase in HIV infections within this community."

In 8 Italian municipalities, 2,512 men and women without both diabetes and CI-DSN at baseline are examined. Potential effect of vascular factors was estimated by regressing new onset CI-DSN on the occurrence of several vascular diseases and risk factors. Multivariate relative risks of CI-DSN were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. After 3.8 (±2.4) years of follow-up, we documented 51 incident CI-DSN cases. At univariate analysis, age, comorbidity, waist circumference, leg length, peripheral artery disease, and coronary heart disease proved to increase the risk of developing CI-DSN. By multivariate analyses, only age (RR = 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.14), leg length (RR = 1.05; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.1) and peripheral artery disease (RR = 2.75; 95 % CI, 1.15-6.56) proved significant predictors of CI-DSN. Separate analyses by gender show that age is an independent predictor of CI-DSN both in men and in women, while PAD predicts the disease only in men, together with body height. Incidence of CI-DSN is higher in individuals carrying vascular conditions. In men, the presence at baseline of peripheral artery disease is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of developing CI-DSN. The incidence of neuropathy in non-diabetic individuals is associated with potentially modifiable vascular factors."

This is especially true in vulnerable at-risk sub-populations, where definitions of \"community\", \"participation\" and \"representation\" can be difficult to apply. This study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of a participatory model of community liaison among an occupational cohort of women at high-risk of HIV and sexually-transmitted infections in Mwanza City, northwest Tanzania in preparation for a Phase III vaginal microbicide trial. This approach was rooted in participatory action-orientated research and used tools adapted from participatory learning and action techniques. During the feasibility study, a mobile community-based sexual and reproductive health service for women working as informal food vendors or in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels and guesthouses was established in 10 city wards. Participatory mapping was carried out by project fieldworkers and wards divided into 78 geographical clusters of facilities in consultation with community members and study participants. Representatives at cluster and ward level were elected in a process facilitated by the site Community Liaison Officer and a site-level Community Advisory Committee established. A logical framework was used to guide the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the community liaison system (CLS) within the broader feasibility study. The CLS was essential to the successful conduct of the feasibility study and has now been consolidated and expanded as part of the on-going MDP301 Phase III microbicide trial in Mwanza. The participatory model presented in this paper is likely to be generalisable to other vulnerable, stigmatised, at-risk study populations in resource-limited settings."

However due to changing circumstances in Europe, the reason for gathering has altered from one of necessity in the past to a pleasurable activity today. Wild plant gathering has therefore also received renewed attention as a form of intangible cultural heritage expressing local preferences, habits and man's relationship with nature. In the Biosphere Reserve Grosses Walsertal (Austria), local people's knowledge of the gathering of wild plants and their perception of their own gathering activities are being documented. The focus of this paper is on the uses of herbal teas and the informal guidelines for gathering plants that have been issued by the Bergtee (mountain tea) association.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six free-list interviews were conducted with subsequent semi-structured interviews and three focus group meetings held with members of the Bergtee association.

The Bergtee association, founded by a young man and two middle-aged women in the valley, is a good example of the link between biological and cultural diversity, with the aim of sharing the biosphere reserve's natural treasures as well as local plant-related knowledge in the form of herbal tea products. The association's informal guidelines for gathering reflect people's attitude to nature: monetary income does not play a major role in gathering plants; instead people's appreciation of the value of the nature around them is to the fore.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Gathering wild plants can be seen as an expression of people's regional identity.

At the same time, fish traders, especially women, travel regularly to remote fishing camps to purchase fish. Although female fish traders may be exposed to HIV, violence and abuse in their interactions and relationships with fishermen, economic necessity keeps them in this trade. Good health among fisherfolk is a basic mainstay of productive and sustainable fisheries, providing food and income to fishing communities and the nation at large. However, these benefits are severely at risk as per-capita fish supplies in several African countries are declining, and fisherfolk are among the populations most vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Under the regional programme 'Fisheries and HIV/AIDS in Africa: Investing in sustainable solutions,' the WorldFish Center conducted a socioeconomic assessment in the Kafue Flats fishery in Zambia to identify factors related to HIV/AIDS vulnerability among people in the fishing communities, particularly female fish traders. The study identified a variety of factors, hence the 'Fish Trader+' model of intervention was developed to reduce female fish traders' vulnerability to HIV by building on their economic rationale through the formation of savings groups. This article outlines the implementation of the Fish Trader+ model in Zambia and examines its potential to empower female fish traders so as to reduce poverty and vulnerability to HIV in fishing communities."

Community outreach and counseling are provided by African American men with whom participants can identify, and counseling is designed to respond to men's need for privacy, cultural affirmation, and masculine values. Thirty-six African American MSMW completed a pilot intervention, including baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments of sexual risk behaviors and psychosocial factors. Preanalysis and postanalysis found significant reductions in unprotected receptive and insertive anal sex with male partners, fewer numbers of female and male unsafe sex partners, and decreased sex while under the influence of drugs. Men also reported significantly increased social support, self-esteem, and reduced loneliness at follow-up. Positive outcomes suggest this is a promising approach for reducing HIV risk in this population."

            "abstract": "In 1990, the Unicef conceptual framework for nutrition recognised the role of care, along with household food security and health services and environment, as one of the three underlying factors of child survival, growth, and development. This model has been adopted at a policy level at the International Conference on Nutrition (Rome, 1992) and over the past ten years the concept of care has been refined through literature reviews, consultative meetings and empirical works. \"Care is the provision in the household and the community of time, attention, and support to meet the physical, mental, and social needs of the growing child and other household members\". Basically, care refers to the actions of caregivers (mainly, but not only mothers) that translate food and health resources into positive outcomes for the child's nutrition. Even under circumstances of poverty, enhanced caregiving can optimise the use of resources to promote good nutrition. Care practices have been grouped into six categories: care for women, breastfeeding and child feeding practices, psychosocial care, food preparation, hygiene practices, household health practices. They cover a wide range of behaviours, are often culturally specific and are daily, repetitive, and time-consuming activities. It must be underlined that the way care practices are performed (i.e., quality of care) is as important as the practices themselves. It has also been emphasised that children play a significant role in determining the quality of care that they receive, through an interactive process: an active child elicits more care from the caregiver, who is in turn more responsive. Care resources at household level have been described according to three categories: human (knowledge, beliefs, education, physical and mental health of the caregiver), economic (control on income, workload and time), and organisational (alternate caregivers, community support). But the availability of care also depends on support at the national or international level. As the mother is the primary caregiver, most of the obstacles to care are the constraints to the mothers, the most common characteristic of which being the low status of women in many societies. More studies are required to better understand the causal relationship between care and nutrition. Methods to measure the qualitative aspects of care and indicators that capture the complexity of care must be developed and cross-culturally tested. These will also be useful to design and monitor more effective interventions incorporating care. These programmes should first identify and support the good traditional care practices rather than simply ask for change; the activities proposed should not break the balance between the time women spend on care and the time they spend on work. Therefore one must be sure that enough resources are available. Finally, to achieve sustainable changes a participatory and comprehensive approach is definitely needed."

The study included a quantitative survey of 6,882 married women, 119 interviews and 95 focus group discussions with community and local government leaders, traditional birth attendants, women who had attended maternity services and health care providers. Only 26% of the women surveyed had received any antenatal care and only 13% delivered in a facility with a skilled birth attendant for their most recent pregnancy. However, those who had had at least one antenatal consultation were 7.6 times more likely to deliver with a skilled birth attendant. Most pregnant women had little or no contact with the health care system for reasons of custom, lack of perceived need, distance, lack of transport, lack of permission, cost and/or unwillingness to see a male doctor. Based on these findings, we designed and implemented an integrated package of interventions that included upgrading antenatal, delivery and emergency obstetric care; providing training, supervision and support for new midwives in primary health centres and hospitals; and providing information to the community about safe pregnancy and delivery and the use of these services."

Methods used included focus group discussions, in-depth and critical incidence interviews, and Participatory Learning and Action methods. We found that treatment seeking behaviour for children was influenced by norms of decision-making power and 'ownership' of children, access to and control over resources to pay for treatment, norms of responsibility for payment, marital status, household living arrangements, and the quality of relationships between mothers, fathers and elders. However, the implications of these findings may be interpreted from different perspectives. Most studies that have considered gender in relation to malaria have done so within a narrow biomedical approach to health that focuses only on the outcomes of gender relations in terms of the (non-)utilisation of allopathic healthcare. However, we argue that a 'gender transformatory' approach, which aims to promote women's empowerment, needs to include but go beyond this model, to consider broader potential outcomes of intra-household bargaining for women's and men's interests, including their livelihoods and 'bargaining positions'."

The challenges are amplified when the particular health issue or research question is not prominent in the consciousness of the targeted community. In this paper, we explore the community-based participatory research (CBPR) model as a means to negotiate a mutual agenda between communities and researchers. The paper is focused on the (perceived) need for cervical cancer screening in an under-resourced community in Cape Town, South Africa. Cervical cancer is a significant health problem in this community and elsewhere in South Africa. Unlike HIV-AIDS, however, many Black South Africans have not been educated about cervical cancer and the importance of obtaining screening. Many may not consider screening a priority in their lives. Our research included extensive consultations and informal interviews with diverse community and regional stakeholders. Following these, we conducted 27 focus groups and 106 demographic surveys with randomly selected youth, parents, local health care personnel, educators and school staff. Focus group data were summarized and analyzed cross-sectionally. Community stakeholders were involved throughout this research. Our consultations, interviews, and focus group data were key in identifying the concerns and priorities of the community. By engaging community stakeholders, we developed a research framework that incorporated the community's concerns and priorities, and stressed the intersecting roles of poverty, violence, and other cultural forces in shaping community members' health and wellbeing. Community members helped to refocus our research from cervical cancer to 'cervical health,' a concept that acknowledged the impact on women's bodies and lives of HIV-AIDS and STDs, sexual violence, poverty, and multiple social problems. We conclude that the research agenda and questions in community-based health research should not be considered immutable. They need to be open to negotiation, creativity, and constant reinvention."

An interdisciplinary, participatory study of two delta villages studied human behaviour in relation to disease transmission, knowledge and treatment using the insights and methods of social science, especially anthropology. Through primarily qualitative techniques such as focus group discussions and participant observation, we found that most people who used the canals for domestic, recreational or agricultural activities thought that they had little alternative but to do so, even though they knew of the risk of exposure to schistosomiasis. The knowledge and behaviour of villagers with regard to schistosomiasis affected their utilization of the local provisions for schistosomiasis diagnosis and treatment. Our monitoring of diagnosis and testing for schistosomiasis at a local health centre identified areas which could be upgraded, and we trained health staff to improve their knowledge of schistosomiasis. Our findings reinforce the need for integrated research and implementation strategies, taking into account the knowledge and capabilities of all those involved in schistosomiasis control at the village level, and the fostering of effective communication between villagers, both women and men, and the local staff in rural health centres."

            "abstract": "This paper reports on a pilot study of the development and evaluation (using outcome and process measures) of a manualised participatory risk reduction programme, aimed at reducing high-risk sexual behaviour amongst tertiary level learners, called 'Sex and Risk' (S&R), at the University of Durban-Westville 1 in South Africa. The programme was grounded in a focused ethnographic study of the risk behaviours and life context of tertiary level learners at this institution, as well as informed by literature on successful behavioural risk reduction programmes on Western and African populations. Significantly, the S&R programme was shown to facilitate greater awareness in males of how social influences inform high-risk sexual behaviour. This greater awareness did not, however, translate into greater self-efficacy in relation to negotiating safer sexual relationships for either males or females and was attributed to the dominant social norms, which promote and sustain gender inequity that places the sexual health of young women and men at risk. Given that the S&R programme operates largely at the level of the individual, although it does address the subjective aspects of social influences on behaviour, these findings highlight the need for proximal situation-centred interventions, which promote more egalitarian social norms in sexual relationships, to accompany such curriculum interventions at tertiary institutions."

Although community women collaborated in aspects of the intervention and research, the project nonetheless raises the basic question whether such involvement of community women does or does not correspond to what scientific writers consider to be the essence of participatory research. We review key project features in the context of recent literature and conclude that although the project is committed to the sharing of power and control, it does not fully correspond to the characteristics of participatory research. Moreover, we argue that given the project's central focus on reproductive health outcomes, complete adherence to the process-oriented, pure version of participatory research would have been inappropriate."

Sixty women participated with a mean age of 58 years. Participants brainstormed 150 items which were consolidated into 67 items. After sorting and rating, cluster analysis revealed eight clusters of barriers on knowledge, fear, language and transportation, access to mammogram center, access to doctor, beliefs and practices, self-care, and family dependence. Participants discussed possible solutions, and emphasized out-reach models to address knowledge gaps and issues of language and transportation. One example was a community-based shuttle bus to screening centres, hosted by trained co-ethnic workers.

            "abstract": "In Germany, four years of experience with mifepristone as an alternative procedure to surgical abortion have revealed a still reluctant use of the new method. In the public discussion, the more participatory role of the women in the abortion procedure is often feared to have negative consequences for the emotional processing of the event. This study compares the women's criteria for selecting a method and the psychological responses before and four weeks after medical or surgical abortion. Two hundred and nineteen women answered questions regarding demographic data, motivation, medical details and social support. Additionally, the women completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). There were no differences regarding sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics among both groups. Comparing data before and a month after the abortion, our study showed a significant decline of both anxiety and depression for both abortion methods. The medical group had significantly lower entrance levels of anxiety than the surgical group. The medical regimen caused significantly more sequelae such as prolonged bleeding, pain and other side effects. However, this did not have a negative influence on the coping process. A vast majority of women in both groups evaluated choosing between different abortion methods as being highly important to them. Our study supports the consensus view that termination of an unwanted pregnancy is a positive first solution to the conflict, regardless of the chosen method. The positive outcome and high satisfaction levels among the participants illustrate the importance of an ongoing and improved accessibility of medical abortion for women in Germany."

They were between 14 and 43 years of age (mean 22.6 +/- 5.7). 87.4% of them were single and 63.7% were primipara. 50.4% of them failed to complete primary education while 3.4% had university-level education. 6% were mentally and/or psychologically handicapped and 42.7% had no profession. The major causes of admission into the Home were: desire to hide the pregnancy, family conflicts, homelessness, difficult material situation, mental or physical disability, violence or alcoholism in the family. The control group comprised 400 women (group K) who gave birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. 51.5% of them were primipara. The mean age in this group was 27.4 +/- 5.4 (17-44). 71.3% were married. The Majority had secondary (41.9%) or university (32.5%) education. Most of them worked as artisans, teachers or economists. Neurological or psychiatric diseases dominated in group DSM but otherwise no severe disease at all could be disclosed. Satisfactory prenatal care was provided to 33.1% of DSM patients and to 78% of group K. No prenatal care was provided to 9.5% of DSM patients and to 1.7% of group K. EPH gestosis was more often observed in DSM patients and imminent abortion, premature birth, PROM, urinary tract infection, and anaemia were more frequent in controls. More DSM patients had no treatment during pregnancy than controls. The use of tocolytics was significantly more frequent in DSM patients. Antibiotics and drugs accelerating maturation of the respiratory system were applied with similar frequency in both groups. Frequency of immature and mature births was similar in both groups. 84.2% of DSM patients and 68.8% of controls had natural delivery. Cesarian section was twice more frequent in group K. Immediate indications dominated in both groups (74.1% in DSM; 57.4% in K). No medication was used during delivery in 30% of patients. DSM patients more often required strong analgesics. Antibiotics and agents increasing uterine tension more often were used in K patients. Deliveries in both groups were usually without complications. Female genital tract injury was more frequent in DSM patients (20.9% in DSM; 14.8% in K). Delivery duration was similar in both groups, but the second part of delivery was longer in K primipara. Mean neonatal weight in the 1000-2500 g range was similar in both groups but was significantly higher in controls for 2501-4000 g neonates. The difference for newborns weighing more than 4000 g was not significant. There were no neonates weighing less than 1000 g. The clinical condition of newborns measured with the Apgar scale was worse in the DSM group after the 1st min, as well as after the 3rd and 5th min and the difference in each case was significant. Puerperium was usually uncomplicated. However, urinary tract infection was more frequent in DSM patients and anaemia was more frequent in controls. The duration of hospitalisation was similar in both groups (mean = 6 days). 120 of 177 DSM mothers left hospital together with their children, as compared to 99.3% in the control group. 87 children of mothers from the Maternity Home were offered for adoption.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      By studying unwed maternity it was observed that a holistic approach is the only way to disclose all the problems which are often unusually complex and concealed but which determine the normal development of an individual in the society.

            "abstract": "Violence against women has been a problem in human cultures for centuries. This is still the case both in developed and in developing countries, but it is in developing countries where the problem is aggravated as the result of cultural norms that are tolerant of men exerting power over women and girls as a commonly accepted practice. This power is often put into practice through physical and psychological acts of violence. In Mexico, as in many other countries, there is a legal framework that protects women from such acts, yet in the case of Mexico it has not yet been translated into actual improvements in their lives. We present an overview of advances in legal remedies regarding violence towards females internationally and in Mexico. The fact that these advances per se do not lead to changes in social norms that tolerate violence against females is emphasized. Also presented is the experience of the Mexican Institute for Research on Family and Population (IMIFAP) with the design and implementation of programs that promote protective factors and changes in behaviors in such a way that violence is effectively prevented. These programs focus on the development of psychosocial skills and knowledge through participatory workshops that promote self reflection, and they are developed and evaluated before being then applied on a large scale in poverty-stricken communities. These workshops lead to more egalitarian relationships between genders. IMIFAP's programs address not only violence but also other areas are integrated such that the enablement of psychosocial skills is applied in the broader socio-cultural context, leading to healthier and economically more productive lives. These programs are derived from the Framework for Enabling Agentic Empowerment (FENAE), which enables choice and the development of agentic empowerment through integrating skills, knowledge, and the context in which people live."

Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer were invited to participate. The intervention encompassed three professionally led self-help groups running sequentially, each group for approximately 4 months. Each group of five to seven participants met weekly. Several empowerment strategies were initiated by two professional facilitators, aiming to promote empowerment processes and to manage stress. The participants experienced group participation as both empowering and as a valuable source of support, and although the group processes developed very differently, a strong sense of fellowship developed in all three groups. The discussion highlights the findings in relation to several theoretical perspectives including social capital, social cohesion, risky agreements, helper-therapy and power/empowerment. We conclude that empowerment strategies that are implemented in professionally led breast cancer self-help groups can contribute to participant empowerment and function as an important source of re-discovery and confirmation of the participants' strengths and abilities."

A total of 114 black African men and women were recruited. A large number of African countries were represented among respondents from newly-migrant and well-established communities. The response rate to the oral fluid sample was high at 82% and all samples collected were of sufficient quality to be tested for HIV. In-depth interviews with respondents revealed positive views and experiences about participating in the study whilst understanding of the questionnaire was good. We therefore conclude that anonymous HIV testing as part of a community-based survey is feasible and acceptable, whilst a set of recommendations was produced to refine the survey methodology and questionnaire.

Audio-taped activity instructions with music and practical usage of the educational package were given to the intervention group in weekly home-visits by 53 volunteers from local non-governmental and community-based organizations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the participants, the percentage who reported being active (at lease 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity for at least 5 days a week, or at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity for at least three days a week) increased from 3% and 2.7% at baseline to 13.4% and 3% (p < 0.0001) at the ending of the program in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The participants in the intervention group reported more minutes of physical activity per week (mean = 139.81, SE = 23.35) than women in the control group (mean = 40.14, SE = 12.65) at week 8 (p < 0.0001). The intervention group subjects exhibited a significantly greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (-10.0 mmHg) than the control group women (+2.0. mmHg).

The main over-riding theme uncovered by the research was 'no me hace caso', or that women and men accessing the maternal health system did not feel valued. The significant amount of time required to receive care was interpreted by the participants as a lack of respect. Finally, the idea of 'cuña' emerged, in which participants noted special treatment for those with social connections to health-care providers.

It was conceptualized and designed by a team of university-based researchers and community health workers (promotores). This article describes the process of establishing a CBPR project such as Formando and the most current results from that project. The Formando project is an example of health-focused advocacy with the Mexican agricultural workers in Southeast (SE) Idaho. To date, 172 qualitative interviews on participants' knowledge about type 2 diabetes have been carried out with farmworker women and their families. Biometric data (heights, weights, blood pressures and fasting blood glucoses) were obtained from participants. Fieldnotes, focus group discussions and key informants were used to triangulate findings. Significant quantitative findings include that age was significantly associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) (p < 0.001, Spearman Correlation < 0.001) and with elevated fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001, Spearman Correlation < 0.001). The qualitative interviews were thematically analyzed. Key themes associated with type 2 diabetes in this community were the connection between thinness and vanity, dieting and starvation and the onset of diabetes as a result of, what social scientists call, structural violence within the immigrants' daily lives. We conclude that long-term commitment to using the CBPR approach in these Mexican agricultural communities is an effective way to engage in health research and to establish real and meaningful dialogue with community members."

Completion of a self-administrated questionnaire at baseline was used to obtain anthropometric measurements, and laboratory testing was done before and after the program. Differences in body composition change and obesity-related life style between the two groups were compared with respect to WC and non-weight cycling (NWC). After 12 weeks, both groups showed reductions in weight, waist circumference, and body mass index. The group differences were not significant.

This approach has interdisciplinary roots dating back more than half a century. Although widely used in community-based conservation and development projects worldwide, international public health research has yet to fully embrace this inclusive approach, which requires the sharing of power with research participants and a more involved relationship building process with communities. In return, the gap between publication and public action can be narrowed because ownership of the research process by an empowered community can lay the foundation for an accelerated implementation of interventions tailored to community needs and based on research results. This article draws on the professional experiences of the authors as well as published examples of international participatory health research with women. Factors critical for the success of participatory research are discussed, including attention to initial planning, early community involvement, conceptual clarity, defined community benefits, and joint interpretation of results, as well as translation to action.

Improving both the diagnosis and prevention of FASD requires evidence-based approaches to clinical and social service delivery that are capable of accounting for the unique contours of the geographic, regional and cultural diversities in which women become pregnant and in which families live. Although FASD has been a priority for communities and governments in northern Canada, research capacity has not been available to support the development of the context-specific knowledge needed to inform policy and practice in this region. Moreover, there have not been adequate mechanisms for transferring practice-based knowledge from the Canadian North to researchers and service providers in the South, who might make use of this knowledge to inform their own practice.

We conducted a telephone survey of staff (N = 100) from agencies across New Mexico to assess perceptions of methamphetamine use among people working with AI populations. We collected and analyzed self-reported drug use data from 300 AI clients/relatives who completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) in the context of treatment at three diverse addiction treatment programs. Each focus group offered a unique perspective about the effect of drugs and alcohol on each respective community. Though data from the phone surveys and ASIs suggested concerning rates of methamphetamine use, with women more adversely affected by substance use in general, alcohol was identified as the biggest substance use problem for AI populations in the Southwest. There appears to be agreement that methamphetamine use is a significant problem in these communities, but that alcohol is much more prevalent and problematic. There was less agreement about what should be done to prevent and treat methamphetamine use. Future research should attend to regional and tribal differences due to variability in drug use patterns, and should focus on identifying and improving dissemination of effective substance use interventions."

Such interventions should take people's reported needs, coping strategies, and context into account. Usually, active problem-focused coping strategies have been encouraged because they are considered to be more beneficial than passive emotion-focused strategies. However, this may not be the case in the South African context. This study was based on in-depth interviews with Black, rural, South African women about their coping strategies. The overriding aim of coping was to solve the tasks of physical, psychological, and social survival. Strategies involving avoidance of, escaping from, or minimizing HIV/AIDS and its accompanying emotional distress were predominant. We argue that such strategies could be adaptive in a society with scarce resources and marked by gender inequalities. Our findings suggest that care and support interventions should be sensitive to culture and context, should be holistic and participatory, and should include income generation and child care services."

Among women, smoking was associated with stigma and shame. Smoking in women is often hidden from family members. Peer pressure was an important influence on smoking behaviour in younger people, who tended to hide their smoking from elders.

            "abstract": "## INTRODUCTION\nImproving maternal and newborn health in low-income settings requires both health service and community action. Previous community initiatives have been predominantly rural, but India is urbanizing. While working to improve health service quality, we tested an intervention in which urban slum-dweller women's groups worked to improve local perinatal health.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nA cluster randomized controlled trial in 24 intervention and 24 control settlements covered a population of 283,000. In each intervention cluster, a facilitator supported women's groups through an action learning cycle in which they discussed perinatal experiences, improved their knowledge, and took local action. We monitored births, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths, and interviewed mothers at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcomes described perinatal care, maternal morbidity, and extended perinatal mortality. The analysis included 18,197 births over 3 years from 2006 to 2009. We found no differences between trial arms in uptake of antenatal care, reported work, rest, and diet in later pregnancy, institutional delivery, early and exclusive breastfeeding, or care-seeking. The stillbirth rate was non-significantly lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.60-1.22), and the neonatal mortality rate higher (1.48, 1.06-2.08). The extended perinatal mortality rate did not differ between arms (1.19, 0.90-1.57). We have no evidence that these differences could be explained by the intervention.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFacilitating urban community groups was feasible, and there was evidence of behaviour change, but we did not see population-level effects on health care or mortality. In cities with multiple sources of health care, but inequitable access to services, community mobilization should be integrated with attempts to deliver services for the poorest and most vulnerable, and with initiatives to improve quality of care in both public and private sectors.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN96256793\n"

We describe how they stimulated change in rural Nepal and the factors influencing their effectiveness. We collected data from 19 women's group members, 2 group facilitators, 16 health volunteers, 2 community leaders, 21 local men, and 23 women not attending the women's groups, through semi-structured interviews, group interviews, focus group discussions and unstructured observation of groups. Participants took photographs of their locality for discussion in focus groups using photoelicitation methods. Framework analysis procedures were used, and data fed back to respondents. When group members were compared with 11 184 women who had recently delivered, we found that they were of similar socioeconomic status, despite the context of poverty, and caste inequalities. Four mechanisms explain the women's group impact on health outcomes: the groups learned about health, developed confidence, disseminated information in their communities, and built community capacity to take action. Women's groups enable the development of a broader understanding of health problems, and build community capacity to bring health and development benefit."

Research has shown that conventional rehabilitation programs do not meet the needs of women recovering from cardiac events. Women's primary rehabilitative need may be support, particularly from women with similar experiences. Furthermore, the need for support in living with heart disease may persist beyond the in-hospital phase of recovery. The purpose of this study was to develop and implement a community-based communication and psycho-educational support group for women with heart disease. Participatory action research was the methodology selected. Two groups of women (n = 16) met monthly for 5 months to develop the program. Sessions were facilitated jointly by a nurse clinician and a nurse-researcher. Between sessions, participants kept diaries of their experiences. Data consisted of videotapes and transcriptions of the sessions, field notes, and the women's diaries and final evaluation. Initial analysis revealed that the value of the group for the women was threefold: it helped them to cope with their emotional reactions, offered social support, and helped them to manage their health problem. Iterative analysis unveiled a meta-paradigm consistent with the concept of suffering. The apparent overall benefit of a community-based psycho-educational support group for women with heart disease is acknowledgement and sharing of suffering, something that cannot readily occur in women's other life arenas."

            "abstract": "Exploring fertility preferences in relation to contraceptive use can increase the understanding of future reproductive behaviour and unmet family planning needs. This knowledge can help assist women in meeting their reproductive goals. The influences on the desire for more children and current contraceptive use were examined among 1528 married women of reproductive age in an isolated community in Bali, Indonesia, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Women who were younger, had fewer living children, had given birth in the past year and had regular access to health services were more likely to desire children. Being older, having fewer living children, not having regular access to health services, having given birth in the past year and having the desire for more children were associated with a lower likelihood of using contraception. Women with regular access to health care are more likely to desire more children, probably because they are confident in their ability to have successful birth outcomes. However, specialized clinics or family planning outreach workers may be required to reduce barriers to service utilization among some groups. The findings of this study identify key target populations for family planning, including older women and postpartum women--groups that may not perceive themselves to be at risk for unintended pregnancy. Meeting unmet need for family planning among these groups could help women meet their fertility goals, as well as reduce maternal morbidity and mortality."

We focus on the specific challenge of recruiting and engaging low-income and underinsured Latina women in cancer prevention education research, and present community-based strategies used to recruit women into a recently completed study in Arizona, Juntos en la Salud (Together in Health). Community representatives and promotoras' (Latino community health educators) involvement in site identification, individual recruitment, and development of strategies and materials for the interventions built engagement and trust. These strategies resulted in enrollment of an especially low-income, underinsured population. To emphasize the degree to which a particularly underserved population was recruited, we present data comparing demographic and screening profiles of enrollees to the general population of Latinos in Arizona."

Morbidity and mortality are highest in rural areas and among the poorest wealth quintiles. Few interventions to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes with government-mandated community health workers have been rigorously evaluated at scale in this setting.The study aims to assess the impact of a community mobilisation intervention with women's groups facilitated by ASHAs to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes among rural tribal communities of Jharkhand and Orissa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial and will be implemented in five districts, three in Jharkhand and two in Orissa. The unit of randomisation is a rural cluster of approximately 5000 population. We identified villages within rural, tribal areas of five districts, approached them for participation in the study and enrolled them into 30 clusters, with approximately 10 ASHAs per cluster. Within each district, 6 clusters were randomly allocated to receive the community intervention or to the control group, resulting in 15 intervention and 15 control clusters. Randomisation was carried out in the presence of local stakeholders who selected the cluster numbers and allocated them to intervention or control using a pre-generated random number sequence. The intervention is a participatory learning and action cycle where ASHAs support community women's groups through a four-phase process in which they identify and prioritise local maternal and newborn health problems, implement strategies to address these and evaluate the result. The cycle is designed to fit with the ASHAs' mandate to mobilise communities for health and to complement their other tasks, including increasing institutional delivery rates and providing home visits to mothers and newborns. The trial's primary endpoint is neonatal mortality during 24 months of intervention. Additional endpoints include home care practices and health care-seeking in the antenatal, delivery and postnatal period. The impact of the intervention will be measured through a prospective surveillance system implemented by the project team, through which mothers will be interviewed around six weeks after delivery. Cost data and qualitative data are collected for cost-effectiveness and process evaluations.\n    \n\n\n          Study registration:\n        \n      \n      ISRCTN: ISRCTN31567106."

The method adopted by duty physicians at the prenatal outpatient clinic of a community hospital furnishes an example. The examination was subdivided into four phases: 1. documentation of the current state of communication between doctor and patient (tape recordings, participatory observation, interviewing the patients and the duty physicians); 2. analysis of the interviews and the participatory observation, linguistic analysis of the history discussions; 3. topic-centered communication training of the duty physicians involved, on the basis of their own tape recordings; 4. feedback, verification of efficiency, and transfer of results to routine practice in the prenatal clinic. As early as in the fourth session changes in behavior and an increased awareness of problem areas in the course of the discussion were noted among the duty physicians. The program has proved easy to implement in practice. It enhances communication and identification for the junior physicians, and has had a highly positive overall effect."

In Inquisivi, Bolivia, Save the Children/Bolivia, worked with 50 women's groups in remote rural villages in the Andean mountains. Through a participatory research process, the 'autodiagnosis', actions identified by women's groups included among others: provision of family planning through a local non-governmental organization (NGO), training of community birth attendants, income generating projects. In Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, access was improved through training of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in timely recognition and referral of pregnancy/delivery/neonatal complications, while quality of care in health facilities was improved through modifying health professionals' attitude towards TBAs and clients, and implementation of management protocols. In Indonesia, the University of Padjadjaran addressed issues of referral and emergency obstetric care in the West-Java subdistrict of Tanjunsari. Birthing homes with radios were established in ten of the 27 villages in the district, where trained nurse/midwives provided maternity care on a regular basis. In Nigeria professional midwives were trained in interpersonal communication and lifesaving obstetric skills, while referral hospitals were refurbished and equipped. While reduction in maternal mortality after such a short implementation period is difficult to demonstrate, all projects showed improvements in referral and in reduction in perinatal mortality."

            "abstract": "Peace accords and international interventions have contributed to the suspension of armed conflict and the censuring of repressive regimes in many parts of the world. Some governments and their opposition parties have agreed to the establishment of commissions or other bodies designed to create historical records of the violations of human rights and foster conditions that facilitate reparatory and reconciliatory processes. This paper explores selected roles that community psychologists have played in this process of remembering the past and constructing new identities towards creating a more just future. With reference to two community groups (in Guatemala and South Africa) we show how efforts to \"speak out\" about one's own experiences of political and military repression involve complex representational politics that go beyond the simple binary opposition of silencing versus giving voice. The Guatemalan group consisted of Mayan Ixil women who, together with the first author, used participatory action research and the PhotoVoice technique to produce a book about their past and present struggles. The South African group, working within the ambit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in collaboration with the third author and others, explored ways of speaking about their roles in apartheid and post-apartheid society. Although both these initiatives can be seen as moments in on-going struggles to overcome externally-imposed repressive practices that censor the voices of marginalized communities, they also serve to dispel overly romanticized notions of \"univocal\" communities now liberated to express themselves in an unmediated and unequivocal fashion. The paper discusses how each group of women instead entered into subtly nuanced relationships with community psychologists involving a continual interplay between the authenticity of their self-representational accounts and the requirements of the discursive technologies into which they were being inducted and the material conditions within their sites of struggle. In both cases the group's agenda also evolved over time, so that what emerged was not so much a particular account of themselves, or even the development of a particular \"voice\" for speaking about themselves, but an unfolding process--for the groups and for the community psychologists who accompanied them--of becoming active players in the postmodern, mediated world of self-representational politics and social struggle."

            "abstract": "The \"From Mother to Child Project\" is a molecular epidemiological study that employs a community- based participatory research (CBPR) approach and gene-environment interaction research to address environmental justice in migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSF) women and children of Mexican origin home-based in Baytown and La Joya, Texas. This paper presents the background and rationale for the study and describes the study design and methodology. Preliminary data showed that MSF women and children in Texas have measurable levels of pesticides in their blood and urine, some of which were banned in the United States decades ago and are possible human carcinogens. Polymorphisms in genes involved in chemical detoxification and DNA repair have been associated with susceptibility to genetic damage and cancer development in populations exposed to environmental toxins. The \"From Mother to Child Project\" is testing three hypotheses: (1) MSF women and children who are occupationally exposed to pesticides are at higher risk for DNA damage than are non-exposed women and children. (2) Both, the extent of pesticide exposure and type of polymorphisms in chemical detoxification and DNA repair genes contribute to the extent of DNA damage observed in study participants. (3) The mutagenic potency levels measured in the organic compounds extracted from the urine and serum of study participants will correlate with the total concentrations of pesticides and with the measured DNA damage in study participants. The study will enroll 800 participants: 200 MSF mother-child pairs; 200 children (one per family) whose parents have never worked in agriculture, matched with the MSF children by ethnicity, age ± 2 years, gender, and city of residence; and these children's mothers. Personal interviews with the mothers are used to gather data for both mothers and children on sociodemographic characteristics; pesticide exposure at work and home; medical and reproductive history; dietary assessment, and lifestyle factors. Blood and urine samples are collected from each participant and analyzed for (1) organochlorine and organophosphate pesticide levels, (2) genetic polymorphisms of chemical detoxification and DNA repair genes, (3) DNA damage (chromosomal aberrations), and (4) the mutagenic potential of pesticides in the serum and urine. Recruitment and data collection in Baytown is near completion, and over one third of the target population for the La Joya study site."

This paper describes how women in a peri-urban pueblo joven located in the coastal desert surrounding Lima, Peru conceptualize the links between RTIs, sexual behaviour, personal hygiene, and the adverse environment in which they live.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We combined qualitative interviews and a participatory voting exercise to examine social and physical environmental influences on RTIs and gynaecologic symptom interpretation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Knowledge of RTIs in general was limited, although knowledge of AIDS was higher. Perceived causes of RTIs fell into three categories: sexual contact with infected persons, personal hygiene and exposure to the contaminated physical environment, with AIDS clearly related to sexual contact. The adverse environment is thought to be a major contributor to vaginal discharge, \"inflamed ovaries\" and urinary tract infection. The more remote parts of this periurban squatter settlement, characterized by blowing sand and dust and limited access to clean water, are thought to exhibit higher rates of RTIs as a direct result of the adverse environment found there. Stigma associated with RTIs often keeps women from seeking care or obtaining information about gynaecologic symptoms, and favours explanations that avoid mention of sexual practices.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The discrepancy between demonstrated disease risk factors and personal explanations influenced by local environmental conditions and RTI-related stigma poses a challenge for prevention programs.

The primary goal is to increase knowledge of preconception health and its benefits among adolescent females and tribal communities. Preconception health is an area of considerable concern among American Indians (AIs) in the Northern Plains region, as there are high rates of birth, infant mortality, unintended pregnancy, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases in this area. We examined the effectiveness of implementing this intervention during a residential summer program for AI high school students.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The educational intervention consisted of 15 preconception health education sessions and was piloted during a summer high school residential academic program.

In terms of intra-group score analysis between Time 1 (T1; pre-intervention) and T2, there were significant changes within the intervention group in knowledge of obesity and diabetes. Knowledge changes in smoking were approaching significance. Within the non-intervention group, there was a significant change from T1 to T2 in scores for diabetes knowledge only.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The key finding was that the intervention group had higher overall preconception health knowledge at T2 compared to the non-intervention group. Intervention participants demonstrated an understanding of how preconception behaviors may affect birth outcomes and maternal health. Another key finding was that, among participants in the intervention group, the change in knowledge regarding smoking beliefs between T1 and T2 were approaching significance. Because smoking during pregnancy is a risk factor for poor birth outcomes, this finding emphasizes that future curriculum modification should address the effects of smoking, and the benefits of smoking cessation, prior to or during pregnancy. Study limitations such as small sample size, high baseline health knowledge, the need to add traditional knowledge variables, and shortened implementation timeframe reveal key areas for improvement. Possible future intervention modifications include expanding on areas that reached or approached significance, implementing the intervention over a longer period of time, identifying ways to translate traditional knowledge into quantifiable survey measures, and implementing the intervention with high-risk, reservation-based populations of AI youth."

We describe a study which aims to evaluate a community-level participatory intervention in rural Nepal. The effectiveness of community-based action research interventions with mothers and other key members of the community in improving perinatal health outcomes is being examined using a cluster randomized, controlled trial covering a population of 28,000 married women of reproductive age. The unit of randomization was the village development committee (VDC): 12 VDCs receive the intervention while 12 serve as controls. The key elements of the intervention are the activities of female facilitators, each of whom works in one VDC facilitating the activities of women's groups in addressing problems in pregnancy, childbirth and the newborn period. Each group moves through a participatory planning cycle of assessment, sharing experiences, planning, action and reassessment, with the aim of improving essential maternal and newborn care. Outcomes assessed are neonatal and perinatal mortality rates, changes in patterns of home care, health care seeking and referral. The study also aims to generate programmatic information on the process of implementation in communities."

Focus groups were first organized to explore sources of stress for daughter and spousal caregivers. Workshops in which caregivers developed the content of a group program were then organized. The aims of the program were to increase empowerment and self-efficacy and to decrease stress and psychological distress of caregivers. Experimentation and qualitative evaluation of the program led to 10 weekly meetings covering the following topics: how to feel good with my relative, how to discuss with staff, how to appraise my experience differently, coping with my relative's losses, how to reorganize my life, and how to identify and ask for social support.

            "abstract": "Intimate partner violence is one health-related outcome that has received growing attention from those interested in the role of neighborhood context. A limitation of existing contextual health research is its' failure to look beyond urban settings. Because suburban and rural areas have received so little attention, it is not clear whether data generated from urban samples can be generalized to non-urban geographic settings. We began to explore this issue using concept mapping, a participatory, mixed method approach. Data from 37 urban and 24 suburban women are used to explore and compare perceptions of neighborhood characteristics related to intimate partner violence. While several similarities exist between the perceptions of participants residing in urban and suburban areas, some differences were uncovered. These results provide valuable information regarding the perceived relationship between neighborhood context and intimate partner violence and suggest future avenues for research interested in examining the role of geographic setting."

As an example of advancing a statewide research agenda in cancer disparities, we present descriptive statistics from major public health surveillance data systems in Massachusetts. Disparities highlighted include higher breast cancer mortality rates among African-American women than women of other racial groups, lower rates of colorectal and cervical cancer screening among Asian-American residents, and striking gradients in cancer risk factor prevalence and screening by income and education. Challenges in utilizing public health surveillance data include lack of information in many domains of social inequity beyond race/ethnicity, uneven quality, and lack of stable, reportable data for smaller populations. Opportunities to maximize the usefulness of cancer registry data include application of geographic information systems and linkage with other data systems tracking information on health services outcomes and clinical trial participation. Analyses of surveillance data can spark advances not only in community-based participatory research but also in programs and policies that may ultimately eliminate disparities along the cancer continuum."

Using marketing concepts such as the \"four Ps\" (product, price, place, and promotion), social marketing borrows from the principles of commercial marketing but promotes beneficial health behaviors. Consumer research is used to segment the population and develop a strategy based on those marketing concepts. In a community-based participatory research study, 17 focus groups were used in consumer research to develop a social marketing program to promote walking and other moderate-intensity physical activities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two phases of focus groups were conducted. Phase 1 groups, which included both men and women, were asked to respond to questions that would guide the development of a social marketing program based on social marketing concepts.

The qualitative study, set in Ontario, Canada, employed a participatory action research model. Twenty-six lesbians were interviewed about their experiences of cancer and cancer care. This article reports research participants' narratives about lesbian community. Findings reveal the complex and sometimes contradictory ways that lesbian community unfolds in the lives of lesbians with cancer. While most participants experienced robust and competent community support, participants also reported instances of isolation and disconnection linked to fear of cancer, homophobia in the broader community, and patterns of exclusion within lesbian communities. As well, while lesbian community norms and values appeared to buffer the negative effects of treatment-related physical changes, such norms also manifested as prescriptions for lesbians with cancer. Findings affirmed the value of creating networks among lesbians with cancer within a context of increased accessibility to mainstream cancer services."

Recent health reforms have abolished the federal Ministry of Health and devolved administrative and financial powers to the provinces. Ideally, devolution tends to simplify a healthcare system's management structure and ensure more efficient delivery of health services to underserved populations, in this case women and children. In this time of transition, it is appropriate to outline prerequisites for the efficient management of maternal and child health (MCH) services. This paper examines the six building blocks of health systems in order to improve the utilization of MCH services in rural Pakistan. The targeted outcomes of recent reforms are devolved participatory decision-making regarding distribution of MCH-related services, improved deployment of the healthcare workforce, prioritization of pro-poor strategies for health financing and integration of various health information systems. Given this window of opportunity, the provinces need to guarantee fairness and equity through their stewardship of the healthcare system so as to protect vulnerable mothers and their children, especially in rural, remote and disadvantaged areas of Pakistan."

According-to-protocol (ATP) cohorts included compliant HPV-negative women; intention-to-treat (ITT) included all randomized women. ATP VE was 90.9% (95% CI, 82.0-95.9) against HPV16/18 infections, 44.5% against HPV31/33/45 (95% CI, 17.5-63.1), and 12.4% (95% CI, -3.2 to 25.6) against any oncogenic infection. Overall ITT VE against HPV16/18 infections was 49.0%, but ATP and ITT VE almost reached 100% in year 4 of follow-up. ATP efficacy against HPV16/18 was similar by age, but ITT VE was greatest among youngest women (68.9% among those 18-19 years of age; 21.8% among those 24-25 years of age) and 79.8% among virgins.

There was no evidence of cervical dysplasia or cancer cervix among the screened population. Despite the presence of risk factors of high parity, early age of marriage and early childbirth after marriage, absence of cervical dysplasia and malignancy emphasizes the fact that socio-cultural factors, like absence of promiscuity and male circumcision, play an important role in the low prevalence of cancer cervix."

A number of these obstacles relate to immigration laws, policies and legal processes they encounter due to their immigration status and sponsorship relationship. The present study was conducted in Canada, in an urban centre that boasts one of the largest immigrant populations in the world. Using a focus group methodology within a participatory action research framework, this investigation sought to identify factors that facilitate or impede women from coming forward and disclosing IPV, and traced their help-seeking actions. Qualitative data from helping professionals and women reveal that in cases of sponsorship breakdown due to IPV, the criteria required for a viable immigration application are unrealistic, and in many cases impossible to meet in situations of domestic abuse. These data indicate that despite claims to the contrary, laws and policies related to immigration have remained stable for over a decade. Systemic and structural barriers that these create for abused women are still clearly present in immigration laws and policies. The result is that many women stay in abusive relationships, often with their children, for prolonged periods of time accruing serious negative mental health effects. Implications are discussed to help inform policy and practice."

They used the framework to develop a survey, which they administered to fourth-year medical students at 20 U.S. medical schools in 2007-2008.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 80 focus-group participants suggested that the key influences on students' development of humanism were their authentic, unique, and participatory experiences before and during medical school, and the opportunity to process these experiences. Students who completed the survey (N = 1,170) reported that experiences of greatest intensity (e.g., being involved in a case where the patient dies), participatory learning experiences (e.g., volunteer work, international clinical rotations), and positive role models had the greatest effect on their development of humanism, whereas stressful conditions, such as a busy workload or being tired or postcall, inhibited their humanism. Women and students going into primary care placed significantly greater importance on experiences promoting humanism than did men and those not going into primary care. In addition, students with lower debt burdens viewed such experiences as more important than did those with higher debt burdens.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Students viewed a variety of factors as influencing their development of humanism.

            "abstract": "A program of clinical perinatal research was established in a community-based hospital in collaboration with private-practice obstetricians and their patients. This longitudinal study, undertaken to investigate the value of a circulating placental protein as an indicator of fetal compromise, enrolled 200 unselected pregnant patients. The project required collection of five blood samples at 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 weeks' gestation in addition to a level II ultrasound examination at 32 weeks. Baseline and interim prenatal visit data were collected, as were maternal and neonatal data upon delivery. Patients who participated were invariably enthusiastic about their involvement. The physicians and their staff were also generally pleased. We infer from these and other studies a need to provide enhanced educational, participatory opportunities to all pregnant women. We conclude that properly conducted, reasonably funded projects that offer no direct benefit to the patient or physician can be successfully carried out with physicians and their private patients in community hospitals. The potential benefits of developing such extended resources can only enhance medical care and foster satisfaction and cooperation among physicians and patients."

Only few data was published on prevalence, awareness and management of AH in Lithuania. Development of objective approaches to the treatment and control of AH reduces the risk of mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate time trends, the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of AH and risk of mortality among Lithuanian urban population aged 45-64 years during the period of 1983-2009.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Time trends of AH and risk of mortality were examined in three MONICA health surveys in 1983, 1986, 1992, and in one health survey according to MONICA protocol in 2002 included randomly recruited of 2,218 men and 2,491 women. AH was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP of ≥90 mmHg or current use of antihypertensive medication. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, mortality from CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The mean duration of follow-up was 11.8 ± 9.2 years. All survey periods were age standardized to the year 2006 of Kaunas population.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nWomen's groups and health education by peer counsellors can improve the health of mothers and children. We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates in rural Malawi.\n## METHODS\nWe did a 2×2 factorial, cluster-randomised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district. 48 equal-sized clusters were randomly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence. 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems. 72 trained volunteer peer counsellors made home visits at five timepoints during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding and infant care. Primary outcomes for the women's group intervention were maternal, perinatal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates (MMR, PMR, NMR, and IMR, respectively); and for the peer counselling were IMR and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN06477126.\n## FINDINGS\nWe monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009. In a factorial model adjusted only for clustering and the volunteer peer counselling intervention, in women's group areas, for years 2 and 3, we noted non-significant decreases in NMR (odds ratio 0.93, 0.64-1.35) and MMR (0.54, 0.28-1.04). After adjustment for parity, socioeconomic quintile, and baseline measures, effects were larger for NMR (0.85, 0.59-1.22) and MMR (0.48, 0.26-0.91). Because of the interaction between the two interventions, a stratified analysis was done. For women's groups, in adjusted analyses, MMR fell by 74% (0.26, 0.10-0.70), and NMR by 41% (0.59, 0.40-0.86) in areas with no peer counsellors, but there was no effect in areas with counsellors (1.09, 0.40-2.98, and 1.38, 0.75-2.54). Factorial analysis for the peer counselling intervention for years 1-3 showed a fall in IMR of 18% (0.82, 0.67-1.00) and an improvement in EBF rates (2.42, 1.48-3.96). The results of the stratified, adjusted analysis showed a 36% reduction in IMR (0.64, 0.48-0.85) but no effect on EBF (1.18, 0.63-2.25) in areas without women's groups, and in areas with women's groups there was no effect on IMR (1.05, 0.82-1.36) and an increase in EBF (5.02, 2.67-9.44). The cost of women's groups was US$114 per year of life lost (YLL) averted and that of peer counsellors was $33 per YLL averted, using stratified data from single intervention comparisons.\n## INTERPRETATION\nCommunity mobilisation through women's groups and volunteer peer counsellor health education are methods to improve maternal and child health outcomes in poor rural populations in Africa.\n## FUNDING\nSaving Newborn Lives, UK Department for International Development, and Wellcome Trust.\n"

Key amongst these is the question of what constitutes an appropriate standard of health care (SoC) for participants in HIV prevention trials. This paper describes a community-focused approach to develop a locally-appropriate SoC in the context of a phase III vaginal microbicide trial in Mwanza City, northwest Tanzania.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A mobile community-based sexual and reproductive health service for women working as informal food vendors or in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels and guesthouses has been established in 10 city wards.

A city-level Community Advisory Committee (CAC) with representatives from each ward has been established. Workshops and community meetings at ward and city-level have explored project-related concerns using tools adapted from participatory learning and action techniques e.g. chapati diagrams, pair-wise ranking. Secondary stakeholders representing local public-sector and non-governmental health and social care providers have formed a trial Stakeholders' Advisory Group (SAG), which includes two CAC representatives.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Key recommendations from participatory community workshops, CAC and SAG meetings conducted in the first year of the trial relate to the quality and range of clinic services provided at study clinics as well as broader standard of care issues. Recommendations have included streamlining clinic services to reduce waiting times, expanding services to include the children and spouses of participants and providing care for common local conditions such as malaria.

To achieve elimination of paediatric HIV, therefore, interventions must also work within communities to address these barriers and increase service use and need to be informed by evidence. This paper reviews community-based approaches that have been used in resource-limited settings to increase rates of PMTCT enrolment, retention in care and successful treatment outcomes. It aims to identify which interventions work, why they may do so and what knowledge gaps remain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      First, we identified barriers to PMTCT that originate outside the health system. These were used to construct a social ecological framework categorizing barriers to PMTCT into the following levels of influence: individual, peer and family, community and sociocultural. We then used this conceptual framework to guide a review of the literature on community-based approaches, defined as interventions delivered outside of formal health settings, with the goal of increasing uptake, retention, adherence and positive psychosocial outcomes in PMTCT programmes in resource-poor countries.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our review found evidence of effectiveness of strategies targeting individuals and peer/family levels (e.g., providing household HIV testing and training peer counsellors to support exclusive breastfeeding) and at community level (e.g., participatory women's groups and home-based care to support adherence and retention). Evidence is more limited for complex interventions combining multiple strategies across different ecological levels. There is often little information describing implementation; and approaches such as \"community mobilization\" remain poorly defined.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence from existing community approaches can be adapted for use in planning PMTCT. However, for successful replication of evidence-based interventions to occur, comprehensive process evaluations are needed to elucidate the pathways through which specific interventions achieve desired PMTCT outcomes. A social ecological framework can help analyze the complex interplay of facilitators and barriers to PMTCT service uptake in each context, thus helping to inform selection of locally relevant community-based interventions."

This paper deals with ergonomics intervention through sustainable work tool design development process. Workers who frequently shift to different activities quite often in unorganised small-scale fruit processing units where productivity is directly related to the harvesting season require different work tools relevant to specific tasks and mostly workers themselves manage work tools of their own with available local resources. Whereas in contrast the tea-leaf pluckers are engaged in a single task throughout the year, and the work schedule and work equipment is decided and supplied to them based on the corporate decision where the workers do not have any individual control. Observations confirm the need for organising participatory workshops specific to trade based occupational well-being and different work tools for different tasks in mostly private owned unorganised sector. Implementation of single variety work tool development that supports a crucial component in tea-leaf plucking for which they are engaged in full time employment; and through a corporate decision a single design with its number of users makes a good effect."

A cultural model approach drawn from cognitive anthropology is taken to focus on how Chinese caregiving daughters develop a sense of what is right and emotionally fulfilling and acquire the motivation to care for their parents. An ethnographic approach was used in the study and techniques included guided and open-ended interviews and non-participatory observations. A total of 20 co-residential caregiving daughters were interviewed in their homes on average twice over the course of one year. All interviews were conducted in Cantonese. Although the sample was small, daughters' accounts are structured by reference to cultural models and this structure provides the common basis for generalisability of results. Concepts of Confucian antecedents, reciprocity and personhood and other modern ideas of filial duty are explored. Conclusions are drawn about the shifting rights and obligations of Chinese caregiving daughters within the contemporary urban realities of Hong Kong. The findings of this study have relevance for the development of welfare policy for older Chinese persons and the chronically ill, and to all services involving women. The findings will also serve to inform family caregiver education programs."

            "abstract": "Because of a growing cultural and religious sensitivity and controversy over reproductive health issues, particularly abortion, this area remains relatively unexplored in Egypt. This study was conducted using a participatory approach to determine the morbidity and determinants of abortion in rural Upper Egypt. In all, 1025 women from six villages in Upper Egypt were included in the study. Information regarding the incidence of abortion, patterns of health care utilization and risk factors was obtained using a structured interview format. The local dialect was used in formulating questions and they were revised and amended by a panel of local leaders, interviewers and representatives of the study population. Interviewers were local educated (secondary or university level) female volunteers. Information about exposure to 17 risk factors was also collected and statistical analysis was done by estimating the odds ratio and applying a test of statistical significance. Then, a multivariate logistic regression model was applied to control for possible interactions and confounding effects. The results were that 40.6% (n=416) had aborted at least once; of them 24.6% (n=252) had aborted more than once and were designated as recurrent aborters. The lifetime prevalence of recurrent abortion was estimated to be 25% and nearly 21% of pregnancies were aborted. The incidence of abortion was estimated to be 265 per 1000 live birth. Only 21.9% (n=91) of women received medical care for the last abortion. The vast majority of women (92%, n=299) who did not seek medical help received help from traditional and domestic sources. These sources are midwife (59.9%, n=179), relative or neighbour (29.8%, n=89), and traditional practitioner (10.4%, n=31). The multivariate analysis revealed that the incidence of abortion is significantly associated with gravidity, consanguinity, and mother occupation, while recurrent abortion is associated with gravidity, consanguinity and woman's age at marriage. In conclusion, the morbidity of abortion is a serious public health problem in Egypt. Because the incidence rate is very high and because safe abortion is limited in Egypt, maternal mortality due to abortion is expected to be underestimated. Promotion of family planning is expected to have a significant impact on the incidence of abortion in Upper Egypt."

Comparing the study and the control groups, those who were dewormed and also had participatory hygiene education lectures (study group) had a significantly higher reduction in the level of children who had ova of intestinal helminthes present in their stool than those in the control group (Χ 2 = 31.61; df = 1, P = 0.00).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study therefore concludes that including participatory hygiene education to deworming programmes will greatly improve the hemoglobin level of children in areas where there is a high prevalence of hookworm infections, especially as a short-term preventive measure for anemia in children."

Actual involvement of the public in priority setting and poor communication between the different levels of the decentralization system, despite the existing structures, were additional concerns. Public participation is mainly through representatives. Majority participation is mainly at health benefits and programme activity levels. Decision-making, monitoring and evaluation, and implementation are still dominated by the locally elected leaders due to reported economic, social and cultural barriers that hinder the participation of the rest of the public."

While there has been increasing recognition of access and equity issues in Australia's current neo-colonial period, actual improvements have been very slow to emerge. Meanwhile many Aboriginal people continue to experience poor levels of health. My hope is that this article can contribute to the growing body of knowledge that recognises the impact of past and present colonisation practices and shifts health care towards collaborative healing and well being models that are more supportive of Aboriginal people and their needs. The emphasis on Aboriginal women's health rather than mixed gender health care comes from my experiences in sexual health, where many Australian Aboriginal women prefer to access 'women only' services."

Qualitative interviews conducted with community partners participating across 10 coalitions were analyzed to compare responses of those individuals working on HIV prevention coalitions targeting adolescent and young adult gay and bisexual men versus those targeting adolescent and young adult heterosexual women. Community partner responses revealed differences across several key areas including: (a) acceptability and goals in discussing sexual issues with adolescents, (b) goals of sexual health promotion activities, and (c) competition among collaborating agencies. Themes highlighted in this study can complement existing community intervention literature by helping community mobilizers, interventionists, and researchers understand how cultural norms affect youth-specific coalition work."

Research has focused on technical questions, such as how small farmers and livestock keepers understand seasonal forecasts, veterinary problems or market conditions. However, there is a more holistic way of engaging local knowledge. Rural people utilise external technical ideas and tools, even complex ones, that complement their own concepts and experience of change. However, there are obstacles to overcome in generating such hybrid local knowledge. Firstly, there is a long history of domination of rural people by urban elites, including the assumed superiority of urban or high culture versus rural, vernacular or low culture. A second obstacle comes from the frequent use of science as justification to force rural people to do what governments want. Experience of exclusion and displacement has left a residue of bitterness and suspicion among many rural people. A third obstacle involves misuse of one-size-fits-all methods. No single, homogeneous knowledge exists in a locality. Rather there are women's forms of knowledge and the knowledge of men and elders and the knowledge of young people and children, which are differentiated also by occupation and by ethnicity. In the face of such cultural diversity an incompetent use of standardised participatory methods yields poor results and may alienate residents."

Four participants reported having sex with men and women during the past three months; two participants self-identified as male-to-female transgender. Qualitative themes that emerged included a lack of accurate information about HIV and prevention; the influence of social-political contexts to sexual risk; and barriers to healthcare services.

This article examines the experiences of a community-academic partnership in designing, developing, and implementing an evidence-based, LHA-driven perinatal tobacco cessation program for low-income, predominately African American and Hispanic women. A multimethod process evaluation was conducted to analyze three essential domains of program implementation: (1) fit of the tobacco cessation program into the broader project context, (2) feasibility of program implementation, and (3) fidelity to program implementation protocols. Findings indicate that project partners have largely succeeded in integrating an evidence-based tobacco cessation program into a community-based maternal and infant health project. The successful implementation of this intervention appears to be attributable to the following two predominant factors: (1) the utilization of a scientifically validated tobacco cessation intervention model and (2) the emphasis on continuous LHA training and capacity development."

            "abstract": "Most malaria risk reduction strategies are firmly embedded in biomedical practices and public health perspectives. National and international programmes to 'control' malaria are particularly characterised by the promotion of public health interventions which converge on the disease vector, the malaria mosquito, notably through the use of indoor household spraying with insecticides, and the deployment of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). With convincing evidence for the effectiveness of ITNs in reducing the incidence of malaria, control programmes have emphasised the notion of 'scaling-up' bednet coverage. Much previous research on people's 'compliance' with bednet programmes has tended to focus on the quantification of bednet usage and on deriving explanations for 'non-compliance' based on household or individual indicators such as wealth, age, gender or educational level, or on climatic factors such as season and temperature. However, malaria risk behaviours are also rooted in wider aspects of local livelihoods, and socio-cultural beliefs and practices which interplay with the use and, crucially, non-use, of bednets. This paper draws on empirical data derived from in-depth, one-to-one semi-structured interviews, focus groups and participatory methods (mapping and diagramming) with participants in two villages in rural Tanzania to explore the nature of these practices and vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on malaria exposure risk. Participants included farmers and pastoralists, both men and women, as well as village 'officials'. By eliciting local understandings of malaria-related behaviours we explore how malaria risks are played out in people's everyday lives, and the circumstances and decision-making which underpin non-usage of bednets. Our findings reveal the importance of shifting sleeping patterns in response to livelihood needs and socio-cultural practices and events. These arrangements militate against the consistent and sustained use of the bednet which are called for by public health policies. In particular we demonstrate the importance of the spatial and temporal dimensions of farming practices and the role of conflict over access to shared land; the impact of livelihood activities on malaria risks for school-aged children; risk behaviours during 'special' socio-cultural events such as funeral ceremonies; and routine, outdoor activities around dawn and dusk and the gendered nature of these practices."

The widespread Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination holds promise for helping to attenuate this disparity. However, previous research has not fully examined Haitian women's perceptions of, and barriers to, HPV vaccination, which is essential for informing future intervention. The current paper aims to fill this gap.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      As part of ongoing Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) efforts, we conducted a series of focus groups with Haitian immigrant women in Little Haiti, the predominantly Haitian neighborhood in Miami, Florida, U.S. Focus group questions assessed women's knowledge and beliefs about cervical cancer and HPV, their opinions of vaccines in general, their knowledge and perceptions of the HPV vaccine specifically and health communications preferences for cervical cancer prevention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the participants who had heard of HPV, many held misconceptions about virus transmission and did not understand the role of HPV in the development of cervical cancer. Virtually all participants expressed support for vaccines in general as beneficial for health. Some women had heard of the HPV vaccine, primarily as the result of a contemporary popular media campaign promoting the Gardasil® vaccine. Physician recommendation was commonly mentioned as a reason for vaccination, in addition to having more than one sex partner. Women felt the HPV vaccine was less appropriate for adolescent girls who are presumed as not sexually active. Women indicated a strong preference to obtain health information through trusted sources, such as Haitian physicians, Haitian Community Health Workers, and especially Kreyol-language audiovisual media.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Study findings indicate a need for culturally and linguistically appropriate educational initiatives to promote awareness of HPV and its role in cervical cancer, the importance of vaccination against the virus, explicitly differentiating HPV from HIV and providing specific information about vaccine safety.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In the U.S., there is a substantial lack of educational information available in Haitian about HPV and cervical cancer.

The slow uptake of malaria prevention products appears to reflect lack of knowledge and resistance to behavioural change, as well as poor access to resources, and limited support of programmes by local communities and authorities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A recent community-based programme in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, is analysed to determine the degree to which community-directed interventions can improve access to malaria prevention in pregnancy. Six local government areas in Southern Nigeria were selected for a malaria in pregnancy prevention intervention. Three of these local government areas were selected for a complementary community-directed intervention (CDI) programme. Under the CDI programme, volunteer community-directed distributors (CDDs) were appointed by each village and kindred in the treatment areas and trained to deliver ITNs and IPTp drugs as well as basic counseling services to pregnant women.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Relative to women in the control area, an additional 7.4 percent of women slept under a net during pregnancy in the treatment areas (95% CI [0.035, 0.115], p-value < 0.01), and an additional 8.5 percent of women slept under an ITN after delivery and prior to the interview (95% CI [0.045, 0.122], p-value < 0.001). The effects of the CDI programme were largest for IPTp adherence, increasing the fraction of pregnant women taking at least two SP doses during pregnancy by 35.3 percentage points [95% CI: 0.280, 0.425], p-value < 0.001) relative to the control group.

Using a participatory action research approach, data were collected in two phases of focus group discussions in five African Nova Scotian communities from a total of 57 people, including those with breast or prostate cancer and their families and associates. Findings provide insight into how gender and meanings of masculinity and femininity in the African Nova Scotian community unavoidably interact with other social structures such as race and class to affect women and men's perceptions and experiences of these two cancers. These insights point to the need for culturally appropriate and meaningful health interventions. As a prerequisite, health care professionals need to have an understanding of the overlapping and contextualized nature of gender, class, and race and be willing and able to work in partnership with African Nova Scotian communities to identify and develop strategies that reflect the realities of peoples' lives."

Between 1993 and 1994, the services provided by TASO were evaluated through a participatory approach between staff and clients. TASO counselling services helped clients and their families to cope with HIV and AIDS, with 90.4% of clients revealing their serostatus, and 57.2% reporting consistent use of condoms in the past 3 months. TASO was also the main source of medical care for clients with opportunistic infections in the last 6 months (63.8%). As a result of counselling, over half of the clients (56.9%) made plans for the future and 51.3% wished to make wills. There was a high level of acceptance of people living with HIV/AIDS (PWAs) by families (79%) and the community (76%). Care was provided to PWAs at home mainly by women (86.2%). TASO has demonstrated that individuals and their families are able to live positively with HIV/AIDS. Through counselling, medical care and material support to clients and their families, TASO has effected change in people's attitudes, knowledge and lifestyles. In particular, TASO has demonstrated a strong capacity to overcome four problems that haunt AIDS care in most places: (1) revealing one's HIV-serostatus to relevant others; (2) accepting PWAs in family and community; (3) seeking early treatment; and (4) combining prevention and care. In general, TASO has shown that specialized services to meet AIDS care needs can be added to existing health services at district levels.

This paper reports findings from a community-based participatory research study that described diabetes risk and awareness, assessed the association between perceived and actual risk (high, two or more diabetes risk factors; low, fewer than two risk factors) and identified factors associated with disease risk among Chinese and Hispanic/Latino immigrant populations in Portland, OR, USA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional, self-reported data were collected from a purposive sample of 324 Chinese (n=159) and Hispanic/Latino (n=165) adults, aged 18-86 years [mean (SD) age, 45.2(17.9) years; 50.7% women). Analyses described differences in variable distributions. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in pooled and ethnic group-specific samples.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n       Approximately 43% of participants were at high risk for diabetes, regardless of ethnicity or age. Of those unaware of their risk, or who perceived themselves not to be at risk, 25-53% had two or more risk factors (high risk); these patterns varied by ethnicity. The proportion of participants who reported two or more risk factors and were unaware of their risk status (31.8% Hispanic/Latino; 17% Chinese) or self-identified as not at risk (12.5% Hispanic/Latino; 13.0% Chinese) was substantial. Factors associated with diabetes risk also varied by ethnicity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study assessed the degree and determinants of diabetes risk and awareness among local Hispanic/Latino and Chinese communities and identified significant variation between groups. The results are important because they highlight substantial diabetes risk among persons who misestimate or are unaware of their risk status, regardless of ethnicity, and, in the USA, the Chinese immigrant population commonly is not considered a high-risk group for Type 2 diabetes."

Of these, every second child under 3 years of age is underweight, more than four out of ten are stunted, and one out of eight are wasted. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme in West Bengal has 355 operational projects covering 53,064 operational anganwadi centers reaching out to more than four million beneficiaries--approximately half of whom are children in the age group 0-3 years. The Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) is trying to identify and replicate innovative, community-based, sustainable approaches. One such innovative initiative has been the \"Keno Parbo Na\" project based on the Positive Deviance (PD) approach which aims to reduce and prevent malnutrition among children under 3 years of age by focusing on local solutions and resources, local behaviors and practices. Behavior change is emphasized through participatory learning and community mobilization. The pilot phase of the project has been completed in two districts [Four blocks (2 in each District) and 32 villages/AWCs (8 in each block)] of West Bengal (Murshidabad and South 24 Parganas). The analysis of the project activities so far reveals that the issue of malnutrition and its prevention is now visible in the villages covered. Acceptance of desirable behavioral practices is observed within the community. A steady reduction in the moderate and severe level of malnutrition was noted across four districts. A general preponderance of girl children was noted at the entry stage indicating higher levels of severe and moderate malnutrition among girl children to begin with but also suggesting PD as an important strategy in reducing the gender gap in malnutrition. The boys gain in terms of nutritional status faster than the girls so in the intermediate phase malnourished girls are more in number. However, by the sixth / ninth round, as the malnutrition levels decline substantially, the gender gap tends to close."

Food proscriptions do not appear to significantly limit food consumption in the areas where this question has been examined, with the possible exception of adult women in some settings. Preferential food allocation patterns, based on economic contribution, social valuation and other factors do play a role in limiting the intake of animal source foods for children and women in some settings. Economic factors limit access to ASF at the household level. Child care patterns in different cultural settings can also serve to enhance or limit the consumption of ASF. Social marketing and positive deviance approaches have had some success in increasing the intake of ASF by using formative research and participatory approaches.

Several challenges regarding the delivery of services were revealed, including implementing screening programs in busy acute-care environments, access to mammography, providing culturally sensitive care, and providing diagnostic/treatment services in rural and remote locations. Strategies perceived as successful in meeting program challenges included identifying a \"champion\" or main supporter of the program in each clinical setting, using mobile mammography, using female providers, and increasing the capacity to provide diagnostic services at screening sites.

Though women were the victims of violence, they were surprisingly also the perpetrators and astute enforcers of the practice, as well as those who vehemently opposed any form of change. Superstitious beliefs and associated fears were major reasons for opposition to change. Women can play key and effective roles in eliminating gender-based violence and in initiating and implementing programmes that guarantee their reproductive and human rights.

Interventions engaging women's groups in participatory learning and action meetings and other group activities, for example, have led to substantial increases in neonatal survival in high-mortality settings. Participatory interventions with women's groups work by providing a forum for communities to develop a common understanding of maternal and neonatal problems, as well as locally acceptable and sustainable strategies to address these. Potential partners for scaling up interventions with women's groups include government community health workers and volunteers, as well as organizations working with self-help groups. It is important to tailor scale-up efforts to local contexts, while retaining fidelity to the intervention, by ensuring that the mobilization of women's groups complements other local programs (e.g. home visits), and by providing capacity building for participatory learning and action methods across a range of nongovernmental organizations and government stakeholders. Research into scale-up mechanisms and effectiveness is needed to inform further implementation, and prospective surveillance of maternal and neonatal mortality in key scale-up sites can provide valuable data for measuring impact and for advocacy. There is a need for further research into the role of participatory interventions with women's groups to improve the quality of health services, health, and nutrition beyond the perinatal period, as well as the role of groups in influencing non-health issues, such as women's decision-making power."

Training on participatory approaches was given to Women Health Volunteers (WHV) in a pilot area. The results gave evidence that local people could identify and act upon their own health needs and request more information from professionals to improve their own health. Further research is needed however to assess how the pilot can be scaled up and how initial enthusiasm can be sustained."

Results suggested that middle-aged respondents viewed psychological behaviors more harshly than did younger respondents and that both middle-aged women and young men were less tolerant of middle-aged perpetrators. Although history of participatory violence toward older persons was predictive of perceptions of elder abuse as it interacted with respondent age, history of experienced abuse was not predictive. These data support a view of elder abuse that emphasizes its relativistic nature, wherein perceptions of elder abuse depend on both the characteristics of the perceiver and the victim and perpetrator variables."

For each district, cluster names were written on pieces of paper, which were folded and placed in a bottle. The first three cluster names drawn from the bottle were allocated to the intervention group and the remaining three to control. All clusters received health services strengthening and basic training of traditional birth attendants. In intervention clusters, a facilitator convened 18 groups every month to support participatory action and learning for women, and to develop and implement strategies to address maternal and neonatal health problems. Women were eligible to participate if they were aged 15-49 years, residing in the project area, and had given birth during the study period (Feb 1, 2005, to Dec 31, 2007).

The results of our pilot study based on a participatory approach show, among other things, that family caregivers, women for the most part, have little input in the decisions regarding their relative's care and are uneasy to express their opinions to health care staff. As part of the pilot study, caregivers developed a group intervention program entitled \"Taking Care of Myself\" geared, among other things, towards increasing their competence in expressing their viewpoint to health care staff and in taking part in care-related decisions. According to an efficacy study conducted after the pilot study, the program produced successful outcomes in terms of caregiver competence in dealing with the health care staff and of perceived challenge of the caregiver situation. Recommendations are made aimed at giving caregivers recognition, that is their due."

            "abstract": "Inability to reduce neonatal and maternal mortality in poor countries is sometimes blamed on a lack of contextual knowledge about care practices and care-seeking behavior. There is a lack of knowledge about how to translate formative research into effective interventions to improve maternal and newborn health. We describe the findings of formative research and how they were used to inform the development of such an intervention in rural Nepal. Formative research was carried out in four parts. Part 1 involved familiarization with the study area and literature review, and parts 2, 3 and 4 involved community mapping, audit of health services, and qualitative and quantitative studies of perinatal care behaviors. Participatory approaches have been successful at reducing neonatal mortality and may be suitable in our context. Community mapping and profiling helped to describe the community context, and we found that community-based organizations often sought to involve the Female Community Health Volunteer in community mobilization. She was not routinely conducting monthly meetings and found them difficult to sustain without support and supervision. In health facilities, most primary care staff were in post, but doctors and staff nurses were absent from referral centers. Mortality estimates reflected under-reporting of deaths and hygiene and infection control strategies had low coverage. The majority of women give birth at home with their mother-in-law, friends and neighbors. Care during perinatal illness was usually sought from traditional healers. Cultural issues of shyness, fear and normalcy restricted women's behavior during pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period, and decisions about her health were usually made after communications with the family and community. The formative research indicated the type of intervention that could be successful. It should be community-based and should not be exclusively for pregnant women. It should address negotiations within families, and should tailor information to the needs of local groups and particular stakeholders such as mothers-in-law and traditional healers. The intervention should not only accept cultural constructs but also be a forum in which to discuss ideas of pollution, shame and seclusion. We used these guidelines to develop a participatory, community-based women's group intervention, facilitated through a community action cycle. The success of our intervention may be because of its acceptability at the community level and its sensitivity to the needs and beliefs of families and communities."

Photo novella is an innovative methodology that puts cameras in the hands of rural women and other constituents who seldom have access to those who make decisions over their lives. As an educational tool, the practice of photo novella has three main goals: (1) to empower rural women to record and reflect their lives, especially health needs, from their own point of view; (2) to increase their collective knowledge about women's health status; and (3) to inform policymakers and the broader society about health and community issues that are of greatest concern to rural women. In this paper we analyze the third goal: the contributions and limitations of photo novella as a tool for informing policymakers. We conceptualize first the theoretical and practical underpinnings of photo novella. After tracing the relationships among empowerment education, feminist theory, documentary photography and policy, we describe photo novella within the broader context of the Ford Foundation-supported Yunnan Women's Health and Development Program and explain its application for influencing policy based on our experience carrying out photo novella in China."

This study applied a Scandinavian method called the Research Circle to convene a group of experienced women construction workers repeatedly over a period of two years so they could collaborate with researchers in explaining workplace issues. The results both validated and expanded upon previous findings about health and safety for women in construction, including gender discrimination, lack of access to sanitary facilities, retaliation for reporting hazards and injuries, and inadequate training and equipment. Especially important, findings illustrate some of the complex hierarchical social structures involved in both female and male construction workers responding to hazardous conditions."

The research aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of participatory methods.Needs assessment and intervention development phases resulted in implementation of aerobic lessons and nutrition interventions. In the evaluation phase, participation levels were measured using Pretty's typology in focus groups.Results show that women appreciate participating in the program. Increase in physical activity was not measured. Women's knowledge about healthy food increased, women changed behavior by buying healthier food ingredients and women continued to participate.Participatory approaches facilitate participation at the desired level in the different phases of the program. Participatory approaches are time-consuming but worthwhile. Pretty's typology is useful to measure degree of participation, although methods can be improved and the meaning of participation should be reconsidered.The added value of this article is twofold: 1. it demonstrates that participatory methods and tools both facilitate and evaluate participation, and 2. it shows how to evaluate the degree of participation."

The issue of poor access to prenatal care by Aboriginal women and families is viewed through a post-colonial lens within a historical and social location. This case study was guided by participatory research principles. Data were collected through exploratory interviews and small-group discussions. The sample comprised purposively selected community leaders, providers, and community members affiliated with 2 Aboriginal health-care organizations in a mainly rural region. Participants from all 3 stakeholder groups expressed the view that care should be based on an understanding of the priorities and experiences of the pregnant and parenting Aboriginal women and families themselves. Therefore the research question What are Aboriginal parents' views of the importance of pregnancy and parenting? was added to highlight the views and life experiences of Aboriginal parents. \"Turning around\" the intergenerational impact of residential schools was identified as pivotal to care. The results suggest that pregnancy and parenting must be understood as reflecting both the unique individual and family experiences of Aboriginal people and the intergenerational impact of residential schools as an instrument of collective violence and as a key factor in Aboriginal Canadians' inequitable health status and access to health services."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Over 250,000 workers are employed in poultry processing, one of the most dangerous industries in the US. These jobs are increasingly held by immigrant workers who are frequently undocumented, lack knowledge of workers' rights to workplace safety, and who are reluctant to pursue their rights. This situation creates the potential for organizational injustice, made visible through abusive supervisory practices, and leads to situations in which occupational illnesses and injuries are likely to occur.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This paper draws on data collected during the research phases of a community-based participatory research and social justice project. Two hundred survey interviews and 26 in-depth interviews were collected in representative, community-based samples in western North Carolina. Analyses describe associations between one aspect of organizational injustice, abusive supervision, and worker injuries.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Workers' reports of abusive supervision are associated with a variety of specific and summary health indicators. The associations are stronger for women than for men. These suggest that the use of relative power within the plant may be the basis for injuries and illnesses. Three types of power relations are described that form the basis for these abusive interactions in the plant: ethnicity (American vs. Latino), immigration status (\"good papers\" vs. undocumented), and rank (supervisor vs. worker). Two factors modify these relations: kinship (preferences and privileges for family members) and gender.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Among Latino immigrants working in poultry plants, power differences reflecting organizational injustice in the form of abusive supervision may promote occupational illnesses and injuries, particularly for women."

            "abstract": "According to hope theory, hope is defined as goal-directed thinking in which people perceive that they can find routes to desired goals and the motivation to use those routes. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between hope and body mass index and hope and self-rated health among women completing a community survey conducted in four rural counties in eastern North Carolina. The survey was administered as part of Hope Works, a participatory, community-led intervention program to improve weight, health and hope among low-income women in rural North Carolina. Survey data from 434 women were analyzed. In multivariate models adjusting for age, race, education and income, higher hope was positively related to self-reported health (OR:0.92; 95% CI: 0.89-0.95) and negatively related to BMI (P < 0.01). These results indicated that women who reported better self-rated health also had higher hope scores and women who were heavier had lower hope scores. While these findings are exploratory, they suggest directions for further research. State-based hope is considered to be a characteristic that is malleable and open to development. Future interventions should examine the importance of hope as a construct to examine in weight loss studies. For example, programs could be designed to increase hope by focusing on goal setting and providing support, information and resources to help women work toward their goals."

            "abstract": "Community-based participatory development empowers villagers to develop community cohesion and confidence, increase their ability to identify, analyze, and priorize their own needs, and organize the resources to meet these needs. An important first step in the process involves establishing a cohesive and functional community group. The authors believe that this is best accomplished through villagers' critical examination of their experiences with development including their understanding of reasons for success or failure, and the gradual emergence of a model of working together that acknowledges and builds on participation and collective expertise. This approach to development is demonstrating encouraging results in a rural area of western Nepal in a university affiliated Canadian/Nepali Health Development Project. This paper describes two mini-projects to illustrate the evolution of group formation through reflection, analysis, and action, and identifies outcomes that could serve as indicators of community empowerment. The paper also presents a generic model of empowerment, and offers lessons learned by the project through the application of the empowerment process to sustainable health development."

            "abstract": "Feminist participatory action research integrates feminist theories and participatory action research methods, often with the explicit intention of building community-academic partnerships to create new forms of knowledge to inform women's health. Despite the current pro-partnership agenda in health research and policy settings, a lack of attention has been paid to how to cultivate effective partnerships given limited resources, competing agendas, and inherent power differences. Based on our 10+ years individually and collectively conducting women's health and feminist participatory action research, we suggest that it is imperative to intentionally develop power-with strategies in order to avoid replicating the power imbalances that such projects seek to redress. By drawing on examples from three of our recent feminist participatory action projects we reflect on some of the tensions and complexities of attempting to cultivate power-with research partnerships. We then offer skills and resources needed by academic researchers to effectively harness the collective resources, agendas, and knowledge that each partner brings to the table. We suggest that investing in the process of cultivating power-with research partnerships ultimately improves our collective ability to understand and address women's health issues."

Community loan funds can increase access to cash in rural areas, thereby reducing delays in care seeking. As part of a participatory intervention in rural Nepal, community women's groups initiated and managed local funds. We explore the factors affecting utilization and management of these funds and the role of the funds in the success of the women's group intervention. We conducted a qualitative study using focus group discussions, group interviews and unstructured observations. Funds may increase access to care for members of trusted 'insider' families adjudged as able to repay loans. Sustainability and sufficiency of funds was a concern but funds increased women's independence and enabled timely care seeking. Conversely, the perceived necessity to contribute may have deterred poorer women. While funds were integral to group success and increased women's autonomy, they may not be the most effective way of supporting the poorest, as the risk pool is too small to allow for repayment default."

The project used three components: small grant scheme, technical assistance and database system management. Through the small grants scheme, the PfD supported a Community Participation Strategy (CPS) project over a three year period. The project involved the rural areas of six Bolivian departments and suburban areas of three Bolivian cities. The main objective was to increase health service utilization with a particular emphasis on empowerment of women, strengthening of local organizations and increasing the demand for health services. Women from both the urban and rural areas, and from different indigenous groups, were trained in project management, health promotion, reproductive health and family planning, advocacy and community participation. Participatory methodologies have allowed empowering women in decision making and capacity building throughout the entire project process. The experience shows that it is important to work with formally established grass-root community organizations and strengthen leadership within them. Additionally, the sub-projects demonstrated that interventions are more successful when promoters speak and write native languages, women are more motivated and empowered, projects are designed to be responsive to daily necessities identified by the communities and health services are culturally suitable. A preliminary evaluation, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, shows an overall improvement in health knowledge and practice, and utilization of health services."

We suggest that the process of transition towards incorporating the experience of chronic illness into one's life is influenced by the (re)construction of self-identity.\n    \n\n\n          Design and methods:\n        \n      \n      A participatory action process guided the research. The women joined the authors for five group sessions that totalled 15 hours of contact time. In addition, we offered women the opportunity for one-to-one interviews at home. Nine women volunteered to participate. This allowed us to gain additional in-depth data about individual experiences. The interpretive framework was guided by the self-identity literature. When reading the transcripts we questioned: What is going on here? What does this say about the construction of self? What does this say about the construction of identity? What influence does the body have in the construction of self-identity? Analysis was collaborative (with the women) and the resultant emerging construction of sexuality is shared in this paper. Data generated during one-to-one interviews are privileged and we include two accounts from women who live with MS. The women's stories focus on sexuality, however, within this sexual context, we observed shifts in self-identity which we contend may shape the illness transition experience.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The rationale for privileging only two accounts is to expand understanding of Ordinariness and Extraordinariness with particular focus on the salience of the body in the 'sexual' lives of the women. Self-identity was shaped by how they felt about themselves as sexual beings, how they experienced their body, how they felt about sexual activities and by the way others reacted to them. Importantly, we view the women's sense of self, identity and the relationship to the body and find that shifts in self identity shape the woman's transition towards Ordinariness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This exploration of illness experiences is a reminder that our bodies are vehicles for our sense of self and identity. Cultural, educational, social, religious and family contexts all impact on women's capacity to shape the consequences of illness and the choices available to them. Facilitating women towards an awareness of the choices available in order to sustain or reclaim self may in turn expedite transition towards Ordinariness so that illness may become a part of their life."

We highlight the essential role of advocacy in CBPR and how that can enhance research quality. We argue for the justification of this approach as not only valid and credible but essential in research with these and other communities."

            "abstract": "AIDS affects everyone, regardless of race, age, or religion; hence, information must be accessible to everyone. This descriptive study identified the need to generate culturally sensitive educational programs and evaluated their effect. Culturally sensitive AIDS educational training was offered to culturally diverse women. Training was conducted by women of the same ethnicity as the women in the group. The facilitators were specially trained on the role of a facilitator and the participatory method of learning. To assess any change in attitude, knowledge, and beliefs regarding AIDS, the questionnaire was administered before and after the training programs. Educational training had a positive effect (p < .05) on participants' attitude and knowledge regarding AIDS; they felt comfortable discussing their concerns in their own language, and with their friends from the same community, and they viewed the resources used as culturally sensitive."

Yet many programs have demonstrated success only in highly controlled research settings and few address the needs of low-income, uninsured, minority women. Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN), a demonstration program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that provides chronic disease risk factor screening and lifestyle interventions for low-income, 40-64-year-old women is learning from our own successful programs but is also charting new territory. As the CDC, state health departments, tribal organizations, and other WISEWOMAN partners approach the end of the first decade of WISEWOMAN demonstration projects, we are seeking to understand what has worked and what has not. This paper describes the rationale and proposed methodology for assessing best practices in the WISEWOMAN program through a participatory process that will examine scientific evidence and quantitative and qualitative program data. By emphasizing practicality in addition to scientific rigor, we are expanding the base of evidence considered to identify effective approaches for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in financially disadvantaged, ethnically diverse women. Results of the 3-year project will be disseminated in a format intended to encourage programs to select and adapt those strategies best suited to their particular contexts."

By increased use of evidence-based knowledge in the healthcare system a large proportion of these neonatal deaths could be prevented. But there is a severe lack of knowledge on effective methods for successful implementation of evidence into practice, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Recent studies have demonstrated promising results with increased survival among both mothers and newborns using community-based approaches. In Vietnam evidence-based guidelines on reproductive health were launched in 2003 and revised in 2009. The overall objective of the current project is to evaluate if a facilitation intervention on the community level, with a problem-solving approach involving local representatives if the healthcare system and the community, results in improvements of neonatal health and survival.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study, which has been given the acronym NeoKIP (Neonatal Health - Knowledge Into Practice), took place in 8 districts composed by 90 communes in a province in northern Vietnam, where neonatal mortality rate was 24/1000 in 2005. A cluster randomised design was used, allocating clusters, as defined as a commune and its correponding Commune Health Center (CHC) to either intervention or control arm. The facilitation intervention targeted staff at healthcare centres and key persons in the communes. The facilitator role was performed by lay women (Women's Union representatives) using quality improvement techniques to initiate and sustain improvement processes targeting identified problem areas. The intervention has been running over 3 years and data were collected on the facilitation process, healthcare staff knowledge in neonatal care and their behaviour in clinical practice, and reproductive and perinatal health indicators. Primary outcome is neonatal mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The intervention is participatory and dynamic, focused on developing a learning process and a problem-solving cycle.

The Gateways to Cancer Screening project was initiated to document the challenges for women with disabilities in their access and experiences of screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. The study followed the tenets of participatory action research. Five peer-led focus groups were held with 24 women with mobility disabilities. Study participants identified multiple and interacting institutional barriers to cancer screening. Their discussions highlighted the complex work of (1) arranging and attending health-related appointments, (2) confronting normative assumptions about women's bodies and (3) securing reliable health care and information. These overlapping, mutually reinforcing issues interact to shape how women with disabilities access and experience cancer screening.

Given the pervasive levels of violence faced by sex workers over the last decades, and extensive harm reduction and HIV prevention efforts operating in Vancouver, Canada, this research aimed to explore the role of social and structural violence and power relations in shaping the HIV risk environment and prevention practices of women in survival sex work. Through a participatory-action research project, a series of focus group discussions were conceptualized and co-facilitated by sex workers, community and research partners with a total of 46 women in early 2006. Based on thematic, content and theoretical analysis, the following key factors were seen to both directly and indirectly mediate women's agency and access to resources, and ability to practice HIV prevention and harm reduction: at the micro-level, boyfriends as pimps and the 'everyday violence' of bad dates; at the meso-level, a lack of safe places to take dates, and adverse impacts of local policing; and at the macro-level, dopesickness and the need to sell sex for drugs. Analysis of the narratives and daily lived experiences of women sex workers highlight the urgent need for a renewed HIV prevention strategy that moves beyond a solely individual-level focus to structural and environmental interventions, including legal reforms, that facilitate 'enabling environments' for HIV prevention."

            "abstract": "Against the backdrop of a large treatment gap for mental disorders in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), the 2007 Lancet series on global mental health calls for a scaling up of mental health services. Community participation is largely harnessed as one strategy to facilitate this call. Using a participatory implementation framework for the development of mental health services for common mental disorders (CMDs) in a rural subdistrict in South Africa as a case study, this study sought to understand the benefits and challenges of community participation beyond that of scaling up. Qualitative process evaluation involving interviews with service providers and users was employed. The results suggest that in addition to promoting mobilization of resources and actions for scaling up mental health services, community participation can potentially contribute to more culturally competent services and personal empowerment of recipients of care. In addition, community participation holds promise for engendering community-led public health actions to ameliorate some of the social determinants of mental ill health. Challenges include that community members involved in these activities are mainly marginalized women, who have limited power to achieve structural change, including cultural practices that may be harmful to the mental health of women and children. We conclude that in addition to contributing to scaling up mental health services, community participation can potentially promote the development of culturally competent mental health services and greater community control of mental health."

Analysis of how communication might practically be improved remains a critical area for investigation however. To this end a pilot study, conducted in January 1998 involving two all-female focus groups in two rural areas of Zimbabwe, explored the possibility of using 'participatory' methods and visual diagramming as a means to facilitate rural people's communication about issues of sexual health. While still provisional, the results hold considerable interest for future HIV/AIDS work in the region. As a research tool, diagramming provides richer, more nuanced data about sexual activity than wholly discursive focus groups. However, the technique also holds considerable potential for action research and positive interventions that seek to facilitate couples' more open communication and safer sexual decision making. The pilot established both that rural women were comfortable utilising the techniques and that they were prepared to use them to discuss the detail of their sex lives. The next and vital step, as participants themselves suggested, is to involve men in similar self-analytical activities."

Proactive calls providing continuity of care increased women's confidence and were highly valued. Data demonstrated intervention fidelity for woman-centred care; however, observing an entire breast feed was not well implemented due to short hospital stays, ward routines and staff-team-woman communication issues. Staff pragmatically recognised that dedicated feeding teams help meet women's breastfeeding support needs in the context of overstretched and variable postnatal services.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Implementing and integrating the FEeding Support Team (FEST) trial within routine postnatal care was feasible and acceptable to women and staff from a research and practice perspective and shows promise for addressing health inequalities.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ISRCTN27207603.

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the number of women in US jails has increased at an annual average of 7.0%. These women typically suffer from untreated, serious health problems. This participatory research project explored health problems and healthcare from the perspective of women incarcerated in a county detention facility located in the western US. A convenience sample of 78 inmates and former inmates participated in 10 focus groups. Using the constant comparative method, the data analysis revealed that they suffered from physical, mental, and iatrogenic health problems. Barriers to care included concerns about privacy and dignity as well as waiting time for treatment, co-payments, and concealing problems in order to obtain work opportunities. Women in the project identified solutions for these problems and analyzed why incarceration made them aware of previously ignored health concerns. The findings suggest the importance of further research with this vulnerable, hidden population."

            "abstract": "Young Aboriginal women are consistently identified as having poorer health outcomes and access to sexual health services than non-Indigenous Australians. Yet the literature is particularly silent on what sexual health nurses need to know and do in order to work well with young urban Aboriginal women. This paper reports on a qualitative pilot study undertaken by a non-Indigenous nurse in Adelaide. The participatory action research methods used in this study were sensitive to the history of problems associated with research in Aboriginal communities. A reference group of Elder Aboriginal women and Aboriginal health workers guided all aspects of the study. A partnership approach between the researcher and the Reference Group ensured that the methods, analysis, and final report were culturally safe. Three groups participated in this study: Elders and Aboriginal health workers; young Aboriginal women, and sexual health nurses. All participants acknowledged the importance of nurses being clinically competent. However, the overarching finding was a lack of a clear model of cultural care to guide health service delivery. Three interrelated themes emerged from the data to support this contention. These were: the structural and personal importance of establishing and maintaining trustworthy relationships between nurses, Aboriginal health workers and Elders; the recognition that Aboriginal culture does exist, and is important in urban areas; and the importance of gender considerations to understanding urban women's health business. A partnership approach was recommended as a way to use these findings to develop a transparent cultural model of care. Further research is currently being undertaken to progress this agenda."

            "abstract": "The vast majority of community nutrition/health programs in developing countries focus on women of reproductive age (WRA) and a few explicitly involve senior women, or grandmothers. In Senegal, as in many other places, older, experienced women play an influential role in household maternal and child health (MCH) matters. Formative research in Serer villages revealed their importance and this was taken into account in an action research nutrition education (NE) project in which grandmothers were encouraged to promote improved nutritional practices related to pregnancy (e.g. decreased work and improved diet) and infant feeding (e.g. breastfeeding and complementary feeding). A participatory communication/empowerment education approach was used involving songs, stories and group discussion. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to both document and evaluate the intervention. Triangulation of the evaluation data suggests that 12 months after the intervention was initiated there were significant improvements in grandmothers' nutritional knowledge, in their advice to WRA, and in the nutrition-related practices of these younger women associated both with pregnancy and infant feeding. For example, in the pre-test only 20% of grandmothers stated that they advise pregnant women to decrease their workload whereas in the post-test 87% reported giving this advice. At the same time, 91% of WRA in villages with the grandmother strategy reported having decreased their workload during their last pregnancy whereas in villages with NE activities for WRA but not with grandmothers, only 34% of younger women reported having done so. These findings provide evidence of grandmothers' ability to learn, to integrate new information into their practices and to positively influence the practices of WRA. These results support the need for future MCH programs, in different cultural contexts, to involve grandmothers and in so doing to build on their intrinsic commitment to family well-being."

            "abstract": "Persisting health disparities have lead to calls for an increase in health research to address them. Biomedical scientists call for research that stratifies individual indicators associated with health disparities, for example, ethnicity. Feminist social scientists recommend feminist intersectionality research. Intersectionality is the multiplicative effect of inequalities experienced by nondominant marginalized groups, for example, ethnic minorities, women, and the poor. The elimination of health disparities necessitates integration of both paradigms in health research. This study provides a practical application of the integration of biomedical and feminist intersectionality paradigms in nursing research, using a psychiatric intervention study with battered Latino women as an example."

However, consumers are rarely involved in decisions about what evidence is actually required and this may result in a mismatch between research undertaken and issues of importance to those who use the health services. This may be particularly evident in maternity care where disease focused research funding priorities may not address aspects of care which are important to the majority of women. Working with service users to generate possible future research questions may facilitate more women centred research.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      the project used a three stage participatory approach in a diverse sample of localities across Scotland. Twelve pre-existing, community-based groups of maternity service users participated with between 8 and 20 mothers in each. Each group met twice. At the first meeting group discussion identified topics and questions. A rapid literature review of each topic was conducted and used to develop a document summarising evidence to facilitate discussion at the second meeting. The group then prioritised topic areas and questions using a modified Nominal Group Technique.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      analysis identified key topics and questions which were raised and prioritised by a number of the groups; a 'top ten' list of priority topics was readily identified, these included aspects of postnatal care, antenatal care, communication and information giving and risk. Approximately 200 individual questions were asked by women, for example: What is the impact of a bad birth experience on postnatal physical and psychological health? What is the best way of providing antenatal classes/preparation classes? What is the effect of women feeling not listened to in labour? How can fathers be given effective preparation for coping with labour and birth and supporting their partner?\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      this project demonstrates that women are well able to articulate researchable questions when given the opportunity and support to do so.

Little is known, however, about enabling among policy-makers and professionals. This case study investigates enabling among policy-makers and professionals who engaged in a specific participatory approach, cooperative planning. We define 'enabling' as creating action situations that allow policy-makers and professionals to (i) build individual capacities for health promotion and to (ii) apply these capacities to concrete organizational and political action at the institutional level. This case study followed policy-makers and professionals as they participated in a local physical activity promotion action research project in Germany. We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data gathered in that project (2005-2011). Methods included participant observation, document analysis, focus groups and qualitative interviews. All data were revisited for the case study and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Findings include examples of enabling among policy-makers and professionals related to the cooperative planning process. Individual capacities were developed in perceived project roles, interactions with target groups and decision-making procedures. Findings also demonstrated municipal policy changes. Access to physical activity infrastructures improved, and an intersectoral job position was funded to support physical activity promotion among target group participants. Findings were analyzed using a model that links cooperative planning with a framework on policy change from a political science perspective. We conclude that cooperative planning might be a pathway to negotiated agreements that foster systematic enabling and health-promoting policy change."

By contrast, a process that we have termed knowledge transfer by deelitization occurs when (a) participatory action researchers work with a community to identify a problem involving oppression or exploitation. Then (b) community members suggest solutions and acquire the tools of analysis and action to pursue social actions. (c) Disadvantaged persons thereby become more aware of their own abilities and resources, and persons with special expertise become more effective. (d) Rather than detachment and value neutrality, this joint process involves advocacy and structural transformation. In the examples of participatory action research documented here, Third World social scientists collaborated with indigenous populations to solve problems of literacy, community-building, land ownership, and political voice. Western social scientists, inspired by these non-Western scientists, then joined in promoting PAR both in the Third World and in Europe and the Americas, e.g., adapting it for solving problems of people with disabilities or disenfranchised women. Emancipatory goals such as these may even help North American psychologists to break free of some methodological chains and to bring about social and political change."

Data were gathered through a series of focus group (FG) discussions with local lady health workers, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women attending an Emergency Field Hospital in North West Pakistan between May 2008 and March 2009. A nutrition intervention programme was implemented that involved cookery demonstration kitchens and free food supplements, coupled with nutrition and healthcare information and advice for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Subsequent FG discussions revealed that the programme had a positive impact on knowledge gained by women in the community and generated an openness to receiving and spreading knowledge. The framework, which rested on the use of a double feedback loop, involving local women, lady health workers, local researchers and UK-based researchers, has enabled not only the establishment of the programme, but has also given the local team the tools to apply for, and gain, further funding for the development of nutrition support services.

While this disparity primarily reflects lack of access to screening with cervical cytology, the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) which causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide, varies by population and may contribute to excess rate of disease. Our study examined the prevalence of oncogenic and nononcogenic HPV types and risk factors for HPV infection in Little Haiti. Methods. As part of an ongoing community-based participatory research initiative, community health workers recruited study participants between 2007 and 2008, instructed women on self-collecting cervicovaginal specimens, and collected sociodemographic and healthcare access data. Results. Of the 242 women who contributed adequate specimens, the overall prevalence of HPV was 20.7%, with oncogenic HPV infections (13.2% of women) outnumbering nononcogenic infections (7.4%). Age-specific prevalence of oncogenic HPV was highest in women 18-30 years (38.9%) although the prevalence of oncogenic HPV does not appear to be elevated relative to the general U.S. population. The high prevalence of oncogenic types in women over 60 years may indicate a substantial number of persistent infections at high risk of progression to precancer."

In this paper we 1) describe the process of qualitative inquiry and community involvement, 2) evaluate the impact of community participation, and 3) present a brief summary of the findings on social context as it relates to pregnancy outcomes of women in Harlem.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We operationalized the qualitative method by combining participant observation, longitudinal case studies, and focus groups. An ethnographic survey was used to verify and triangulate findings across methods of data collection. We involved the community in the design, implementation, and analysis by collaborating with community-based organizations, setting up a community advisory board, and the use of dialogue groups and community meetings.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The use of qualitative methods and community partnership uncovered important aspects of the social context of women's lives that may not have emerged through traditional epidemiologic research. We found that pregnancy may serve as a catalyst to increase perception of the magnitude of preexisting social stressors. Several stressors and chronic strains associated with structural forces were identified. For example, the high percentage of households headed by women is seen as one consequence of larger structural forces. While social support networks serve as an important coping mechanism to buffer against the stress caused by these structural forces, the types of support women seek differs by social strata, and some strategies were identified as being substantially more effective than others.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Qualitative and community participatory research can be successfully conducted to support public health goals and can derive important new information on the social context of women's lives."

Increasing numbers of nurse scholars have explored the use of emancipatory inquiries (particularly feminist theory and critical theory) as philosophic bases for nursing practice and as theoretical or methodologic perspectives for nursing research. This article presents participatory research as a methodology and consciousness raising as a method for nursing research that addresses the emancipatory goals of feminist and critical theories. An example of consciousness raising in a participatory nursing research project is offered. It is argued that participatory research can produce a revolutionary emancipatory knowledge for the future of nursing and health care."

Evidence suggests that death rates can be reduced by interventions at community level. We describe an intervention which aimed to harness the power of community planning and decision making to improve maternal and newborn care in rural Nepal. METHODS: The development of 111 women's groups in a population of 86 704 in Makwanpur district, Nepal is described. The groups, facilitated by local women, were the intervention component of a randomized controlled trial to reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality rates. Through participant observation and analysis of reports, we describe the implementation of this intervention: the community entry process, the facilitation of monthly meetings through a participatory action cycle of problem identification, community planning, and implementation and evaluation of strategies to tackle the identified problems. RESULTS: In response to the needs of the group, participatory health education was added to the intervention and the women's groups developed varied strategies to tackle problems of maternal and newborn care: establishing mother and child health funds, producing clean home delivery kits and operating stretcher schemes. Close linkages with community leaders and community health workers improved strategy implementation. There were also indications of positive effects on group members and health services, and most groups remained active after 30 months. CONCLUSION: A large scale and potentially sustainable participatory intervention with women's groups, which focused on pregnancy, childbirth and the newborn period, resulted in innovative strategies identified by local communities to tackle perinatal care problems."

Health care providers must use culture-specific HIV prevention strategies and must address cultural roles and values of the Latin community to empower Latinas to reduce high-risk behaviors. Some Latinas adhere to their cultural traditions that place the female subservient to the male in the sexual relationship. A review of the literature reveals that skills-building, a group participatory tool that engages the individual to examine high-risk behaviors and provides methods to make behavior changes, and nurse counseling, which focuses on an individual's specific risk behaviors, are more effective modes of reducing high-risk behaviors in women than an information-only intervention."

We evaluated community and facility-based interventions to reduce deaths in three districts of Malawi.\n## METHODS\nWe evaluated a rural participatory women's group community intervention (CI) and a quality improvement intervention at health centres (FI) via a two-by-two factorial cluster randomized controlled trial. Consenting pregnant women were followed-up to 2 months after birth using key informants. Primary outcomes were maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality. Clusters were health centre catchment areas assigned using stratified computer-generated randomization. Following exclusions, including non-birthing facilities, 61 clusters were analysed: control (17 clusters, 4912 births), FI (15, 5335), CI (15, 5080) and FI + CI (14, 5249). This trial was registered as International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial [ISRCTN18073903]. Outcomes for 14,576 and 20,576 births were recorded during baseline (June 2007-September 2008) and intervention (October 2008-December 2010) periods.\n## RESULTS\nFor control, FI, CI and FI + CI clusters neonatal mortality rates were 34.0, 28.3, 29.9 and 27.0 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births and perinatal mortality rates were 56.2, 55.1, 48.0 and 48.4 per 1000 births, during the intervention period. Adjusting for clustering and stratification, the neonatal mortality rate was 22% lower in FI + CI than control clusters (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.01), and the perinatal mortality rate was 16% lower in CI clusters (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.97).

Traditional methods of controlling ticks include handpicking, on-host use of ethnobotanical suspensions (prepared from one or more of over 150 documented plants) to kill the ticks and prevent re-infestation, fumigation of infested cattle with smoke derived from burning ethnobotanical products, burning pastures, rotational grazing ethnopractices, and livestock quarantine.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study confirms that the Bukusu have preserved rich ethnoveterinary knowledge and practices.

            "abstract": "While relatively few countries have changed their working time legislation in recent years, new working time patterns show some changes in approaches to night and shiftwork. Prominent trends include (i) the spread of irregular hours of work to different sectors, including services, often as a result of decoupling business hours from individual working hours; (ii) greater flexibility, often in return for shorter hours, in covering operating hours by different individuals; (iii) the appearance of complex combinations of different categories of working time arrangements, such as a combination of full-time semi-continuous shifts and part-time weekend shifts; and (iv) the adoption of a complex process for changes in schemes, incorporating group study and joint planning. Importantly, these trends reflect fundamental changes in the concept of night work (and that of nightworkers). The issues related to these recent trends were apparent in the two-year debate that led to new international labour standards, the Night Work Convention (No. 171) and Recommendation (No. 178), 1990, both of which apply to both sexes and to nearly all occupations. Also adopted was the Protocol of 1990 to the Night Work (Women) Convention (No. 89) of 1948, under which national laws or regulations may now permit night work of women in industry under strictly defined conditions. The new Convention and Recommendation define 'nightworker' to include workers performing a substantial amount of night work. They prescribe a variety of actions to improve the quality of working life of such workers, including measures related to working hours, rest periods, safety and health, transfer to day work, maternity protection, social services, and consultations. Strategies should be adopted that take into account the local situation, that are participatory, and that take due account of the diverse aspects of working life associated with the new concept of night work."

RAS are a quick, cost-efficient method for assessing the prevalence of health behaviors in communities with high-rates of illiteracy and/or distrust of research.

The guidelines are being revised in a third edition to emphasize an integrated approach to water quality assessment and management from source to consumer. The forthcoming guidelines will: be risk-based and quantitative, emphasize quality protection and prevention of contamination, be proactive and participatory, and address the needs of those in developing countries who have no access to piped community water supplies. The guidelines emphasize the maintenance of microbial quality to prevent waterborne infectious disease as an essential goal. In addition, they address protection from chemical toxicants and other contaminants of public health concern. The forthcoming 3rd edition of the WHO GDWQ intend to be responsive to the under-served in developing countries by inclusion of non-piped supplies and addressing practical systems for their collection, treatment and storage at household level to provide safe water. Beyond the inclusion of these and possibly additional household water collection, treatment and storage systems, what is needed is to achieve their widespread use is an education and dissemination campaign that promotes and explains them and their benefits. Such a communication and marketing campaign is best done by including as many different sectors and stakeholders as possible in the process. It will be important to acknowledge that safe water is one of essential components or needs for healthy living, along with adequate sanitation and proper nutrition. Together, these are the essential health needs to be met in the developing and the developed world. All three contribute to reduced disease and increased health, and the lack of one can degrade the beneficial impact of the others. The importance of safe water, sanitation and nutrition to human health and well-being can be stated no better than it was by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his statement on \"Freedom from Want\" in the Millennium Report, 03/04/00. \"How can we call human beings free and equal in dignity when over a billion of them are struggling to survive on less than one dollar a day, without safe drinking water, and when half of all humanity lacks adequate sanitation?

            "abstract": "The authors describe the implementation, results, and evaluations of a participatory action research project in which they used qualitative methods to do HIV prevention education with lesbians and bisexual women. This grassroots project combined collective consciousness-raising, qualitative field interviewing, and individualized HIV prevention education in an experientially intense intervention sustained over a 2-year period in community sites. Systematic data collection about HIV risk taking among lesbians and bisexual women was conjoined with efforts to mobilize the community for behavior change to prevent HIV. A cadre of peer educators conducted 1,189 field interviews and produced 55 HIV prevention presentations with a total of 3,665 women in attendance. Key findings describe the HIV risk taking common in this population and their needs for support in reducing risk. Process evaluations of the project suggest that its combined individual and group approach and its continuity over time were effective. Outcomes suggest that the project positively affected participants' intent to change risk behaviors, supported incremental changes to reduce risk, assisted participants in the interpersonal realm of partner negotiations, and began to change community conventions about sexual expectations and practices."

Regarding at-home preventive agents, there was little difference in preference between nonprescription fluoride, prescription fluoride, or chlorhexidine rinse. Dentists who most frequently used caries prevention were also those who regularly perform caries risk assessment and individualize caries prevention at the patient level. Higher percentages of patients with dental insurance were significantly associated with more use of in-office prevention modalities. Female dentists and dentists with more-recent training were more likely to recommend preventive agents that are applied by the patient. Dentists who reported more-conservative decisions in clinical treatment scenarios were also more likely to use caries preventive agents. Groups of dentist who shared a common preference for certain preventive agents were identified. One group used preventive agents selectively, whereas the other groups predominately used either in-office or at-home fluorides.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Caries prevention is commonly used with adult patients.

The Community Action Board, consisting of 20 East Harlem residents, leaders, and advocates, used CBPR to compare the effectiveness of various strategies in recruiting and enrolling adults with prediabetes into a peer-led, diabetes prevention intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The board created five recruitment strategies: recruiting through clinicians; recruiting at large public events such as farmers markets; organizing special local recruitment events; recruiting at local organizations; and recruiting through a partner-led approach, in which community partners developed and managed the recruitment efforts at their sites.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 3 months, 555 local adults were approached; 249 were appropriate candidates for further evaluation (overweight, nonpregnant, East Harlem residents without known diabetes); 179 consented and returned in a fasting state for 1/2 day of prediabetes testing; 99 had prediabetes and enrolled in a pilot randomized trial. The partner-led approach was highly successful, recruiting 68% of those enrolled.

Nursing staff were trained to identify three key actions in the pathway for domestic violence presentations in the ED. A survey of ED staff was taken pre-training to determine a base-line measure of self-reported knowledge regarding domestic violence policies and practices. The survey was re-administered 1 month and 6 months post-training. A file audit was also undertaken prior to and following the training. Results show the training improved the nurses' confidence, practice and skills in the identification of, and response to, domestic violence, particularly in relation to children. ED nurses are well placed to identify and respond to domestic violence as the ED provides a gateway into health services for women and their children. This paper reports on a participatory action research project which aimed to improve quality and practice around DV for ED staff. The dissemination of the results in this paper are considered to be essential to health services due to dearth of information and research about best practice initiatives for responding to and recognizing domestic violence in the ED."
