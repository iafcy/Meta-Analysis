### Abstract

Introduction: Improving maternal and newborn health in low-income settings requires both health service and community
action. Previous community initiatives have been predominantly rural, but India is urbanizing. While working to improve
health service quality, we tested an intervention in which urban slum-dweller women’s groups worked to improve local
perinatal health.

Methods and Findings: A cluster randomized controlled trial in 24 intervention and 24 control settlements covered a
population of 283,000. In each intervention cluster, a facilitator supported women’s groups through an action learning cycle
in which they discussed perinatal experiences, improved their knowledge, and took local action. We monitored births,
stillbirths, and neonatal deaths, and interviewed mothers at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcomes described perinatal
care, maternal morbidity, and extended perinatal mortality. The analysis included 18,197 births over 3 years from 2006 to
2009. We found no differences between trial arms in uptake of antenatal care, reported work, rest, and diet in later
pregnancy, institutional delivery, early and exclusive breastfeeding, or care-seeking. The stillbirth rate was non-significantly
lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.60–1.22), and the neonatal mortality rate higher (1.48, 1.06–2.08).
The extended perinatal mortality rate did not differ between arms (1.19, 0.90–1.57). We have no evidence that these
differences could be explained by the intervention.

Conclusions: Facilitating urban community groups was feasible, and there was evidence of behaviour change, but we did
not see population-level effects on health care or mortality. In cities with multiple sources of health care, but inequitable
access to services, community mobilization should be integrated with attempts to deliver services for the poorest and most
vulnerable, and with initiatives to improve quality of care in both public and private sectors.

### Introduction

The current consensus on improving maternal and newborn
survival [1–3], particularly in low-income countries, is that
perinatal care needs to involve both health service strengthening
and community activities [4–6]. Recent advances include India’s
Janani Suraksha Yojana cash incentive for professional obstetric
care [7], the development of home-based newborn care as a result
of work in rural India [8–11], and the success of community
mobilization around perinatal issues through women’s groups

[12,13]. The balance of supply- and demand-side interventions
remains uncertain: community mobilization seems likely to yield
greater benefits when mortality rates are high, and a focus on
health service quality when they are lower.
Community mobilization in this context has been almost
exclusively rural, but urban health is a developing concern [14].
Currently, 30% of India’s population is urban and 50 cities have
populations of over 1 million [15]. Rural health inequalities are
replicated in urban settings [16–19], with some important
differences. Cities offer many potential sources of health care at
a range of prices, and urban health care in India is provided by a
burgeoning, largely unregulated private sector and a beleaguered
public sector that caters mainly to poorer groups. In this context,
both quality of care and choice of an appropriate provider are
problematic [20,21]. Access tends not to be limited by distance
and scarcity, but by direct and indirect costs: urban life and
available time are intensely monetized and 80% of health care
expenditure is out of pocket [22]. Environmental determinants of
health such as housing fabric, water, sanitation, and sewage
dominate community perceptions of health needs in vulnerable
urban communities. Socio-cultural heterogeneity hinders collective action, while an overburdened urban infrastructure struggles
to meet growing demand.
Mumbai’s City Initiative for Newborn Health began in 2004.
A partnership between the Society for Nutrition, Education and
Health Action (SNEHA), a non-government organisation (NGO)
committed to improving the health of women and children in
Mumbai’s slums, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai
(MCGM), and University College London aimed to improve
maternal and newborn health in slum communities. Planning of
India’s National Urban Health Mission, analogue of the
developing National Rural Health Mission, was underway. An
Urban Social Health Activist (USHA) would work in vulnerable
communities, but what she would do was undecided. The City
Initiative was conceived as operationalizing a combination of
supply- and demand-side interventions in the urban context. It
combined improvement in municipal health care provision—
reinstitution of antenatal clinics at health posts catering to the
urban poor, clinical protocols for maternal and newborn care,
improved communication between institutions, and consolidation of referral linkages—with community mobilization activities

[23].
The community activities took as their model south Asian
projects that have worked successfully with groups of rural women
to improve perinatal health in their own communities, in a test of
their transferability to urban slum populations [12,13,24]. The
trial was a piece of operational research within the City Initiative.
Our objective was to test an intervention in which slum-dweller
women’s groups discussed perinatal health, improved their
knowledge through peer-learning, and developed and implemented local strategies. We examined a range of outcomes, including
stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates and antenatal, intrapartum,
and postpartum care (Text S1).


### Methods

 Ethics Statement
The activities of the City Initiative for Newborn Health were
approved by MCGM Joint Municipal Commissioners in 2004.
Given our interest in operational research at the interface between
NGO activities and public health evaluation, the idea of a trial was
in our minds. However, we were aware of no previous cluster
randomised controlled trial (cRCT) involving urban slums, and
there were serious doubts about whether it would be possible.
Additionally, little was known about maternal and child health in
Mumbai slums. For these reasons, in 2005, we set up a perinatal
vital registration system in 48 slum communities as part of the City
Initiative. The number was chosen because it was large enough to
model scalability and would be sufficient if we proceeded to a trial.
The surveillance was successful and it became clear that there was
scope for achieving a cRCT design. Funding for a trial was
received in 2007. Ethical approval was granted in the same year by
the Independent Ethics Committee for Research on Human
Subjects (Mumbai, reference IEC/06/31), the trial was registered
(ISRCTN96256793), and its protocol was published in 2008 (Text
S2) [25]. Cluster-level verbal consent for the study was given after
community meetings with general practitioners, community-based
organizations, NGOs, municipal representatives, political officers
of major parties, and social workers.

### Setting and Design
The capital of Maharashtra state, Mumbai has a provisional
2011 census population of 12.4 million, more than half of whom
live in slums. About one-fifth of slum homes have a private toilet,
31% of residents have completed 10 y of education, and the total
fertility rate is below the replacement threshold at 1.9 [26]. Public
sector care is provided by the Municipal Corporation. Private
health care is widely available and ranges from specialty hospitals
to informal practitioners. A cRCT design was chosen because a
group intervention was delivered in communities. Key participants
were women who joined groups in 24 intervention clusters, to be
compared with 24 control clusters. We implemented the trial in six
municipal wards. Clusters included had at least 1,000 households,
residents were aware of no plans for resettlement, and cluster
separation was wide enough to minimise contamination. We
excluded areas with transient communities—large construction
gangs, pavement dwellings—and areas for which resettlement was
being negotiated.

### Intervention
All the human resources involved in community activities were
employed by SNEHA. We recruited one full-time facilitator in
each intervention cluster of about 1,000 households. This sakhi
(friend) was a local woman with secondary education and
leadership skills, preferably married with children. Her role was
to conduct meetings with women, attend planning and supervision
meetings, and support group action. After training, she began by
profiling her settlement and building rapport with local stakeholders. She also attended regular training on a range of health care
topics. Over about 6 mo, she set up ten women’s groups,
formative work having shown that women’s mobility tended to
be confined to their own alley. The groups met fortnightly and she
met weekly with other sakhis and her supervisor. The intervention
followed a 36-meeting cycle that was predetermined in general but
developed iteratively in detail (Figure 1). There was no set point at
which women had to join a group, and women of all ages,
pregnant and non-pregnant, were welcome to participate. We took


-----

a participatory approach with an emphasis on sharing and peerlearning, rather than on the sakhi as an expert resource, and used
the change methodology of Appreciative Inquiry to focus on the
positive and to build energy for action through identification of the
strengths of participants, their families, and neighbourhoods [27].
Appreciative approaches have gained traction as an alternative to
problem-focused approaches [28,29], although empirical evaluation in terms of health outcomes has been limited. Each step was
simulated in sakhis’ weekly meetings and supported by supervisors.
The emphasis was on knowing what services were available,
choosing appropriate perinatal health care, understanding best
practice, and negotiating optimal care with family and providers.

### Outcomes
Routine and emergency antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal
care was documented, as well as illness in mother or baby.
Previous trials in rural settings had shown no effects on stillbirth
rates. In an urban setting with high levels of institutional delivery,
we decided to present both stillbirth (death of an infant before or
during delivery, per thousand births) and neonatal mortality (death
of a live-born infant within the first 28 d of life, per thousand live
births) rates.

### Sample Size and Allocation
Using data collected in the pre-trial year, with a two-tailed 5%
significance level, a conservative coefficient of variation between
clusters (k) value of 0.3, and the recruitment numbers achieved, the
trial had 80% power to detect a reduction in stillbirths from 12 to
7 per thousand, in neonatal deaths from 20 to 12 per thousand,
and in extended perinatal mortality from 29 to 20 per thousand

[30]. Through municipal documents, surveys, discussions with key
informants, and site visits, we identified 92 slum clusters. In a
transparent process, social workers external to the trial drew lots to

Figure 1. The intervention cycle.
doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001257.g001


select 48 in blocks of eight per ward, and then to allocate four
clusters per block to the intervention. We chose this method
because of our emphasis on participation and demystification of
research. The nature of the intervention precluded allocation
concealment.

### Data Collection and Management
Sakhis recorded details of each meeting they facilitated, quantitative
elements of which were entered into an electronic database.
Supervisors recorded their observations of meetings and training
and feedback sessions. A process evaluation officer attended and
documented weekly meetings and interviewed sakhis, group members
and non-members, and local stakeholders. We were able to draw on
attendance and content data for 5,253 women’s group meetings, 120
meetings observed by supervisors, summaries of 150 valuation
meetings, ten focus group discussions, seven sets of questionnaires,
seven role-play exercises, and interviews with 39 local stakeholders.
Group attendance was documented by sakhis and supplemented with
interview data collected by the process evaluation officer. We used the
attendance data to identify group members in all 24 intervention
clusters who had attended at least 15 meetings, and whose groups had
reached the latter stages of the meeting cycle. We asked these women
what they had done in terms of outreach, and subsequently
categorized their responses.
The trial covered an estimated population of 283,000. The
community-based vital surveillance system across the 48 clusters
was based on previous models [12,31]. Live births, stillbirths,
neonatal deaths, and maternal deaths were identified by 99 locally
resident women, each covering an average 600 households and
receiving INR 50 (US$1.11) per identification. Every event was
confirmed by one of 12 interviewers, who took verbal consent for a
comprehensive interview at around 6 wk after delivery (Text S3).
In the event of a death, one of six supervisors conducted verbal


-----

autopsy. Because of a fall in documented births later in the trial,
we did a retrospective census of births and deaths in all 48 clusters.
After the trial finished, we gave lists of all documented births and
deaths in the preceding year to the field investigators, and to
fieldworkers from other SNEHA projects. These agents checked
house to house for any births or deaths that might not have been
identified. The process identified 41 previously undocumented
births, but no stillbirths or neonatal deaths.
We had an ethical responsibility to recommend that unwell
mothers or infants visit a health facility, and to expedite care in
emergencies. Records of events and completed questionnaires
were subject to systematic and random checks for accuracy and
completeness, both in the field and during entry into an electronic
database (Access; Microsoft Corporation). Information provided
by participants remained confidential and outputs did not include
their names.
A steering group of external experts met in the first and second
years and reviewed the design, intervention and recruitment. A
Data Monitoring Committee met in April 2009, looked at data
from the first 2 y, and recommended stopping the intervention
after its cycles were complete and finishing the data collection as
planned. Data collection continued until mid-2010 in order to pick
up outcomes from all births to end-September 2009. It included a
retrospective census to ensure data completeness. A further
meeting in March 2011 considered the analyses and discussed
presentation and publication.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis used records of individual births and was by
intention to treat at cluster level. Analysts were blind to allocation.
For potential effects on health care, morbidity, and mortality, we
did multivariable logistic regression with random effects grouped
on cluster, comparing outcomes in intervention and control arms
and adjusting for covariates by including them in the models.
Quadrature checks confirmed the applicability of this approach.
The Data Monitoring Committee recommended adjustment for
socioeconomic status and for Muslim faith. Socioeconomic status
was described by a household asset score based on standardised
weights for the first component of a principal components analysis

[32,33]. This adjustment made no appreciable difference to the
findings, and we present unadjusted odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals. There were differences in the mortality
findings after adjustment, and we present unadjusted models,
along with models adjusted for cluster mean household asset score
at baseline, cluster proportion of Muslim respondents at baseline,
and baseline cluster mortality rate [34].
The primary analysis compared records from intervention and
control arms collected over 3 y. We did four pre-specified ancillary
analyses using identical methods on successively filtered datasets: a
comparison of outcomes in the latter 2 y of the trial, a comparison
that included only women who had lived in a cluster for at least a
year, a comparison of outcomes stratified by socioeconomic status,
and a comparison of women who had been group members with
women in intervention clusters who had not been members.
Analyses were done in Stata 11. Causes of perinatal death based
on verbal autopsies were assigned independently by two physicians, using an international classification [35]. Discordance was
resolved by a pediatrician (DO).

### Results

 Process
The conceptual premise of the model was that facilitation of
women’s groups would lead to changes in members’ knowledge


and behaviour, with diffusion of influence to other local women.
When the project began, women expressed a need for information
on health and health care. Although slum women’s groups (Mahila
mandals) and action groups existed in some clusters, they tended to
focus on single issues on an ad hoc basis. Sakhis formed 244 groups,
a median ten per cluster. Groups were based in individual alleys
because members were often reluctant to circulate, and the small
size of homes restricted attendance. Other considerations included
women’s need to do piecework and to care for their families. A
mean five women attended each meeting (range 2–20) and
individual women attended 15 meetings each (range 1–50).
Group members were enthusiastic about acquiring new
knowledge. They made substantial efforts to reach out to other
local women: a sample of 235 members helped 1,372 other distinct
women so that, on average, one woman reached out to six others,
particularly by providing them with information on antenatal and
newborn care, suggesting that they visit health providers, and
occasionally accompanying them. Achieving collective action was,
however, more challenging. Key activities undertaken by groups
were attempts to create local awareness, extending support to
other women, negotiating with civic authorities for amenities, and
mobilizing and sharing resources. One group succeeded in getting
the municipal corporation to cover local sewage channels, but
efforts were generally more individual than collective and involved
women’s own families and neighbourhoods. Their desire for
knowledge was tempered by time pressure and immediate
concerns such as insecurity of tenure, which limited their
inclination to get involved in wider action. There was attrition
in the numbers of groups and membership in the later phases that
attempted to broker collective strategizing. Membership was
informal and withdrawal easy when participants felt that the
commitment required would be onerous. 150 groups were
sustained to the end of the cycle and member numbers dropped
from an initial 2,948 to 656.

### Recruitment
The trial ran from 1st October 2006 to 30th September 2009.
We designated the pre-trial year of data collection a baseline
period, leaving 3 complete years for the evaluation of effect.
Figure 2 shows the trial profile.

### Baseline Comparison
Table 1 summarizes cluster size and participant characteristics.
There were insufficient births in nine clusters and we expanded
their perimeters for subsequent years. Two clusters were reduced
because of excess births. Numbers of households, population, and
births were similar in intervention and control arms. The crude
birth rate was 23 per 1,000. Mean maternal age was 24.2 y
(standard deviation [SD] 4.05) in the intervention arm and 24.6 y
(SD 4.33) in the control arm. A higher proportion of households in
the control arm followed Islam (58%, compared with 33%).
Control clusters had slightly more of the poorest quintile of women
than intervention clusters (21% compared with 20%), but also of
the least poor (23% compared with 17%). Health care practices
were similar in intervention and control arms (unpublished data).
Baseline stillbirth rates were 12.5 per thousand live births in both
arms (42/3,347 in intervention and 42/3,338 in control). Neonatal
mortality rates were 22.3 and 18.6 (63/2,845 in intervention and
50/2,712 in control).

### Impact Evaluation
The intention-to-treat analysis included 18,197 births over 3 y,
a median 379 births per cluster (interquartile range [IQR] 263–
480). For analysis of neonatal mortality rates, the vital status at

1 mo of 15,703 live-born infants was known. Analysis of other
outcomes was based on detailed interviews with 15,192 women.
We achieved interviews after 84% of births in the intervention and
83% in the control arm. Table 2 presents the findings for
behavioural and morbidity outcomes, and Figure 3 time-series
examples. We found no differences between intervention and
control arms in uptake of antenatal care, reported work, rest and
diet in later pregnancy, institutional delivery, early and exclusive
breastfeeding, or care-seeking for maternal or neonatal problems.
The occurrence of serious antenatal symptoms (premature rupture
of membranes, antepartum hemorrhage, cessation of fetal
movements, or maternal seizures) was less common in the
intervention arm. Table 3 presents the mortality findings. The
stillbirth rate was lower in the intervention arm, although this
finding was only significant after adjustment for religion,
socioeconomic status, and baseline cluster stillbirth rate (adjusted
odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.93). The neonatal mortality rate
was higher in the intervention arm, but non-significantly after
similar adjustment (1.42, 0.99–2.04). A combination of both these
outcomes, the extended perinatal mortality rate, did not differ
between arms (1.01, 0.78–1.31); Figure 4 shows an annual boxplot.
There were 20 maternal deaths in the intervention and 24 in the
control group, a combined maternal mortality ratio of 244 per


100,000 live births. We are aware of no harms associated with the
intervention.
The findings did not differ substantially when we repeated the
analysis to include only women who had lived in the trial clusters
for at least a year, when we limited it to the last 2 y of the trial, or
when we stratified by socioeconomic status (unpublished data).
When we compared a sample of 191 group members with 10,053
non-members in the intervention arm, we found that they had a
higher proportion of antenatal care in the public sector (odds ratio
1.52, 95% CI 1.06–2.20), that they were likelier to have rested
more in the third trimester of pregnancy (1.74, 1.13–2.67), and
that they were likelier to have had a postnatal check-up (1.58,
1.06–2.35). Verbal autopsies were available for 112 stillbirths and
145 neonatal deaths in the 3 y of the trial. The major causes of
neonatal mortality were prematurity (40; 27%), intrapartumrelated death (33; 23%), infection (33; 23%), and congenital
anomalies (10; 7%). There were no obvious differences between
allocation groups in the distribution of these causes.

### Discussion

In a cRCT across 48 urban slum communities of Mumbai, it
was possible to implement women’s groups in challenging

conditions. We did not, however, see substantial effects on health
care. Women in intervention clusters reported fewer sentinel
antenatal morbidities, but we lack a conceptual basis to explain
this. The lower stillbirth rate and higher neonatal mortality rate in
the intervention arm have, we think, three possible explanations.
The first is chance, or residual confounding: it is possible that
intervention and control groups differed systematically in ways
unaccounted for by our analysis. Second, the intervention may
have reduced stillbirths by encouraging timely care-seeking. It is
conceivable that some of these infants did not survive subsequently, shifting the balance of mortality from stillbirth to neonatal
death. If this was the case, we might have expected to see fewer


fresh stillbirths and more early neonatal asphyxial deaths in the
intervention arm, a finding not supported by the verbal autopsy
data (unpublished data). Third, the data collection may have itself
led to improvements in both trial arms. Given that it consisted of
birth identification and an interview at 6 wk postpartum, we think
this unlikely.
Municipal figures for the same period confirm a reduction in
mortality across the city. The positive changes seen in both
intervention and control groups are intriguing. We considered the
possibility that external initiatives might have affected intervention
and control groups, differentially or equally. Significant municipal
initiatives in the trial period included some improvement in

outreach services by community health volunteers, birth registration and pulse polio campaigns, and infectious disease surveillance.
We have cluster-specific information on concurrent non-governmental initiatives. Two NGOs were working on general health in
some clusters. We do not think that specific initiatives explain our
findings. More likely, in our opinion, was a general improvement
in environmental conditions accompanied by behaviour change.
Conditions in slum areas improved manifestly over the trial
period. Gutters were covered, sanitation block coverage increased,
housing fabric became more durable, and there was widespread
electricity supply. We think that health-related culture change is a
natural accompaniment, all the more because of aspiration and
the notions of modernity of Mumbai’s residents.
The surveillance and intervention teams were separate. Each of
the six municipal wards had a surveillance supervisor and two
investigators, responsible for data collection in all eight clusters: a
mix of intervention and control. The procedures were identical in
intervention and control clusters, and the supervisors and
investigators saw their work as unconcerned with the intervention.
It is conceivable that in intervention areas sakhis could have told
identifiers about births and deaths. We have discussed this with the
field and data management teams, and we do not think that this
happened. As local residents, the birth and death identifiers were
aware that there was an intervention in their community, but were
focused on their task and did not dwell on the comparative nature
of the trial.
The trial demonstrated the value of a counterfactual control
group and the potential weakness of ecological evaluation, the


commonest example being a before-after comparison. If we had
based our assessment on the trends in the intervention arm seen in
Figures 3 and 4 (a design used by many programs), it would have
appeared an unqualified success [36]. A fall in documented births
in the third year of the trial was partly explained by demolition of
some settlements, and by difficulties in follow-up. This illustrates a
key limitation of urban initiatives: population mobility and the fact
that, the poorer the target group, the more transient are their
homes. Public health trials would benefit from census data and
better registries. Good registration would certainly help when
outcome numbers are small and a single missed stillbirth has a
substantial effect on a rate per thousand. Our subsequent trial will
use censuses rather than prospective ascertainment.
We think that the trial raises three general issues: coverage,
target group, and the emergent pattern of health care in cities in
the South. Achieving sufficient intervention coverage has been a
challenge in other settings [6,24]. In a situation of space and time
constraint, with a lack of social cohesion despite high population
density, we did not manage to trigger diffusion of innovation.
Using population estimates for Mumbai slum areas from the most
recent National Family Health Survey (4.7 members per
household; women aged 15–49 constituting 26.7% of the
population) [26], our women’s groups at their peak involved
8%, and at their nadir 2%, of women of reproductive age
(although, as mentioned earlier, outreach communication may
have multiplied these figures by up to six times).
Convening community groups was feasible and learning and
behaviour change possible, but achieving the impetus necessary for

wider change was challenging: group members helped others
individually but balked at collective strategizing. There was
attrition in group numbers over the course of the intervention,
suggesting that women stopped attending when they felt that they
had either learned enough or were required to invest more time
and energy. Collective action was clearly a big step for groups to
take, possible challenges being time-poverty and restrictions on
movement, concerns about tenure, lack of confidence, and
perhaps a lack of conviction in perinatal health as a major issue.
Our target group were slum dwellers, but not exclusively the
poorest among them. In a city in which more than half of the
population live in slums, slum households themselves encompass a
spectrum of socioeconomic realities [16,37]. For potential
replicability, the model included municipal wards with a range
of infant mortality rates and, although restricted to slum
populations, the intervention may not have succeeded in
mobilizing the poorest and most at risk, who tend to be hardest
to reach. Although socioeconomic status was not associated with
differences in trial outcomes between intervention and control
arms, our other research in the same population has demonstrated
associations between dimensions of vulnerability and maternal and
newborn health risks [38] and we have described inequities in
access to routine maternal health services [16,39] and morbidity
care [40]. On the basis of these findings, our strategy has changed:
subsequent interventions will target the most vulnerable families


and we will intensify our efforts to improve quality of care in
private and public facilities.
The third issue was the complexity of urban health care.
Antenatal care was the norm and the nadir for institutional
delivery in trial clusters was 75%. Around 57% of antenatal care
and 30% of deliveries were in the private sector (this in a slumdwelling population). Open access to private providers, and to
institutions at all levels of the public sector hierarchy, is a challenge
to systematic health care delivery. Our findings confirmed the
tendency to bypass public maternity homes, which should handle
uncomplicated deliveries, in favour of tertiary institutions.
Women’s group discussions included clarification of appropriate
sites of consultation and considerations of price and quality,
reflected in higher use of public sector services by group members.
The study underlined the need to work on quality of care in both
public and private sectors. Although regulatory insufficiencies
make intervention difficult, quality control in the private sector
needs to feature more in debates about health care in low-income
countries.
The wider implications of our findings include a tipping of the
balance of perinatal intervention in cities toward improvement in
service quality, with an emphasis on intrapartum vigilance and
resuscitation. Indeed, there have been concerns about the utility of
cash incentives for institutional delivery in the urban context, the
argument being that access is not the primary issue. Our question

was not whether women’s groups were beneficial to their
members. Members valued the groups and their opportunities
for peer learning, showed behaviour change, and helped other
women in their communities. Exchange of knowledge about
health and health services, rights, social networks, and increased
confidence are public goods, although there are challenges in
quantifying such outcomes in public health terms. Rather, the
question was about the added value of women’s groups—over and


above activities to improve health care quality—in terms of
measurable changes in perinatal health at population level. While
acknowledging the possibility that others might be able to achieve
this through more intensive community activities in higher
mortality settings, our own programme did not show effect.
Community groups will feature in our subsequent interventions, as
they must in any participatory initiative. We will, however,
attempt to integrate them more strongly with pro-poorest

targeting, service provision at household level, strengthening of
links between communities and service providers, and partnerships
with public and private sector providers to improve quality of care.

### Editors’ Summary

Background. Substantial progress is being made to reduce
global child mortality (deaths of children before the age of 5
years) and maternal mortality (deaths among women
because of complications of pregnancy and childbirth)—
two of the Millennium Development Goals agreed by world
leaders in 2000 to end extreme poverty. Even so, worldwide,
in 2010, 7.6 million children died before their fifth birthday
and there were nearly 360,000 maternal deaths. Almost all
child and maternal deaths occur in developing countries—a
fifth of under-five deaths and more than a quarter of
neonatal deaths (deaths during the first month of life, which
account for two-fifths of all child deaths) occur in India alone.
Moreover, most child and maternal deaths are caused by
avoidable conditions. Specifically, the major causes of
neonatal death—complications of preterm delivery, breathing problems during or after delivery, and infections of the
blood (sepsis) and lungs (pneumonia)—and of maternal
deaths—hemorrhage (abnormal bleeding), sepsis, unsafe
abortion, obstructed labor, and hypertensive diseases of
pregnancy—could all be largely prevented by improved
access to reproductive health services and skilled health care
workers.

Why Was This Study Done? Experts believe that
improvements to maternal and newborn health in lowincome settings require both health service strengthening
and community action. That is, the demand for better
services, driven by improved knowledge about maternal and
newborn health (perinatal issues), has to be increased in
parallel with the supply of those services. To date,
community mobilization around perinatal issues has largely
been undertaken in rural settings but populations in
developing countries are becoming increasingly urban. In
India, for example, 30% of the population now lives in cities.
In this cluster randomized controlled trial (a study in which
groups of people are randomly assigned to receive alternative interventions and the outcomes in the differently
treated ‘‘clusters’’ are compared), City Initiative for Newborn
Health (CINH) researchers investigate the effect of an
intervention designed to help women’s groups in the slums
of Mumbai work towards improving local perinatal health.
The CINH aims to improve maternal and newborn health in
slum communities by improving public health care provision
and by working with community members to improve
maternal and newborn care practices and care-seeking
behaviors.

What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers
enrolled 48 Mumbai slum communities of at least 1,000
households into their trial. In each of the 24 intervention
clusters, a facilitator supported local women’s groups
through a 36-meeting learning cycle during which group
members discussed their perinatal experiences, improved
their knowledge, and took action. To measure the effect of
the intervention, the researchers monitored births, stillbirths,
and neonatal deaths in all the clusters and interviewed
mothers 6 weeks after delivery. During the 3-year trial, there
were 18,197 births in the participating settlements. The


women in the intervention clusters were enthusiastic about
acquiring new knowledge and made substantial efforts to
reach out to other women but were less successful in
undertaking collective action such as negotiations with civic
authorities for more amenities. There were no differences
between the intervention and control communities in the
uptake of antenatal care, reported work, rest, and diet in late
pregnancy, institutional delivery, or in breast feeding and
care-seeking behavior. Finally, the combined rate of stillbirths and neonatal deaths (the extended perinatal mortality
rate) was the same in both arms of the trial, as was maternal
mortality.

What Do These Findings Mean? These findings indicate
that it is possible to facilitate the discussion of perinatal
health care by urban women’s groups in the challenging
conditions that exist in the slums of Mumbai. However, they
fail to show any measureable effect of community mobilization through the facilitation of women’s groups on
perinatal health at the population level. The researchers
acknowledge that more intensive community activities that
target the poorest, most vulnerable slum dwellers might
produce measurable effects on perinatal mortality, and they
conclude that, in cities with multiple sources of health care
and inequitable access to services, it remains important to
integrate community mobilization with attempts to deliver
services to the poorest and most vulnerable, and with
initiatives to improve the quality of health care in both the
public and private sector.
