### Summary
**Background Community mobilisation through participatory women’s groups might improve birth outcomes in poor**
**rural communities. We therefore assessed this approach in a largely tribal and rural population in three districts in**
**eastern India.**

**Methods From 36 clusters in Jharkhand and Orissa, with an estimated population of 228 186, we assigned 18 clusters**
**to intervention or control using stratifi ed randomisation. Women were eligible to participate if they were aged**
**15–49 years, residing in the project area, and had given birth during the study. In intervention clusters, a facilitator**
**convened 13 groups every month to support participatory action and learning for women, and facilitated the**
**development and implementation of strategies to address maternal and newborn health problems. The primary**
**outcomes were reductions in neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and maternal depression scores. Analysis was by intention**
**to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number**
**ISRCTN21817853.**

**Findings After baseline surveillance of 4692 births, we monitored outcomes for 19 030 births during 3 years (2005–08).**
**NMRs per 1000 were 55·6, 37·1, and 36·3 during the fi rst, second, and third years, respectively, in intervention**
**clusters, and 53·4, 59·6, and 64·3, respectively, in control clusters. NMR was 32% lower in intervention clusters**
**adjusted for clustering, stratifi cation, and baseline diff erences (odds ratio 0·68, 95% CI 0·59–0·78) during the 3 years,**
**and 45% lower in years 2 and 3 (0·55, 0·46–0·66). Although we did not note a signifi cant eff ect on maternal depression**
**overall, reduction in moderate depression was 57% in year 3 (0·43, 0·23–0·80).**

**Interpretation This intervention could be used with or as a potential alternative to health-worker-led interventions,**
**and presents new opportunities for policy makers to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes in poor**
**populations.**

### Introduction
Every year, an estimated 3·7 million children worldwide
die in the fi rst month of life.[1,2] Global progress in
reduction of maternal and child mortality rates is
insuffi cient—only 16 of 68 countries are on track to
achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 (reduction of
mortality rate in children <5 years by two-thirds between
1990–2015).[3] India accounts for 20% of maternal deaths
worldwide, 21% of all child (<5 years) deaths, and 25% of
all neonatal deaths.[4] Urgent eff orts are needed to reduce
these mortality rates quickly through cost-eff ective and
scalable interventions.
Large improvements were noted in birth outcomes in a
poor rural population in Makwanpur, Nepal, after a lowcost, potentially sustainable, and scalable participatory
intervention with women’s groups.[5] Newborn mortality
rates were 30% lower in intervention areas than in control
areas (odds ratio 0·70, 95% CI 0·53–0·94).[5] Local female
facilitators assisted women’s groups every month to
consider the causes and underlying problems leading to


maternal and newborn deaths, develop practical strategies
with community leaders and men, and implement and
assess the outcomes of these strategies. This communityaction cycle, adapted from a programme developed in
Bolivia, created health and non-health benefi ts at low
cost.[6]

Maternal depression is an increasing public health
concern in low-income countries because of its high
prevalence and wide-ranging implications for the health
of the mother and infant.[7] Delivery of appropriate
interventions to prevent or treat maternal depression
through health workers is a major challenge in countries
with under-resourced health systems, and community
groups assisted by non-health-care workers might have
some advantage in helping the poorest women.[8]

Jharkhand and Orissa are two of the poorest states in
eastern India. About 40% of their total combined
population lives below the poverty line.[9] The average life
expectancy among women in both states is about 60 years,
and an estimated 63% are illiterate [10] Neonatal mortality


-----

rate (NMR) per 1000 livebirths is 49 in Jharkhand and 45
in Orissa, and maternal mortality ratio per 100 000
livebirths is 371 and 358, respectively.[11,12] These are
disproportionately higher than India’s national estimates
of 39 per 1000 for NMR and 301 per 100 000 for maternal
mortality ratio.[11,12]

More than 20% of Jharkhand and Orissa’s population is
affi liated with Scheduled Tribes (or Adivasi—ie, indigenous
groups), and about 12% with scheduled castes.[13] Despite
calls for inclusive development, Adivasi communities
remain underserved—their employment rate is roughly
half that of non-indigenous people, and nearly a third of
Adivasi children in Jharkhand and Orissa do not receive
primary education.[12,13] Indigenous communities also have
higher mortality rates and poorer access to health services
than do the non-indigenous populations.[14]

We hypothesised that a participatory intervention with
women’s groups could reduce neonatal mortality by at
least 25% in underserved tribal communities of eastern
India, and improve home-care practices and healthseeking behaviour of pregnant and postnatal women,
and their family members; and that the women’s group
intervention could reduce maternal depression in the
intervention areas by 30%.

### Methods
#### Study location and population
Our study was done in three contiguous districts of
Jharkhand and Orissa—Saraikela Kharswan, West
Singhbhum, and Keonjhar (fi gure 1). The proportion of
Adivasis within the study clusters was 58–70%. Eligible
participants were women aged 15–49 years, residing in
the project area, and who had given birth during the
study (July 31, 2005, to July 30, 2008). The study
population was an open cohort—ie, women could enter
the study at any time during the trial period if they had
given birth. Women who chose to participate gave their
consent (written or left-thumb print) and were free to
decline an interview at any time. Women who were
identifi ed by interviewers as having symptoms of
severe depression were referred to the nearest tertiary
mental health centre at Ranchi. Ethical approval was
obtained from an independent ethical committee in
Jamshedpur, India.

#### Randomisation
We identifi ed 12 rural clusters per district, with a mean
population of 6338 per cluster (range 3605–7467). The
estimated population in these 36 clusters was 228 186 (on
the basis of the 2001 Indian census projections).[15] In
18 clusters, existing women’s groups were involved in
savings and credit activities (seven in West Singhbhum,
three in Saraikela Kharswan, and eight in Keonjhar). In
the fi rst district (West Singhbhum), an external
observer from a partner non-governmental organisation
(Professional Assistance for Development Action) drew
folded papers with numbers corresponding to clusters

with existing groups from a basket. The fi rst four clusters
were allocated to the intervention group, the rest to the
control group. This process was repeated for clusters
without women’s groups and in the other two districts in
the presence of external observers (fi gure 2). We chose
this method because of simplicity and visibility, which
were necessary to convince local communities that the
process was transparent. Because of the nature of the
intervention, neither the intervention team nor the
participants were masked to group assignment during
the trial

**_Figure 3: Surveillance system_**


**_Panel 1: Defi nitions_**

- Miscarriage: cessation of a presumptive pregnancy before
22 weeks of gestation before delivery of the baby’s head[17]

- Neonatal death: death of a liveborn infant within
28 completed days of birth

- Early neonatal deaths: deaths arising within 6 completed
days

- Late neonatal deaths: deaths arising from 7 to
28 completed days of birth

- Perinatal death: a stillbirth or an early neonatal death

- Maternal death: death of a woman while pregnant or
within 42 days of cessation of pregnancy from any cause
related to the pregnancy or its management, but not
from accidental causes


In September, 2004, we met with gram sabhas (village
councils), headmen, and representatives from panchayats
(elected representatives for basic governance) in the three
districts. These representatives granted permission to
start surveillance of births and deaths, and to work with
women’s groups.

#### Surveillance
A surveillance system with key informants was
established in the three districts. Figure 3 shows this
system, and Barnett and colleagues[16] describe it in detail.
One key informant, usually a traditional birth attendant
or active village member, was responsible for about
250 households, and reported any births, maternal or
newborn deaths and deaths in women of reproductive


age every month within their allocated area. The key
informant met with an interviewer once a month who
verifi ed births and interviewed all identifi ed mothers to
gather information about their sociodemographic
characteristics, pregnancy, delivery, and postnatal period
through a structured questionnaire about 6 weeks after
delivery. As additional checks for the identifi cation
stage, all women identifi ed were asked to locate any
others of reproductive age who had recently given birth
or died in the study area. Every district had 12
interviewers, one interviewer supervisor, and a district
manager. The monitoring manager supervised fi eldbased activities in all three districts and data entry at the
head offi ce. The intervention and surveillance teams
were partitioned—interviewers and facilitators belonged
to diff erent villages, their training was done separately,
and they had review meetings on separate days.
In the event of a stillbirth or neonatal death (panel 1),
the interviewer administered a questionnaire and did a
verbal autopsy with the mother and other individuals
present at the time of death; the verbal autopsy included
free text in which the mother was asked to narrate the
details of events leading to the death of the neonate. For
deaths among women of reproductive age, the
interviewer spoke to family members to ascertain the
age of the woman, cause of death, and whether she was
pregnant or had recently given birth. In the event of a
maternal death, the monitoring supervisors, initially
accompanied by a physician, did verbal autopsies with a
relative who was present at the time of the death.
Supervisors completed a standard questionnaire with
free text for elaboration of the sequence of events before
the death. Verbal autopsies for maternal deaths were
done by a physician (n=11), interviewer supervisor
(n=96), or district manager (n=2).
Maternal depression was included as a trial outcome in
the second year of the study because of delays in
identifi cation of a contextually appropriate scale. We used
the Kessler-10 item scale (K10), a questionnaire for the
detection of common mental disorders in community
settings, that has been used in India and World Mental
Health Surveys.[18–20] A psychiatrist (RL) did three training
sessions of 2 days each for groups of 12–15 interviewers
that consisted of administration of the K10 questionnaire,
aspects of understanding depression and body language,
association between physical health and mental health,
active listening skills, and confi dentiality.

#### Clusters and coverage of women’s groups
In the 18 intervention clusters, we used a participatory
action cycle with 172 existing groups and created an
additional 72 groups. Coverage of Ekjut groups was one
group per 468 population. In year 1, 546 (18%) of 3119
newly pregnant women attended the groups, rising to
1718 (55%) of 3126 in year 3. We recorded 111 006 group
attendances over 3 years. 74 715 (67%) of these were from
married women of reproductive age 15030 (14%) from


-----

adolescent girls, 10 452 (9%) from men, and 10 809 (10%)
from elderly women.

#### Women’s group intervention
Every group met monthly for a total of 20 meetings,
and a local woman, selected on the basis of criteria
(including speaking the local language and having the
ability to travel to meetings) identifi ed by the
community, facilitated the meetings. After a 7-day
residential training course to review the cycle’s
contents, and to practice participatory communication
techniques, facilitators were given support through
fortnightly meetings with district coordinators.
Facilitators coordinated an average of 13 meetings every
month with as many groups.
Groups took part in a participatory learning and action
cycle (fi gure 4). Community members who were not
regular group members were also encouraged to
participate in discussions. Information about clean
delivery practices and care-seeking behaviour was shared
through stories and games, rather than presented as key
messages. By discussion of case studies imparted
through contextually appropriate stories, group members
identifi ed and prioritised maternal and newborn health
problems in the community, collectively selected relevant
strategies to address these problems, implemented the
strategies, and assessed the results. Although some
strategies were common, each group was free to
implement its own combination of strategies. The
intervention team adapted facilitation materials from
the study in Makwanpur, Nepal, to guide the meetings.[5]
Groups used methods such as picture-card games, role
play, and story-telling to help discussions about the
causes and eff ects of typical problems in mothers and
infants, and devised strategies for prevention, homecare support, and consultations (fi gure 5).

#### Health-service inputs
We formed health committees in all intervention and
control clusters so that community members would have
the opportunity to express their opinions about the
design and management of local health services. About
ten village representatives within every cluster met once
every 2 months and used a structured action cycle to
discuss maternal and newborn health entitlement issues.
As a result, committee members became more
knowledgable about the government health system and
assisted with the formation of village health committees
as part of the National Rural Health Mission programme.[21]
In addition to the creation of cluster-level health
committees, we provided workshops for appreciative
inquiry with frontline government health staff from
seven clusters per district in Jharkhand.[22] Participants
assessed the programme qualitatively at the end of every
training session. We expected that any improvement in
performance or service quality would be equal in
intervention and control clusters

#### Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcomes were reductions in NMR and
maternal depression scores. Secondary outcomes were
stillbirths, maternal and perinatal deaths, uptake of
antenatal and delivery services, home-care practices
during and after delivery, and health-care-seeking
behaviour (seeking care from qualified providers in the

#### Quality control of data
Data were double-entered in an electronic database.
Surveillance supervisors manually checked information
provided by key informants and interviewers. The fi eld
surveillance manager, data input offi cer, and data
manager undertook manual and systematic data
checks.

#### Statistical analysis
We did not expect the intervention to have adverse
eff ects at cluster or participant level, and therefore did
not have any rules for stopping the intervention. In
December, 2007, we presented fi ndings from a
preliminary analysis to an independent data safety
committee. After an interim analysis in 2007, the
committee recommended that the trial continue for a
total of 3 years to enable comparison with the
Makwanpur study,[5] in which the eff ect was measured
from 9 months after the beginning of the intervention
to allow exposure to the women’s groups in pregnancy.
The data safety committee also noted that 3 years would


allow analysis of possible seasonal variations in NMR.
The committee undertook a fi nal review of the data in
December, 2008.
Our prospective surveillance from Nov 21, 2004, to
July 30, 2005, showed a baseline NMR of 58 per
1000 livebirths (261 deaths per 4509 livebirths) and
maternal mortality ratio of 510 per 100 000 (23 deaths
per 4509 livebirths). The trial was planned for 3 years
and was originally powered, like the Makwanpur trial,[5]
for a 2-year analysis of birth outcomes, after allowing a
period of up to 1 year for the women’s groups to be
established and for pregnant women to be given the
intervention. We assumed a between-cluster correlation
coeffi cient of variation (k) of 0·15–0·25, and about
324 births per cluster during 2 years. On the basis of
10% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 18 clusters per
group resulted in 64–81% power to detect a 25% reduction
in NMR. With an estimated baseline prevalence of 15%
and _k of 0·3, the study had 79–81% power to detect a_
30% reduction in maternal depression over 1 year. We
used data for recorded births during the study to
estimate that the study had a power of 92% to detect a
25% reduction in NMR.
Analysis was by intention to treat at cluster and
participant levels. We excluded data from mothers who
migrated out of the region and their infants from
intention-to-treat analyses since many of these women
probably came into the clusters at the time of delivery
and would therefore not have been exposed to the
intervention in pregnancy. We aimed to do the tests of
signifi cance for our primary and secondary outcomes on
the basis of previously agreed hypotheses about the likely
eff ect of the intervention. For comparison of mortality
outcome, we used multivariate logistic regression with
random eff ects on individual-level data in Stata (version
10.0).[23] We compared secondary indicators using
generalised estimating equations models with semirobust
SEs at the cluster level.[23] Generalised estimating equations
models were used for secondary indicators and categorical
scores of maternal depression because these outcomes
had high intracluster correlation coeffi cients (>0·30). We
compared K10 scores grouped in three categories
(none/mild, moderate, or severe) during years 2 and 3 of
the trial. This method was chosen in favour of linear
regression to address the data’s strong positive skewness.
We adjusted for stratifi cation by including strata as
variables in the regression analyses, and for multiple
hypothesis testing by adjusting the p values for the
primary outcomes using the Holm correction in the
results tables. We did not adjust for clustering at the level
of the mother. All results are presented as odds ratios
with 95% CIs.

#### Cost-eff ectiveness analysis
We used a similar method of cost-eff ectiveness analysis
as used by Borghi and colleagues.[24] Costs were estimated
at 2007 prices and were calculated separately for the


-----

women’s group intervention and activities for healthservice strengthening. These were the fi nancial and
economic costs of setting up the intervention, and
running costs during the trial. Costs were estimated
from the perspective of a provider to give an indication
of the potential costs of replication for the government
and interested agencies, and discounted at 3%.
Incremental cost eff ectiveness was measured in relation
to a do-nothing alternative.
This study is registered as an International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN21817853.

#### Role of the funding source
The funders had no role in the design of the study, data
collection, data analysis, interpretation, or writing up of
the fi ndings, although they made a site visit early in the
study implementation. The corresponding author had
access to all the data and had fi nal responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.

### Results
Figure 6 shows the trial profi le. All 18 selected clusters
had the intervention. Loss to follow-up after birth as a
result of migration or refusal of interview was 86 (<1%)
of 9770 women in intervention clusters and 173 (2%) of
9260 in control clusters. In the study areas, 5661 (37%) of
15 118 home deliveries were by a relative, friend, or
neighbour, 5368 (36%) by traditional birth attendants,
and 1913 (13%) by husbands.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of identifi ed
births during 9 months of data gathering from Nov 21,
2004, to July 30, 2005. Numbers of births were similar in
intervention and control clusters, but diff erences were
noted in household assets, maternal education, literacy,
and tribal membership, with women in the intervention
clusters being generally poorer and more disadvantaged
than those in the control clusters (table 1).
NMRs unadjusted for clustering decreased from year 1
to year 3 in the intervention clusters compared with an
increase in the control clusters (table 2).
We noted a 32% reduction in NMR during the 3-year
trial when data were adjusted for clustering,
stratifi cation, and baseline diff erences (table 3). NMR
was reduced by 45% in intervention clusters compared
with control clusters during the last 2 years (table 3).
The reduction in NMR was still signifi cant when
migrated mothers and their babies were excluded from
the intention-to-treat analyses during the 3 years
(table 3). _k, estimated from retrospective data from_
control clusters, was 0·10 when we took stratifi cation
into account, and corresponded to an intracluster
correlation coeffi cient of 0·0005.[23] In the analysis of
neonatal mortality data at the cluster level, the risk ratio
was 0·71 (95% CI 0·57–0·90, p=0·0011) for years 1 to
3 when adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing with
the Holm procedure and unadjusted for baseline
differences


After year 1, NMRs were considerably lower in the
intervention clusters than in the control clusters (fi gure 7).
In the third year of the study, NMR was almost half in the
intervention clusters compared with the control clusters
(odds ratio 0·53, 95% CI 0·41–0·68, adjusted for
clustering and stratifi cation only), much larger than the
fi ndings of the Makwanpur trial in Nepal.[5] Figure 8 shows
the cluster-level changes in NMR between baseline and

**_Table 3: Comparison of mortality rates in intervention and control clusters_**


year 3—the NMRs fell below their baseline level in most
intervention clusters. Between 2005 and 2008, perinatal
mortality rates in the intervention clusters decreased
compared with those in the control clusters when
adjusted for clustering (table 2; table 3). Stillbirth rates
did not diff er between intervention and control clusters
(table 2). Maternal mortality ratio was generally lower in
intervention than in control clusters, but the study was
not powered to detect signifi cant diff erences (table 3).
Qualitative evidence from the assessment of the trial’s
process showed that community mobilisation through


women’s groups might have contributed to avoidance of
some maternal deaths (panel 2).
There was no detectable diff erence in maternal
depression K10 scores, when measured about 6 weeks
after delivery, between intervention and control clusters
in year 2 of the study or overall (table 4). However, in
year 3, when 55% of all pregnant women in the
intervention clusters had joined a group, a 57% reduction
was noted in moderate depression among mothers in
the intervention clusters compared with control clusters
(table 4)


-----

No signifi cant diff erences were noted in health-careseeking behaviour between control and intervention
clusters (table 5). However, home-care practices showed
substantial improvements—in intervention clusters,
birth attendants were more likely to wash their hands,
use a safe delivery kit and a plastic sheet, and boil the
thread used to tie the cord than were those in the control
clusters. The proportion of infants exclusively breastfed
at 6 weeks was higher in intervention areas in adjusted
analyses for years 2 and 3.
Cause-specifi c diff erences in mortality rate as a
percentage of all causes—septicaemia, birth asphyxia,
hypothermia, and prematurity—during the 3 years were
not clearly discernable because there was a reduction in
all causes (table 6). The incremental cost of the women’s
group intervention was US$910 per newborn life saved,
increasing to $1308 (in 2007 prices) when health-service
strengthening activities were included. The incremental
cost per life-year saved was $33 for the women’s group
intervention ($48 inclusive of health-service strengthening activities). The women’s group inter vention in
this setting was therefore more cost eff ective than that
reported in Nepal[5] as a result of the greater eff ect of
women’s groups on NMR combined with lower
operating costs in the current context.

### Discussion
Women’s groups led by peer facilitators reduced NMR
and moderate maternal depression at low cost in largely
tribal, rural populations of eastern India. Our data show
that mortality reduction in underserved rural settings
was not associated with increased care-seeking
behaviour or health-service use. The most likely
mechanism of mortality reduction was through
improved hygiene and care practices. The availability of
safe delivery kits increased in both control and
intervention areas, but women’s groups seemed to
generate more demand in intervention clusters than in
control clusters. In places where kits were not provided,
group members made them and provided information
about their contents to mothers, then visited pregnant
women during the eighth month of pregnancy to ensure
that they had received kits and would use them. Birth
outcomes might have been aff ected by the fact that
these community members attended the groups or
were advised by group members, thus generating
increased social awareness and support for clean
delivery practices.
The most striking reduction in mortality rate was noted
in early neonatal deaths, which might be explained by the
strong focus on intrapartum and early neonatal periods
in several case studies and stories discussed during the
cycle. Attribution of cause of newborn death on the basis
of verbal autopsy is an imperfect science, and deaths
might arise from several and overlapping causes. Early
septicaemia could have been reduced with clean delivery
practices and premature babies might have survived

**strategies to avoid maternal deaths**

A woman in the eighth month of her pregnancy, and her
mother-in-law attended a monthly women’s group
meeting where they participated in a drill based on what to
do in the event of post-partum bleeding. After a month,
when the woman delivered at home and had severe
bleeding, her mother-in-law remembered what had been
said in the group, and, without wasting time, asked her
daughter-in-law to breastfeed the baby while she rushed to
get money from the group and asked her son to arrange for
a vehicle. The daughter-in-law was immediately taken to
the district hospital, where she was given medicines,
intravenous fl uid, and two pints of blood, and was
discharged after 15 days.


with improved care. The reason for this combined
reduction of asphyxia, prematurity, and septicaemia
could also be improved intrapartum care. Potential
mechanisms for reduction of mortality rate will be
further assessed in future analyses of verbal autopsies
and seasonal mortality trends.
Our fi ndings also show that a low-cost intervention
involving non-health-care workers might affect maternal


-----

mental health. We hypothesise that the large reduction
in moderate depression seen in the third year could
have occurred through improvements in social support
and problem-solving skills of the groups. Adequate
social support reduces the risk of depression during
pregnancy and is an important social determinant of
mental health [25] In meetings information was shared


about the diffi culties encountered by mothers in the
community, and practical ways to collectively address
them were established. Group meetings also
strengthened problem-solving skills, a component of
psychotherapeutic interventions that has been shown to
aff ect depression in other settings.[26] The intervention
seemed to have no effect on severe depression perhaps


-----

because it was more similar to primary prevention
rather than treatment, or because severe depression is
less amenable to psychotherapeutic interventions. A
complete analysis and discussion of these fi ndings will
be presented in the future.
Two potential eff ect modifi ers in this trial, on the basis
of evidence, were diff erences in maternal education, and
tribal membership and assets between the intervention
and control populations. These were taken into account
in adjusted analyses and mainly provided an advantage
for the control areas. Additionally, the high signifi cance
of some of our results could be a result of an increase in
mortality rate in the control areas between 2005–08. The
control and intervention clusters were in similar
geographic areas, so factors that aff ected NMR should
have aff ected both groups equally, but further
investigation is needed.
We believe that the study had two main weaknesses.
First, as in several other community-based randomised
control trials, the intervention and surveillance teams
were not unaware of allocation. However, there were no
incentives or disincentives for over-reporting or underreporting births and deaths, and several process
mechanisms were in place to detect errors. Second,
although migration out of districts was common, we
cannot rule out some intercluster migration when
women married out of their home cluster. Our intentionto-treat analysis might have aff ected the results positively
or negatively.
In the Shivgarh study,[27] in Uttar Pradesh, India, the eff ect
of an intensive behaviour-change programme involving
community meetings and home visits by a new cadre of
paid, non-governmental community workers in a
population of 104 123 during 15 months resulted in a 54%
reduction (relative risk 0·46, 95% CI 0·35–0·60) in NMR
with changes in home-care practices, but no real change in
care-seeking behaviour. No overall diff erences in NMR
were noted during 30 months of intervention in the
Projahnmo trial,[28] in Bangladesh, but a 34% reduction
(0·66, 0·47–0·93) was noted in the home-care group in the
last 6 months of the programme. The investigators of the
Projahnmo study[28] noted that “Availability of referral
services and a strong supervisory system were crucial to
this intervention and would be a necessary feature of
scaling up the intervention.”
Interventions with health-worker home visits have
rarely achieved adequate coverage, quality, or eff ectiveness
when taken to scale in poor populations.[29] Participatory
groups have the advantage of helping the poorest, being
scalable at low cost, and producing potentially wideranging and long-lasting eff ects. By addressing critical
consciousness,[30] groups have the potential to create
improved capability in communities to deal with the
health and development diffi culties arising from poverty
and social inequalities.[31] The intervention requires a
training and support structure to manage facilitators in
charge of 12–14 groups per month with every group


responsible for a population of about 500 and for
recruiting up to half of newly pregnant women. Costs are
lower than for most other primary health-care
interventions, and these interventions can complement
existing self-help groups in the community.
Two other issues arising from our study are cost
eff ectiveness and the eff ect on maternal mortality ratios.
The interventions in the Ekjut trial were more cost
eff ective than those in the Makwanpur study[5] because of
lower operating costs and greater eff ect of the
intervention. In the Nepal trial, eff ect of women’s groups
on maternal mortality ratios was signifi cant, although
the number of deaths was small and maternal mortality
ratio was not a stated primary outcome. In our trial the
maternal mortality ratio was higher in the intervention
areas at baseline, and 20% lower after 3 years of
intervention, but this diff erence was not signifi cant and
the trial was not powered to measure diff erences in
maternal mortality. Reduction in maternal mortality will
depend mainly on improved access to health services
and to life-saving drugs, but community mobilisation
could help through improvement in hygiene at delivery
and early care-seeking behaviour for complications by
addressing the fi rst-delay component.
This participatory intervention with women’s groups
could complement or be a potential alternative to healthworker led interventions, two examples of which have
been discussed here. Our fi ndings raise several important
issues for policy makers in India. Could federal and state
governments invest in this programme? Should
government or non-government organisations be
responsible for its scale-up? Could such a participatory
intervention support and strengthen the National Rural
Health Mission’s mandate of communitisation of health
and the Accredited Social Health Activist programme?[32]
Further assessments of this approach will involve a
scale-up in large populations with little access to health
services, and diff erent delivery mechanisms of the
intervention will need to be tested in partnership with
government and non-government organisations.
