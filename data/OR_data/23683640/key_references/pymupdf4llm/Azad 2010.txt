### Summary
**Background Two recent trials have shown that women’s groups can reduce neonatal mortality in poor communities.**
**We assessed the eff ectiveness of a scaled-up development programme with women’s groups to address maternal and**
**neonatal care in three rural districts of Bangladesh.**

**Methods 18 clusters (with a mean population of 27 953 [SD 5953]) in three districts were randomly assigned to either**
**intervention or control (nine clusters each) by use of stratifi ed randomisation. For each district, cluster names were**
**written on pieces of paper, which were folded and placed in a bottle. The fi rst three cluster names drawn from the**
**bottle were allocated to the intervention group and the remaining three to control. All clusters received health services**
**strengthening and basic training of traditional birth attendants. In intervention clusters, a facilitator convened**
**18 groups every month to support participatory action and learning for women, and to develop and implement**
**strategies to address maternal and neonatal health problems. Women were eligible to participate if they were aged**
**15–49 years, residing in the project area, and had given birth during the study period (Feb 1, 2005, to Dec 31, 2007).**
**Neither study investigators nor participants were masked to treatment assignment. In a population of 229 195 people**
**(intervention clusters only), 162 women’s groups provided coverage of one group per 1414 population. The primary**
**outcome was neonatal mortality rate (NMR). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an**
**International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN54792066.**

**Findings We monitored outcomes for 36 113 births (intervention clusters, n=17 514; control clusters, n=18 599) in a**
**population of 503 163 over 3 years. From 2005 to 2007, there were 570 neonatal deaths in the intervention clusters and**
**656 in the control clusters. Cluster-level mean NMR (adjusted for stratifi cation and clustering) was 33·9 deaths per**
**1000 livebirths in the intervention clusters compared with 36·5 per 1000 in the control clusters (risk ratio 0·93,**
**95% CI 0·80–1·09).**

**Interpretation For participatory women’s groups to have a signifi cant eff ect on neonatal mortality in rural Bangladesh,**
**detailed attention to programme design and contextual factors, enhanced population coverage, and increased**
**enrolment of newly pregnant women might be needed.**

### Introduction
An estimated 3·7 million neonatal deaths occur
worldwide every year,[1] 98% of which are in developing
countries. In Bangladesh, the neonatal mortality rate
(NMR) declined from 63 per 1000 livebirths in 1985–89 to
34 per 1000 in 2002–06.[2–4] A recent survey showed that
around 85% of births occur at home.[5] Since around 45%
of deaths in children under 5 years of age in Bangladesh
occur in the fi rst month of life, further progress in
reducing neonatal mortality is essential to achieve
Millennium Development Goal 4 (to reduce child
mortality by two-thirds by 2015).[6] This progress would
require community-based interventions to improve the
supply and demand for maternal and neonatal care.
We tested a low-cost, participatory, community-based
approach to improving birth outcomes in rural areas in
two cluster-randomised controlled trials: the first in


Makwanpur, Nepal (2001–03),[7] and the second in
Jharkhand and Orissa, India (2005–08).[8] Participatory
women’s groups reduced neonatal mortality by 30% in
Nepal over years 2 and 3 and by 32% in rural India over
the 3-year study period. We also assessed a similar
approach in a larger population within three rural
districts of Bangladesh.[9] We recruited local female peer
facilitators who undertook twice as many meetings than
did facilitators in the Nepal trial (18 vs nine) and covered
a population two to fi ve times larger. We also introduced
a key informant system to monitor maternal and
neonatal mortality rates with detailed interviews or
verbal autopsies for all births, neonatal deaths, and
maternal deaths.[10] Our aim was to test the generalisability
and scalability of this community-based participatory
approach with women’s groups. A cluster-randomised
design was used in the trial because the women’s group

intervention was implemented at a community rather
than individual level.


Women were eligible to participate in the study if they
were aged 15–49 years, residing in the project area, and
had given birth during the study period (Feb 1, 2005, to
Dec 31, 2007). The study population was an open cohort—
ie, women could enter the study at any time during the
trial period if they had given birth. Data was obtained for
all eligible women throughout the study period.
Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics
committees of BADAS and the University College
London Institute of Child Health. Women who chose to
participate in the study during the baseline survey and
the period of prospective surveillance gave verbal consent
and were free to decline an interview at any time.

#### Randomisation and masking
Each district constituted one stratum and each union a
cluster (see webappendix p 2). 18 unions (six per district)
were selected. The total population within these
18 unions was 503 163 people, with union sizes ranging
from 15 441 to 35 110. Unions were randomly allocated to
either intervention or control groups by district in the
presence of four project staff (including the project
director and project manager) and two external
individuals (Nazmun Nahar, Department of Paediatrics,
Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, and Azad Khan, BADAS,
Dhaka). For each district, cluster names were written on
pieces of paper, which were folded and placed in a bottle.
The fi rst three cluster names drawn from the bottle
were allocated to the women’s group intervention and
the remaining three to control. The project manager
drew the papers from the bottle. The allocation sequence
was decided upon by the project team before drawing
the papers and was based on clusters rather than
individuals. Clusters had been pre-identifi ed by the
team on the basis of previously mentioned criteria.
The control clusters included three tea garden estates
that had substantially worse health and socioeconomic
indicators than did the rest of the study area. In these
areas, surveillance started late because of entry
restrictions. We did not know about the entry diffi culties
and high mortality rates before the recruitment and
allocation of clusters and therefore did not exclude these
areas before allocation. Additionally, about 10% of
mothers in our study area were temporary residents and
mainly came into the cluster areas to give birth, since the
tradition is for women to go to their mothers’ home just
before delivery. These temporary residents were not
exposed to the women’s group intervention, and often
had returned to their marital homes outside the study
area before the post-natal interview.
In a second-level randomisation, the randomised
clusters were further randomly assigned by the same
method to traditional birth attendant intervention or
control groups. Of the nine women’s group intervention
clusters, fi ve became traditional birth attendant
intervention clusters and four became controls. The nine
women’s group control clusters were randomised so that

### Methods
#### Study design, location, and population
We assessed two interventions in the same study area
using a factorial design against a common background of
health services strengthening: fi rst, a community-based
intervention with participatory women’s groups to
improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes; second,
an intervention that involved training traditional birth
attendants in bag-valve-mask resuscitation of neonates
with symptoms of birth asphyxia.
Three districts, Bogra, Faridpur, and Moulavibazar,
were selected by use of purposive sampling from three
diff erent divisions in Bangladesh on the basis of the
districts having active Diabetic Association of Bangladesh
(BADAS) offi ces (webappendix p 1). Within these
districts, subdistricts (upazilas) and unions (the lowestlevel administrative units in rural Bangladesh) were also
purposefully sampled by use of recommendations from
BADAS representatives, the main criteria being perceived
limited access to perinatal health care in those unions,
and a feasible travelling distance from BADAS district
headquarters.
We approached community leaders and obtained their
permission to establish women’s groups in the
intervention clusters in 2004. 451 community orientation
meetings were undertaken with the chairmen and
members of union councils and community members.
The team also undertook 451 village mapping exercises
to identify the location of health facilities and social and
religious meeting places


-----

four received the traditional birth attendant intervention
and fi ve became controls. Overall, for this second-level
randomisation, there were nine traditional birth attendant
intervention groups and nine control clusters
(webappendix p 2).
The randomisation process was done before the
collection and analysis of baseline data, and none of the
staff attending the randomisation process had any previous
knowledge of the health and socioeconomic status of the
chosen union clusters. Neither the study investigators nor
the participants were masked to group allocation.

#### Women’s group intervention
Women’s group facilitators visited every tenth household
within the intervention clusters and invited married
women of reproductive age to join the groups. The
groups initially only included women of reproductive age
but others joined later because group members requested
that mothers-in-law, adolescents, and other women
should also attend.
Women’s groups were facilitated by a local female peer
facilitator who acted as a catalyst for community
mobilisation. Every facilitator was responsible for
18 groups. Facilitators received fi ve training sessions that
covered participatory modes of communication and
maternal and neonatal health issues. The role of the
facilitator was to activate and strengthen groups, to
support them in identifying and prioritising maternal
and neonatal problems, to help to identify possible
strategies, and to support the planning, implementation,
and monitoring of strategies in the community. Locally
recruited supervisors supported facilitators in preparing
for meetings and liaising with community leaders.
Groups took part in a participatory learning and action
cycle consisting of four phases (fi gure 1 and
webappendix p 3). Control and intervention clusters all
received health services strengthening and basic training
of traditional birth attendants.

#### Traditional birth attendant intervention
In clusters assigned to the traditional birth attendant
intervention, 482 attendants were given basic training in
undertaking clean and safe deliveries, providing safe
delivery kits, recognising danger signs in mothers and
infants, making emergency preparedness plans,
accompanying women to facilities, and undertaking
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. They also received
additional training in neonatal resuscitation with bagvalve-mask. A pre-test and post-test questionnaire was
done for every traditional birth attendant at the start and
end of the initial training session and at subsequent
training sessions. Control clusters were given basic
training but no training in bag-valve-mask resuscitation.

#### Health service inputs
The project did not have resources to improve service
delivery intensively at all levels of government health

services. Activities undertaken in both intervention and
control clusters focused on improving referral systems,
links between the community and health services and
between diff erent levels of health services, effi cient use
of available resources, basic and refresher clinical
training relating to essential neonatal and maternal care,
in addition to information, education, and communication materials. The training was provided to
doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff working at district,
upazila, and union levels. This training consisted mainly
of refreshing knowledge about antenatal, natal, and
postnatal care, recognition of danger signs in the mother
and newborn baby, essential care of the newborn baby,
the five cleans (clean delivery surface clean perineum


-----

clean hands of attendant, clean blade to cut cord, clean
umbilical stump without anything applied to it) safe


delivery kits (soap, a blade, gauze, polythene, and a
thread), and safer motherhood.

#### Surveillance
A prospective monitoring system was developed to record
all births and their outcomes within the 18 control and
intervention clusters during the project. The system was
similar to the one implemented in the India trial and
consisted of two stages (webappendix p 4).[10] First,
traditional birth attendants (ie, key informants) in the
study area identifi ed all births, irrespective of whether
they attended them, and deaths in all women during
pregnancy or up to 6 weeks after delivery. Each traditional
birth attendant was responsible for about 200 households,
and was paid an incentive of 60 Taka (US$0·87 on June 8,
2009) for each accurate identifi cation. Surveillance
monitors met with traditional birth attendants once a
month to gather the information. Second, when births
were identifi ed, women were interviewed once 6 weeks
after delivery. Interviewers verifi ed the births and deaths
identifi ed by key informants and completed a
questionnaire that covered background characteristics
and the antenatal, delivery, and postpartum periods. All
eligible women identifi ed were also asked if they could
identify any other pregnant women. In the event of a
stillbirth or neonatal death, a verbal autopsy was done
with the mother. In the event of a maternal death up to
6 weeks after delivery, a verbal autopsy was done with a
close friend or relative. Surveillance started in August,
2004, and covered all clusters by January, 2005.

#### Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcome of the women’s group study was
NMR (deaths in the first 28 days per 1000 livebirths).
Secondary outcomes were maternal deaths (death of a
pregnant woman or within 42 days of cessation of
pregnancy from any cause related to the pregnancy or its
management, but not from accidental causes), stillbirths
(fetal death after 28 weeks of gestation but before delivery
of the baby’s head), uptake of antenatal and delivery
services, home-care practices during and after delivery,
infant morbidity, health-care seeking behaviour (seeking
care for any maternal or newborn illness or complication),
perinatal mortality, and early and late NMR. We used the
International Classifi cation of Diseases version 9
defi nition of stillbirth because it was appropriate for this
setting.[11]

The primary outcome of the traditional birth attendant
study was early NMR. This outcome is presented in this
report, but a more detailed analysis of the intervention
will be reported in a separate publication. Early neonatal
deaths refer to deaths within 6 completed days after
birth and late neonatal deaths from 7–28 completed days
after birth. Miscarriage was defi ned as cessation of a
presumptive pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestation.
Perinatal death describes either a stillbirth or an early
neonatal death We obtained background demographic

and socioeconomic information to investigate cluster
comparability.

#### Quality control of data
Data were double-entered in an electronic database.
Quality checks were undertaken by district-based
surveillance supervisors who manually checked
information provided by the traditional birth attendants
and monitors. The fi eld surveillance manager, data
input offi cer, and data manager undertook manual and
systematic data checks. Additionally, we cross-checked
a subsample of our data with government records.

#### Statistical analysis
We undertook a cross-sectional baseline survey for the
women’s group study from January to March, 2003, in
more than 6000 mothers who had delivered a baby
within the past year, to obtain data for household and
demographic characteristics, in addition to data for
pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. Details of
the sampling method used for this survey have been
published elsewhere.[9] The baseline survey was
undertaken to gather data for neonatal care practices
and behaviour, but not to provide precise NMRs in view
of its limited sample size. We based our original sample
size calculations on the national estimate of neonatal
mortality from Bangladesh Demographic and Health
Survey data from 2004, which gave a value of 41 deaths
per 1000 livebirths for the 1999–2003 period. With an
estimated 1600 livebirths per cluster over 3 years, a
_k value of 0·3, and a baseline NMR of 41 deaths per_
1000 livebirths the study had a power of 56% to detect a


30% reduction in NMR at the 95% signifi cance level.
After the end of the trial, we undertook a retrospective
calculation to understand whether our inability to detect
an eff ect of the intervention could be caused by a lack of
power. From our study data, the harmonic mean of the
number of recorded livebirths per cluster over the study
period was 1467 (range 1081–2708). The stratum-average
intracluster correlation coeffi cient was 0·00056,
corresponding to a between-cluster coeffi cient (k) of
0·12 with the observed NMR in the control groups of
38 deaths per 1000 livebirths.[12] On the assumption of a
baseline NMR of 38 deaths per 1000 livebirths, the study
had a power of 88% to detect a reduction in neonatal
mortality of 25% at the 95% signifi cance level.
We did not expect the intervention to have adverse
eff ects at cluster or participant level and therefore did not
have any stopping rules. A preliminary analysis was
undertaken in July, 2008, and findings were presented to
an independent data safety monitoring board. The board
recommended a fi nal analysis of data for all births in the
study area between Feb 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2007.
Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) at cluster and
participant levels. Temporary and tea garden residents
were included in the analysis for mortality outcomes.
However, they were excluded from analyses for secondary
outcomes since they were unlikely to have been exposed
to the intervention.
We compared NMRs, stillbirth rates, and maternal
mortality ratios between control and intervention groups
by use of stratifi ed cluster-level analysis because of the
small number of clusters in each group. These analyses
involved calculating risk ratios for each stratum and then


-----

an overall weighted mean of these, testing the null
hypothesis that the true overall risk ratio is 1 by use of a
stratifi ed _t test.[13] We noted baseline diff erences in_
maternal education, maternal age, and household assets
between intervention and control clusters: mothers in
the intervention clusters were slightly younger, less
educated, and had fewer household assets. We adjusted
for these covariates by use of the two-stage method
described by Hayes and co-workers[13] for cluster-level
analysis. First, a logistic regression model was fi tted to
the individual-level data, which incorporated the stratum,
maternal age, education, and household assets, but
excluded any information about trial group. The resulting
regression model was used to calculate ratio residuals for
each cluster, which were then used in place of clusterlevel observations for a stratifi ed _t test described above_
for unadjusted analysis. Results are presented as risk
ratios with 95% CIs.
In the assessment of the traditional birth attendant
intervention, only home deliveries were included in the
analysis. Analysis was at cluster level and adjusted for
stratifi cation as described for the women’s group
assessment, but in this analysis the strata were clusters
in which the women’s group intervention was
implemented, and clusters in which no women’s groups
were implemented. We undertook tests to check for
interactions between the traditional birth attendant and
women’s group interventions and did not fi nd any. We
therefore analysed the women’s group data as if from a
single trial with two groups.
This study is registered as an International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN54792066.

#### Role of the funding source
The sponsors of the study had no role in study design,
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or
writing of the report. Representatives from the Big Lottery
Fund and Saving Newborn Lives visited the project during
the trial implementation. All authors had access to all the
data in the study. KA and AC had fi nal responsibility for
the decision to submit for publication


### Results
Figure 2 shows the trial profi le. The estimated population
size was 503 163 people. All nine selected clusters had
the intervention. All women’s groups had fi nished their
fi rst meeting by September, 2004. The traditional birth
attendant intervention started in March, 2005, with all
attendants completing their training in May, 2005. We
monitored births and deaths in the study area between
Feb 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2007. Interviews were completed
for 17 514 births in the intervention clusters and for
18 599 births in control clusters (including temporary
and tea garden residents). These data correspond with
84% of 20 943 births registered by key informants in
intervention areas and 82% of 22 774 births in control
areas (fi gure 2). The main reason for failure to interview
was maternal migration.
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of intervention
and control clusters gathered in a retrospective survey.
6389 mothers were interviewed, 3213 from intervention
unions and 3176 from control unions. The number of
mothers to be interviewed in each union was weighted
according to the total union population based on the 1991
Bangladesh census.[14] Women who had delivered a baby
within the past 12 months were selected for interview by
use of random sampling. We noted diff erences in
maternal education, maternal age, and household assets
between intervention and control unions, with a greater
proportion of mothers in the intervention unions with no
education and no household assets. Mothers in
intervention unions were also more likely to be younger
than mothers in control unions. Further results from this
survey are reported elsewhere.[9]

In a total population of 229 195 people in the nine
clusters, 162 women’s groups provided a coverage of one
group per 1414 population. In 2007, 2363 (9%) women of
reproductive age in the intervention clusters (n=27 614)
were group members. Almost half the members
(1158 women, 49%) were between 25 years and 34 years
old with fewer (378 women, 16%) younger members
(<24 years old). The groups held meetings once a month
and completed a cycle of 20 meetings The mean


-----

attendance during the fi rst ten meetings was 73%
(1735 women) of registered members. Only 477 (3%) of
15 695 women who gave birth and were interviewed
during the study period reported attending a group.
Unadjusted NMRs per 1000 livebirths were 30·6 in 2005,
36·1 in 2006, and 33·6 in 2007 in the intervention clusters
(including all residents), and 41·1, 37·5, and 32·4 in the
control clusters, respectively (table 2). The risk ratio for
neonatal mortality, taking into account clustering and
stratifi cation, for the 3-year period was 0·93 (95% CI
0·80–1·09; table 3). The diff erence in maternal mortality
ratio between intervention and control clusters was based
on fairly small numbers of deaths but reached signifi cance
when temporary and tea garden residents were included in
the analysis (table 3). Although this fi nding is of concern,
46 of the 55 maternal deaths in the intervention clusters
(excluding tea garden or temporary residents) were to
women who had neither heard of nor attended groups and
there were no maternal deaths in members of women’s
groups, which suggests that the intervention did not have a
direct adverse eff ect. Additionally, maternal mortality was a
secondary outcome of the study and the sample size only
gave us power to detect large diff erences.
In intervention clusters, neonatal mortality increased
during year 2 then stabilised in year 3. In control
clusters, neonatal mortality decreased over time,
although the diff erences were not signifi cant (fi gure 3).
Stillbirth rates did not diff er between intervention and
control clusters.
No signifi cant diff erences were noted in most homecare practices or health-care-seeking behaviours between
intervention and control clusters (table 4). However, we
did see higher frequencies of delayed bathing and
exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention clusters than
in the control clusters. The proportion of institutional
deliveries was slightly higher in control clusters than in
intervention clusters, which might have contributed to
the diff erence noted in maternal mortality.
To further examine the eff ect of the women’s group
intervention, we compared birth outcomes and selected
home-care and health-care-seeking practices in women’s
group members and non-group members in the
intervention clusters (webappendix pp 5–6). The
proportion of women with hygienic delivery practices
was higher in group members than in non-group
members. Additionally, group members were more likely
to avoid bathing in the fi rst 24 h and to undertake
exclusive breastfeeding for the fi rst 6 weeks than were
non-group members.
Data from our process assessment showed that the
three main strategies implemented by women’s groups
were the creation of emergency funds managed by the
groups, the raising of awareness of maternal and
newborn health issues during meetings and in the
community by use of materials provided by the groups
(such as picture cards and fl ipcharts), and the fostering
of effective communication with health-care providers

through meetings with group representatives. These
strategies changed over time and varied between groups.
In clusters in which selected traditional birth attendants
were trained in bag-valve-mask resuscitation, there were
12 519 home births, of which 8618 were attended by any
traditional birth attendant and 2792 by a traditional birth
attendant trained in bag-valve-mask resuscitation. In the
control clusters, there were 13 195 home births, of which
9171 were attended by any traditional birth attendant and
2536 by a traditional birth attendant trained in mouth-tomouth resuscitation. Mean early NMRs did not diff er
signifi cantly between clusters in which traditional birth
attendants received training in bag-valve-mask
resuscitation (25·4 deaths per 1000 livebirths) and control
clusters (26·5 deaths per 1000 livebirths). The risk ratio
for early neonatal death was 0·95 (95% CI 0·75–1·21). A
more detailed assessment of this intervention will be
reported in a separate publication. We did not fi nd any
interactions between the traditional birth attendant and
women’s group interventions.

### Discussion
Our study shows that participatory women’s groups did
not signifi cantly reduce neonatal mortality in poor rural
populations of Bangladesh. This fi nding contrasts with
the large reductions in mortality reported in other trials
undertaken in Nepal and India.[7,8] This trial monitored
birth outcomes in a large population and had fewer
clusters than did previous trials; however, the intracluster
correlation coeffi cient was small, thus our inability to
detect a diff erence in NMR between intervention and
control clusters cannot be attributed to lack of power.
Although neonatal mortality was lower in the intervention
clusters than in the control clusters over the 3 years of
the trial, there was also a decline in neonatal mortality in
the control clusters over time. This fi nding might refl ect
underlying secular trends in mortality seen in other parts
of Bangladesh and merits further investigation [15,16]


-----

Maternal mortality was higher in intervention clusters
than in control clusters during the 3 years of the trial.
This diff erence only reached signifi cance when tea
garden and temporary residents were included in the
analysis. There are no obvious population, health service,
or other contextual factors to explain this fi nding, and
there is no evidence that women’s groups discouraged
use of health services. Also, there were no deaths in
mothers who attended women’s groups. We do not wish
to over-interpret diff erences in maternal mortality rates
on the basis of low numbers of maternal deaths. The
eff ects of women’s group membership on maternal
mortality might become evident with meta-analysis of
several trials.
Despite the absence of a signifi cant eff ect of women’s
groups on neonatal mortality, process data suggested that
good perinatal practices in intervention clusters were
slightly better than they were in control clusters, such as
use of a safe delivery kit, exclusive breastfeeding for the
fi rst 6 weeks, and avoidance of early bathing. Nonetheless,
none of these fi ndings were signifi cant, and the
continuing second phase trial, in which women’s group
coverage has been increased to one group per
400 population should clarify questions about any


signifi cant eff ects of women’s groups on maternal
mortality or perinatal care practices.
We believe that the lack of eff ect of the intervention in
this setting was caused by three main factors. First, the
population coverage of women’s groups (one group per
1414 population) was less than a third of the coverage
achieved in the India trial (one group per 468 population)[8]
and less than half that in the Nepal trial (one group per
756 population).[7] Findings from these three trials suggest
that population coverage and the proportion of newly
pregnant women enrolled in groups might need
threshold levels to have an eff ect on birth outcomes
(perhaps of the order of one group per 450–750 population,
and between 30% and 50% of newly pregnant women
attending groups, respectively). The enrolment of newly
pregnant women is likely to be a key determinant of the
eff ectiveness of women’s groups.
Second, we believe that the quality of the intervention
might have been aff ected by several factors related to the
size of the study. The total population covered by the
project was much larger than that covered in the Nepal or
India trials, but facilitators in our study had to coordinate
more groups than did those in other trials. The project
had diffi culties in retaining facilitators and supervisors,
which might have led to disruptions in meetings and
reduced support for community mobilisation. Facilitators
also had an increased workload, since they arranged
18 meetings per month compared with nine per month in
the trial in Nepal. Although the support structure and ratio
of supervisors to facilitators in this study were similar to
those in Nepal and India, in practice coordinators often
lived further away from women’s group facilitators than
did those in other sites, and they were not able to provide
refresher training and continuing support to facilitators.
Facilitators’ use of participatory techniques to stimulate
community mobilisation is the hallmark of this
intervention and lack of support for facilitators might have
damaged the quality of the intervention.
Third, local contextual factors could have had a role:
adverse climatic conditions aff ected the facilitators’ ability
to travel to meetings and one of the intervention unions
in Faridpur was entirely fl ooded in 2007. Additionally,
there are signs that gender-based barriers were strong in
some of the intervention unions, and might have
prevented some women from joining groups, seeking
care, or from implementing strategies if they had joined
a group. For example, some women reported facing
problems when asking for their husbands’ or in-laws’
permission to join a group. Other women’s groups linked
to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operated in
our study area, and women were regularly asked to
participate in NGO activities for which they could receive
fi nancial incentives. Women might therefore have been
deterred from investing time in women’s group meetings
for which no incentives were off ered. Despite these
problems, all 162 groups continued to meet after the end
of the programme’s cycle

The purposive selection of districts and upazilas, and
the stratifi cation of sampling, together with the restricted
number of clusters, might have limited the eff ectiveness
of randomisation procedures. The participatory approach
assessed in this study contrasts with health-worker-led
interventions tested in other recent trials of communitybased newborn care.[17,18] In Bangladesh, the Projahnmo
trial[18] compared home care, consisting of multiple
community health worker visits to pregnant mothers,
with a community mobilisation group and a control
group. The results showed no overall signifi cant
diff erences between groups in NMR over the 3 years of
the trial, but there was a 34% reduction in NMR in the
fi nal 6 months of the trial in the home-care group.
However, the community mobilisation approach used in
the Projahnmo trial was not participatory and was less
intensive than the approaches used in the Nepal, Indian,
and Bangladesh Perinatal Care Project trials. In the
Projahnmo community-care group, each female
community health worker was responsible for a
population of 18 000 people, which was divided so that
each geographical area of about 225 people was visited
once every 4 months; the male community health workers
visited each area every 10 months. Just as we propose for
this trial with women’s groups, we do not believe that
this level of coverage and intensity is suffi cient to bring
about behaviour change and reduction in mortality.
Few government programmes have managed to provide
multiple prenatal or postnatal home visits to mothers
and infants when scaled up.[19] By contrast, women’s
groups, if scaled to an adequate coverage, have the
potential to reach the poorest people and bring about
substantial health and non-health benefi ts. Nonetheless,
a women’s group approach requires adequate human
resources support for community mobilisation and
appropriate coverage. The threshold coverage or dose
eff ect for the women’s group intervention needs to be
established for future scale-up programmes. This
threshold coverage raises an important new research and
policy question: would scaling up the coverage of
women’s groups in Bangladesh achieve the same eff ect
on mortality as did the intervention in India and Nepal,
or is the absence of eff ect caused by other delivery and
social context barriers? We are currently assessing the
eff ect of more intensive scale-up of women’s groups in
the intervention clusters to increase population coverage
and membership of pregnant women to levels similar to
those reported in the trial in India. Additionally, we are
improving support for facilitators and implementing
strategies to counter gender-based barriers, such as the
involvement of men and religious leaders. We are closely
monitoring contextual factors that might aff ect the
delivery of the intervention through a detailed process
assessment. The results of this assessment will establish
whether the success of women’s groups is dependent on
population coverage, or whether specifi c contextual and
delivery factors reduce their effectiveness
