## Summary

**Background—Women’s groups and health education by peer counsellors can improve the**
health of mothers and children. We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates in
rural Malawi.


**Methods—We did a 2×2 factorial, cluster-randomised trial in 185 888 people in Mchinji district.**
48 equal-sized clusters were randomly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number
sequence. 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and
child health problems. 72 trained volunteer peer counsellors made home visits at five timepoints
during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding and infant care. Primary outcomes for
the women’s group intervention were maternal, perinatal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates
(MMR, PMR, NMR, and IMR, respectively); and for the peer counselling were IMR and
exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered as
ISRCTN06477126.

**Findings—We monitored outcomes of 26 262 births between 2005 and 2009. In a factorial**
model adjusted only for clustering and the volunteer peer counselling intervention, in women’s
group areas, for years 2 and 3, we noted non-significant decreases in NMR (odds ratio 0·93, 0·64–
1·35) and MMR (0·54, 0·28–1·04). After adjustment for parity, socioeconomic quintile, and
baseline measures, effects were larger for NMR (0·85, 0·59–1·22) and MMR (0·48, 0·26–0·91).
Because of the interaction between the two interventions, a stratified analysis was done. For
women’s groups, in adjusted analyses, MMR fell by 74% (0·26, 0·10–0·70), and NMR by 41%
(0·59, 0·40–0·86) in areas with no peer counsellors, but there was no effect in areas with
counsellors (1·09, 0·40–2·98, and 1·38, 0·75–2·54). Factorial analysis for the peer counselling
intervention for years 1–3 showed a fall in IMR of 18% (0·82, 0·67–1·00) and an improvement in
EBF rates (2·42, 1·48–3·96). The results of the stratified, adjusted analysis showed a 36%
reduction in IMR (0·64, 0·48–0·85) but no effect on EBF (1·18, 0·63–2·25) in areas without
women’s groups, and in areas with women’s groups there was no effect on IMR (1·05, 0·82–1·36)
and an increase in EBF (5·02, 2·67–9·44) . The cost of women’s groups was US$114 per year of
life lost (YLL) averted and that of peer counsellors was $33 per YLL averted, using stratified data
from single intervention comparisons.

**Interpretation—Community mobilisation through women’s groups and volunteer peer**
counsellor health education are methods to improve maternal and child health outcomes in poor
rural populations in Africa.

## Background

Worldwide, the mortality rate in children younger than 5 years is still unacceptably high at
7·7 million to 8·8 million per year, and includes 3·6 million deaths in newborn babies.[1,2] In
Malawi, the mortality rate in children younger than 5 years during 2005–10 was 112 per
1000 livebirths, of which 30% were neonates.[1,3] In south Asia, community mobilisation
through women’s groups reduced the rate of neonatal mortality, probably through improved
solidarity, decision making, preventive care, care-seeking, and health-service
accountability.[4,5]

Exclusive breastfeeding helps development of the immune system,[6] improves survival of
children born to HIV-infected mothers,[7] and reduces the risk of mother-to-child
transmission (MTCT) of HIV compared with mixed feeding.[7,8] The findings from
systematic reviews[9,10] suggest that peer advice and support for mothers improve hygiene,
recognition of illness in infants, and breastfeeding. Evidence that exclusive breastfeeding as
a result of peer counselling leads to a reduction in the mortality rate is scarce. The results of
research suggest that peer counselling increases the rates of breastfeeding and reduces those
of diarrhoea, with little effect on mortality rates.[11–17] According to the findings of a
Cochrane review,[10] further trials are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of lay and
professional support for breastfeeding.

Most births in African countries occur at home, especially in rural areas, and many deaths in
infants might be prevented if mothers are given advice about feeding, infant care, danger
signs, MTCT, HIV testing and treatment, and care-seeking. In Africa, no trials of
community mobilisation through women’s groups, and only one trial of counselling for
exclusive breastfeeding, have been done to assess effects on child mortality. The effects of
community mobilisation through women’s groups, and health education through female
volunteer peer counsellors on rates of infant care, feeding, morbidity, and mortality were
assessed in the MaiMwana Project, a collaboration between the Malawi Ministry of Health
and University College London, London, UK.


## Methods

**Study location and population**


**Participants**


90% of Malawi’s population live on less than US$2 a day.[18] Mchinji district, in the central
region, has a population of 455 000, of which 90% live in rural areas and are dependent on
subsistence farming.[19] In 2006, 99% of women in this district attended antenatal care at least
once during pregnancy and 58% delivered at a health facility.[20] Health care is provided by
one district hospital, four rural hospitals, nine health centres, and private clinics. Quality is
compromised by a severe shortage of personnel, low morale, and irregular drug supplies.

A cohort of 43 719 women of childbearing age was defined in 2004 during a baseline
household survey. All women aged 10–49 years who consented to participate were enrolled.
Cohort members were entered in an open master list to which new participants were added if
they moved into the study area. Women’s migrations within and outside the study area were
recorded to allow for both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.[21] Women who had
terminal family planning procedures were enumerated but excluded from the final sample.
They were not excluded from participating in the interventions.

The study was approved by the Malawi National Health Sciences Research Committee in
January, 2003, and the ethics committee of the University College London Institute of Child
Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.

Written consent for the random allocation of interventions to communities was obtained
from the district commissioner, district health officer, and leaders of participating
communities. Most women enrolled were not literate, and verbal consent was obtained for
each data gathering episode after explaining the purpose of the visit. Women were free to
decline to be interviewed at any time.


**Randomisation and masking**

We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial using a 2×2 factorial design to assess the effects
of two interventions on specific outcome indicators. The study design has been described in
detail elsewhere.[21] 48 clusters were defined on the basis of census enumeration areas
(appendix p 1). Each cluster had a population of about 3000 people, with a surrounding
buffer area to reduce contamination between intervention and control areas; villages in the
buffer area were excluded. Clusters of villages, rather than individual villages, were used as
the unit of randomisation to further reduce rates of travel across cluster boundaries and the
possibility of contamination. The urban district administrative centre was excluded.

The 48 clusters were allocated randomly to one of four groups (appendix p 1). 12 were
allocated to the women’s group and volunteer peer counselling, 12 women’s group only, 12
volunteer peer counselling only, and 12 no intervention. SL and DO allocated clusters with a
random number sequence generated in Stata (version 7.0). Neither was involved in the
implementation of the interventions. Although the interventions made masking of allocation
impossible at the participant level, allocation was masked for data analysis. Data were
gathered independently of programme implementation and could not be used to inform the
implementation of the interventions, and thus bias them.


**Surveillance**


From December, 2004, to December, 2010, each cohort member was visited once a month
by a cluster enumerator and data were gathered; the interventions are still in progress, with
data (not related to this trial) being gathered. All pregnancies, births, and neonatal, infant,
and maternal deaths were identified, and surviving mothers and infants were followed up to
1 year. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires about the demographic
characteristics, maternity history, care and care-seeking, and maternal and infant morbidity
at 1 month and 6 months after delivery. Feeding practices were ascertained through 24 h and
7 day recall at both interviews. Deaths were verified by a supervisor, through a verbal
autopsy interview 2–6 weeks later. When respondents were temporarily unavailable, they
were followed up by the interviewers until an outcome was ascertained. If respondents were
permanently unavailable, information about dates and timings of events was sought from
other community members.


**Women’s group intervention**

From May, 2005, 207 women’s groups were established. Each was supported by a cluster
facilitator through a community mobilisation action cycle of 20 meetings in four phases
(appendix p 2), adapted from cycles used in Bolivia and Nepal.[4,22–24] Facilitators (n=24)
were local women aged 20–49 years, literate and with at least one child, selected from the
community. They were trained over 11 days, with refresher training every 4 months. The
facilitators were paid a salary, and given a bicycle, T-shirt, umbrella, field bag, and
monitoring forms. They were supported by four supervisors who visited them at least twice
a month, observed meetings, and provided training and feedback. The facilitators used a
manual to implement the cycle, with participatory rural appraisal methods and picture cards
of maternal and newborn health problems to guide discussion. Through the four phases of
the cycle, members identified and prioritised maternal and child health problems, identified
strategies to implement, planned and implemented them, and assessed them and made plans

for the future. Criteria for membership were decided by the groups. Initially restricted to
women (phases 1 and 2), membership was expanded to include men (phase 3). More than 12
000 people attended at least once.


**Volunteer peer counselling intervention**

From December, 2004, 72 female volunteer peer counsellors (two to four per cluster)
implemented the intervention.[25] Counsellors were selected with communities, and were
literate women aged 23–50 years with breastfeeding experience. They identified pregnant
women and made five home visits during and after pregnancy: in the third trimester, in the
week after birth, and at 1 month, 3 months, and 5 months (appendix p 3). They provided
health education about exclusive breastfeeding, infant care, immunisations, prevention of
MTCT (PMTCT), and family planning. They also supported women with breast problems
and raised awareness of timely care-seeking. Counsellors used an intervention manual
describing visit content, and a simple picture book (adapted from manuals published by
WHO,[26] Save the Children,[27] and Linkages[28]). They were given an initial 5 day and annual
refresher training, and attended monthly meetings. They were also given a bicycle, meeting
allowances, registers, calendars, and supervision forms. Peer counsellors lived in the same
communities, so informal contacts to make arrangements for visits were common. Because
the content was time dependent (eg, birth preparedness, immunisations, and weaning),
counsellors stopped trying to arrange missed counselling visits after the appropriate time had
elapsed, but would still attempt to make the next scheduled visit. No prespecified number of
attempted visits were made before giving up. Counsellors only stopped attempting meetings
if a woman expressed a lack of interest or refused. If a woman was not identified during
pregnancy, counsellors would try to enrol her after delivery to attend the remaining four
visits. Reasons for missed visits or discontinued counselling were recorded in their register.

To promote sustainability, planning, and management, the Mchinji district health office was
involved. Counsellors were supervised by 24 government health surveillance assistants, who
visited quarterly, documenting progress, achievements, and challenges, and by three
MaiMwana officers. Health surveillance assistants received initial and yearly refresher
training, attended monthly and quarterly meetings, and were given calendars and a
supervisory checklist.


**Health service inputs**

All study clusters benefited from strengthening of health services. Health workers from
every facility were trained in essential newborn care, lifesaving skills and safe motherhood,
and discussed the MaiMwana interventions. Bulb syringes, resuscitation tables, ambubags,
artery forceps, cord clamps, and sphygmomanometers were donated by University College
London and UNICEF to all facilities. MaiMwana project and district health staff, with
funding from UNICEF, introduced PMTCT to the district in 2005 and all health facilities
were covered by 2008.


**Outcomes**


Primary outcomes were maternal, perinatal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates (MMR,
PMR, NMR, and IMR, respectively) for the clusters assigned to the women’s group
intervention; and IMR and rates of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first 6 months for
those assigned to the volunteer peer counselling intervention (panel 1). PMR was reported as
deaths per 1000 births (perinatal), NMR and IMR were reported as deaths per 1000
livebirths, and MMR was reported as deaths per 100 000 livebirths.

Secondary outcomes for the women’s group intervention were maternal and infant
morbidity, skilled antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care, tetanus toxoid immunisation, use

-----

of malaria prophylaxis, insecticide-treated bednets during pregnancy, and PMTCT services,
infant immunisations, early EBF, and reduced use of prelacteal feeds. For the volunteer peer
counselling intervention, neonatal mortality and infant morbidity rates were secondary
outcomes, and caretaker practices included duration of EBF, time to initiating breastfeeding,
use of prelacteal feeds, time to weaning, management of breast problems, and family
planning uptake, including condom use. We excluded dietary recall data if they were
incomplete or gathered more than 2 weeks after expected interview dates. Care-seeking
behaviour included awareness and use of PMTCT and HIV testing services and uptake of
immunisations (three doses of pentavalent immunisation and four doses of polio vaccine by
6 months). Birth preparedness was a prespecified outcome assessed indirectly through
reported hand washing or use of gloves at delivery and early wrapping of the newborn baby.
Use of nevirapine, expressing breastmilk, and infant growth were also prespecified, but data
for these outcomes were gathered through different systems and will be investigated in
future analyses. Uptake of antenatal, skilled delivery, and postnatal care were included as
post-hoc outcomes because they were promoted by peer counsellors. Data for recognition of
danger signs, though this was a prespecified secondary outcome for both interventions, were
not gathered because showing participants pictures of major danger signs and asking for
responses for each would have substantially lengthened the interview.


**Statistical analysis**

The main analyses were factorial analyses, for comparison of the 24 clusters given the
women’s group intervention (ie, alone or with volunteer peer counselling) with 24 control
clusters (ie, volunteer peer counselling only or no intervention), and the 24 clusters given
volunteer peer counselling (ie, alone or with the women’s group intervention) with 24
control clusters (ie, women’s group alone or no intervention). The volunteer peer
counselling intervention was established more rapidly than was the women’s group
intervention, so the interventions were assessed over different time frames (appendix p 4).
After exclusion of the baseline and establishment periods, the study ran from Feb 1, 2006, to
Jan 31, 2009, for the women’s group intervention and July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2008, for the
volunteer peer counselling intervention.

We did not expect the interventions to have adverse effects at cluster or participant level,
and did not institute stopping rules. In October, 2008, we presented preliminary findings to
an independent data monitoring committee,[29] which recommended further data gathering for
1 year, and consideration of the delays in the first year of the women’s group intervention.
The committee under took a final review of the volunteer peer counselling intervention in
August, 2009, and of the women’s group intervention in March, 2010.


The trial was planned for 3 years, and was powered for an analysis of birth outcomes over 2
years, allowing 1 year for the women’s group intervention to be established.[21] We assumed
a between-cluster coefficient of variation (k) of 0·15–0·30, and about 240 births per cluster
in 2 years. A sample size of 24 clusters per comparison group would detect a 47–50%
reduction in MMR, 28–33% reduction in PMR, 31–36% reduction in NMR, and 21–28%
reduction in IMR between intervention and control areas at 80% power and 5% significance
level (assuming baseline mortality rates of 984 per 100 000 livebirths, 34 per 1000 births, 27
per 1000 livebirths, and 76 per 1000 livebirths, respectively).[30] At the same power and
significance levels, it would detect a 16–30% increase in EBF, assuming baseline levels of
28%.[30]

Analysis was by intention to treat at cluster and participant levels. Data were excluded from
analyses when dates of birth or death were not known. We tested the intervention effect on
primary and secondary outcomes on the basis of previously agreed hypotheses. We used
multivariate logistic regression with random effects on individual-level data in Stata (version

11.0). Main analyses were factorial and adjusted for clustering, stratification by the other
intervention, and socioeconomic and demographic variables. Analyses were adjusted for
baseline differences in the women’s group intervention, but not in the volunteer peer
counselling intervention because this intervention had already started during the 6 month
inception and therefore there was a risk of masking early effects. Analysis of year 2 and 3
outcomes was planned because of the potential for delayed effects of the women’s group
intervention.[4,5,31] Treatment group analysis was prespecified to investigate any interaction
between the interventions, and inter action terms were included in factorial models to assess
the strength of interaction.


**Cost-effectiveness analysis**

Costs were calculated from July, 2004, to January, 2009, separately for women’s groups,
peer counselling, health-service strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and process
evaluation. Joint costs were shared. Costs from July, to December, 2004, and costs incurred
later on that were necessary for implementation, were classified as start-up and running
costs (appendix p 4). Costs were estimated from the perspective of a provider in Malawi
Kwacha, inflated to 2010 values with the Malawian consumer price index,[32] and converted
to US$ on July 2, 2010. Capital costs were converted to yearly costs, assuming constant
linear depreciation. Residual assets were deducted from programme costs based on resale
value on Jan 31, 2009.

Costs were gathered through project accounting systems, vehicle log-books, and timeallocation interviews. Resource use was assessed retrospectively. Donated resources and
other items not captured in the accounting ledger were valued on the basis of best alternative
use. Volunteer time was not valued at minimum wage because volunteers received financial
allowances and goods, and volunteer work did not replace regular employment. Incremental
cost-effectiveness was measured in relation to a do-nothing alternative. Results were
calculated as the years of life lost (YLL) component of disability-adjusted life-years
(DALYs) with 3% dis counting and no age weights. Deaths averted were calculated by
subtracting actual from expected numbers and, for infant deaths, by multiplying the
difference by the ratio of livebirths (n=9120) to births followed up to 1 year (n=7541).
Expected deaths were calculated by use of adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from the stratified
analyses to control for individual-level con founding. Maternal YLL averted were calculated
from a mean age at death of 28 years.

## Results


The figure shows the trial profile; 48 clusters were randomly assigned equally to
interventions—women’s group plus volunteer peer counselling, women’s group only,
volunteer peer counselling only, or no intervention. The mean population per cluster was
3873 (range 3083–4933). Intervention implementation started before the trial periods began.
The volunteer peer counselling intervention began on Dec 1, 2004, and the women’s group
intervention on May 1, 2005. We took the 6 months’ inception, Jan 1, to June 30, 2005, as a
baseline for the women’s group intervention, and an establishment period for the volunteer
peer counselling intervention. Table 1 shows the characteristics of women and pregnancies

in intervention groups in this period. Women in the four groups were similar in age,
education, and marital status, with small differences in religious and tribal affiliations
between groups, fewer farmers in areas with volunteer peer counselling only, and more
primigravidae in areas with women’s group intervention only. The 24 clusters with
volunteer peer counselling had higher uptake of skilled antenatal, delivery, and postnatal
care, HIV testing, and exclusive breastfeeding, compared with clusters without peer
counselling during this period, and lower frequencies of perceived maternal and neonatal
problems, suggesting early intervention effects, though newborn care practices—early
wrapping and initiation of breastfeeding—were lower (table 1). The opposite was true for
areas with the women’s group intervention—lower delivery and postnatal care, and highest
perceived maternal problems than in control areas—though early wrapping and
breastfeeding were better (table 1). Clusters with only the women’s group intervention had
the lowest uptake of antenatal and postnatal care and HIV testing, and higher perceived
maternal problems (table 1). Exclusive breastfeeding was highest in areas with both
interventions, suggesting early effects of volunteer peer counselling (and not an interaction
because the women’s group intervention had not begun; table 1).

Four women’s group facilitators dropped out during the trial and were replaced. Over 3
years in intervention areas, data for coverage were provided by 7815 mothers at 1 month
after delivery. 4167 (53%) of these mothers had ever attended a women’s group. 2457
(59%) of 4167 had attended groups one to five times, 1267 (30%) six to ten times, and 443
(11%) more than ten times. There was one women’s group per 105 women aged 15–49
years and per 440 population.


Eight volunteer counsellors and six health surveillance assistants dropped out during the trial
and were replaced. Over 3 years in intervention areas, data for coverage were provided by
8112 mothers at 1 month after delivery, and 4447 (55%) of these said they had received
counselling (8612 individual visits). Reports at 6 months after delivery were available for
5513 mothers in intervention areas, and 3582 (65%) of these were given counselling (8715
visits). There was one volunteer counsellor per 305 women aged 15–49 years and per 1291
population.

Table 2 summarises the numbers of births and deaths in each group. Mortality rates were
higher in the women’s group (with or without volunteer peer counselling) than in the nonwomen’s group (volunteer peer counselling only or no intervention) clusters at inception,
and highest in clusters given both interventions (women’s group plus volunteer peer
counselling). PMR, NMR, and IMR fell consistently over 3 years in areas given the
women’s group intervention with or without volunteer peer counselling; MMR also fell,
with the largest reductions in years 2 and 3 (table 2). Non-women’s group clusters did not
show a similar pattern (table 2). Generally, IMR was lower in clusters assigned to volunteer
peer counselling (alone or with women’s groups) than in those assigned to non-volunteer
peer counselling (women’s groups or no intervention) and was lowest in volunteer peer
counselling only clusters throughout the study.


Table 3 summarises the analyses of the primary outcomes for the women’s group
intervention. There was no difference between women’s group and no women’s group
intervention clusters in a factorial model adjusted only for clustering and the presence of
volunteer peer counselling intervention. Adjustment for cluster-level baseline values,
socioeconomic quintile, and parity lowered the ORs. For years 2 and 3, after exclusion of
data from the first year (establishment) of the trial, MMR was reduced by 52% (adjusted OR
0·48, 95% CI 0·26–0·91; table 3). Inclusion of interaction terms in models showed highly
significant interactions between the two interventions for almost all primary outcomes, and
stratified analyses were done. Strong effects were noted in areas without peer counsellors,

with reductions of 33% in PMR, 41% in NMR, 28% in IMR, and 74% in MMR in years 2
and 3 (table 3). No effects were noted in areas with peer counsellors. k for NMR was 0·38
for all clusters and 0·28 for control clusters only, corresponding with intracluster correlation
coefficients of 0·00376 and 0·00237, respectively.

Analysis of secondary outcomes, after adjustment for cluster-level baseline values,
socioeconomic quintile, and parity, showed a 50% increase in uptake of antenatal care, and a
30% reduction in births attended by traditional birth attendants (table 4). Exclusive
breastfeeding showed an increase of 74% and complete immunisation at 6 months showed a
greater than 2·5 times increase (table 4).

For the primary outcomes with the volunteer peer counselling intervention, we noted an
18% reduction in IMR compared with control areas during the 3 years of the trial after
adjustment for stratification and clustering (table 3). This effect was not significant after
adjustment for socioeconomic quintile and parity, and the effect size was not increased when
the first year was excluded (table 3). Stratified analysis showed large effects on IMR in
areas without women’s groups (adjusted OR 0·64, 0·48–0·85), but no effect in areas with
women’s groups. k for IMR was 0·26 for all clusters and 0·14 for control clusters,
corresponding with intracluster correlation coefficients of 0·00385 and 0·00120,
respectively. Improvements were also noted in exclusive breastfeeding rates (tables 3 and 4);
however, stratified analysis showed that these effects were not significant in areas without
women’s groups. k for exclusive breastfeeding was 0·91 for all clusters and 0·62 for control
clusters only (intracluster correlation coefficients 0·14703 and 0·04263, respectively).

Analysis of secondary outcomes for the peer counselling intervention, after adjustment for
socioeconomic quintile and parity, showed much lower use of prelacteal feeds, shorter mean
time to first breastfeed, and higher mean age of starting porridge (the main complimentary
feed; table 4). Immunisation rates were already high in all study areas at inception, and
though coverage was generally higher in peer counselling areas during the study, only the
effect on BCG was significant (table 4), and the number of infants fully vaccinated for
poliomyelitis was lower. Reported breastfeeding problems and associated care-seeking did
not differ between control and intervention groups, but reported infant cough, fever, or
diarrhoea was 42% lower in intervention areas (table 4).

No differences were noted in use of family planning, or other antenatal, delivery, and
postnatal care-seeking (table 4). Uptake of HIV testing was much higher in all areas than it
was at inception, but there was no difference between volunteer peer counselling and control
areas during the study (table 4).

The presence of both interventions in a cluster improved coverage, with 2192 (57%) of 3874
women with available attendance data having ever attended a women’s group by 1 month
post partum, compared with 1975 (50%) of 3941 in clusters with women’s group only. 2552
(63%) of 4055 women with available visit data had ever been visited by a peer counsellor in
areas with both interventions, compared with 1895 (47%) of 4057 in areas with only
volunteer peer counselling. Despite this, the effects on mortality rates were lower than in
areas with one intervention.

Comparisons were made between control areas and the three intervention groups (table 3).
Striking effects were noted on MMR with women’s groups only, and on IMR with volunteer
peer counselling only in years 1–3. Table 2 shows that IMR remained the lowest in peer
counselling only areas throughout the study. Outcomes in years 2 and 3 showed striking
effects on all mortality rates in areas with women’s group intervention only (table 3). With
the exception of MMR, adjusted ORs in areas with both interventions were near to 1·00
(table 3). All interaction effects were significant, except for MMR and NMR for model 2,

years 1–3, though these treatment group effects showed a similar pattern (table 3).
Treatment group analysis of EBF showed much higher rates in double intervention areas
than in control areas, and non-significant effects in areas with either intervention alone
(table 3). This pattern was the same as at inception, before the women’s groups had started,
and could not have been due to interaction (table 1).

Significant interactions were not noted for secondary outcomes, though treatment group
analysis showed larger effects in areas with both interventions. Adjusted (for clustering,
stratification, socioeconomic quintile, parity, and baseline values) ORs for skilled birth
attendance were 1·36 (0·89–2·06) for areas with both interventions, 1·21 (0·80–1·83) for
women’s group only, and 1·10 (0·72–1·67) for volunteer peer counselling only.


The total economic cost of the women’s group intervention was $698 459. The cost of the
volunteer peer counselling intervention was $263 544. In years 2–3, 48·4 maternal deaths
and 157·5 infant deaths were averted by the women’s group intervention. In years 1–3,
258·5 infant deaths were averted by the volunteer peer counselling intervention. The cost of
the women’s groups was $114 per YLL averted (infant and maternal deaths), and was of
similar magnitude to other studies.[4,5] The average cost of volunteer peer counselling was
$33 per YLL averted.

The mean costs per year were $16·6 per infant (women’s group), $6·3 per infant (volunteer
peer counselling), and $5·6 per woman of childbearing age (women’s group). Health service
strengthening added $1·6 and monitoring and assessment $5·4 per woman of childbearing
age. $601 019 (86%) of the cost of the women’s group and $205 446 (78%) of the cost of
the volunteer peer counselling group were for implementation.


## Discussion

Our results suggest that, in rural Malawi, a women’s group intervention mobilising
communities for improved maternal and child health reduced MMR (74%), PMR (33%),
NMR (41%), and IMR (28%) in years 2 and 3, in adjusted, stratified models in areas without
a peer counselling intervention, but had no effects in areas with peer counselling. In areas
without women’s groups, where volunteer peer counsellors advised mothers about feeding
and infant care, IMR fell by 36% (table 3), and overall infant morbidity by 42% (table 4).
EBF rates increased more than two times, but after stratification the effect was only
significant in areas with women’s group intervention. Both interventions were highly cost
effective, averting 1 YLL for less than the per head gross domestic product of Malawi.[33]

Despite the lower than expected coverage and attendance, the effect of both interventions
was impressive. Increasing coverage would have increased costs, making the interventions
difficult to implement on a larger scale. Secondary outcomes suggested changes toward
improved care and care-seeking behaviour, though few indicators showed conclusive
effects. Reductions in morbidity and mortality rates might have been due to small changes in
many behaviours (panel 2).[34]

Our study had some limitations. Although surveillance of births and deaths was prospective
and quality controlled, errors probably arose in ascertainment and classification of
outcomes. Delays in implementation of activities by the women’s groups in year 1 diluted
the effects noted overall. Breastfeeding status was ascertained by use of self-report at two
timepoints, raising the possibility of misclassification. The low exclusive breastfeeding
proportion (14%) compared with Malawi Demographic and Health Survey estimates
(28%),[30] suggests it was not over-reported. Losses to follow-up for breastfeeding outcomes
are largely explained by the exclusion of incomplete or delayed dietary recall data. Because
women knew their intervention allocation, behavioural answers were open to best behaviour

bias. However, corresponding reductions in mortality outcomes suggest that changes in
behaviour were real.

The factorial design introduced the possibility of interaction between the two interventions,
confirmed by the analyses. The greater effect on mortality rates seen in single intervention
areas than in those with both was noteworthy. One explanation might be negative synergy,
where both interventions might have been saving the same lives, thus restricting the
potential for combined effect. Another explanation is that combined delivery led to reduced
efficiency, but this was not supported by improved coverage in areas with both
interventions. Furthermore, outcomes such as EBF and skilled birth attendance were greater
in areas with both interventions. For EBF, this apparent interaction existed at inception,
before the women’s group intervention started, suggesting that areas with both interventions
differed in ways that were not compensated for by the adjusted analyses. They were either
more urbanised, making interventions less easy to implement, or more remote from health
facilities. They had higher IMR, NMR, and PMR at inception, but improved more than areas
with no intervention during the study period (table 2).

Our results, though complicated by the factorial design and baseline imbalances after
randomisation, confirm the findings from women’s group trials in south Asia that reductions
in mortality rates result from mobilisation of women and communities.[4,5] Of particular note
is the effect on MMR, also noted in the Makwanpur trial,[4] but in this case a specified
primary outcome. Previous trials of breastfeeding counselling showed variable effects in
sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.[7,10,20] The contribution of improvements in feeding to
infant survival in rural Malawi is plausible, but difficult to ascertain in this study. We did
not see changes in individual home-care practices or uptake of routine primary care
interventions, although 22 of 26 process variables were better in areas with volunteer peer
counsellors. Infant morbidity rate from cough, fever, and diarrhoea was lower in these areas,
and better recognition of illness and timely care-seeking might have contributed to a
reduction in IMR.

Our study is the first trial of women’s groups and volunteer peer counsellors in a rural
African population and showed substantial effect on MMR, NMR, and IMR. The
interventions were uncomplicated and inexpensive, and could achieve further savings at
scale. Counsellors were supervised through the government public health system, and
women’s groups linked to government health surveillance assistants during strategy
implementation, so both could be scaled up and sustained through these systems. Slow
progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 in Africa, and a lack of community trials
with population mortality rates as outcomes, means that women’s groups and peer
counsellors deserve serious policy consideration for scale-up.

Data are n/N (rate), unless otherwise indicated. 95% CIs were not adjusted. MMR=maternal mortality ratio per 100 000 livebirths. PMR=perinatal
mortality rate per 1000 births. NMR=neonatal mortality rate per 1000 livebirths. IMR=infant mortality rate per 1000 livebirths. EBF=exclusive
breastfeeding rate per 100 livebirths. Model 1 data were adjusted for clustering and stratification by the other intervention. Model 2 data were
adjusted as in model 1, and for cluster-level baseline values, socioeconomic quintile, and parity.


*This effect was no longer significant at the 5% level after application of the Holm procedure for multiple testing.

†Adjusted for stratification, clustering, socioeconomic quintile, and parity, but not for baseline values, because these could reflect early effects of
the volunteer peer counselling intervention.


‡Study years used for this analysis were for the women’s group intervention, so that both interventions were active during the period analysed,
because the women’s group intervention was still in its set-up phase during year 1 of the volunteer peer counselling intervention.

§p value for likelihood ratio test for comparison of the model with and without the interaction term.

Data are number (%) or adjusted odds ratio (95% CI), unless otherwise indicated. Model 1 data were adjusted for clustering and stratification by
the other intervention. Model 2 data: as model 1, with adjustment for socioeconomic quintile and parity. Women’s group analyses were adjusted
for cluster-level baseline values due to imbalance at baseline. Volunteer peer counselling analyses were not adjusted for baseline values as the
intervention had already started. Denominators used for calculating percentages do not include missing data, which differ for each variable. p
values for secondary outcomes were not corrected for multiple testing, and exact significance levels should be interpreted with caution. Care
practices and care-seeking behaviour were secondary outcomes for the peer counselling intervention, but antenatal care, health facility delivery,
type of birth attendant, and postnatal care were not directly prespecified and were analysed post hoc.


*A woman received two or three doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine during her current pregnancy or a complete course of five immunisations during
her lifetime.

†Only data for study period for women’s group intervention used because models 1 and 2 failed to run with the data for the study period for the
volunteer peer counselling as a result of numerical overflow.
