Background—Maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality remains high in low-income countries. 
We evaluated community and facility-based interventions to reduce deaths in three districts of 
Malawi.
Methods—We evaluated a rural participatory women’s group community intervention (CI) and a 
quality improvement intervention at health centres (FI) via a two-by-two factorial cluster 
randomized controlled trial. Consenting pregnant women were followed-up to 2 months after birth 
using key informants. Primary outcomes were maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality. Clusters 
were health centre catchment areas assigned using stratified computer-generated randomization. 
Following exclusions, including non-birthing facilities, 61 clusters were analysed: control (17 
clusters, 4912 births), FI (15, 5335), CI (15, 5080) and FI + CI (14, 5249). This trial was registered 
as International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial [ISRCTN18073903]. Outcomes for 14 576 
and 20 576 births were recorded during baseline (June 2007–September 2008) and intervention 
(October 2008–December 2010) periods.
Results—For control, FI, CI and FI + CI clusters neonatal mortality rates were 34.0, 28.3, 29.9 
and 27.0 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births and perinatal mortality rates were 56.2, 55.1, 48.0 
and 48.4 per 1000 births, during the intervention period. Adjusting for clustering and stratification, 
the neonatal mortality rate was 22% lower in FI + CI than control clusters (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 
0.60–1.01), and the perinatal mortality rate was 16% lower in CI clusters (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 
0.72–0.97). We did not observe any intervention effects on maternal mortality.
Conclusions—Despite implementation problems, a combined community and facility approach 
using participatory women’s groups and quality improvement at health centres reduced newborn 
mortality in rural Malawi.

Introduction
Although recent trends show a decline in maternal mortality from 984 per 100 000 live 
births during 2000–2004 (just before this trial) to 675 per 100 000 live births during 2006–
2010,1,2 Malawi is off-track to meet Millennium Development Goal 5 (a three-quarters 
reduction in maternal mortality between 1990 and 2015).3 Neonatal mortality, at 31 per 
1000 live births in 2006–2010,2 and perinatal mortality, at 40 per 1000 live births in 2006–
2010,2 are also high and lag behind decreases in the number of child deaths but Malawi is 
on-track to meet Millennium Development Goal 4.3,4
The main direct causes of maternal death in Malawi are haemorrhage, sepsis, ruptured uterus 
and eclampsia; and the main indirect causes are HIV, malaria and anaemia,5 with underlying 
social causes including poverty, illiteracy and lack of knowledge. The main causes of 
neonatal death are prematurity, asphyxia and sepsis.4
To reduce deaths, supply side (health system) and demand side (community and individual) 
barriers to adequate antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care must be addressed.6 Based on

the three delays model (delays in deciding to seek care, reaching the place of care and 
receiving adequate care once there),7 an international consortium of partner organizations 
designed supply side (health facility quality improvement; FI) and demand side (community 
women’s groups; CI) interventions to reduce maternal and newborn mortality.8 The impact 
of both interventions on deaths was evaluated by a two-by-two factorial cluster randomized 
controlled trial (RCT). Separate process and economic evaluation studies were also 
evaluated and are reported elsewhere.9
Previous research has shown that community mobilization through women’s groups reduced 
neonatal mortality in India10 and Nepal.11 However, a similar RCT in Bangladesh found no 
impact probably, due to low population coverage of the intervention.12
Robust evidence of the effect of quality improvement interventions on population mortality 
rates in the developing world is lacking.13,14 We hypothesized that women’s groups could 
reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality rates by 30% through changes in care 
practices and healthseeking behaviour; and that quality improvement at health centres and 
hospitals, given higher rates of institutional delivery in Malawi, could have a similar effect 
through better antenatal, delivery and postpartum care.
Methods
The design of the trial is reported in full elsewhere.9 The trial was registered as an 
International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial [ISRCTN18073903]. A locally 
registered non-government organization (NGO), MaiKhanda (Chichewa for ‘mother and 
newborn infant’) was set up in Malawi to implement the interventions.
Study population: clusters and participants
The study was conducted in Kasungu, Lilongwe and Salima, three districts of the central 
region of Malawi (Figure 1), chosen in a consultative process at a meeting of key 
stakeholders (from the district councils and health offices, Ministry of Health and local 
academic and NGOs) in October 2005. In 2010 in Kasungu, Lilongwe and Salima 
respectively, access to electricity was only 5.0%, 11.9% and 8.1%, only 3.7%, 14.6% and 
8.8% of households had improved sanitation facilities, and female literacy rates were 72.3%, 
66.7% and 56.9%.2 In 2011 Malawi had a human development index of 0.400 and an 
inequality-adjusted human development index of 0.272.15
Given that community mobilization takes place at village level and the quality improvement 
at health centres and hospitals, the unit of randomization was required to be a cluster of 
people. A suitable cluster for both interventions was the catchment population of a health 
centre. All health facilities in the three districts were included as clusters for the quality 
improvement trial except: (i) any facility providing comprehensive emergency obstetric care 
(CEmOC) functions (Caesarian section and blood transfusion) plus basic emergency 
obstetric care (BEmOC) signal functions (manual removal of placenta, manual vacuum 
aspiration, vacuum extraction, breech deliveries, parenteral antibiotics, magnesium sulphate, 
oxyticic drugs [ergonetrine or oxytocin]); (ii) any facility not offering any BEmOC functions 
(i.e. dispensaries); and non-functional facilities. We did not include CEmOC hospitals

because they cater for all or larger parts of the districts and therefore could not be 
randomized. For the women’s group trial, conditions (i) and (iii) were used as exclusion 
criteria, and urban facilities were also excluded because formative research indicated 
women’s groups are less likely to work in urban areas due to the transient nature of urban 
communities. Condition (ii) was also used as a de facto exclusion criteria for the community 
mobilization study as no women’s groups were set up in the areas surrounding dispensaries 
that do not carry out deliveries.
The average population of each health centre catchment area was approximately 30 000. We 
randomly sampled approximately 4000 people per cluster and set up a community 
surveillance system to track pregnancies, births and deaths of consenting women. Population 
mortality rates were derived from data collected by village development/health committee-
approved volunteer key informants (KI), who captured all deaths.
Entry meetings with area development and district executive committees introduced the 
project to seek their approval. All pregnant women in surveillance areas who agreed to take 
part were eligible to be participants and enrolled if they became pregnant. In-migration of 
pregnant women to the open study cohort was allowed and occurred throughout the study 
period, as did outmigration.
Description of interventions
Community mobilization—In mid-2007, MaiKhanda established 729 participatory 
women’s groups to mobilize communities around maternal and newborn health, using 81 
volunteer facilitators, supported by nine staff, across the allocated clusters. The facilitators 
each formed nine village women’s groups which followed an ‘action cycle’, adapted from 
previous studies,11,16–18 to identify and prioritize maternal and neonatal health problems, 
decide upon local solutions, advocate for, implement and evaluate such strategies (Figure 2). 
The average women’s group size was 29 members in Kasungu, 37 in Lilongwe and 24 in 
Salima (phases I and II of the action cycle; Figure 2). Population coverage overall of one 
women’s group per 1200 population was slightly better than the BADAS trial in Bangladesh,
12 (1:1400) but not as good as trials in India and Nepal.10 Only 10% of pregnancies in 
women’s group areas were among group members.
In mid-to-late 2009, 365 (50%) of the groups had maternal and neonatal health task forces 
(MNHTF) added to them by the MaiKhanda programme in an attempt to enhance antenatal 
coverage, maternal and neonatal health (MNH) knowledge, and facility delivery. MNHTF 
were set up by those women’s groups that chose MNH knowledge as a strategy to focus on. 
The MNHTF aimed to identify high-risk pregnant women; promote delivery at a health 
facility, and antenatal and postnatal care; and provide health education.
Quality improvement—The quality improvement method consisted of breakthrough 
series collaboratives,14 and coaching of facility staff in quality improvement methodology, 
such as developing change ideas, conducting small tests of change using Plan-Do-Study-Act 
cycles, to improve care at health centres (within the RCT) and hospitals (outside the RCT). It 
also involved implementing change packages,19 and conducting death reviews20 and 
specific additional training, for local improvement leaders, and in situ training on specific

clinical areas such as neonatal resuscitation drills and use of protocols for prevention and 
management of postpartum haemorrhage, sepsis and eclampsia. Figure 3 provides an 
overview of the different components.
The programme initially lacked sufficient staff to facilitate the full quality improvement 
intervention working with government staff as intended, and it was revised in mid-2008. 
Between 2006 and September 2009, quality improvement specialists on the MaiKhanda 
team grew from one to six. This delay meant that the FI was not fully implemented at the 
‘dose’ anticipated from the study design. The programme targeted, with quality 
improvement, a limited number of the causes of maternal death (postpartum haemorrhage 
and sepsis via prevention protocols at hospitals; and referrals, identification of high-risk 
women and blood donor identification at the randomized health centres). The main causes of 
neonatal death were targeted for improvement (prematurity via kangaroo mother care, 
asphyxia via resuscitation drills, and sepsis via prevention and treatment protocols), but only 
from late-2009/early 2010.9
Trial outline
The interventions were tested by two trials combined in a factorial design producing four 
different groupings of intervention combinations (Figure 4). When MaiKhanda learned that 
the dispensary clusters did not do any deliveries, they were excluded from the trial before the 
interventions started, and were excluded from an intention-to-treat analysis as the intention 
was only ever briefly stated at the initial randomization, and removed after baseline 
information on delivery rates at health facilities was collected. After exclusion of two more 
FI clusters, one a military facility we did not get permission to work with and the other a 
district hospital rather than a health centre, there were 15 clusters with both interventions (CI 
+ FI), 15 clusters with the FI only, 15 clusters with the CI only and 17 clusters with no 
interventions (control) (Figure 5). One CI + FI cluster could not have data collected in it due 
to a lack of community health workers, meaning it was excluded from the analysis, which 
involved 61 clusters in total.
There was no prespecified start date for the intervention. The intervention periods for both 
trials ran for 27 months from 1 October 2008 to 31 December 2010; with a preceding period 
of 16 months of baseline data collection: 1 June 2007 to 30 September 2008. The rationale 
for the intervention period beginning in October 2008 for the CI was the completion of the 
first two phases of the action cycle (Figure 2) by almost all women’s groups by September 
2008; and the rationale for the quality improvement intervention was the completion of the 
first 90-day action cycle by the end of September 2008 following the relaunch of the 
intervention in the randomized health centres in July 2008.
Randomization
Following the study design (Figure 4) clusters were allocated to each, both or no 
intervention with a random number sequence generated in Stata 7 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX, USA). Randomization was stratified by the two interventions and by district, so 
that the numbers of intervention and control clusters in each district were balanced. To 
ensure concealment of intervention allocation, identification numbers were assigned for each

cluster and a random number generated for each. The random numbers were sorted in 
ascending order, and a new ‘order’ variable generated. This sequence was used to allocate to 
each of the four intervention groups in each district. The sequence was concealed until 
interventions were assigned. SLgenerated the allocation sequence and assigned clusters to 
their groups in the presence of AC and MR. Given the nature of the interventions, neither 
participants nor those administering the interventions were blinded to group assignment. 
Those assessing the outcomes were also not blinded to group assignment. However, the 
analysis plan was prespecified and detailed in a Stata .do file before the final analysis was 
carried out.
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcome measures for both interventions were maternal, neonatal and perinatal 
mortality (Supplementary Box 1), assessed by monthly community surveillance of all 
pregnant women and their infants until 2 months after delivery throughout the 27-month 
intervention period. Any deaths of mothers or infants were followed-up with a verbal 
autopsy interview to verify and establish the cause of death.
Secondary outcome measures were: for both interventions: percentage of deliveries at a 
health facility; at facility level (for the quality improvement trial): percentage of maternal 
deaths subjected to maternal death audit, case–fatality rates, practice of signal obstetric care; 
at community level (for the women’s group trial): number of women’s groups mobilized 
annually (see below), percentage of pregnant women attending women’s groups. These were 
determined through monthly community surveillance, monthly health facility surveillance 
and collection of process data on the interventions.
Community surveillance of births and deaths
Within each cluster (Figure 4) a population of approximately 4000 was randomly chosen as 
follows. We enumerated the size of the catchment populations of health surveillance 
assistants (HSA; government community health workers; initial average HSA catchment 
area size was a population of 2000) and then randomly chose HSAs from each cluster until a 
population of roughly 4000 was gained using the Complex Samples procedure in SPSS 14 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Some cluster populations were significantly less or more 
than the desired 4000 population due to the large size of some HSA areas.
Village volunteers, called KIs, collected data for and were supervised by the HSAs. They 
recorded monthly data on pregnancies, miscarriages, abortions, stillbirths, live births, 
neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and place of delivery using a standard form. The form was 
translated into Chichewa, the main local language.
KIs were selected by local chiefs and MaiKhanda staff: criteria included literacy, basic 
numeracy, living locally and having the trust of the community. They went house to house to 
elicit the status of any pregnant women/new mothers every month, and covered about 50 
households, or one village, typically following around five women each month. They were 
given T-shirts, and small allowances at quarterly refresher trainings. HSAs collected their 
forms each month and passed them on to MaiKhanda supervisors. Each HSA supervised 
around 5–10 KIs, and were paid small allowances at monthly meetings, and used the data

collected by the KI for their own reports. HSAs were involved in surveillance only and not 
in either intervention.
Overall about 1800 KIs, worked in around 1900 villages throughout the three districts (the 
precise numbers changed throughout the surveillance as new hamlets were formed). 
Surveillance covered 8% of the rural population of Lilongwe district (around 150 000), 15% 
of Kasungu (90 000) and 21% of Salima (70 000).
Data quality control
To ensure good quality data there was comprehensive training and monthly refresher 
meetings for KIs and HSAs by 11 monitoring and evaluation officers (MEOs) who were 
supervised by two evaluation investigators (BN and TC). Where data was unclear, callbacks 
to the woman or community were made. Unclear data on deaths were prioritized. Two 
trained data clerks entered data into a Microsoft Access database with validation rules. 
Duplicate records of women and newborn infants were identified and removed from the 
database, and the assignment of all women and all deaths in the database to the correct 
cluster and district was checked and amended as necessary. Deaths were verified by verbal 
autopsy interview with relatives of the mother or infant who died. A simple algorithm based 
on movement, breathing and crying of the baby was used to differentiate between stillbirths 
and neonatal deaths (see appendix 4 in the project technical report9).
Statistical analysis
Sample size was determined using Hayes’ method with intercluster coefficient of variation.
21 The final sample size was limited by the number of health facilities as the unit of 
randomization. The hypotheses being tested by the RCT were that each intervention would 
reduce maternal mortality by 30% (i.e. from 984 deaths per 100 000 at baseline to 688 
deaths per 100 000) and neonatal mortality by 30% (i.e. from 27 to 19 deaths per 1000). 
Baseline data showed that the maternal mortality ratio was 415 instead of 984 deaths per 100 
000 live births, so the power of the RCT to detect a 30% reduction was reduced to 36% 
(rather than the recommended 80% as originally designed). The RCT had an 80% power to 
detect reductions in maternal mortality ratio of 50% or larger. The power to detect a 30% 
reduction in neonatal mortality rate remained good at 98%: baseline neonatal mortality rate 
was 30.7/1000. The observed intracluster correlation coefficients in control clusters during 
the intervention period were 0.00118 for maternal and 0.00213 for neonatal, differing 
slightly to those reported earlier using preliminary data.22
RCT analysis plan
Analyses were conducted in Stata 11.2 for Mac and planned in advance. After cleaning, data 
quality was assessed using cluster summaries of the percentages of women with no outcome 
data (loss to follow-up), maternal deaths with no verification, and stillbirths and neonatal 
deaths with no verification.
Descriptive analyses of time trends, annotated by baseline and intervention periods, for each 
of the primary outcome measures, by RCT arm and by district, assessed intervention effects 
and also initial balancing of the RCT arms with respect to baseline mortality rates.

Cluster-level analyses were made of intervention effects on mortality by weighted t test of 
cluster mortality rate summaries, taking stratification by district into account.21 
Comparisons were made with and without the other intervention, and with and without 
adjustment for baseline mortality rates and other potential confounders such as health 
facility delivery, nurse/delivery ratio at health centre, signal function availability at health 
centre, baseline staff psychology score at health centre, urban/periurban/rural setting, access 
to health centre by tar road, health centre being either government-run or run by the 
Christian Health Association of Malawi, and clusters being tobacco estate areas (lots of 
migration) or not. Data for these confounders were collected during the baseline period (1 
June 2007 to 30 September 2008), except for the nurse delivery ratio, collected by survey in 
2010. The data, other than mortality, were collected from the health centres.9 The effect of 
each variable on mortality rates was assessed by descriptive univariate analyses followed by 
a stepwise logistic regression analysis of all variables.23
The cluster-level analyses were repeated at individual level using logistic regression with 
random effects by cluster.21 The results of these models are the primary results reported in 
this paper. Given that no data on individual level covariates was collected, adjustments were 
only made for cluster-level covariates. We adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing by 
adjusting reported p values of the primary outcomes using the Holm correction, which, when 
using a 5% significance level, adjusts the p value of each p < 0.05 result according to how 
many p < 0.05 results there are.24
We conducted the following secondary and exploratory analyses: analysis of the secondary 
outcome measures; assessment of trends in intervention effects (given changes to the dosage 
and content of the interventions) by splitting the intervention period into two: October 2008 
to September 2009 and October 2009 to December 2010, the latter period being when the 
dosage of the FI was increased and when the task forces were added to the CI.
The data monitoring committee did not foresee any adverse effects of the interventions, so 
we did not apply stopping rules, interim analyses were not planned because they would have 
reduced power, and safety issues were not considered a problem.
Additional analyses
Causes of perinatal and neonatal deaths were determined using the InterVA method.25 
Process evaluation studies on health worker motivation and psychology, clinical knowledge 
of health workers, availability of human and material resources, the running of women’s 
groups using volunteers, and the success of the interventions with respect to their dosage, 
fidelity of implementation and sustainability, and contextual factors are reported elsewhere.9 
Analysis of quality improvement efforts at nine hospitals, not in the RCT is in the project 
technical report.9 A detailed economic evaluation was conducted. Here we present headline 
results of the preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis.

Results
After consideration of the CONSORT guidelines,26 deviations from protocol, and approval 
by the external data monitoring committee, changes were made to the number of clusters 
included in the final analysis and the trial profile is shown in Figure 5.
During the baseline period, the recorded loss to follow-up to birth outcomes was 19% and 
during the intervention it was 29%, with higher rates in later months. Given that observed 
birth rates in the study matched those expected from the crude birth rate1,27 to within 3%, 
and that in-migration probably broadly matched out-migration, many of the pregnancies 
recorded by KIs as ‘lost to follow-up’ may have been recorded as pregnancies by mistake 
and true loss-to-follow-up was probably much lower; there was little difference in loss-to-
follow-up between arms.9 All 102 maternal deaths were verified—either through initial 
verbal autopsy (51) or by callbacks to the family later (51). A total of 300/2088 (14.4%) 
stillbirths and neonatal deaths remained unverified, despite a large catchup activity, with 
most women untraceable. The percentage unverified did not differ significantly by RCT arm. 
Despite verbal autopsy, some stillbirths could not be categorized correctly as macerated or 
fresh, nor neonatal deaths as early or late, necessary for calculation of perinatal and neonatal 
mortality rates (see Supplementary Box 1 definitions). There were no significant differences 
between the percentages of uncategorized stillbirths and neonatal deaths by RCT arm.
Table 1 shows potential confounding cluster-level variables at baseline for which we have 
data. Observed differences in baseline mortality, skilled birth attendance, urban, access by 
tar road, type of facility and tobacco estates were small and the variables were included in 
adjusted models if associated with the mortality outcome in question. Results of adjusted 
models were only slightly different to unadjusted models,9 and are not reported here.
When unadjusted for clustering or the factorial nature of the trial, there appeared to be a 
decline in stillbirths and perinatal deaths in the CI areas, and combined CI and FI area, 
relative to the other areas (Table 2). Splitting the intervention period into two, with the latter 
period representing increased dosage in the quality improvement, and increased time for 
effect and addition of task forces in the women’s groups (Supplementary Table 1) showed 
changes in mortality rates over time.
We observed a significant 22% reduction in neonatal mortality in the combined intervention 
clusters compared with the control arm (Table 3; OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.60–1.01; p = 0.057). 
The CI and FI in combination led to a reduction from 34 to 27 neonatal deaths per 1000. We 
also observed a 16% reduction in perinatal mortality (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.97), in 
women’s group areas, adjusting for clustering, stratification and the presence of the quality 
improvement intervention (Table 3;p = 0.020), a reduction from 56 to 48 perinatal deaths per 
1000. Our data were consistent with a 33% reduction in the relatively low rate of late 
neonatal deaths (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035; Table 3) in the facility 
improvement arm. We did not observe any significant reduction in neonatal or maternal 
mortality in women’s group areas. There was also no reduction in maternal, perinatal or 
neonatal mortality in quality improvement intervention areas. The results of the adjusted

logistic regression analyses were similar but weaker to those of the unadjusted analyses and 
are presented in the technical report.9
Splitting the intervention period in two (to reflect the greater intensity in the second half of 
project implementation), and considering the cause of death data, suggests the observed 
effect of the combined FI and CI on neonatal mortality may have been mediated by 
reductions in mortality due to asphyxia, prematurity and sepsis, in both the early and late 
neonatal periods. The effect was mainly observed in the last, more intensive, 15 months of 
the intervention period, when it was larger (a 28% reduction; p = 0.084; Table 4); and, the 
effect of the CI on perinatal mortality may have been mediated through a reduction of 
stillbirths during the first 12 months of the intervention period and through a reduction in 
early neonatal mortality due to sepsis, prematurity and asphyxia in the second period of the 
study (Table 4). The internal consistency of the effects of both interventions on stillbirths 
and early and late neonatal deaths (the components of perinatal and neonatal mortality) is 
depicted in Figure 6. Increasing stillbirths and perinatal mortality in all areas, including the 
control area (Supplementary Table 1), is indicative of a secular trend rather than to do with 
dosage of the interventions. It is not clear why mortality rose at this time.
Given the observed number of births and deaths in each arm of the randomized trial the 
probability (calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution) that a 30% 
reduction in maternal mortality really occurred as a result of the MaiKhanda interventions in 
the total population our sample sought to represent (intervention areas vs control areas) was 
1% for the FI and 28% for the CI.
Secondary outcome measures are reported in Table 5. While it was hypothesized that the CI 
would positively impact on both the decision and activity of women seeking skilled delivery, 
women’s groups had no effect on increasing health facility deliveries over and above the 
rapid increase observed in all areas (Table 5; Supplementary Figure 1) in line with the 
increase observed between the 2004 DHS survey (57%)1 and the 2010 DHS (73%).2 There 
were very few maternal deaths at health centres, which made comparison of FI intervention 
effects difficult. Neonatal case–fatality rates were low and not different between FI and 
control facilities. Fresh stillbirth rates were also low and were lower in FI facilities than 
control facilities in the intervention period. Although essential support systems were 
identified as one of the ‘key drivers’ of improved care, the availability of obstetric care 
signal functions were equally low across all comparison groups (Table 5), reflecting the fact 
that the health system is seriously under-resourced in Malawi.28,29
The proportion of newly pregnant women who attended women’s groups was 10% and the 
percentage of members who had never had children before was also low at 2%; we estimate 
a population coverage of approximately 1 women’s group to 1200 population.9 Given the 
results of recently published studies10,12 low coverage may help to explain a lower impact 
than Asian studies.
The effect of the CI on perinatal mortality and the effect of the FI and CI combined on 
neonatal mortality are highly cost- effective by WHO criteria (less than the per capita GDP

of Malawi per disability-adjusted life-year averted, which is less than US$5400 per stillbirth 
or neonatal death averted).
Discussion
In rural Malawi a combined facility improvement and women’s group community 
intervention reduced neonatal mortality by 22%, and a women’s group intervention alone 
reduced perinatal mortality by 16%, compared with control areas. No other study has 
measured the impact of supply and demand side interventions in Africa on maternal and 
newborn care, and population mortality outcomes, using a trial design.
Our results also suggest that the women’s groups had a greater effect on perinatal and early 
neonatal mortality, and the facility improvement on late neonatal mortality. The effects on 
mortality were greater in the latter stages of the effectiveness trial (Table 4), when the 
‘dosage’ and implementation improved. Most newborn mortality reduction (due to the 
higher proportion of early neonatal deaths) arose probably from community mobilization, 
but was enhanced by efforts to improve quality at facilities. Larger effects of both 
interventions might be expected with more concentrated implementation.
Our study had limitations: use of a simple, large-scale surveillance system using KIs and 
government health workers may have led to some errors in stillbirth and neonatal death 
categorization. Without individual level covariates we were only able to undertake limited 
adjusted analyses using cluster-level covariates. After initial randomization we excluded 
several clusters when baseline information indicated that no deliveries took place at the 
health facilities (dispensaries) there. This exclusion was made before the start of the trial so 
we consider this does not break the intention to treat principle. The CEmOC hospital 
facilities excluded from the RCT were also undergoing quality improvement and women 
from both intervention and control areas delivered at these facilities. However, data from 
verbal autopsies show that only 19% of neonatal deaths and 51% of maternal deaths took 
place in these facilities rather than in health centres (17% neonatal deaths; 13% maternal 
deaths) or communities (56% neonatal deaths; 34% maternal deaths) and that these 
percentages were similar across all four RCT arms. The intervention effects we have 
measured are obviously independent of happenings at the CEmOCs. The verbal autopsy data 
also shows that <4% of deaths took place in other arms of the RCT from where the birth 
took place, meaning that ‘contamination’ between RCT arms is likely to have been minimal. 
‘Spillover’ of intervention effects is also likely to have been minimal: for the CI because the 
influence of the women’s groups were contained within groups of villages under the same 
group village headmen, which are typically always within the same health facility catchment 
area (study cluster). In addition, opportunities for health centre clinicians to share quality 
improvement knowledge to clinicians in control health centres were very limited. The 
quality improvement and women’s group process evaluation was limited by the scale and 
resources of the intervention programme and the availability of government health services, 
in particular systems available for collection of routine health delivery data. Behaviour 
change interventions take time to work, so it is possible that stronger effects on service 
quality improvement and community mobilization will emerge with time. Quality 
improvement at district level in Malawi takes time to establish, and requires staff stability,

leadership, training and ongoing support from district staff trained in quality improvement 
methods. The programme faced difficulties with each of these components in taking the 
programme to scale. Likewise, considerable effort, resources and commitment from the 
MoH and supporting NGOs are required to reach the concentration of women’s groups per 
population (1:500–750) to produce optimal improvements in neonatal mortality. This study 
achieved a lower coverage of 1:1200.
Our process evaluation showed a wide range of strategies implemented by women’s groups, 
with the most frequently implemented strategies being health education, voluntary testing 
and counselling for HIV/AIDS, village savings and loans, bednets, vegetable gardens and 
bicycle ambulances. Any of these strategies may have contributed to reductions in stillbirths 
and early neonatal deaths.9 For example, health education directed at antenatal, delivery and 
postnatal care could have improved corresponding practices, bicycle ambulances could have 
reduced delays in getting to health facilities, and village savings and loans could have 
enabled faster transport and provision of resources for mothers and infants. The strategies 
are proxy measures for communities having built their capacities to take control of mother 
and child health issues. This is an important mechanism through which women’s groups 
work—they help communities to take control of and address the social determinants of 
health (through empowerment) as well as the behavioural determinants (the strategies and 
behaviour changes).
The quality improvement intervention, in enhancing newborn mortality reduction from the 
combined intervention, appeared to have most effect on late neonatal deaths (Table 3). There 
was no clear evidence for the impact of specific quality improvement activities at the health 
centres on clinical practices such as identification of high-risk pregnant women and blood 
donors, or emergency obstetric referrals, although the linkage of improved clinical processes 
and outcomes may have been missed due to limited record keeping.9 Our data on signal 
functions at health centres shows no striking changes between the intervention and control 
health centres. Although fresh stillbirth rates were lower in quality improvement health 
centres, there was no effect of the intervention on neonatal case–fatality rates.
The lack of effect of either intervention on maternal mortality may reflect underdosing. The 
rapid increase in health facility delivery in Malawi, after the policy change regarding 
community births (Supplementary Figure 1), may have overwhelmed the poorly resourced 
health facilities, countering any benefits of the two interventions on women’s health. The 
potential for quality improvement to affect maternal deaths at the health facilities was 
limited because case–fatality rates at the health centres were very low and most deaths 
occurred at locations that were outside these centres—either in the community or at the 
referral hospitals. The combined CI and FI intervention together, but not alone, produced an 
effect on neonatal mortality rate, perhaps explained by weak independent effects which, 
when applied together achieved significance (Figure 6). Independent effects might have been 
detected if the interventions were fully dosed.
We know of no other randomized trials testing the effects of facility quality improvement 
interventions, or both facility and community interventions combined, on neonatal (or 
perinatal or maternal) mortality. Bhutta and colleagues30 concluded that strategies

enhancing the skills of community health worker cadres demonstrated impact on stillbirths 
especially in combination with health systems strengthening activities. The Warmi project in 
Bolivia16 developed community mobilization through women’s groups. Subsequently, 
randomized trials to test the impact of women’s groups on neonatal mortality in Nepal,11 
Jharkhand and Orissa in India10 and Bangladesh12 respectively, showed reductions of 30%, 
45% and no significant fall in neonatal mortality. Effect sizes vary depending upon baseline 
mortality rates and levels of coverage by women’s groups, especially of newly pregnant 
women, and also contextual factors. Other studies, Hala in Pakistan31 and Shivgarh in India,
32 which combined community mobilization and community health worker interventions 
showed neonatal mortality reductions of 15% and 54% respectively, although the latter was a 
small trial terminated after only 15 months.
A large review of quality improvement projects in poor settings showed better compliance 
with healthcare standards and improvement in health processes or outcomes for maternal 
and neonatal health, malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS.14 However, none of the outcomes were 
mortality rates; also the studies were uncontrolled and the data self-reported.14 An earlier 
systematic review13 on the evidence for quality improvement collaboratives, identified 57 
(from a total of 72) studies that were based on the breakthrough series collaboratives. Seven 
were controlled, and one a RCT evaluating the breakthrough series integrated with the 
chronic care model. This trial did not show an effect on processes or intermediate outcomes 
of care for children with asthma.33 An update of the review found 10 controlled studies. Of 
these, two were RCTs: one showed no effect and the other showed an effect on two out of 
three processes but no effect on outcomes. Of the eight non-randomized, controlled studies, 
seven showed a positive effect on some of the selected effect parameters and one no effect.
34 The USAID funded Health Care Improvement (HCI) project for maternal and newborn 
care in Niger35 looked mainly at performance measures but did not report on primary 
outcomes. Quality improvement based on performance and standards of care has recently 
also been evaluated in Malawi in a before and after study, but showed limited results and did 
not report on mortality outcomes.36
Ovretveit and Staines speak about an ‘investment threshold’ before quality improvement 
efforts start showing results.37 Initial investments in quality improvement do not necessarily 
show positive results but are important for institutionalization in the Malawian health care 
setting. The Zambian Quality Assurance Program established in 1993 covered the entire 
nation with a network of quality assurance coaches and trainers but the capacity to sustain 
quality assurance activities remained a challenge.38 It is unclear whether quality 
improvement approaches are more sustainable than quality assurance approaches in low-
income settings. The Niger healthcare improvement project also had limited success in 
institutionalizing the quality improvement packages at scale for essential obstetric and 
neonatal care.35
Deming, who pioneered the use of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles in quality improvement in the 
1950s, emphasized the importance of long term commitment of management and leadership 
to transformation, and that those expecting quick results would be disappointed.39 Our study 
suggests that reducing facility case–fatality requires staff stability, leadership, training, 
Colbourn et al.

ongoing support from district staff trained in quality improvement methods and external 
coaches who should make frequent visits.
We saw no trends in differences in population-level maternal mortality (Table 3), and no 
significant changes in maternal case–fatality rates (MCFR) between intervention and control 
health centres (Table 5), nor any significant impact on case–fatality of quality improvement 
work during 4 years at the nine non-randomized hospitals (median MCFRs were 381 deaths 
per 100 000 cases during January 2007 to December 2008, 266 during January 2009 to May 
2010 and 310 during June 2010 to November 2011).9 Available process data on timing, 
dosage and focus, and on changes in causes of maternal death do not support a clear effect of 
the quality improvement on case–fatality at the nine CEmOCs.9 The observed early decrease 
in CEmOC MCFR was partially reversed in the second half of the period under review, 
possibly due to the overwhelming of resource-limited facilities by the surge in mothers 
seeking skilled deliveries over this period (due to a 2007 government ban on deliveries by 
traditional birth attendants).9 Probably, greater attention is needed on the ‘golden hour’ and 
‘silver 6 hours’ of resuscitation and stabilization of severely sick mothers when they arrive at 
hospitals or health centres to make inroads into case–fatality. The quality improvement work 
in the nine CEmOCs did not have significant effects on neonatal case–fatality rates.9
Current Ministry of Health policy supports quality improvement and community 
mobilization interventions in principle,40–42 but resource allocation remains a major 
problem. Malawi has a double burden of HIV/AIDS and a human resource crisis.43 Our 
evaluation showed that health centres were severely under-resourced for the seven BEmOC 
signal functions and for human resources. Deficiencies of drugs and human resources were 
key factors impeding the essential health package across Malawi.29 Essential support 
systems were key drivers for change identified by the programme implementers.
Taking both interventions to scale at adequate coverage will need finance, integration with 
the Malawian Ministry of Health programme and technical assistance developed within 
country. There is a pressing need for further evaluation of how to achieve lasting impact at 
scale.
Conclusions
Key conclusions for low-income countries like Malawi are that both communities and 
facilities should be targeted for improvement, and sufficient intensity must be delivered. The 
FI and CI in combination reduced neonatal mortality by 22% and had a greater effect (28% 
reduction, p = 0.084) in the later period (Table 4), when the intensity of the FI was greater, 
women’s groups were augmented by 365 task forces, and more time had elapsed. With 
major improvements in signal functions at facilities,9 the combined approach might reduce 
mortality rates more effectively, given rapidly rising deliveries in health centres and 
hospitals.
Both FI and CI improve motivation, solidarity, networks, and confidence in decision-
making, which enable women and health workers to find solutions to problems. Both work 
to develop strategies and evaluate success using data. But there are also differences. CI

focuses more on prevention (hygiene, infant feeding, social support) and the underlying 
causes of mortality (social isolation, poor nutrition, dangerous traditional practices, delays in 
seeking care). FI focuses more on improving the reliability of treatment of immediate 
causes, such as better management of haemorrhage or shock or asphyxia; and the data 
demands for women’s groups are less rigorous than for FI.
An integrated community and facility approach may be the best approach to reduce 
mortality. CI can hold facilities to account, and improved service quality enhances care-
seeking. We cannot assume that quality improvement techniques, efficacious in a developed 
country setting, will transfer easily to resource-poor settings, so further rigorous evaluation 
is needed. However, as social and system interventions44 which improve birth outcomes and 
are highly cost-effective by WHO criteria,9 both deserve consideration for national and 
international policy.

CI: community intervention; FI: facilities intervention; HC: health centre; MMR: maternal mortality ratio; NMR: neonatal mortality rate; PMR: 
perinatal mortality rate.
aNo other data on characteristics of women, e.g. tribe, age, socioeconomic status or parity, was collected due to the simple and low-cost nature of 
the community surveillance system.
bDifferences are not tested for statistical significance as, given the randomization process, the null hypothesis of no difference is already true, and 
any significant differences that were found would be due to chance.
