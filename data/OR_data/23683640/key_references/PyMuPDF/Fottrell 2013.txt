Abstract
Importance—Community-based interventions can reduce neonatal mortality when health 
systems are weak. Population coverage of target groups may be an important determinant of their 
effect on behavior and mortality. A women’s group trial at coverage of 1 group per 1414 
population in rural Bangladesh showed no effect on neonatal mortality, despite a similar 
intervention having a significant effect on neonatal and maternal death in comparable settings.
Objective—To assess the effect of a participatory women’s group intervention with higher 
population coverage on neonatal mortality in Bangladesh.
Design—A cluster randomized controlled trial in 9 intervention and 9 control clusters.
Setting—Rural Bangladesh.
Participants—Women permanently residing in 18 unions in 3 districts and accounting for 19 
301 births during the final 24 months of the intervention.
Interventions—Women’s groups at a coverage of 1 per 309 population that proceed through a 
participatory learning and action cycle in which they prioritize issues that affected maternal and 
neonatal health and design and implement strategies to address these issues.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Neonatal mortality rate.
Results—Analysis included 19 301 births during the final 24 months of the intervention. More 
than one-third of newly pregnant women joined the groups. The neonatal mortality rate was 
significantly lower in the intervention arm (21.3 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births vs 30.1 per 
1000 in control areas), a reduction in neonatal mortality of 38% (risk ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 
0.43-0.89]) when adjusted for socioeconomic factors. The cost-effectiveness was US $220 to $393 
per year of life lost averted. Cause-specific mortality rates suggest reduced deaths due to infections 
and those associated with prematurity/low birth weight. Improvements were seen in hygienic 
home delivery practices, newborn thermal care, and breastfeeding practices.
Conclusions and Relevance—Women’s group community mobilization, delivered at 
adequate population coverage, is a highly cost-effective approach to improve newborn survival and 
health behavior indicators in rural Bangladesh.

Community-based interventions have the potential to reduce neonatal mortality, as 
demonstrated by cluster randomized trials of participatory women’s groups in rural Nepal1 
and India2 that showed a 30% to 45% reduction in neonatal mortality. A similar women’s 
group trial in Bangladesh,3 however, showed no impact on neonatal mortality. A possible 
explanation for the absence of effect was the lower population coverage of women’s groups 
(approximately 1 group per 1414 population) compared with the studies in India (1 per 468) 
and Nepal (1 per 756). In particular, the coverage of pregnant women, a key target group for

the intervention, was only 3% in Bangladesh compared with 55% in the final study year in 
India.
Given that participatory women’s groups are low-cost and potentially highly effective and 
scalable,4 we wished to assess the effect of the intervention at higher population coverage in 
Bangladesh. We hypothesized that the intervention delivered at higher coverage could 
reduce neonatal mortality by at least 30% and improve home care practices and health care 
use for pregnant women and newborns and their mothers.
Methods
Intervention and Study Design
We used a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the participatory 
learning and action cycle with women’s groups when delivered at higher population 
coverage in 18 “unions” in 3 districts (Bogra, Molavibazar, and Faridpur) of rural 
Bangladesh. Unions are the lowest administrative unit in Bangladesh, representing a 
geographically adjacent collection of villages. To fully assess the effect of scale-up of the 
women’s groups, the same intervention and control unions were used as for the earlier 
2005-2007 trial.3 Randomization for that trial is described elsewhere.3,5 It involved the 
purposeful selection of the 3 districts on the basis of having active Diabetic Association of 
Bangladesh offices and some-what representing the social and geographical diversity of 
Bangladesh.5 Per district, 2 upazillas (subdistricts) and, per upazilla, 3 unions were 
purposefully sampled on the basis of perceived limited access to perinatal health care and 
feasible accessibility from Diabetic Association of Bangladesh district headquarters. The 6 
unions (clusters) in each district (stratum) were randomly allocated to either intervention or 
control by blindly pulling pieces of paper, each representing 1 union, from a bottle. The 
allocation sequence had been decided on before drawing the papers.
In intervention areas, 648 new groups were formed by newly recruited facilitators in addition 
to the 162 women’s groups set up in the intervention areas as part of the 2005-2007 trial. 
The 162 “old” groups continued to meet monthly from late 2004 until the end of June 2011, 
during which their focus expanded beyond maternal and newborn health to include the 
health of children younger than 5 years of age and women’s health. From January 2009, the 
648 “new” groups proceeded through a cycle of monthly meetings on maternal and newborn 
health, giving a coverage of 1 per 386 population. The combined 810 women’s groups 
constituted a coverage of 1 group per 309 population. The nature of the intervention means 
that allocation was not masked. All unions, irrespective of allocation arm, received health 
system–strengthening initiatives from the Diabetic Association of Bangladesh–Perinatal 
Care Project. These included the provision of basic medical equipment, traditional birth 
attendant training in essential newborn care, physician training, and establishing links 
between communities and health services.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The trial ran from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011. The period from January to December 
2008 was designated the baseline period, and the period from January to June 2009 was

designated the scale-up period, leaving 24 months between July 2009 and June 2011 for 
impact evaluation. The study participants were women whose childbirth or death was 
recorded in the study areas. A prospective surveillance system recorded all deaths during 
pregnancy and for up to 6 weeks postpartum and all births taking place in the study areas 
and their outcomes.6 Each of approximately 500 key informants, all traditional birth 
attendants, received an honorarium for identifying births and pregnancy-related and newborn 
deaths in the study areas. Each traditional birth attendant was visited fortnightly by monitors 
who collected details of all registered events. The monitor subsequently verified all events 
through household visits and further asked household members if they were aware of any 
other births or deaths in their community to ensure complete capture of these vital events.
Between 6 and 52 weeks after the event, the monitors revisited households to gather data on 
background characteristics, home care practices, and health care use. In the event of a 
stillbirth or a neonatal- or pregnancy-related death, data on the signs, symptoms, and 
circumstances of death were collected using structured verbal autopsy questions 
administered to the mother or other close caregiver.
Data were checked for quality and completeness in the district offices, and errors were 
referred back to the field. Between 10% and 20% of questions in 10% to 20% of the 
completed interviews were randomly selected for verification in the field by revisiting 
respondents to check the accuracy and completeness of data collected. Verified data were 
sent to Dhaka, Bangladesh, for data entry into a Microsoft Access database where further 
quality assurance took place. Process evaluation data were collected from monthly women’s 
group attendance registers and from a 2009 cross-sectional survey of women’s group 
members’ socioeconomics and basic demographics.4,7
Statistical Analysis
The control areas in Moulavibazar included tea-garden estates, which differ from the 
majority of non–tea-garden Bangladesh in terms of socioeconomics and history. The 
majority of tea-garden estate residents work on the tea estates and are descendants of 
workers originating mostly from Orissa and Bihar, in India, who were brought to the area by 
the former British rulers. The relative socioeconomic disadvantage of tea-garden estates has 
been described previously.8,9 Given these underlying differences and as specified a priori in 
the study protocol, analyses were performed with and without the tea-garden residents.
Participants were assigned to the cluster in which their birth or death was registered, and the 
intention-to-treat analysis only included those who permanently resided in the study areas, 
as determined by the registration process. Analysis of secondary outcomes only included 
women who were successfully interviewed.
The trial’s primary end point was the neonatal mortality rate in the final 24 months of the 
30-month intervention implementation. All analyses were specified a priori in the trial 
protocol5 and were based on cluster-level summaries using regression techniques that took 
the stratified and clustered study design into account, using Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp 
LP). Process evaluation data from registers and implementation documents were used to 
estimate intervention coverage (groups per population and proportion of pregnant women

attending groups) and “dosage” received by women’s group members (average proportion of 
meetings attended) as described elsewhere.4
To account for potential confounding and to facilitate comparisons with the previous trial, 
adjustments for maternal age, maternal education, and household assets were made using a 
2-stage analysis. At the first stage, a regression model was fitted that incorporated the strata 
(as a fixed effect) and all co-variates of interest (but not the intervention effect). Fitted values 
from the model were used to compute a residual for each cluster, and these residuals then 
replaced the cluster-specific observations in the analysis, following the methods detailed by 
Hayes and Moulton (2009).10
Verbal autopsy data for neonatal deaths were analyzed using InterVA4 software, which uses 
Bayesian reasoning to identify likely causes of death and has been widely applied.11–14 
Aggregated cause-specific mortality fractions were used to derive cause-specific mortality 
rates by dividing the total number of deaths from each cause category by the total number of 
live births. Crude cause-specific rate ratios were derived using the Stata incidence rate ratio 
calculator.
We did not expect the intervention to have any adverse effects, and therefore we had no 
stopping rules. Interim analysis of the first 18 months of data was performed in June 2011 
and presented to a data safety monitoring board, and, again, interim analysis of the first 24 
months of data was performed in March 2012. The board, as well as the implementation and 
in-country monitoring and evaluation teams, were blind to the allocation arm on both 
occasions. The board recommended completion of the full trial period and a final analysis of 
data from July 2009 to June 2011, with and without the inclusion of tea-garden residents.
Cost-effectiveness
A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a provider perspective using methods 
consistent with similar trials of community participatory interventions.1,2,15 A description 
of methods is provided (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Ethics
Community consent was acquired for intervention implementation and monitoring activities. 
Individual informed consent was obtained before each interview. The trial was approved by 
the University College London research ethics committee (identification no. 1488/001) and 
the ethical review committee of the Diabetic Association of Bangladesh.
Results
Process
A total of 648 new women's groups were added to the pre–scale-up 162 groups. All new 
groups completed their first meeting in January 2009, and 198 groups had completed at least 
20 meetings by June 2011. The remaining 450 groups completed at least 20 meetings by 
September 2011, with various reasons being given for delays in holding meetings, including 
religious holidays, harvest commitments, and flooding.

Total population coverage was 1 group per 309 population and 386 for the new groups, an 
approximately 4- to 5-fold increase in coverage relative to pre–scale-up levels. There was 1 
women's group per 57 ever-married women of reproductive age, compared with 1 per 283 
prior to scale-up, and 23% of the 45 330 ever-married women living in the intervention areas 
and of reproductive age were women's group members. Approximately 36.8% of women 
who gave birth and were interviewed between July 2009 and June 2011 reported attending 
women's groups compared with 3% prior to scale-up. Average attendance at each women's 
group meeting in the newly formed groups was 21 women per group (range, 19-24 women). 
Process evaluation data indicated a mean age of participants of 31 years, and 95% of group 
members were 15 to 49 years of age. Approximately 3% of attendees were men. Attendees 
also included traditional birth attendants, health service providers, teachers, and community 
leaders. The intensity or “dose” of the exposure to the intervention among women's group 
members was estimated at 70%, meaning that, on average, women's group members were 
exposed to 14 of 20 meetings.
A total of 385 community meetings, organized by the groups after their 14th women’s group 
meeting, were held from March to August 2010, with approximately 43 000 community 
participants. Approximately one-third of participants at community meetings were men.
Recruitment
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the trial profile during the final 24 study months for the 
intervention and control arms, respectively. Including tea-garden residents, the estimated 
population size was 532 996 people, in 117 914 households, representing 99 998 women of 
reproductive age. A total of 25 594 events were registered during the final 24 months, for 
which 25 321 interviews were completed (99%) with a median follow-up time of 67 days 
following birth (interquartile range, 52-100 days). The interview completion rates were the 
same for both arms of the trial. The interview rates were slightly lower for neonatal deaths 
and stillbirths, and the follow-up times were slightly higher (median, 94 days; interquartile 
range, 58-174 days), largely owing to difficulties in tracking these families for an interview 
after the event.
Baseline Comparisons
Table 1 shows cluster-level summaries of the baseline characteristics of the study population, 
including cluster size. Sociodemographic indicators and primary and secondary outcome 
indictors were similar in both arms, irrespective of the inclusion of tea-garden residents. 
Baseline comparisons did not significantly change with the inclusion of tea-garden residents, 
except that more women with a primary education were in the intervention clusters than in 
the control clusters and that fewer Hindus were in the intervention clusters (10.4%) than in 
the control clusters (17.6%).
Impact Evaluation
The intention-to-treat analysis included 17 940 births over the final 24 study months, a mean 
of 997 births per cluster (19 315 births, 1073 per cluster when including tea-garden 
residents) and a coefficient of variation for neonatal mortality of 0.2. Analysis of home care 
practices and health care use was based on successfully completed interviews relating to 17 
Fottrell et al.

817 events (99%) (19 148 events [99%] when including tea-garden residents). The rate of 
completion of interviews was equally high in the intervention and control arms.
Table 2 presents the counts of births and deaths during the trial period, and Table 3 presents 
the mortality rates and rate ratios during the trial period. The crude neonatal mortality rate 
was 29% lower in intervention arm than in the control arm, increasing to 38% when adjusted 
for maternal age, maternal education, and household assets. The inclusion of tea-garden 
residents reduced the crude mortality rate to 35%, although adjustment for background 
factors reduced this effect and made the effect on the overall neonatal morality rate (but not 
the early neonatal morality rate) statistically nonsignificant. The risk ratios indicate that 
most of the survival gain was in the early neonatal period. Substantial reductions in stillbirth 
mortality in control areas were not observed in intervention areas, where the stillbirth 
mortality rate did not change over the trial period.
Gains were observed in hygienic home delivery practices, thermal care of the newborn, and 
feeding practices (Table 4). Quantitative gains in health service utilization were statistically 
significant only when including tea-garden residents (eTable in Supplement). Adjustment for 
socioeconomic indicators had little quantitative effect on the estimated intervention effect on 
secondary outcomes.
Cause of Death
Verbal autopsies for all deaths followed up with interview show that the major causes of 
neonatal mortality were infections, perinatal asphyxia, and complications associated with 
prematurity and low birth weight (Table 5). Notably, infection-specific mortality rates 
decreased in the intervention areas during the trial period but remained relatively stable in 
the control areas, and preterm/small-baby mortality rates decreased more in the intervention 
areas than in the control areas.
Cost-effectiveness
The prospective cost-effectiveness was US $11 974 ($10 053 with tea-garden residents) per 
neonatal death averted and $393 ($330 with tea-garden residents) per year of life lost 
averted. The estimated cost-effectiveness of going straight to scale is $7975 ($6695 with tea-
garden residents) per neonatal death averted and $261 ($220 with tea-garden residents) per 
year of life lost averted.
Discussion
Our trial showed that participatory women’s groups with high population coverage in 
Bangladesh strongly and statistically significantly reduced neonatal mortality. A 4- to 5-fold 
increase in population coverage of women’s groups was achieved, and more than one-third 
of pregnant women attended the groups. Intervention coverage at this scale, combined with 
active engagement with this target group of women, led to reductions in neonatal mortality 
of up to 38%. Gains in home delivery practices, essential newborn care, and feeding 
practices were also observed in the intervention clusters compared with the control clusters, 
which may explain part of the observed reduction in neonatal mortality. The evidence of the 
effect on health service utilization was less strong, with statistical significance only being

reached when intervention areas were compared with control areas that included tea-garden 
residents, who are typically more disadvantaged and thus less likely to access services. The 
cost-effectiveness of $220 to $393 per year of life lost averted is less than the Bangladesh 
gross domestic product per capita of $775 (in 2011), which indicates that the intervention is 
very cost-effective.16
This trial follows an earlier trial of women’s groups,3 delivered at lower coverage in the 
same areas, that showed no effect on neonatal mortality (risk ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 
0.80-1.09]). For pragmatic and practical reasons and to test the effect of scale-up and assess 
whether coverage is an important determinant of the success of the intervention, we used the 
same clusters and allocation arms as in the earlier trial.3 A difference-in-difference analysis, 
which accounted for the non-statistical difference in baseline neonatal mortality rates that 
favored the control areas, had a negligible effect on the estimated effect of the intervention 
(data not shown).
Of the 810 women’s groups evaluated, 162 were existing groups, which had been meeting 
from late 2004 onward, and 648 were new groups, which started in January 2009. We did 
not intend to separate out the effects of the old and new groups. Thus, any difference in 
outcomes between trial arms could, in theory, be due to either increased population coverage 
of groups from 1 group per 1414 population to 1 group per 309 population, as hypothesized, 
or a residual effect of the 162 original groups that have all continued to meet. Given that the 
previous trial of 162 groups showed no effect on primary and most secondary outcomes and 
that the 162 original groups have subsequently focused largely on the postneonatal period, 
we expect that the observed effect on primary and secondary outcomes in the present trial is 
mainly due to increased coverage of new women’s groups addressing maternal and neonatal 
health issues.
We expect that the prospective key-informant surveillance system used in this study captures 
most, if not all, births and deaths in our study areas. Exceptions may be deaths in early 
pregnancy, in which a woman’s pregnancy status at the time of death may remain unknown. 
The reported pregnancy-related mortality rate may therefore be underestimated, although the 
proportion of pregnancy-related deaths in early pregnancy is generally small, so the absolute 
number of missed events is also likely to be small. A further potential limitation of the 
system is that classification of deaths as stillbirths or neonatal deaths depends on lay 
reporting and could, in theory, be misclassified. The monitoring and evaluation 
questionnaire, which had an extremely high response rate of 99% in both arms, can correct 
for this to a certain extent in that it gathers information on signs of life after delivery.
Verbal autopsy results suggest that the intervention reduced deaths due to infections and 
prematurity or low birth weight. This plausibly correlates with improvements in hygienic 
delivery and essential newborn care practices and is supported by the observation that most 
of the survival gains were in the first week of life, when most deaths due to prematurity/low 
birth weight and approximately half of the deaths due to infections are likely to occur.17
Our findings add to the growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of women’s groups in 
low-income settings. Trials from rural South Asia provide strong evidence of the effects of

women’s groups on neonatal mortality rates, with reductions ranging from 30% in Nepal to 
45% in India,1,2 although, as demonstrated in the work from Bangladesh, coverage matters. 
An evaluation of the intervention in Mumbai, India, showed no effect on mortality 
outcomes, with More et al18 suggesting that transient populations, low-baseline mortality 
rates, poor social cohesion, and a dynamic environment hindered the collective action and 
resulted in the diffusion of messages in urban slum areas. Issues of coverage and the 
participation of women of reproductive age were also highlighted18 that reinforced the 
findings of the present study that population coverage and the appropriate targeting of the 
intervention are important factors for success. Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that 
population-level improvements in neonatal mortality require interventions that address both 
the supply side and the demand side of health care.
In conclusion, population coverage of women’s groups and the extent to which they reach 
target groups are important determinants of their success. Even at high coverage, the 
intervention is highly cost-effective and could improve maternal and neonatal health in 
Bangladesh and other rural settings.
