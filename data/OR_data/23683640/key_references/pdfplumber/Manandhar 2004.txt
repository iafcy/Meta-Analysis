Makwanpur trial was a cluster-randomised controlled
trial of such an intervention in a rural mountainous area
of Nepal. The trial tested a large-scale intervention, using
facilitators to work with women’s groups in a population
of 170000 covering 1600 km2. A cluster design was
chosen because the intervention was structured around
communities rather than individuals.

For estimated baseline mortality rates, participants in

290neonatal deaths in the 5 years preceding our census
(neonatal mortality rate 25·4 per 1000 livebirths).
Participants in control clusters recalled 12132 livebirths
and 304 neonatal deaths (neonatal mortality rate 25·1

pooled data showed that neonatal mortality rates were
higher in intervention than control clusters in four pairs,
similar in four pairs, and higher in control than
intervention clusters in four pairs. Although valid for
cluster comparison, the prospective findings in the same
population suggest that maternity histories substantially
underestimated actual neonatal mortality rates.
