strategies, and assessed the results. Although some
strategies were common, each group was free to
implement its own combination of strategies. The
intervention team adapted facilitation materials from
the study in Makwanpur, Nepal, to guide the meetings.5
Groups used methods such as picture-card games, role
play, and story-telling to help discussions about the
causes and eff ects of typical problems in mothers and
infants, and devised strategies for prevention, home-
care support, and consultations (fi gure 5).
Health-service inputs
We formed health committees in all intervention and
control clusters so that community members would have
the opportunity to express their opinions about the
design and management of local health services. About
ten village representatives within every cluster met once
every 2 months and used a structured action cycle to
discuss maternal and newborn health entitlement issues.
As a result, committee members became more
knowledgable about the government health system and

not clearly discernable because there was a reduction in
all causes (table 6). The incremental cost of the women’s
group intervention was US$910 per newborn life saved,
increasing to $1308 (in 2007 prices) when health-service
strengthening activities were included. The incremental
cost per life-year saved was $33 for the women’s group
intervention ($48 inclusive of health-service strength-
ening activities). The women’s group interv ention in
this setting was therefore more cost eff ective than that
reported in Nepal5 as a result of the greater eff ect of
women’s groups on NMR combined with lower
operating costs in the current context.
Discussion
Women’s groups led by peer facilitators reduced NMR
and moderate maternal depression at low cost in largely
tribal, rural populations of eastern India. Our data show
that mortality reduction in underserved rural settings
was not associated with increased care-seeking
behaviour or health-service use. The most likely
mechanism of mortality reduction was through
improved hygiene and care practices. The availability of
safe delivery kits increased in both control and
intervention areas, but women’s groups seemed to
generate more demand in intervention clusters than in
control clusters. In places where kits were not provided,
group members made them and provided information
about their contents to mothers, then visited pregnant
women during the eighth month of pregnancy to ensure
that they had received kits and would use them. Birth
outcomes might have been aff ected by the fact that
these community members attended the groups or
were advised by group members, thus generating
increased social awareness and support for clean
delivery practices.

strategies to avoid maternal deaths
A woman in the eighth month of her pregnancy, and her
mother-in-law attended a monthly women’s group
meeting where they participated in a drill based on what to
do in the event of post-partum bleeding. After a month,
when the woman delivered at home and had severe
bleeding, her mother-in-law remembered what had been
said in the group, and, without wasting time, asked her
daughter-in-law to breastfeed the baby while she rushed to
get money from the group and asked her son to arrange for
a vehicle. The daughter-in-law was immediately taken to
the district hospital, where she was given medicines,
intravenous fl uid, and two pints of blood, and was
discharged after 15 days.
