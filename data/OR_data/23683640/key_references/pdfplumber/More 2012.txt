Abstract
Introduction:Improvingmaternalandnewbornhealthinlow-incomesettingsrequiresbothhealthserviceandcommunity
action. Previous community initiatives have been predominantly rural, but India is urbanizing. While working to improve
health service quality, we tested an intervention in which urban slum-dweller women’s groups worked to improve local
perinatalhealth.
MethodsandFindings:A cluster randomized controlled trial in 24 intervention and 24 control settlements covered a
populationof283,000.Ineachinterventioncluster,afacilitatorsupportedwomen’sgroupsthroughanactionlearningcycle
in which they discussed perinatal experiences, improved their knowledge, and took local action. We monitored births,
stillbirths,andneonataldeaths,andinterviewedmothersat6weekspostpartum.Theprimaryoutcomesdescribedperinatal
care,maternalmorbidity,andextendedperinatalmortality.Theanalysisincluded18,197birthsover3yearsfrom2006to
2009. We found no differences between trial arms in uptake of antenatal care, reported work, rest, and diet in later
pregnancy,institutionaldelivery,earlyandexclusivebreastfeeding,orcare-seeking.Thestillbirthratewasnon-significantly
lowerintheinterventionarm(oddsratio0.86,95%CI0.60–1.22),andtheneonatalmortalityratehigher(1.48,1.06–2.08).
The extended perinatal mortality rate did not differ between arms (1.19, 0.90–1.57). We have no evidence that these
differences couldbe explainedby theintervention.
