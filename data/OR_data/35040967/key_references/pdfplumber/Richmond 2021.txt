patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses.
Interpretation The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum
adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising
activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.
