RESULTS This article was published on December 30,
2020, at NEJM.org.
The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2035389

96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic,
virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 ill-
ness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-
years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-
1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was
94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary
analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included
participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses
in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 partici-
pants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient re-
actogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group.
Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness,
including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no
safety concerns were identified. (Funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research

The data cutoff for the primary analysis occurred on November 25, 2020. The full analysis population consisted of participants who un-
derwent randomization and received at least one dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo; the modified intention-to-treat population comprised
participants in the full analysis population who had no immunologic or virologic evidence of Covid-19 on day 1, before the first dose;
and the per-protocol analysis population included participants in the modified intention-to-treat population who received two doses,
with no major protocol deviations. The safety population included all participants who received at least one injection. Among partici-
pants who received an incorrect injection, three participants in the mRNA-1273 group received at least one dose of placebo and no dose
of mRNA-1273 and were included in the placebo safety population, and three received one dose of placebo and one dose of mRNA-1273

regarding the participant’s age and coexisting conditions. Percentages are based on the full analysis population; baseline demographics
and characteristics for the per-protocol population are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Percentages may not total 100 because of
rounding. The abbreviation bAb denotes binding antibody concentration, and RT-PCR reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
† Risk was based on a stratification factor from the Internet-based interactive response system used for randomization; participants who were
younger than 65 years of age were categorized as at risk for severe Covid-19 illness if they had at least one of the risk factors specified in the
trial protocol at screening.
‡ Race or ethnic group was reported by the participant. Participants could be included in more than one category.
§ Baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was positive if there was immunologic or virologic evidence of previous illness with Covid-19, as defined by
a positive RT-PCR test or a positive bAb against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid assay result that was above the limit of detection or by a lower
limit of quantification at day 1. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was negative if there was a negative RT-PCR test and negative bAb against
SARS-CoV-2 assay result at day 1.

Figure 4. Vaccine Efficacy of mRNA-1273 to Prevent Covid-19 in Subgroups.
The efficacy of the RNA-1273 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups in the per-protocol population
was based on adjudicated assessments starting 14 days after the second injection. Vaccine efficacy, defined as 1
minus the hazard ratio (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo), and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a
stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with Efron’s method of tie handling and with the treatment group as a
covariate, adjusting for stratification factor if applicable. Race and ethnic group categories shown are White (non-
Hispanic) and communities of color (all others, including those whose race and ethnicity were both reported as un-
known, were not reported, or were both missing at screening). Data for communities of color were pooled owing to
limited numbers of participants in each racial or ethnic group, to ensure that the subpopulations would be large
