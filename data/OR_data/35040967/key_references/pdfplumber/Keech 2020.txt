values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administra-
tion toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti–spike protein response (in en-
zyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units). Secondary outcomes included
unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay),
and T-cell responses (cytokine staining). IgG and microneutralization assay results
were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples
from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic. We performed a pri-
mary analysis at day 35.
RESULTS
After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with
adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive
placebo. No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild
in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration
(mean, ≤2 days). One participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day. Unsolicited
adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events.
The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose–
sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-μg adjuvanted
regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutral-
ization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent
serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
At 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that
exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum. The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced
CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype. (Funded by the Coali-
tion for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368988).

the 5‑μg and 25‑μg adjuvanted groups (groups C and D, respectively), and the 25‑μg adjuvanted and placebo group (group E). Dia‑
monds and whisker endpoints represent geometric mean titer values and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The Covid‑19 human
convalescent serum panel includes specimens from PCR‑confirmed Covid‑19 participants, obtained from Baylor College of Medicine (29
specimens for ELISA and 32 specimens for MN IC>99%), with geometric mean titer values according to Covid‑19 severity. The severity of
Covid‑19 is indicated by the colors of the dots for hospitalized patients (including those in intensive care), symptomatic outpatients
(with samples collected in the emergency department), and asymptomatic patients who had been exposed to Covid‑19 (with samples
collected during contact and exposure assessment). Mean values (in black) for human convalescent serum are depicted next to (and of
same color as) the category of Covid‑19 patients, with the overall mean shown above the scatter plot (in black). For each trial vaccine
group, the mean at day 35 is depicted above the scatterplot.

solved or stabilized during the testing period.
Four participants (3%), including one who had
received placebo, had elevated liver enzymes that
were noted after the first vaccination and re-
solved within 7 to 14 days (i.e., before the sec-
ond vaccination). Vital signs remained stable
immediately after vaccination and at all visits.
Unsolicited adverse events (Table S9) were
predominantly mild in severity (in 71%, 91%,
83%, 90%, and 82% of participants in groups A,
B, C, D, and E, respectively) and were similarly
distributed across the groups receiving adju-
vanted and unadjuvanted vaccine. There were no
reports of severe adverse events.
Immunogenicity Outcomes
ELISA anti-spike IgG geometric mean ELISA
units (GMEUs) ranged from 105 to 116 at day 0.
By day 21, responses had occurred for all adju-
vanted regimens (1984, 2626, and 3317 GMEUs
for groups C, D, and E, respectively), and geo-
metric mean fold rises (GMFRs) exceeded those
induced without adjuvant by a factor of at least
10 (Fig. 3 and Table S10). Within 7 days after the
second vaccination with adjuvant (day 28; groups
C and D), GMEUs had further increased by a
factor of 8 (to 15,319 and 20,429, respectively)
over responses seen with the first vaccination,
and within 14 days (day 35), responses had more
than doubled yet again (to 63,160 and 47,521,
respectively), achieving GMFRs that were ap-
proximately 100 times greater than those ob-
served with rSARS-CoV-2 alone. A single vaccina-
tion with adjuvant achieved GMEU levels similar

to be highly protective in multiple studies using

cific data that clearly correlate immunogenicity

NVX-CoV2373 induced immune responses that
compared well with anti-spike IgG and micro-
neutralization in a Covid-19 population with clini-
cally significant illness. We also found that when
the human convalescent serum was stratified
according to illness severity, anti-spike IgG and
microneutralization titers closely resembled find-
ings in other Covid-19 studies in which illness
severity and the magnitude of microneutraliza-
tion responses are proportional,22 a finding that
suggests that the selection of comparative popu-
lations has to be interpreted in light of the clini-
cal severity of disease. Although the comparative
immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 and convales-
cent serum from clinically ill Covid-19 patients
must be interpreted with caution, the level of
vaccine-induced immunogenicity appears prom-
ising and in line with protective responses seen
in a similar respiratory disease.18 The theoretical
concern for vaccine-induced enhanced disease is
in part addressed in this trial by the use of an
adjuvant, which stimulates both high neutraliz-
ing antibody responses and T cells with a pre-
