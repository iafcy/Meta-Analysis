not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of
each dose schedule.
RESULTS
After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and
3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events
were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic
adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3
than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who
received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-
antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all partici-
pants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354),
regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 100% by day 57 with a further
increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least
day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT,
827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody
responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the par-
ticipants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing
toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower
in cohort 3.
CONCLUSIONS
The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further develop-
ment of this vaccine candidate. (Funded by Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical

* Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The participants in cohorts 1 and 3 received Ad26.COV2.S at a dose of either
5×1010 viral particles (low‑dose group) or 1×1011 viral particles (high‑dose group) in a 1‑ml volume. The participants
were grouped according to pooled groups (low dose followed by low dose together with low dose followed by placebo,
high dose followed by high dose together with high dose followed by placebo, and placebo followed by placebo).
† Cohort 1 includes both cohorts 1a and 1b.
‡ Race or ethnic group was reported by the participants, who could report more than one category.
§ The body‑mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. This calculation was
based on the weight and height measured at the time of screening.
