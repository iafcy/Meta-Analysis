of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.
CONCLUSIONS
The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine
candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and im-
munogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany
and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a
pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer;

The 54 participants who were not assigned to a trial group were screened but did not undergo randomization be-
cause trial enrollment had closed. All the participants received two doses of the vaccine (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2)
or placebo, except for the participants who were assigned to receive 100 μg of BNT162b1 or placebo, who received
one dose.
