or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was viro-
logically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset
at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically
negative at baseline.
RESULTS
A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included
in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years
of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10
participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom
onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were
reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection
were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed
an efficacy of 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant
and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.5) against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was
generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and
similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants
conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy
against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020 - 004123 - 16.)

Figure 4. Vaccine Efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 in Specific Subgroups.
Shown is the efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups within the per-protocol population.
Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals were derived with the use of Poisson regression with robust error variance. In the inten-
tion-to-treat population, vaccine efficacy was assessed after the administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo. Participants who
identified themselves as being non-White or belonging to multiple races were pooled in a category of “other” race to ensure that the
subpopulations would be large enough for meaningful analyses. Data regarding coexisting conditions were based on the definition used
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for persons who are at increased risk for Covid-19.
