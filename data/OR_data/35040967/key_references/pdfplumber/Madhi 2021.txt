RESULTS

Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults
(median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of
placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutraliza-
tion assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples
obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the
primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717
placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an effi-
cacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 par-
ticipants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vac-
cine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4%
(95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced
between the vaccine and placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS
A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection
against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. (Funded by the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04444674;

Discussion
In this trial, we found that two doses of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine had no efficacy
against the B.1.351 variant in preventing mild-
to-moderate Covid-19. There were no cases of
hospitalization for severe Covid-19 observed in
the study. The lack of efficacy against the B.1.351 variant should be considered in the con-
text of the 75% efficacy (95% CI, 8.7 to 95.5) in
preventing mild-to-moderate Covid-19 with on-
set at least 14 days after even a single dose of
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine that was observed
before the B.1.351 variant emerged in South Af-
rica. Of note, the vaccine efficacy in preventing
Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant was esti-
mated in a secondary analysis; the trial was
powered for the primary objective of a vaccine
efficacy of at least 60% in preventing Covid-19 of
any severity, irrespective of variants. In addition,
the demographic and clinical profile of the en-
rolled participants contributed to the absence of severe Covid-19 cases; hence, the trial findings
are inconclusive with respect to whether the
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine may protect against
severe Covid-19 caused by infection with the
B.1.351 variant.
The pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization
assay experiments, however, provide evidence of
reduced or abrogated vaccine-induced antibody
neutralization against the B.1.351 variant. Al-
though the degree of attenuation that compro-
mises an effective neutralizing antibody re-
sponse in vivo is unknown, the highest degree
of neutralization achieved against B.1.351 in a vaccinated participant as determined with the live-virus neutralization assay was a 1:20 dilu-
tion, and the highest remaining titer against
B.1.351 was less than 1:200 with the pseudo- virus neutralization assay. Comparison of the
RBD triple mutant and the B.1.351 variant in the
pseudovirus neutralization assay suggests that
much, though not all, of the vaccine-elicited
neutralization is directed to the RBD. A similar
loss of neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 variant in antibodies induced by natural infec-
tion after the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak
has been reported.14
The responses to the original SARS-CoV-2
virus as determined by pseudovirus neutralization
assays in recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vac-
cine in our trial were similar to the responses in
