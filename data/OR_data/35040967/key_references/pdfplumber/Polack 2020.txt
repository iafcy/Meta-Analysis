injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of
Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants as-
signed to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo;
BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to
97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups
defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of
coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first
dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety
profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the
injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was
low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS
A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in
persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to
that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov
