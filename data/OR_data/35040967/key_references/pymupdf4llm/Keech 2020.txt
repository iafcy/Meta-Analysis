**BACKGROUND**
NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2
spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.

**METHODS**
We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2 trial to evaluate the safety
and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-μg and 25-μg doses, with
or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assignments) in 131 healthy adults. In phase 1, vaccination comprised two intramuscular
injections, 21 days apart. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity; laboratory
values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administration toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti–spike protein response (in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units). Secondary outcomes included
unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay),
and T-cell responses (cytokine staining). IgG and microneutralization assay results
were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples
from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic. We performed a primary analysis at day 35.

**RESULTS**
After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with
adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive
placebo. No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild
in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration
(mean, ≤2 days). One participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day. Unsolicited
adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events.
The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose–
sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-μg adjuvanted
regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutralization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent
serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).

**CONCLUSIONS**
At 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that
exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum. The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced
CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype. (Funded by the Coali[tion for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368988).](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04368988)

oronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)
has spread globally at a rapid pace since
the novel coronavirus was first reported

# Cin late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was

declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.[1,2] As of August 1,
2020, more than 17 million cases and over
675,000 deaths due to Covid-19 have been reported worldwide,[3] caused by infection with the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).[4,5] NVX-CoV2373 contains MatrixM1 adjuvant[6] and a recombinant SARS-CoV-2
(rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine, constructed
from the full-length (i.e., including the transmembrane domain), wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein, which mediates attachment of the
virus to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor of host cells for cellular
entry and serves as a key target for development
of antibodies and vaccines.[7,8] In rodent and nonhuman primate challenge models, NVX-CoV2373
induced high titers of antibodies measured against
anti-spike protein that blocked hACE2 receptor
binding and achieved neutralization of wild-type
virus that exceeded the magnitude of responses
measured in human convalescent serum and
that provided protection against SARS-CoV-2
challenge.[9,10] In addition, polyfunctional CD4+
and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced with a
T helper 1 (Th1) dominant phenotype.[9]

We report here the findings of the phase 1
part of a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase
1–2 trial that commenced in May 2020 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 5-μg and
25-μg doses of rSARS-CoV-2 with or without
Matrix-M1 adjuvant (50-μg dose) in healthy adults
younger than 60 years of age.


Methods


**Trial Design and Oversight**
Our phase 1 trial was conducted at two sites in
Australia (Nucleus Network, Herston, Queensland,
and Melbourne, Victoria). Eligible participants
were healthy men and nonpregnant women, 18 to
59 years of age, with a body-mass index (the
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
height in meters) of 17 to 35. Healthy status, assessed during the screening period, was based on
medical history and clinical laboratory findings,
vital signs, and physical examination. Participants
with a history of SARS or Covid-19 or who tested


positive at screening (by real-time polymerasechain-reaction [RT-PCR] assay or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) along with participants exposed to persons with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 or working in an occupation at high
risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were excluded.
(Details of the trial design, conduct, oversight,
and analyses are provided in the protocol and
statistical analysis plan, available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org.) All participants
provided written informed consent before enrollment in the trial.
As a safety measure, 6 participants were initially randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 5-μg
and 25-μg rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 groups
(groups C and D), vaccinated in an open-label
manner, and observed for reactogenicity for 48
hours. Thereafter, the remaining 125 participants
were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio and
in a blinded manner to one of five vaccine groups
according to pregenerated randomization schedules, without stratification (Fig. 1).
The trial was designed by Novavax, with funding support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. The trial protocol was
approved by the Alfred Hospital Human Research
Ethics Committee (Melbourne) and was performed
in accordance with the International Council for
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
Safety oversight for specific vaccination pause rules
and for advancement to phase 2 was performed
by an independent safety monitoring committee.
The manuscript was written by the authors, with
the first author as the overall lead author. No one
who is not an author contributed to writing the
manuscript. All authors had full access to the
data on a vaccine-group level only. The authors
assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the
trial to the protocol.

**Trial Vaccine, Adjuvant, and Placebo**
rSARS-CoV-2, developed by Novavax and manufactured at Emergent Biosolutions, is a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine constructed from the
full-length (i.e., including the transmembrane domain), wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
(GenBank accession number, MN908947; nucleotides 21563–25384) optimized in the established
baculovirus Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cellexpression system.[9] rSARS-CoV-2 is generated with
682-QQAQ-685 mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage

sites to confer protease resistance and two proline substitutions at residues K986P and V987P
at the top of the heptad repeat 1/central helix in
the S2 subunit to stabilize the construct in a prefusion conformation. rSARS-CoV-2 is resistant to
proteolytic cleavage, binds with high affinity to
the hACE2 receptor, and demonstrates thermostability.[9,11] Matrix-M1, a saponin-based adjuvant,[12]
was manufactured by Novavax. Both vaccine and
adjuvant were stored at 2°C to 8°C. Placebo was
sterile 0.9% normal saline.
rSARS-CoV-2 and Matrix-M1 were mixed just
before use. Each participant received two intramuscular injections of trial vaccine or placebo
(injection volume, 0.6 ml) in the deltoid muscle,
one injection on day 0 and one on day 21. Participants and trial site personnel managing the conduct of the trial remained unaware of vaccine
assignment, with the exception of sentinel dosing
(described below). Vaccination pause rules were
in place to monitor participants’ safety (see the
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).

**Safety Assessments**
Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated at
specified time points throughout the trial (Fig. 1).
The primary safety outcomes were the number
and percentage of participants with solicited local and systemic reactogenicity according to the


[Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicity](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/toxicity-grading-scale-healthy-adult-and-adolescent-volunteers-enrolled-preventive-vaccine-clinical)
[grading scale (Table S2 in the Supplementary](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/toxicity-grading-scale-healthy-adult-and-adolescent-volunteers-enrolled-preventive-vaccine-clinical)
Appendix)[13] and their duration and peak intensity for 7 days after vaccination (days 0 to 7 and
days 21 to 28) and laboratory values (serum
chemistry and hematology) according to FDA
toxicity scoring (Table S5)[13,14] at 7 days after vaccination (days 7 and 28). Reported secondary
safety outcomes were laboratory values at day 21,
unsolicited adverse events during the first 35 days
according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) classification, severity score
(mild, moderate, or severe), and relatedness to the
vaccine; vital sign measurements assessed according to FDA toxicity scoring (Table S6)[13] after vaccination; and adverse events of special interest,
which included SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-19
disease manifestations (Table S3),[14,15] and potential immune-mediated medical conditions (Table
S4). In addition, participants underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 on day
35 or any time they reported symptoms suggestive of possible infection.
Participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination for assessment of reactogenicity and were instructed to continue
monitoring these events at home daily, for 7 days
after each vaccination, using a diary. Predefined
local (injection site) reactogenicity included pain,

tenderness, erythema, and swelling; systemic
reactogenicity included fever, nausea or vomiting, headache, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, and
arthralgia.

**Immunogenicity Assessments**
The primary immunogenicity outcome was the
anti-spike IgG ELISA unit responses to rSARSCoV-2 protein antigens, measured on days 0, 7,
21, 28, and 35. Reported secondary immunogenicity assessments were the wild-type virus microneutralization assay (MN) with an inhibitory
concentration of >99% (MN IC>99%) on days 0,
21, and 35 and intracellular cytokine staining of
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at days 0 and 28
in a randomly selected subgroup of 16 participants, 4 participants each from groups A, B, C,
and D. Details of these assays are provided in
the Supplementary Appendix.
Immunogenicity (IgG and MN) results were
compared with a control panel of 32 (IgG) and
29 (MN) convalescent serum specimens collected from patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19,
obtained from Baylor College of Medicine, which
were classified according to clinical severity at
the same institution. Covid-19 clinical severity
was classified as asymptomatic, exposed (sample collected from contact exposure assessment),
symptomatic outpatient (sample collected from
outpatients discharged from the emergency department; see Table S1 for a list of symptoms),
and hospitalized (sample collected from hospitalized patients, including those receiving supportive measures in the intensive care unit).
Disease classification was conducted independent of and before the study assays and analysis.

**Statistical Analysis**
The sample size for the trial was based on clinical and practical considerations, not on a formal
statistical power calculation. Most end points
were summarized with geometric means and
95% confidence intervals that were based on the
t distribution of the log-transformed values. No
adjustments for multiplicity were made in these
analyses, including the calculation of confidence
intervals.
The primary safety and immunogenicity analyses were conducted after all participants had
been followed through day 35. Safety data on the
sentinel participants (who received open-label
vaccination) were analyzed separately from other


participants because of potential investigator bias;
immunogenicity data were combined for all participants. Sponsor personnel who were involved in
the analysis of data were not provided with individual data; they received only vaccine-group assignment data.


**Trial Population**
The trial was initiated on May 26, 2020; 134
participants underwent randomization between
May 27 and June 6, 2020, including 3 participants
who were to serve as backups for sentinel dosing
and who immediately withdrew from the trial
without being vaccinated (Fig. S1). Of the 131
participants who received injections, 23 received
placebo (group A), 25 received 25-μg doses of
rSARS-CoV-2 (group B), 29 received 5-μg doses
of rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1, including three
sentinels (group C), 28 received 25-μg doses of
rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1, including three sentinels (group D), and 26 received a single 25-μg
dose of rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 followed by
a single dose of placebo (group E). All 131 participants received their first vaccination on day
0, and all but 3 received their second vaccination
at least 21 days later; exceptions include 2 in the
placebo group (group A) who withdrew consent
(unrelated to any adverse event) and 1 in the 25-μg
rSARS-CoV-2 + Matrix-M1 group (group D) who
had an unsolicited adverse event (mild cellulitis;
see below). Demographic characteristics of the
participants are presented in Table 1. Of note,
missing data were infrequent.

**Safety Outcomes**
No serious adverse events or adverse events of
special interest were reported, and vaccination
pause rules were not implemented. As noted
above, one participant did not receive a second
vaccination owing to an unsolicited adverse event,
mild cellulitis, that was associated with infection after an intravenous cannula placement to
address an unrelated mild adverse event that occurred during the second week of follow-up.
Second vaccination was withheld because the
participant was still recovering and receiving
antibiotics. This participant remains in the trial.
Overall reactogenicity was largely absent or
mild, and second vaccinations were neither withheld nor delayed due to reactogenicity. After the

the five groups (local: 100%, 100%, 65%, 67%,
and 100% of participants, respectively; systemic:

in group D, had a severe local event (tenderness),
and eight participants, one or two participants
in each group, had severe systemic events; the
most common severe systemic events were joint
pain and fatigue. Only one participant, in group D,
had fever (temperature, 38.1°C) after the second
vaccination, on day 1 only. No adverse event extended beyond 7 days after the second vaccination. Of note, the mean duration of reactogenicity


events was 2 days or less for both the first vaccination and second vaccination periods.
Laboratory abnormalities of grade 2 or higher
occurred in 13 participants (10%): 9 after the
first vaccination and 4 after the second vaccination (Table S8). Abnormal laboratory values were
not associated with any clinical manifestations
and showed no worsening with repeat vaccination. Six participants (5%; five women and one
man) had grade 2 or higher transient reductions
in hemoglobin from baseline, with no evidence of
hemolysis or microcytic anemia and with resolution within 7 to 21 days. Of the six, two had an

to those in asymptomatic (exposed) patients
with Covid-19 (1661), and a second vaccination
with adjuvant achieved GMEU levels that exceeded those in convalescent serum from symptomatic outpatients with Covid-19 (7420) by a
factor of at least 6 and rose to levels similar to
those in convalescent serum from patients hospitalized with Covid-19 (53,391). The responses
in the two-dose 5-μg and 25-μg adjuvanted vaccine regimens were similar, a finding that highlights the role of adjuvant dose sparing.
Neutralizing antibodies were undetectable
before vaccination and had patterns of response
similar to those of anti-spike antibodies after
vaccination with adjuvant (Fig. 3 and Table S11).
After the first vaccination (day 21), GMFRs were
approximately 5 times greater with adjuvant
(5.2, 6.3, and 5.9 for groups C, D, and E, respectively) than without adjuvant (1.1). By day 35,
second vaccinations with adjuvant induced an
increase more than 100 times greater (195 and
165 for groups C and D, respectively) than single
vaccinations without adjuvant. When compared
with convalescent serum, second vaccinations
with adjuvant resulted in GMT levels approximately 4 times greater (3906 and 3305 for groups
C and D, respectively) than those in symptomatic
outpatients with Covid-19 (837) and approached
the magnitude of levels observed in hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 (7457).
At day 35, ELISA anti-spike IgG GMEUs and
neutralizing antibodies induced by the two-dose
5-μg and 25-μg adjuvanted vaccine regimens were
4 to 6 times greater than the geometric mean
convalescent serum measures (8344 and 983, respectively).
A strong correlation was observed between
neutralizing antibody titers and anti-spike IgG
GMEUs with adjuvanted vaccine at day 35 (correlation, 0.95) (Fig. 4), a finding that was not
observed with unadjuvanted vaccine (correlation,
0.76) but was similar to that of convalescent serum (correlation, 0.96). Two-dose regimens of
5-μg and 25-μg rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1
produced similar magnitudes of response, and
every participant had seroconversion according
to either assay measurement. Reverse cumulative-distribution curves for day 35 are presented
in Figure S2.


T-cell responses in 16 participants who were
randomly selected from groups A through D,
4 participants per group, showed that adjuvanted regimens induced antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses that were reflected
in IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α production on spike
protein stimulation. A strong bias toward this Th1
phenotype was noted; Th2 responses (as measured
by IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines) were minimal (Fig. 5).


The primary safety and immunogenicity analyses
indicate that in healthy adult participants 18 to
59 years of age, two-dose regimens of 5 μg and
25 μg of rSARS-CoV-2 plus the Matrix-M1 adjuvant had acceptable safety findings and induced
high immune responses, with levels of neutralizing antibodies that closely correlated with anti-spike IgG. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody
responses after the second vaccination with
rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 exceeded values
seen in symptomatic Covid-19 outpatients and
were of the magnitude seen in convalescent serum from hospitalized patients with Covid-19.
The benefit of the Matrix-M1 adjuvant was clear
in the magnitude of the antibody and the T-cell
response, the induction of functional antibodies,
and antigen dose sparing. The value of the second dose on day 21 for the two-dose rSARSCoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 regimen is clearly demonstrated and warrants the use of this vaccination
schedule.
Although the effector mechanisms that might
lead to protection with a Covid-19 vaccine are yet
not known, it is presumed that neutralizing antibodies will be associated with protection; this
has led to the use of microneutralization testing
in all recent human Covid-19 vaccine trials.[16] In
Covid-19 nonhuman primate challenge models,
wild-type neutralizing antibodies are correlated
with protection.[17] It is notable that studies of
respiratory syncytial virus, which is similar to
Covid-19 as it infects cells through a type 1 fusion protein mechanism, have clearly shown reduction in disease through the presence of both
naturally induced neutralizing antibodies[18] and
prophylactically injected monoclonal antibodies;
the key features of these antibodies are their abil

dominant Th1 phenotype, both of which are
suggested to be important in vaccine candidate
selection.[23,24]

Novavax has accumulated safety data on more
than 14,000 participants in various nanoparticle
vaccine trials, including children, pregnant women, and older adults[25-28] and more than 4300 participants exposed to Matrix-M1 adjuvant, from
5 months to 85 years of age. The current study
demonstrates a safety and immunogenicity profile that is acceptable and comparable to past
studies with the platform technologies. Most
relevant to Covid-19, seasonal influenza hemagglutinin nanoparticle plus Matrix-M1 has demonstrated induction functional immunity and
T-cell responses in older adults, including those
with a modest level of coexisting conditions, a
population most at risk for severe Covid-19 disease.[28-30]

Limitations of this trial include the small size
of the trial, the limited ethnic diversity (particularly the low number of Black and Latinx participants), the younger age of participants, the
short period of follow-up, and the participants’
good health status. The populations at greatest


risk for serious Covid-19 include people with coexisting conditions and older adults, groups that
will be included in our phase 2 program. Data
collected during follow-up beyond 35 days in the
current cohort will be analyzed after the participants have been monitored for 105 days.
Taken together, our findings indicate that the
adjuvanted, recombinant, full-length spike protein
nanoparticle vaccine NVX-CoV2373 is a promising candidate that warrants testing in efficacy
studies. Phase 2 has commenced on the basis of
the safety results of the day 35 primary analysis,
and phase 3 is in preparatory stages.
Supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which provided funding for the clinical trial
and for the manufacture of rSARS-CoV-2 and the Matrix-M1
adjuvant. Novavax provided rSARS-CoV-2 and Matrix-M1 adjuvant for use in this trial but not provide any financial support.
Employees of Novavax, including those listed as authors, contributed substantially to the development and implementation
of the trial and the analysis of the data.
