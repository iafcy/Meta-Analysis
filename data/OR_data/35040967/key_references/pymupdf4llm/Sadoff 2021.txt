**BACKGROUND**
Efficacious vaccines are urgently needed to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A candidate vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant,
replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a full-length
and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

**METHODS**
In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2a trial, we randomly assigned
healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years (cohort 1) and those 65 years
of age or older (cohort 3) to receive the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 5×10[10]
viral particles (low dose) or 1×10[11] viral particles (high dose) per milliliter or placebo
in a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Longer-term data comparing a single-dose
regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are
not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of
each dose schedule.

**RESULTS**
After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and
3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events
were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic
adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3
than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who
received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizingantibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354),
regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 100% by day 57 with a further
increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least
day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT,
827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody
responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing
toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower
in cohort 3.

**CONCLUSIONS**
The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further development of this vaccine candidate. (Funded by Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical

he ongoing coronavirus disease
2019 (Covid-19) pandemic that is caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)T [1,2] has affected millions of
people globally. To contribute to the containment
of this pandemic — and to stop the pressure on
health care systems and the negative effects on
the global economy — efficacious Covid-19 vaccines are urgently needed.[3-6]

One of the candidate vaccines, Ad26.COV2.S,
is a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a fulllength and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein.[7,8] The vaccine was derived from the first
clinical isolate of the Wuhan strain (Wuhan 2019;
whole genome sequence, NC_045512). The Ad26
vector is used in the Ebola vaccine that was approved by the European Medicines Agency and in
vaccine candidates against respiratory syncytial
virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Zika
virus.[9-11] Ad26-based vaccines are generally safe
and highly immunogenic.[9-11] Here, we report the
interim results of a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2a clinical trial (COV1001) involving healthy adults in
two age cohorts to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S.


Methods


**Trial Design and Participants**
The trial was initiated on July 22, 2020, at 12 centers in Belgium and the United States. Trial participants included healthy adults between the ages
of 18 and 55 years and those 65 years of age or
older. The younger group was divided into cohort 1a (with a target enrollment of 375 participants) and cohort 1b (an exploratory cohort for
in-depth analysis of immunogenicity, with a target enrollment of 25 participants). The older age
group was included in cohort 3, with a target enrollment of 375 participants. In November 2020,
enrollment was initiated in cohort 2 to collect
longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen
with a two-dose regimen (as described in the
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org). Only the interim results in cohorts 1 and 3 are reported here.
All the participants provided written informed
consent before enrollment.
Participants in cohorts 1 and 3 received Ad26.
COV2.S at a dose of either 5×10[10] viral particles


(low dose) or 1×10[11] viral particles (high dose) per
milliliter, administered intramuscularly in a single-dose or two-dose schedule 56 days apart. The
trial design called for an evaluation of the boosting effect of Ad26.COV2.S at 6 months and 1 year
after vaccination with respect to safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity in each cohort. Additional details regarding the trial design are provided in Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary
Appendix and in the protocol, also available at
NEJM.org.

**Trial Oversight**
The trial was reviewed and approved by the local
ethics committee or institutional review board at
each site. Janssen Vaccines and Prevention, one of
the Janssen Pharmaceuticals companies acquired
by Johnson & Johnson, was the regulatory sponsor of the trial and holder of the Investigational
New Drug application. The trial was funded by
Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority of the Department of Health and Human Services. Janssen representatives designed and manufactured
the vaccine candidate, designed the trial, developed the statistical analysis plan, and performed
the analyses. The decision to submit the manuscript for publication was made by all authors,
who vouch for the accuracy and completeness of
the reported data and for the fidelity of the trial
to the protocol. No one who is not an author
contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

**Procedures**
In cohorts 1 and 3, we randomly assigned the
participants in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of five vaccination groups: low dose followed by low dose,
low dose followed by placebo, high dose followed
by high dose, high dose followed by placebo, and
placebo followed by placebo (Fig. S1). Data that
are reported here were collected after the administration of the second dose (either vaccine or
placebo) in cohort 1a and after the first dose in
cohort 3. Randomization was performed by means
of an interactive Web-response system and stratified according to site with the use of randomly
permuted blocks. Participants and investigators
remained unaware of trial-group assignments
throughout the trial. To meet the criteria for
blinding, the sponsor and statisticians were informed about group assignments for the primary
analysis of results in cohorts 1 and 3 after 8 days

had elapsed since the administration of the second vaccine dose in all the participants.

**Primary and Secondary End Points**
The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule. Follow-up
visits to evaluate reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity were scheduled on days 7, 28, and
71 after vaccination in each cohort. We collected
data regarding solicited adverse events from patients’ diary cards for 7 days after vaccination,
data regarding unsolicited adverse events for 28
days after vaccination, and data regarding serious adverse events throughout the course of the
trial after each vaccination. Adverse events were
graded according to the guidance document Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine
Clinical Trials of the Food and Drug Administration. Safety data are included up to the cutoff date
of October 30, 2020, in cohorts 1 and 3. The
secondary end point was humoral and cellular
immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

**Laboratory Analyses**
We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) to measure SARS-CoV-2 S-specific binding antibodies at baseline and on days 15, 29, 57,
and 71. Seropositivity was defined as a titer above
the lower limit of quantitation of the assay
(50.3 EU per milliliter). Clinicians at Public Health
England measured SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing-antibody titers in a random subgroup of
samples by means of a wild-type virus microneutralization assay using the Victoria/1/2020 SARSCoV-2 strain, with seropositivity defined as a 50%
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) titer of
more than 58 at the lower limit of quantitation.
IC80 titers on wild-type virus microneutralization
assay were also assessed at these time points.
S-specific T-cell responses were measured at
baseline and on day 15 by intracellular cytokine
staining with the use of two pools of S-peptide
pools of 15 mers overlapping by 11 amino acids.
In CD4+ T cells, a response in type 1 helper T
(Th1) cells was characterized by the expression
of interferon-γ, interleukin-2, or both and not
interleukin-4, interleukin-5, or interleukin-13; a
response in type 2 helper T (Th2) cells was characterized by the expression of interleukin-4, interleukin-5, or interleukin-13 (or all three cytokines) plus CD40L. All assays were conducted in


a blinded fashion and are described in detail in
the Supplementary Appendix.

**Statistical Analysis**
We determined that the enrollment of approximately 805 participants would provide a descriptive safety and immunogenicity assessment. We
first enrolled 15 participants (3 per vaccination
group) in cohort 1a; after the review of safety data
for the sentinel enrollees, we proceeded to full
enrollment of cohort 1a. The same process was
used in the enrollment of participants in cohort 3.
We used log-transformed data to calculate the
confidence intervals of the geometric means. Details regarding the statistical analysis plan are
provided in the Supplementary Appendix and in
the protocol.


**Participants**
From July 22 to August 7, 2020, a total of 593 persons underwent screening for enrollment in cohort 1 (including 1a and 1b combined) (Fig. S1).
Of these persons, 405 were enrolled and 402 received the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S; these participants had received the second dose by November 7, 2020. From August 3 to August 24, 2020,
a total of 660 persons underwent screening for
cohort 3. Of these participants, 405 were enrolled
and 403 received the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S.
(Details regarding age distribution are provided
in Table S2.) Analyses of data obtained from participants in cohort 3 after the administration of
the second dose, as well as durability and longerterm safety data, are ongoing.
At baseline, the percentage of participants who
were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibodies was 2% in cohort 1a and 1% in cohort 3.
The baseline characteristics of the participants
were broadly similar across the groups (Table 1).

**Vaccine Safety and Reactogenicity**
Data regarding both solicited and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events were available for more than 99% of the participants who
returned diary cards. The investigator’s assessment of reactogenicity after the administration
of the first dose of vaccine was available for 402
participants in cohort 1 and for 403 participants
in cohort 3. In the two cohorts, solicited local
adverse events were mostly of grade 1 or 2; the

most frequent event was injection-site pain. In
cohort 1, solicited local adverse events were reported in 103 of 162 low-dose recipients (64%),
in 123 of 158 high-dose recipients (78%), and in
7 of 82 placebo recipients (9%) (Fig. 1A and Table S3). In cohort 3, solicited local adverse events
were reported in 66 of 161 low-dose recipients
(41%), in 68 of 161 high-dose recipients (42%),
and in 11 of 81 placebo recipients (14%) (Fig. 1B).
In the two cohorts, most solicited systemic
adverse events were of grade 1 or 2; the most
frequent events were fatigue, headache, and myalgia. In cohort 1, solicited systemic adverse events
were reported in 105 low-dose recipients (65%),
in 133 high-dose recipients (84%), and in 21 placebo recipients (26%). In cohort 3, solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 74 low-dose
recipients (46%), in 88 high-dose recipients (55%),
and in 19 placebo recipients (23%).
In cohort 1, solicited grade 3 systemic adverse
events were reported in 15 low-dose recipients
(9%) and in 32 high-dose recipients (20%); no
placebo recipients reported such events. In cohort
1a, among the participants between the ages of
18 and 30 years who had one or more solicited
grade 3 adverse events, 24% had received the low
dose and 26% had received the high dose; in
those between the ages of 31 and 45 years, the
corresponding percentages were 43% and 14%;
and in those between the ages of 46 and 55 years,
the corresponding percentages were 3% and 11%.
In cohort 3, grade 3 solicited systemic adverse
events were reported in 1 low-dose recipient (1%)
and in 4 high-dose recipients (2%); no placebo
recipients reported having such events.
In cohort 1, fever was reported in 25 low-dose
recipients (15%) and in 62 high-dose recipients
(39%); grade 3 fever (temperature range, 39.0 to
40.0°C) was reported in 8 low-dose recipients (5%)
and in 15 high-dose recipients (9%). In cohort 3,
fever was reported in 7 low-dose recipients (4%)
and in 14 high-dose recipients (9%); grade 3 fever was reported in no low-dose recipients and
in 2 high-dose recipients (1%). No participants
in the placebo group in either cohort reported
having fever. All cases of fever occurred within
2 days after immunization and resolved within
1 or 2 days; more than 80% of the participants
with fever received an antipyretic drug at the
onset of symptoms.
In cohort 1, unsolicited adverse events were


reported in 34 low-dose recipients (21%), in 56
high-dose recipients (35%), and in 14 placebo
recipients (17%). In cohort 3, unsolicited adverse
events were reported in 27 low-dose recipients
(17%), in 38 high-dose recipients (24%), and in
13 placebo recipients (16%) (Table S4). No grade
4 adverse events (solicited or unsolicited) were
reported in any cohort.
In cohort 1a, safety data after the administration of the second dose of vaccine were available
for 363 participants (Fig. S2). One or more solicited adverse events were noted in 77% and 80%
of the participants in the low-dose and highdose groups, respectively, as compared with 34%
and 31% of those who received placebo as a second dose after a first dose of vaccine and in 22%
of those who received placebo for both doses.
Solicited adverse events of grade 3 or higher were
noted in 1% of low-dose recipients and in 7% of
high-dose recipients; the corresponding percentages were 1% and 2% among participants in the
placebo group who received a first dose of vaccine and in no participants who received placebo
for both doses. No grade 3 fevers were reported
in any group after a second dose of vaccine.
No participant discontinued the trial because
of an adverse event. Five serious adverse events
occurred: one case of hypotension that was
deemed by the investigator to be unrelated to the
vaccine because of a history of recurrent hypotension; one case of bilateral nephrolithiasis in a
participant with a history of kidney stones (not
related); one case of legionella pneumonia (not related); one worsening of multiple sclerosis, which
had remained undiagnosed for approximately 8 to
10 years on the basis of findings on magnetic
resonance imaging (not related); and one case of
fever that resulted in hospitalization because of
suspicion of Covid-19. In the last case, the participant recovered within 12 hours, and the fever
was subsequently deemed by the investigator to
be related to the vaccine. Details regarding all
safety data are provided in the Supplementary
Appendix.

**Immunogenicity and Seroconversion**
Immunogenicity data for this interim analysis
were unblinded according to dose level. In all five
groups in cohort 1a, the binding-antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC), as reported in
ELISA units per milliliter, was measured against

**Cohorts 1 and 3 after the First Vaccine Dose.**

Shown are solicited adverse events in participants who
received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 5×10[10]
viral particles (low dose) or 1×10[11] viral particles (high
dose) per milliliter or placebo. Healthy adults between
the ages of 18 and 55 years were included in cohort 1
(Panel A), and those 65 years of age or older were in‑
cluded in cohort 3 (Panel B). The younger group was
divided into cohorts 1a and 1b, with the latter designat‑
ed as an exploratory cohort for in-depth analysis of im‑
munogenicity. As shown here, data for cohorts 1a and
1b have been pooled. Data for patients in cohort 1a
who received a second dose of vaccine are provided in
Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.


a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein.
At baseline, the GMC values in all the participants
were lower than the lower limit of quantitation.
By day 29 after vaccination, the values had increased to 478 (95% confidence interval [CI], 379
to 603) in the low-dose/placebo group, 586
(95% CI, 445 to 771) in the low-dose/low-dose
group, 625 (95% CI, 505 to 773) in the high-dose/
placebo group, and 788 (95% CI, 628 to 988) in
the high-dose/high-dose group, with an incidence
of seroconversion of 99% or more in all the
groups (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). By day 57, the corresponding GMC values had further increased to
660 (95% CI, 513 to 849), 754 (95% CI, 592 to 961),
873 (95% CI, 701 to 1087), and 1100 (95% CI,
908 to 1332). After the first dose, the incidence
of seroconversion was 100% in all but the highdose/placebo group (97%). Fourteen days after
the second dose, the GMC was 1677 (95% CI, 1334
to 2109) in the low-dose/low-dose group and
2292 (95% CI, 1846 to 2845) in the high-dose/
high-dose group, with 100% seroconversion in
each group. On day 71, in the low-dose/placebo
and high-dose/placebo groups, the GMC was 600
(95% CI, 443 to 814) and 951 (95% CI, 696 to 1,300),
respectively, values that were similar to those on
day 57.
In cohort 3, the GMCs in all the participants
were also below the lower limit of quantitation
at baseline. By day 15 after vaccination, the GMC
had increased to 122 (95% CI, 97 to 152) in the
low-dose group and to 141 (95% CI, 114 to 175)
in the high-dose group, with a seroconversion incidence of 75% and 77%, respectively. By day 29,
the GMC was 312 (95% CI, 246 to 396) in the
low-dose group and 350 (95% CI, 281 to 429) in
the high-dose group, with 96% seroconversion.


The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing-antibody titer
(IC50) was measured in a random subgroup of participants in cohorts 1a and 3. In cohort 1a, the
geometric mean titer (GMT) was below the lower
limit of quantitation at baseline and by day 29
after vaccination had increased to 224 (95% CI,
158 to 318) in the low-dose/placebo group, 224
(95% CI, 168 to 298) in the low-dose/low-dose
group, 215 (95% CI, 169 to 273) in the high-dose/
placebo group, and 354 (95% CI, 220 to 571) in the
high-dose/high-dose group, with an incidence of
seroconversion of 96%, 88%, 96%, and 92%,
respectively (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3B). By day 57, the
GMT had further increased to 310 (95% CI, 228
to 422), 288 (95% CI, 221 to 376), 370 (95% CI,
268 to 511), and 488 (95% CI, 334 to 714), respectively, with a 100% incidence of seroconversion in the low-dose/placebo group and 96% seroconversion in the other groups.
In cohort 1a, 14 days after the second dose,
the GMT was 827 (95% CI, 508 to 1183) in the
low-dose/low-dose group and 1266 (95% CI, 746
to 2169) in the high-dose/high-dose group, with
100% seroconversion in the two dose groups. On
day 71, the GMT was 321 (95% CI, 227 to 438) in
the low-dose/placebo group and 388 (95% CI,
290 to 509) in the high-dose/placebo group, values that were similar to those on day 57; the
incidence of seroconversion was 100% in both
groups.
In cohort 3, the GMTs in all the participants
were below the lower limit of quantitation at baseline and had increased to 212 (95% CI, 137 to 284)
in the low-dose group and 172 (95% CI, 119 to
269) in the high-dose group on day 15 and to 277
(95% CI, 193 to 307) and 212 (95% CI, 163 to 266),
respectively, on day 29. The incidence of seroconversion was 91% and 84%, respectively, on day 15
and 96% and 88%, respectively, on day 29. These
data were confirmed on IC80 analysis (Fig. S4).
Antibody levels as measured on wild-type virus neutralization assay and ELISA were strongly
correlated in the two cohorts (Fig. S5). However,
the correlation had a wider elliptical shape in
cohort 3, which suggested more variability in the
relationship between the neutralizing-antibody
titer and the binding-antibody titer in the older
adults. Antibody levels in the different human

**Figure 2 (facing page). Humoral Immunogenicity.**

Shown are measures of humoral immunogenicity in se‑
rum samples obtained from the participants in cohort
1a (left side) and cohort 3 (right side), according to the
receipt of the low or high dose of Ad26.COV2.S or pla‑
cebo. In cohort 1a, the participants received two injec‑
tions of high-dose or low-dose vaccine or placebo, as
indicated with slashes (e.g., placebo/placebo if they re‑
ceived two injections of placebo). The samples were
measured on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) in ELISA units (EU) per milliliter (Panel A) and
on wild-type virus neutralization assay, with seroposi‑
tivity defined as a half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) titer of more than 58 at the lower limit of quanti‑
tation (Panel B). Logarithmic values are reported as the
geometric mean concentration (GMC) in the ELISA
analyses and as the geometric mean titer (GMT) in the
neutralizing-antibody analyses. The values were mea‑
sured at baseline and at day 29 after vaccination in all
the participants and on days 57 and 71 in those in co‑
hort 1a. The two horizontal dotted lines in each panel
indicate the lower and upper limits of quantitation of
the respective assay; values below the lower line have
been imputed to half the lower limit of quantitation.
I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. HCS denotes
human convalescent serum.


dose recipient in cohort 3 had a measurable Th2
response (Fig. 3B). However, all the participants
who had a measurable Th1 or Th2 response had
a Th1:Th2 ratio that was well above 1, which indicated a vaccine-induced Th1-skewed response.
S-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, as identified
by the expression of interferon-γ or interleukin-2
cytokines on S-peptide stimulation, were absent
at baseline in the two cohorts (Fig. 3C). On day
15 in cohort 1a, a CD8+ T-cell response was detected in 51% of participants (95% CI, 39 to 63)
in the low-dose group and in 64% (95% CI, 52
to 75) in the high-dose group, with a median
S-specific CD8+ T-cell response of 0.07% (IQR,
0.03 to 0.19) and 0.09% (IQR, 0.05 to 0.19), respectively. In cohort 3, CD8+ T-cell responses were
lower, with an incidence of 36% (95% CI, 23 to 51)
in the low-dose group and 24% (95% CI, 13 to 37)
in the high-dose group, with a median response
of 0.06% (IQR, 0.02 to 0.12) and 0.02% (IQR, 0.01
to 0.08), respectively. The correlation between
CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T-cell response was poor in
the two cohorts (Fig. S7).


ents were in the same range. Details regarding
differences in values according to demographic
characteristics are provided in Tables S5 and S6
in the Supplementary Appendix. Levels of Ad26
neutralizing antibodies at baseline or after the
first dose of vaccine did not correlate with the
levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies on
either day 29 or day 71 (Fig. S6).

**S-Specific T-Cell Responses**
The vaccine-elicited responses in S-specific CD4+
Th1 and Th2 cells and in CD8+ T cells were assessed in a subgroup of participants at baseline
and 15 days after the first dose. In cohort 1a, a Th1
response to S peptides was detected in 76%
(95% CI, 65 to 86) of low-dose recipients and in
83% (95% CI, 73 to 91) of high-dose recipients;
the corresponding values in cohort 3 were 60%
(95% CI, 46 to 74) and 67% (95% CI, 53 to 79),
respectively (Fig. 3A). In cohort 1a, the median
CD4+ Th1 response to S peptides increased from
an undetectable level at baseline to a median of
0.08% (interquartile range [IQR], 0.05 to 0.16) in
low-dose recipients and 0.11% (IQR, 0.07 to 0.16)
in high-dose recipients on day 15; in cohort 3, the
corresponding values were 0.09% (IQR, 0.04 to
0.17) and 0.11% (IQR, 0.04 to 0.15), respectively.
A low-dose recipient in cohort 1a and a high

The interim analysis of our phase 1–2a trial
showed that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine had an
acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and
was immunogenic after a single vaccination with
either the low or high dose. After the administration of the first dose, a trend toward a higher
incidence of solicited systemic adverse events
was noted with the higher vaccine dose, and a
clear trend for decreasing grade 3 adverse events
with increasing age was observed. The local and
systemic reactions occurred on the day of immunization or the next day and generally resolved within 24 hours. The systemic reactions
were very responsive to antipyretic drugs, and no
need for the prophylactic use of such drugs was
identified. After the second dose among participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years, the
incidence of grade 3 solicited systemic adverse
events was much lower than that after the first
immunization in both the low-dose and highdose groups, a finding that contrasts with observations with respect to messenger RNA–based
vaccines, for which the second dose has been
associated with increased reactogenicity.[4,6]

In CD4+ T cells, the response to low-dose or high-dose
vaccine or placebo in type 1 helper T (Th1) cells was
characterized by the expression of interferon-γ, inter‑
leukin-2, or both, without cytokines expressed by type 2
helper T (Th2) cells (Panel A). The response in CD4+
Th2 cells was characterized by the expression of inter‑
leukin-4, interleukin-5, or interleukin-13 (or all three cy‑
tokines) plus CD40L (Panel B). In CD8+ T cells, the re‑
sponse was measured by the expression of interferon-γ,
interleukin-2, or both (Panel C). In all three panels, the
horizontal bars indicate median values on intracellular
cytokine staining for individual responses to a SARSCoV-2 S protein peptide pool in peripheral-blood
mononuclear cells at baseline and 15 days after vacci‑
nation in a subgroup of participants in cohort 1a (left
side) and cohort 3 (right side), according to the receipt
of the low or high dose of Ad26.COV2.S or placebo. The
horizontal dotted line in each panel indicates the lower
limit of quantitation (LLOQ); values below the line have
been imputed to half the LLOQ.


ules, a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited a strong
humoral response in a majority of vaccine recipients, with the presence of S-binding and neutralizing antibodies in more than 90% of the participants, regardless of either age group or vaccine
dose. In addition, during 71 days of follow-up after
the first dose, antibody titers further increased
and stabilized, which suggests durability of the
Ad26.COV2.S-elicited immune response.
The potency of Ad26.COV2.S is supported by
the results of our study involving nonhuman primates, in which a single dose provided complete
protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication in the
lung and near complete protection in the nose.[12]
An efficacious single-dose Covid-19 vaccine has
obvious logistic advantages over a two-dose vaccine, especially during a pandemic. We observed
that among participants between the ages of 18
and 55 years, a second vaccine dose at day 57 further increased the antibody titer, a finding that
was also in line with our recent observations in
nonhuman primates.[14] Neutralizing-antibody titers
against the Ad26 vector that were elicited by the
first vaccination did not correlate with the magnitude of response after the second dose. Whether
a second dose will provide additional benefit for
either improved efficacy or durability in humans,
especially in elderly persons in whom the immune
response after the first dose tended to be modestly lower than that in younger participants, is


currently being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04614948).
The lack of standards and use of different assays complicate the comparison of performance
of the various Covid-19 vaccines that are currently
in development.[3-6] In addition, comparisons of convalescent serum panels are rather arbitrary, since
the reported GMTs have varied according to the
composition of the panels (i.e., Covid-19 severity
of the donors, time of sampling since disease
onset, and other factors).
A theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)[15-17] has been
associated with poorly neutralizing humoral immunity and Th2-skewed cellular immune responses. In this trial, all elicited CD4+ T-cell responses to Ad26.COV2.S were Th1-skewed, in line with
previous experience with the Ad26-based vaccine
platform.[9-11] Data that further minimize the
theoretical risk of VAERD are the accompanying
consistent CD8+ T-cell responses (albeit occurring
at lower levels in older adults than in younger
adults) and strong humoral responses.
The demographic characteristics of the participants in our trial confirm the lack of representation of minority groups. This finding is a point
of focus in our clinical-development program to
ensure the availability of data with respect to
groups that seem to be affected most by the
Covid-19 pandemic.
Our interim analysis indicates that vaccine
candidate Ad26.COV2.S is safe and immunogenic in both younger and older adults. This
finding, in combination with the results in
preclinical challenge studies,[12,13] has supported
our decision to proceed with two phase 3 trials
(NCT04505722 and NCT04614948) to evaluate
the efficacy of either a single-dose or two-dose
regimen of the lower dose (5×10[10] viral particles) of Ad26.COV2.S.
