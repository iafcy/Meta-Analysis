**ABSTRACT**

**Background**

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants

threatens progress toward control of the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine

efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and

use.

**Methods**

In this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South

Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or

medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio

to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine

(5 µg recombinant spike protein with 50 µg Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary

endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy ≥7 days following the second dose against laboratory
confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.

**Results**

A total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX-CoV2373

and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among

2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative; 6% PLWH), 15 and 29

predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases were noted in NVX-CoV2373 and placebo

recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8).

Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1) and did not differ by

baseline serostatus; 38 (92.7%) of 41 sequenced cases were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc

vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants.


-----

Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and

higher with NVX-CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

**Conclusions**

The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly

mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant.

**INTRODUCTION**

The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by the emergence of a novel severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 115 million

documented cases and 2.5 million deaths worldwide as of March 5, 2021.[1,2] Vaccination remains

a cornerstone of control strategies. Current vaccines primarily target the Covid-19 spike protein

based on the prototype Wuhan strain.[3] The mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) have

demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 94% to 95%[4,5] against any-severity Covid-19, and

corresponding vaccine efficacy for vector-based vaccines has been reported to be 70% (pooled)

for ChAdOx1-nCoV19, 92% for Gam-COVID-Vac, and 67% for Ad26.COV2.S, with the latter

measured against moderate to severe Covid-19.[6-8]

We report on a recombinant, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell/baculovirus system derived,

SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) comprised of full-length, pre-fusion

trimers of spike glycoprotein (prototype Wuhan sequence), co-formulated with a saponin-based

adjuvant, Matrix-M1™.[9,10] In an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial in

healthy adults, NVX-CoV2373, administered in a two-dose regimen 21 days apart, had an

acceptable safety profile; was associated with a strong, Th1-biased, antigen-specific

polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell response; and induced neutralizing antibody responses 4-fold higher

than levels in convalescent sera from predominantly moderate to severe Covid-19 cases.[11]

Recent reports from the United Kingdom (UK), Brazil, and South Africa on the emergence of the

B.1.1.7, P1, and B.1.351 (N501Y.V2) variants, respectively, confirm the acquisition of mutations

in key antigenic sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain of the spike

protein.[12-17] These antigenic changes may render naturally acquired or vaccine-derived immunity

to prototype-like virus less effective against subsequent infection with variant viruses.[13,17-19]


-----

Here, we describe early findings on the primary efficacy endpoint and preliminary safety of a

randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2a/b trial of NVX-CoV2373 in

4406 participants in South Africa during a period of predominant circulation of B.1.351 variant

viruses.

**METHODS**

**Trial Objectives, Participants and Oversight**

In this randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2a/b trial, we assessed the safety

and efficacy of two doses of NVX-CoV2373, administered 21 days apart. The purpose of this

phase 2a/b evaluation was to provide a signal of preliminary vaccine efficacy in a setting of

ongoing transmission. Participants were healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative

adults 18 to 84 years of age or a subgroup of medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH)

18 to 64 years of age. As a safety measure, enrollment was staggered into Stage 1 (defined by the

first 1/3 of targeted enrollment) and Stage 2 (the remainder of enrollment) for both HIV-negative

and PLWH groups, with progression from Stage 1 to Stage 2 in each group requiring favorable

review of safety data through Day 7 from the prior stage against prespecified vaccination pause

rules (Supplementary Appendix; Table S1). Key exclusion criteria were chronic administration

of immunosuppressive therapy, autoimmune or immunodeficiency disease (except for medically

stable PLWH), history of prior or current symptomatic Covid-19, or nucleic acid amplification

test (NAAT)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (hereafter “confirmed”) performed as part of

screening within 5 days before anticipated initial dosing. All participants provided written

informed consent before enrollment. Further details of the trial design, conduct, oversight, and


-----

analyses are provided in the protocol, statistical analysis plan, and Supplementary Appendix

(available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

NVX-CoV2373 was developed by Novavax, which sponsored the trial and was responsible for

the overall design (with input from the lead investigator), site selection, monitoring, and analysis.

Study investigators were responsible for data collection. The trial protocol was approved by the

South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA; Ref 20200420) and Institutional

Ethics Review Boards and registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT045333990 and the Pan African

Clinical trials Registry (PACTR202009726132275). Safety oversight, including for specific

vaccination pause rules, was performed by an independent safety monitoring committee. The

authors decided to publish the paper and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data

and analysis, and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The first author wrote the first draft

of the manuscript with assistance from a medical writer who is an author and employee of

Novavax.

**Trial Procedures**

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections,

21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 (5 µg recombinant spike protein with 50 µg Matrix-M1

adjuvant) or saline placebo (injection volume, 0.5 mL), administered by unblinded staff not

otherwise involved with other study procedures or data collection. All other study staff and trial

participants remained blinded to treatment assignment.

Participants were scheduled for in-person follow-up visits on Days 7, 21, 35, and Months 3, 6,

and 12 (phone call only) to collect vital signs, adverse events, concomitant medication changes,

and blood for immunogenicity analyses.


-----

**Safety Assessments**

The primary safety endpoints were occurrence of unsolicited adverse events (medically attended,

serious, and those of special interest [Tables S2 **and S3]) through Day 35 and solicited local and**

systemic adverse events evaluated via reactogenicity diary for 7 days following each vaccination

(Tables S4 and S5). Safety follow-up is ongoing through Month 12.

**Efficacy Assessments**

The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19

(hereafter “symptomatic Covid-19”) in participants seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline

occurring 7 days after receipt of the second study vaccine (i.e., after Day 28) (Table S6).

Bi-weekly active (outbound phone contact) and passive surveillance for symptoms of suspected

Covid-19 illness began on Day 8 and continues through the end of the study (Table S7;

**Figure S1). A new onset of suspected symptoms of Covid-19 triggered initial and follow-up**

surveillance visits to perform clinical assessments (vital signs, including pulse oximetry, and a

lung examination) and for collection of nasal swabs (Figure S2). In addition, suspected

Covid-19 symptoms were also queried, and nasal swabs collected, at all scheduled study visits.

Nasal swab samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT using the BD

MAX™ system (Becton Dickinson). The InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO[©])

questionnaire was utilized to comprehensively assess symptoms for the first 10 days of a

suspected Covid-19 illness episode.

**Whole Genome Sequencing**


-----

We performed post-hoc whole virus genome sequencing of nasal samples of all primary efficacy

endpoints in a blinded fashion. Details of whole genome sequencing methods and phylogenetic

analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix (Figure S3).

**Statistical Analysis**

The safety analysis population included all participants who received at least one injection of

NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, with participants analyzed according to the treatment actually

received. Safety analyses were presented as numbers and percentages of participants with

solicited local and systemic adverse events analyzed through 7 days after each vaccination, and

unsolicited adverse events through Day 35.

The per-protocol efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included baseline seronegative (by anti-spike

IgG) participants who received both injections of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo as assigned, had no

evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (by NAAT or anti-spike IgG) within 7 days after the second

vaccination (ie, before Day 28), and had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary

efficacy outcome. A second per-protocol efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF-2) was defined in a

similar fashion except without the exclusion of baseline seropositive participants to allow for

analysis of efficacy in seropositive or all participants, regardless of serostatus.

Vaccine efficacy (%) was defined as (1 – RR) × 100, where RR = relative risk of Covid-19

illness between NVX-CoV2373 and placebo. The official, event-driven efficacy analysis targeted

a minimum number of 23 endpoints (range of 23‒50) to provide approximately 90% power to

detect vaccine efficacy of 80% based on an incidence rate of symptomatic Covid-19 of 2% to 6%

in the placebo group. This analysis was carried out at an overall one-sided type I error rate of

0.025 for the single primary efficacy endpoint. The RR and its confidence interval (CI) were


-----

estimated using Poisson regression with robust error variance. Hypothesis testing of the primary

efficacy endpoint was carried out against the null hypotheses: H0: vaccine efficacy ≤0%. The

success criterion required rejection of the null hypothesis to demonstrate a statistically significant

vaccine efficacy.

**RESULTS**

**Participants**

A total of 6324 participants at 16 sites in South Africa were screened from August 17, 2020

through November 25, 2020. A total of 4387 participants received at least one injection of NVX
CoV2373 (n=2199) or placebo (n=2188), with 4332 participants receiving both injections

(Figure 1).

Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced (Table 1). The mean age of all

participants was 32.0 years, and approximately 4% in each group were 65 to 84 years of age.

Approximately 57% of the participants were male, and most were Black-African (95%). Twenty

percent of participants were obese, 5.6% had hypertension, and 1.6% had type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline by anti-S IgG antibodies

(sensitivity 94.7% and specificity 96.4% at a predefined anti-S IgG threshold; see Supplementary

Appendix).

**Safety**

Preliminary safety data were available on all Stage 1 participants, comprised of the first 889

HIV-negative and first 80 PLWH participants, who had completed safety follow-up through at


-----

least Day 35 at the time of the endpoint driven primary efficacy analysis cutoff date

(Supplementary Appendix; Table S8).

Briefly, solicited local and systemic adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate and

transient, and more common in NVX-CoV2373 recipients. Injection site pain was the most

frequently reported local solicited adverse event (37‒39% and 15‒16% in NVX-CoV2373 and

placebo recipients, respectively, post-first dose) (Table **S9); post-first and second dose rates**

were similar overall, with mean duration slightly higher after the second dose but generally less

than 3 days. Severe local adverse events were infrequent but occurred more often in the

seronegative NVX-CoV2373 group after the second dose (4%) versus placebo (1%). In NVX
CoV2373 recipients, the most common solicited systemic adverse events post-first and second

dose were headache (20‒25%), muscle pain (17‒20%), and fatigue (12‒16%). Post-first and

second dose rates were similar overall, with mean duration slightly higher after the second dose

but generally less than 3 days. Severe systemic adverse events, albeit infrequent, increased in the

seronegative NVX-CoV2373 group after the second dose (4%) but were comparable to placebo

(4%), particularly fatigue and headache (Tables S8 and S9). Reactogenicity was generally

similar in seronegative versus seropositive NVX-CoV2373 recipients.

Medically attended adverse events (Table S10) and serious adverse events (Table S11) were

infrequent but occurred more often in the NVX-CoV2373 group versus placebo (13 vs 6, and 2

vs 1, respectively), with no apparent clustering of specific adverse events by treatment group,

preferred term, or system organ class. To date, no serious adverse events have been assessed as

related to trial vaccine by study investigators (Table S8). No prespecified vaccination pause

rules were triggered.


-----

**Efficacy**

In the 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-uninfected and 6% PLWH), evaluable

for the primary efficacy analysis, 15 and 29 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 were observed after

Day 28 among NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively, corresponding to vaccine

efficacy of 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1 to 72.8), thereby meeting the primary phase 2b efficacy endpoint

success criterion (Table 2; Figure 2A). All of the per-protocol cases were mild to moderate

Covid-19, except for one severe case in the placebo group.

Among HIV-negative, baseline seronegative participants, 11 and 27 cases of symptomatic

Covid-19 were observed among NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively,

corresponding to vaccine efficacy of 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1) (Table 2; Figure 2B). The

corresponding vaccine efficacy estimate in baseline seronegative HIV-negative participants was

52.2% (95%: -24.8 to 81.7).

Among baseline seronegative PLWH, there were four and two cases of symptomatic Covid-19

among NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively (N<109 in each group). No cases

were observed in the baseline seropositive PLWH population (N<33 in each group).

The 44 baseline seronegative primary efficacy endpoint cases contributing to the analysis were

accrued between November 23 and December 30, 2020. Of these, 41 (93.2%) had whole genome

sequence data available (samples from three cases in the placebo group could not be sequenced),

and 38 (92.7%) of 41 were identified as the B.1.351 variant, thereby mirroring the national time

trend in circulation of the variant during the same period (Figure 2D; Figure S1). In a post-hoc


-----

analysis, vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV
negative participants (11 cases in NVX-CoV2373 and 22 in placebo recipients) and 43.0% (95%

CI: -9.8 to 70.4) in the combined HIV-negative and PLWH population (14 cases in

NVX-CoV2373 and 24 in placebo recipients).

Notably, during the initial 60 days of follow-up, the preliminary incidence of Covid-19 observed

in baseline seronegative placebo participants (5.3% [95% CI: 4.3 to 6.6]; 33 mild and 47

moderate cases out of 1516 participants) was comparable to the incidence in baseline

seropositive placebo participants (5.2% [95% CI: 3.6 to 7.2]; 14 mild and 21 moderate cases out

of 674 participants) (Figure 2C).

**DISCUSSION**

We describe preliminary evidence of the efficacy of a two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373

nanoparticle vaccine in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in the setting of predominant

transmission of the B.1.351 variant in South Africa.[12,15] The vaccine fulfilled the primary

efficacy objective, demonstrating statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 49.4% in the

combined HIV-negative and PLWH baseline seronegative study population. Among 94% of

participants without HIV, vaccine efficacy was 60.1%. The study was not powered to detect

efficacy in the small population of PLWH. Preliminary safety data continued to indicate an

acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile.[11]

This report provides evidence in the setting of a controlled vaccine trial that prior infection with

first-wave prototype-like, pre-B.1.351 viruses did not appear to reduce the risk of Covid-19 due

to re-infection with B.1.351 variants among placebo recipients during the initial 2 months of

follow-up. This finding is preliminary and may have public health implications for pandemic


-----

modeling, control strategies, and vaccine development and deployment efforts. This observation

is consistent with the lack of incremental benefit conferred by pre-existing immunity in vaccine

recipients as evidenced by consistent levels of efficacy regardless of baseline serostatus.

Although these findings require further confirmation, our observations suggest that vaccination

with prototype-sequenced NVX-CoV2373 conferred a degree of cross-protection against an

immunological escape variant.

Intense transmission during the first wave in South Africa, high levels of resulting population

immunity to prototype-like viruses (as observed in our study and corroborated in serosurveys[20]),

and ongoing high force of infection in advance of the second wave, may have created a milieu

favorable to the emergence of the B.1.351 variant. The B.1.351 variant is reported to have

emerged in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, in October 2020, and rapidly spread to

become the dominant circulating strain throughout the country during November and December

2020,[15] coincident with the surge of second-wave transmission nationally. Our study, with sites

dispersed across the country, accrued 44 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 contributing to the

primary efficacy analysis between November 23 and December 30, 2020. Sequencing of nasal

samples from primary efficacy endpoint cases confirmed a pattern consistent with national

molecular epidemiology.

The B.1.351 variant is characterized by three deleterious mutations at key antigenic sites in the

RBD, including N501Y, K417N, and E484K, with the latter two having particular functional

impact.[13,15,17,18] The N501Y mutation is known to increase binding affinity of the spike protein to

the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor,[21] and has been reported to increase

transmissibility of the B.1.17 variant circulating in the UK.[16] The E484K mutation has been

reported to abolish or substantially reduce neutralization by multiple potent monoclonal


-----

antibodies and polyclonal convalescent sera in both wild-type and pseudo-virus neutralization

assays.[12,13,17,18,22] Additionally, post-vaccination sera derived from volunteers receiving either of

the mRNA vaccines showed 6.5- to 8.6-fold reductions in neutralizing capacity to the B.1.351

variant relative to prototype virus in pseudovirus neutralization[17]; however, the impact on

clinical efficacy remains unassessed. Wild-type and pseudo-virus neutralization assays assessing

the impact of the B.1.351 variant on the neutralizing capacity of NVX-CoV2373 vaccine-elicited

antibodies are in progress. Nevertheless, our data provide clinical evidence of cross-protection

against antigenically drifted viruses. In the interim analysis of our UK phase 3 study, relatively

high levels of efficacy were observed against both the matched prototype-like, pre-variant strains

(vaccine efficacy 96%), and the B.1.1.7 variant (vaccine efficacy 86%).[23] The high vaccine

efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant is consistent with the expected limited impact of the

characteristic N501Y mutation (without a concomitant E484K mutation) on in vitro

neutralization capacity of convalescent sera derived from prototype-like virus infections.[13,17]

Two other trials, partially or wholly conducted in South Africa and contemporaneous with

circulation of the B.1.351 variant, have recently reported efficacy results. In the South African

arm (N=6576) of a large multi-national phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy of a single dose of

Ad26.COV2.S, vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe Covid-19 was reported to be 52%

and 64%, 14 days and 28 days post-first dose, respectively, with 95% of cases reportedly due to

the B.1.351 variant; however, vaccine efficacy against all-severity Covid-19 specific to the

B.1.351 variant has not yet been reported, precluding a direct comparison.[8,24] In the second trial,

ChAdOx1-nCoV19 was evaluated in a phase 2 trial (N=2026) in South Africa, in a study

population resembling ours with predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19, and reported vaccine


-----

efficacy of 22% (95% CI: -50 to 60) overall, and 10% (95% CI: -77 to 55) against the B.1.351

variant, with the latter comprising 95% of cases.[25]

Our study was subject to certain limitations. The efficacy results are preliminary (median

follow-up of 66 and 45 days following first and second doses, respectively), and are limited in

scope to the primary endpoint and subgroups of the primary endpoint, as well as post-hoc

analysis of B.1.351 variant sequencing data; therefore, caution is warranted in the interpretation

of our results on the breadth of natural immunity and vaccine effects in the PLWH cohort, which

represents a relatively small fraction of the study population. Importantly, at the time of analysis,

the study had captured almost exclusively mild to moderate Covid-19 endpoints in a

predominantly young, healthy population; consequently, we have not as yet been able to report

on vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19. Most large Covid-19 vaccine efficacy trials have

reported notably increased vaccine efficacy against severe versus mild to moderate disease.[4-7]

Additional follow-up may shed light on whether naturally acquired immunity to prototype-like

virus alters the severity of infection due to variant viruses.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a prototype-sequenced NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was

efficacious and induced notable cross-protection in the setting of dominant circulation of B.1.351

variants.

**Figure 1.** **Disposition of Participants in the Trial.**

**Legend: The full analysis set included all participants who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose, regardless of protocol violations**

or missing data, and are analyzed according to the trial vaccine group as randomized.

This diagram represents the disposition of participants in the trial. Among participants excluded for not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria: approximately 32%

tested HIV-positive on screening, 18% had a history of suspected or diagnosed Covid-19, 11% had an exclusionary chronic disease condition, 9% had

exclusionary high or low BMI, 7% could not provide informed consent, and 5% had acute or ongoing illness. Among participants excluded for “other” reasons:

approximately 69% were otherwise eligible but had missed the time window for enrollment into a particular stage or cohort; and 23% of “other” did not meet

inclusion/exclusion criteria but were recorded under the free text category of “other” (these had a similar distribution of exclusion criteria as those recorded under

“not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria”). The data cutoff date for the primary efficacy analysis was January 8, 2021, which represented a median follow-up of

66 and 45 days after first and second vaccination, respectively. The data cutoff date for the primary safety analysis was January 25, 2021, which included safety

data through 35 days after first vaccination in all 968 Stage 1 participants (889 HIV-negative and 79 PLWH). The safety analysis set included all participants

who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, with participants analyzed according to the treatment actually received. The per-protocol efficacy

analysis set (PP-EFF) included baseline seronegative (by anti-spike IgG) participants who received both injection of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo as assigned, had

no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (by NAAT or anti-spike IgG) within 7 days after the second vaccination (ie, before Day 28), and had no major protocol

deviations affecting the primary efficacy outcome. A second per-protocol efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF-2) was defined in a similar fashion except without the

exclusion of baseline seropositive participants to allow for analysis of efficacy in seropositive or all participants, regardless of serostatus.

Abbreviations: HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; IgG = immunoglobulin G; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; PLWH = people living with HIV;

SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

**Seropositive versus Seronegative Placebo Recipients, and Timing of Endpoint Accrual.**

**Legend: Shown is the cumulative incidence of symptomatic Covid-19. The time period for surveillance of per-protocol symptomatic Covid-19 cases was from at**

least 7 days after the second dose (ie, Day 28) of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo through the first 2 months of follow-up. Data shown are for the per-protocol efficacy
