**BACKGROUND**
Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as
is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants
of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

**METHODS**
We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess
the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two
doses of vaccine containing 5×10[10] viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride
solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after
the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays
against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points
were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic
coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose.

**RESULTS**
Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults
(median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of
placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples
obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the
primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717
placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4%
(95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced
between the vaccine and placebo groups.

**CONCLUSIONS**
A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection
against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. (Funded by the Bill

evelopment of vaccines to prevent
coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has
occurred with unprecedented speed.[1-4]

# DChAdOx1 nCoV-19, a replication-deficient chim
panzee adenoviral vector containing the sequence
for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) structural surface glycoprotein antigen, is one of six Covid-19 vaccines
based on different platforms that have been authorized for emergency use,[5-11] with efficacy results for two additional vaccines having recently
been reported.[12,13]

Meanwhile, the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene has
accumulated mutations within the receptorbinding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD).[14,15] These domains are major targets
of the antibody response elicited by the vaccines.
The RBD mutations include the N501Y mutation,
which is associated with increased affinity of
SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.[16] In contrast, the E484K
and K417N RBD mutations and mutations in the
NTD have been associated with neutralizing
antibody escape.[17] The B.1.1.7 (N501Y.V1) lineage,
first identified in the United Kingdom, includes
the N501Y mutation, which has been associated
with 53% increased transmissibility.[18] Neutralizing antibody activity elicited by infection or by
mRNA vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant are
largely unaffected.[19] The B.1.1.7 variant, however, has now evolved to include the E484K
mutation in the United Kingdom.[20]

The B.1.351 (N501Y.V2) lineage first identified in South Africa contains the three RBD
mutations and five additional NTD mutations.[14,15]
The sensitivity of B.1.351 to neutralizing antibodies from convalescent donors infected with
the prototype lineage virus, assessed with a spikepseudovirus neutralization assay, indicated that
48% of serum samples were unable to neutralize
B.1.351, with the rest showing a reduction in
neutralization titers by a factor of 3 to 86.[21] This
finding was corroborated by a live-virus neutralization assay, with reduction in antibody activity
ranging from a factor of 6 to complete knockout
for the B.1.351 variant.[14] Another independent
lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (P.1) also containing the
E484K, K417N, and some B.1.351 NTD mutations has been identified in Brazil.[22,23]

A pooled analysis of the efficacy of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in the United King

**Trial Objectives, Participants, and Oversight**
In this multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in South Africa,
we assessed the safety and efficacy of two standard doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine,
administered 21 to 35 days apart, as compared
with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) placebo.
Adults 18 to less than 65 years of age, with no
or well-controlled chronic medical conditions,
were eligible for participation. Included among
the participants were 70 HIV-negative persons
enrolled as group 1, in whom intensive safety
and immunogenicity studies were planned. Key
exclusion criteria were human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) positivity at screening (for the efficacy cohort), previous or current laboratoryconfirmed Covid-19, a history of anaphylaxis in
relation to vaccination, and morbid obesity (bodymass index [BMI, the weight in kilograms divided
by the square of the height in meters], ≥40).
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was developed at the
University of Oxford, which was responsible for
the conduct and oversight of the trial (see the
Supplementary Appendix).


dom, Brazil, and South Africa, performed before
the emergence of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants,
reported an overall vaccine efficacy of 66.7%
(95.8% confidence interval [CI], 57.4 to 74.0).[24]
Recent analysis of the efficacy of the ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine against the B.1.1.7 variant in the
United Kingdom was 74.6% (95% CI, 41.6 to 88.9).[25]

Here, we report findings from a multicenter
phase 1b–2 trial in South Africa evaluating the
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in preventing symptomatic Covid-19. This interim analysis is limited
to addressing the primary objective evaluating
safety and the primary and key secondary objectives evaluating vaccine efficacy, including efficacy specifically against the B.1.351 variant.
Furthermore, we report on immunogenicity of
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and on post hoc pseudovirus
and live-virus neutralization assay investigations
of the sensitivity of the original D614G virus and
the B.1.351 variant to vaccine-elicited antibodies.


Methods

-----

The authors had full access to the trial data,
confirm the accuracy and completeness of the
data reported, and vouch for the fidelity of the
trial to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). An
independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety
data. A local trial-safety physician reviewed all
serious adverse events as they occurred. The
trial was monitored by an external clinical research organization, which ensured adherence
to the protocol.
The trial was reviewed and approved by the
South African Health Products Regulatory Authority and by the ethics committees of the
University of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town,
Stellenbosch, and OxTREC before trial initiation. All participants were fully informed about
the trial procedures and the possible risks, and
all signed written informed consent documents
before enrollment in the trial.

**Trial Procedures**
Trial participants were randomly assigned to
receive either a 0.33-to-0.5-ml dose (depending
on the lot) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or
placebo by intramuscular injection on the day of
randomization and a second injection 21 to 35
days later. Injections were administered into the
deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm, and
participants were observed for 30 minutes after
the injection for acute reactions. Injections were
prepared and administered by site staff who
were aware of participants’ trial-group assignments but were not involved in any other trial
procedures. Trial participants and all other trial
staff remain unaware of trial-group assignments. Details of the trial procedures are provided in the protocol (pages 68–73). Follow-up is
ongoing.

**Safety**
The safety analysis evaluated the occurrence of
solicited local and systemic reactogenicity within the first 7 days after an injection, unsolicited
adverse events within 28 days after an injection,
changes from baseline in safety laboratory measures, and serious adverse events. Further details
of methods used to evaluate safety and reactogenicity are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Adverse event data through January 15, 2021,
are included in this report.


**SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Whole-Genome**
**Sequencing, and Genome Assembly**
Use of a nucleic acid amplification test for SARSCoV-2 infection included sampling at routine
scheduled visits (detailed in the protocol) and at
nonroutine visits when participants had any
symptom suggestive of Covid-19 illness. Participants were advised at the time of randomization
as to which clinical symptoms should trigger a
visit for investigation of possible SARS-CoV-2
infection (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, short messages were sent to
participants every 2 weeks as a reminder to pre­
sent for investigation if they had symptoms.
Details of nucleic acid amplification testing, wholegenome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis
are described in Supplementary Appendix.

**Neutralization Assays**
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at randomization was
evaluated with the use of an IgG assay of the
nucleoprotein (N), as described elsewhere.[8] For
antibody-neutralization studies, pseudovirus neutralization assays (see the Methods section in
the Supplementary Appendix) were performed
at Monogram Biosciences, to prototype virus on
serum samples obtained 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine in 107 randomly selected
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients who were
seronegative for IgG N protein at enrollment.
To assess neutralization activity of vaccineelicited antibodies against B.1.351, serum samples from group 1 participants who had negative
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at enrollment and varying pseudovirus neutralization assay titers to the
original D614G spike virus at 14 days after the
second injection were tested with pseudovirus
and live-virus neutralization assays for activity
against the B.1.351 variant.[14,21] Testing of neutralizing antibody activity against the original
virus and the B.1.351 variant was undertaken before unblinding of trial-group assignments. The
pseudovirus assays for neutralization activity
against the original D614G spike, an RBD triple
mutant (containing only K417N, E484K, and
N501Y), and the B.1.351 spike were performed at
the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (South Africa).[14] Live-virus neutralization
assay testing was performed by a microneutralization focus-forming assay in Vero E6 cells at
the African Health Research Institute, South

Africa.[14,21] Details of the pseudovirus and livevirus neutralization assays have been published
and are described briefly in the Supplementary
Appendix.[14,21]

**Efficacy Objectives**
The primary end point was efficacy against nucleic acid amplification test–confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset more than 14 days
after the second injection in participants who
were seronegative at randomization. Confirmed
symptomatic Covid-19 and the grading of mild,
moderate, and severe disease were prespecified
and are defined in Tables S1 and S2. Covid-19
cases were evaluated by at least two physicians
who were independent of the trial and were unaware of trial-group assignments. Discordant
assessments were discussed between the two
reviewers. Vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351
variant was a prespecified secondary objective.
Other secondary efficacy objectives included
efficacy against Covid-19 in the overall population (including participants who were seropositive at randomization), efficacy specific to the
baseline seropositive group, and efficacy against
Covid-19 with onset more than 14 or more than
21 days after the first dose. Further details of
secondary efficacy analyses are included in the
Supplementary Appendix. Furthermore, a post
hoc analysis was performed for the overall and
seronegative populations, to evaluate vaccine efficacy against illness occurring more than 14 days
after the first injection, with end-point cases
restricted until October 31, 2020, as a proxy for
non–B.1.351 variant Covid-19. The B.1.351 variant only began to be identified in the areas
where the trial sites (Johannesburg and Tshwane
in Gauteng, and Cape Metro in Western Cape
Province) were based from mid-November 2020
onward (Fig. S1).[15]

**Statistical Analysis**
Participants who received at least one dose of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or placebo and who
returned diary cards completed until day 7 after
the first injection were included in the safety
reactogenicity analysis. The occurrence of each
solicited local and systemic reactogenicity sign
and symptom for 7 days after vaccination, adverse events, and serious adverse events through
January 15, 2021, are presented according to trial
group.


**Participants**
We screened 3022 persons across seven sites and
enrolled 2026 HIV-negative persons in the trial
between June 24 and November 9, 2020. All participants except 5 who did not receive vaccine or
placebo were included in the safety analysis. The
initiation of enrollment coincided with the peak
of the first Covid-19 wave in South Africa (Fig.
S2). Overall, 1010 participants received the vaccine and 1011 received the placebo (Fig. 1). A
total of 1467 seronegative participants (750 assigned to the vaccine and 717 to placebo) were
eligible for the primary efficacy analysis; reasons for exclusion are listed in Figure 1.
The median age of the participants was 30
years, 56.5% identified as male, and the racial
distribution included 70.5% Black Africans,
12.8% Whites, and 14.9% identifying as mixed
race. Nineteen percent of participants were
obese (BMI, 30 to 39.9), 42.0% were smokers,

The primary efficacy analysis was end-point–
driven for the composite of mild, moderate, or
severe Covid-19 and required 42 cases to detect
a vaccine efficacy of at least 60% (with a lower
bound of 0% for the 95% confidence interval),
with 80% power. Vaccine efficacy was calculated
as 1 minus the relative risk, and 95% confidence
intervals calculated with the Clopper–Pearson
exact method are reported. Only participants in
the per-protocol population (all participants who
received two doses of vaccine or placebo and
were grouped according to the injection they
received, regardless of their planned group assignment) who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at
enrollment were included in the primary efficacy
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted
that included seronegative participants in the
modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received two doses and were
grouped by their planned assignment, irrespective of the injection they received). Confidence
intervals reported in this article have not been
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

2.8% had underlying hypertension, and 3.1% had
chronic respiratory conditions. The median time
between doses was 28 days, and the median
duration of follow-up from enrollment and from
14 days after the second dose of vaccine or placebo was 156 and 121 days, respectively (as of
January 15, 2021). Demographic characteristics
of the baseline seronegative population were similar to those of the overall population (Table 1).

**Safety**
Local and systemic reactogenicity data are presented in Figures S3 and S4. The incidence of
adverse events and serious adverse events was
similar among vaccine and placebo recipients
(Tables S3 and S4). The only serious adverse
event attributed to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was a body temperature above 40°C after
the first dose; the fever subsided within 24 hours,
and no reactogenicity was observed after the
second dose. All other events were considered
unrelated or unlikely to be related to the injection received.

**Immunogenicity**
Humoral response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induced strong neutralizing antibodies at
28 days after the first dose (geometric mean
titer, 132; interquartile range, 20 to 404), which
rose further after a second dose (geometric
mean titer, 277; interquartile range, 124 to 526)
(Fig. 2A and Table S5).
There were 25 participants in group 1 (the
group of 70 participants who also had laboratory measures evaluated as part of their safety
analysis) who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at
enrollment and had neutralizing antibody activity against the original D614G virus on the pseudovirus neutralization assay at 14 days after the
second dose. The serum samples from these
participants, obtained 14 days after the second
dose, were further tested with pseudovirus and
live-virus assays for neutralizing activity against
the B.1.351 variant. After unblinding of the data,
6 of the 25 serum samples were identified as
having been obtained from placebo recipients
likely to have been infected with the original
SARS-CoV-2 (which predated the emergence of
the B.1.351 variant in South Africa) during the
follow-up period. Furthermore, nucleic acid amplification testing showed that 6 of the vaccine
recipients were also infected with SARS-CoV-2 by


14 days after the second dose. Six of 13 vaccine
recipients (46%) without evidence of previous
SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no neutralization
activity against an RBD triple-mutant pseudovirus (containing K417N, E484K, and N501Y variants), and 11 of the 13 (85%) had no neutralization activity against B.1.351 pseudovirus (Fig. 2B).
Geometric mean titers dropped from 297
against the original virus to 85 against the RBDonly mutant and 74 against the B.1.351 variant.
Vaccine recipients with nucleic acid amplification test–confirmed illness (before the emergence of B.1.351) showed results similar to those
among participants with no confirmed illness
(Fig. S6). Samples from the SARS-CoV-2–infected placebo recipients showed similarly low neutralizing activity, with residual titers of less than
100 (or undetectable) against the RBD triplemutant pseudovirus and the B.1.351 variant
(Fig. 2B).
Live-virus assay showed lower neutralization
overall, relative to pseudovirus assay (Fig. 2C).
Of the 13 vaccine recipients without evidence of
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during
follow-up, one had undetectable neutralization
activity against B.1.1 and B.1.351. Seven of the
12 participants (58%) with neutralization activity against B.1.1 had undetectable neutralization
activity against the B.1.351 variant, and the remaining 5 showed neutralization that was lower
by a factor of 4.1 to 31.5 (Fig. 2C). As with the
pseudovirus neutralization assay, six vaccine recipients with nucleic acid amplification test–
confirmed illness showed results similar to those
among participants with no confirmed illness
(Fig. S6B, light gray points). Among the six place­
bo recipients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2,
all had detectable neutralization of the B.1.1
variant, whereas neutralization activity against
the B.1.351 variant was undetectable in two
cases, lower neutralization by a factor of 6.0 to
9.5 was noted in three cases, and no change was
seen in one case (Fig. 2C).
Given the potential importance of T cells in
protection from severe disease,[26] we include data
on 17 recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine from the United Kingdom, who were evaluated with T-cell–receptor variable beta-chain sequencing for expansion of spike-specific T cells
(see the Supplementary Appendix). The ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine caused expansion of CD4+ and
CD8+ T lymphocytes to specific epitopes of the

spike protein. Of 87 spike-specific antigens
identified by the sequencing, 75 remained unaffected by the B.1.351 mutations. Of note, the


D215G mutation found in the B.1.351 variant is
within a region that had prevalent T-cell antigen
responses (Fig. S7).

second dose. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients
included in the analysis were randomly selected participants from the efficacy trial who contributed to the pooled
vaccine efficacy and safety results reported from those
studies.[8] **Panel B shows the results of the pseudovirus**

**Vaccine Efficacy**
All 42 cases of Covid-19 were graded as mild (15
vaccine recipients and 17 placebo recipients) or
moderate (4 vaccine recipients and 6 placebo
recipients); there were no cases of severe disease


or hospitalization in either group. The incidence of confirmed mild-to-moderate Covid-19
more than 14 days after the second dose among
previously seronegative participants was 93.6
per 1000 person-years in the placebo group and
73.1 per 1000 person-years in the vaccine group;
vaccine efficacy was 21.9% (95% CI, −49.9 to
59.8) (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Similarly, among
seropositive participants who had had a non­
reactive nucleic acid amplification test before
or at randomization, the incidence of mild-tomoderate Covid-19 more than 14 days after the
second injection did not differ between placebo
(81.9 per 1000 person-years) and vaccine
(73.2 per 1000 person-years) recipients; vaccine
efficacy was 10.6% (95% CI, −66.4 to 52.2)
(Table S6).
Forty-one of the 42 nasal swab samples
(97.6%) were successfully sequenced and classified; 39 (95.1%) cases were caused by the
B.1.351 variant and 2 (4.9%; both in the placebo group) by the B.1.1.1 and B.1.144 lineages
(Fig. S8). Further details of phylogenetic characterization are provided in the Supplementary
Appendix. In a secondary-outcome analysis,
efficacy against B.1.351 was not evident (vaccine efficacy, 10.4%; 95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8)
(Table 2).
Results of analyses of other secondary and
exploratory efficacy end points are detailed in
Table S6. Overall vaccine efficacy for Covid-19
of any degree of severity more than 14 days
after the first dose was 33.5% (95% CI, −13.4
to 61.7). Also presented in Table S6 are efficacy estimates for any symptomatic illness or
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after the
first and second injections; differences in efficacy estimates were nonsignificant and were
similar to those for mild-to-moderate Covid-19
estimates.
In a post hoc analysis of vaccine efficacy at
more than 14 days after a single injection
through October 31, 2020, as a proxy for infection by a non–B.1.351 variant (Fig. S1),[15,27] the
overall attack rate of mild-to-moderate Covid-19
at least 14 days after the first injection was
1.3% in placebo recipients and 0.3% in vaccine
recipients; vaccine efficacy was 75.4% (95% CI,
8.7 to 95.5) (Table S8). Similar efficacy estimates were observed in other post hoc analyses for end points occurring through October
31, 2020.

Discussion


In this trial, we found that two doses of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine had no efficacy
against the B.1.351 variant in preventing mildto-moderate Covid-19. There were no cases of
hospitalization for severe Covid-19 observed in
the study. The lack of efficacy against the
B.1.351 variant should be considered in the context of the 75% efficacy (95% CI, 8.7 to 95.5) in
preventing mild-to-moderate Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after even a single dose of
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine that was observed
before the B.1.351 variant emerged in South Africa. Of note, the vaccine efficacy in preventing
Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant was estimated in a secondary analysis; the trial was
powered for the primary objective of a vaccine
efficacy of at least 60% in preventing Covid-19 of
any severity, irrespective of variants. In addition,
the demographic and clinical profile of the enrolled participants contributed to the absence of
severe Covid-19 cases; hence, the trial findings
are inconclusive with respect to whether the
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine may protect against
severe Covid-19 caused by infection with the
B.1.351 variant.
The pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization
assay experiments, however, provide evidence of
reduced or abrogated vaccine-induced antibody
neutralization against the B.1.351 variant. Although the degree of attenuation that compromises an effective neutralizing antibody response in vivo is unknown, the highest degree
of neutralization achieved against B.1.351 in a
vaccinated participant as determined with the
live-virus neutralization assay was a 1:20 dilution, and the highest remaining titer against
B.1.351 was less than 1:200 with the pseudovirus neutralization assay. Comparison of the
RBD triple mutant and the B.1.351 variant in the
pseudovirus neutralization assay suggests that
much, though not all, of the vaccine-elicited
neutralization is directed to the RBD. A similar
loss of neutralizing activity against the B.1.351
variant in antibodies induced by natural infection after the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak
has been reported.[14]

The responses to the original SARS-CoV-2
virus as determined by pseudovirus neutralization
assays in recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in our trial were similar to the responses in

vaccinated participants in the studies conducted
in the United Kingdom and Brazil (Fig. 2A and
Table S5). The extent to which the effectiveness
of other Covid-19 vaccines may be affected by
variants with mutations similar to those of
B.1.351 (and P.1) could depend on the magnitude
of neutralizing antibody induced by vaccination.
Whether an enhanced antibody response resulting from a longer interval between the first and
second doses of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine,
as described elsewhere,[17,24] might confer better
residual neutralizing activity against the B.1.351
variant than that observed in our trial is not
known.
Although the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have
modest neutralizing antibody activity after the
first dose, they produce a greater increase in
neutralizing activity after the second dose than
that produced by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and
heterologous Sputnik V (adenovirus-26 followed


by adenovirus-5 vector) Covid-19 vaccines.[5,6,9]

Neutralizing activity of the two mRNA vaccines
against the B.1.351 variant has also been observed to be lower, by a factor of 8.6 (mRNA1273 vaccine [Moderna]) or 6.5 (BNT-162b2 vaccine [Pfizer]) on pseudovirus neutralization
assay, than activity against the D614G virus,
whereas no difference was evident against the
N510Y.V1 (B.1.1.7)–like mutant.[19,28,29]

Results of a recent interim analysis of the
NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle spike protein Covid-19
vaccine (Novavax), described in a press release,
have not yet been published. However, reports
suggest that the vaccine may have lower efficacy
against the B.1.351 variant than against the
original virus or the B.1.1.7 variant.[12] In the absence of established correlates of protection
against Covid-19 caused by the original virus or
by B.1.351 or other variants, clinical evidence of
the effectiveness of other Covid-19 vaccines

against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 illness is
needed.
Another recent multinational study that included South Africa evaluated the efficacy of a
single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S nonreplicating
adenovirus type 26 vaccine (Janssen). Interim
results from South Africa reported a vaccine efficacy of 57% against moderate-to-severe Covid-19
and 89% against severe Covid-19 mainly due to
the B.1.351 variant.[13] The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine
study, however, submitted for end-point adjudication only cases confirmed by nucleic acid
amplification test in patients who had at least
three symptoms[30]; consequently, the vaccineefficacy analyses were likely to have excluded the
majority of cases of mild Covid-19 in the study.
Of note, the immunogenicity of the Ad26.
COV2.S vaccine is similar to that of the ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine after the first and second doses
have been administered.[13,31] The neutralizing
antibody response induced by the Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine against the B.1.351 variant has not yet
been reported.
Although the correlation between antibody
response and vaccine efficacy is high, which
suggests that the neutralizing antibody response
is important, T-cell responses may contribute to
protection from Covid-19 even in the presence of
lower neutralizing antibody titers.[32] In a post
hoc analysis reported here, we found that in
spike-specific T cells that expanded after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the majority of
antigens and epitopes remained intact in recognition of the B.1.351 variant.
Although efforts to develop second-generation Covid-19 vaccines targeted against B.1.351
and P1-like variants are under way, the only
Covid-19 vaccines likely to be available for most
of 2021 have been formulated against the original virus. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is likely to be one
of the most accessible of all the currently authorized Covid-19 vaccines,[33,34] with expected manufacture of approximately 3 billion doses during
2021, and the least costly.[35] Relative resistance to
human neutralizing antibody responses is expected to be a feature of the pandemic coronavirus in the years ahead, as a result of pressure
on the virus to select for variants that can transmit despite immunity after natural infection or


vaccination. Deliberations on the utility of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine also need to be made
in the context of ongoing global spread and
community transmission of the B.1.351 variant[36]
and the evolution of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages
that include similar mutations.
