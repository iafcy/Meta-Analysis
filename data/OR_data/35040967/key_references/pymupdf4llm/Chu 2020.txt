Background: Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate
mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 8 sites in
the USA, in healthy adults aged �18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had
not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two
age cohorts (�18-<55 and �55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 mg of mRNA1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes
were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody
level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody
(nAb) response.
Results: Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The
most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following
each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days postvaccination one that were higher at the 100 mg dose relative to the 50 mg dose; this difference was less
apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following
the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated
through day 57.
Conclusions: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in
participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 mg mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family of
viruses that can cause mild to severe illness, such as Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS-CoV) [1]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in Dec 2019, has
caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), leading to widespread morbidity and mortality [2–4].
The urgent need for safe and effective interventions to mitigate
the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted international
efforts to develop antivirals and vaccines. Numerous vaccine

candidates based on traditional and new platforms are currently
being evaluated including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), viral vector
(replicating and non-replicating), virus-like particles, peptidebased, recombinant protein, live attenuated and inactivated virus
modalities. The focus of most of the candidates has been on the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen [5–7].
COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of clinical development, with several candidates in pivotal phase 3 clinical trials,
including mRNA-based vaccines [8,9]. The use of mRNA technology
is a promising pandemic response-strategy which combines a
readily adaptable means of designing immunogens with rapid
manufacturing and scale-up, thereby enabling shorter vaccine
development timelines compared with other approaches [10,11].
mRNA-based vaccines encoding viral antigens have been shown
to be immunogenic against infectious pathogens with an acceptable safety profile in several clinical studies, including early phase
trials of COVID-19 vaccines [12–20]. Additionally, preliminary
findings from the interim analyses of two phase 3 trials of mRNA
vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, demonstrated efficacy in
prevention of COVID-19 and no significant safety concerns to date

[21,22].
mRNA-1273 is a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated mRNA
vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (S-2P). In preclinical studies, mRNA-1273 induced
potent neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were
protective against infection in the lungs and noses of mice without
evidence of immunopathology [23]. Vaccination of rhesus macaques with a 2-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 induced robust SARSCoV-2 neutralizing activity and rapid protection in the upper and
lower airways, in the absence of associated immunopathologic
changes in the lung [24].
In a phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04283461),
mRNA-1273, administered as two injections 28 days apart, was
investigated at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 250 mg in participants
18–55 years of age, and at 25, 50, and 100 lg in older cohorts
(56–70 and >71 years) [16,19]. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding
and neutralizing antibody levels induced by mRNA-1273 vaccine
were similar to or higher than those in convalescent plasma from
recovered COVID-19 patients. Vaccine recipients also developed
Th-1 directed T-cell responses with minimal Th-2 responses. There
were no significant safety concerns, and adverse reactions were
mainly mild or moderate in the younger and older age groups at
the 25 and 100 mg doses. The 100 lg dose induced higher antibody
titers than the 25 lg dose, whereas the 250 mg dose did not lead to
significant increases, which supported evaluation of the 100 lg
dose in phase 2 and phase 3 vaccine trials [16,19,25].
The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, doseconfirmation study was to further evaluate the safety and
immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 given as two vaccinations in 600
healthy adults, 18 years of age and older. Dose levels of 50 and
100 lg mRNA-1273 were chosen for evaluation based on available
safety and immunogenicity data [15,16,19], in two cohorts of participants �18–<55 and �55 years old, in an effort to further elucidate the dose–response relationship of 50 and 100 lg mRNA-1273,
based on the safety and immunogenicity in a larger cohort of
healthy adults.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design and participants

This randomized, placebo-controlled dose-confirmation trial
enrolled participants at 8 sites in the US. The study was conducted
in accordance with the International Council on Harmonization of


regulatory and institutional committees (supplementary material).
All participants provided informed consent.
Eligible participants were adults �18 years, considered by the
investigator to be in good health, who could comply with study
procedures and had a body mass index of 18 kg/m[2]–30 kg/m[2].
Excluded from the study were those with a known history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, exposure to someone with SARS-CoV-2
infection or COVID-19 disease, and acutely ill or febrile
(�38.0�C/100.4�F) 24 h prior to or at screening. Also excluded were
those who had received prior administration of an investigational
CoV vaccine, current prophylactic treatment with investigational
agents against COVID-19, and healthcare or emergency response
workers. Pregnant or breastfeeding females, and sexually active
males and females unwilling to use adequate contraception for at
least 3 months after the second study vaccination were also
excluded. See additional eligibility criteria in the supplementary
protocol.

2.2. Randomization and blinding

Dose levels of 50 and 100 lg mRNA-1273 were evaluated in two
age cohorts, comprised of healthy adult participants aged �18–<55
(cohort 1) and �55 (cohort 2). Within each age cohort, approximately 300 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio
to receive 50 and 100 mg of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The randomization was performed in a blinded manner using a centralized
Interactive Response Technology. Vaccine dose preparation and
administration were performed by unblinded pharmacy personnel
who did not participate in any other aspects of the study. All study
staff, participants, clinical research organization (CRO) and sponsor
personnel will remain blinded to dosing assignment until studyend (day 394), except those involved with the day 57 primary analysis. To enable the primary analysis, limited members of the sponsor team and CRO were unblinded.
The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate is comprised of an mRNA
encoding the prefusion stabilized S protein of SARS-CoV-2 encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle as described previously with modification required for large-scale manufacturing [16,24].

2.3. Procedures

The study was initiated by parallel enrollment of all 300 participants in the younger cohort and a sentinel group of 50 participants
in the older cohort (Fig. S1). Acceptable safety of the sentinel group
and all available data from cohort 1 was confirmed by an independent safety monitoring committee before vaccination of the
remaining participants in cohort 2 (N = 250).
The mRNA-1273 vaccine and placebo were administered as a
deltoid intramuscular injection using a 2-dose regimen with the
first dose given on day 1 and the second on day 29. Vaccine was
provided at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL using normal saline to
dilute the doses prior to administration. Each injection was administered in a volume of 0.5 mL containing 50 or 100 mg of mRNA1273, or saline placebo. Both the first and second doses were
administered in the same (preferably nondominant) arm. Participants were monitored for a minimum of 60 min post-injection.
Assessments included vital sign measurements and monitoring
for local or systemic reactions.
Participants were instructed on performing and recording selfassessments via an electronic diary (eDiary). Safety and reactogenicity assessments included monitoring and daily recording of
solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) using the eDiary during 7 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events
(AEs) observed or reported during the 28 days following each
injection, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study

adverse events (MAAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) from
days 1 through 394, and results of safety laboratory tests, vital sign
measurements, physical examination findings, and assessments for
SARS-CoV-2 infection from day 1 through study completion. After
the day 57 visit, participants received monthly prompts via the
eDiary to capture occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, SAEs and any
COVID-19 symptoms. Solicited local ARs included pain, erythema,
and swelling/induration at the injection site, and localized axillary
swelling or tenderness ipsilateral to the injection arm. Solicited
systemic ARs were headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/
vomiting, rash, fever, and chills. The Toxicity Grading Scale for
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive
Vaccine Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007) was used in this study with
modification for rash, solicited ARs, and vital signs (Table S1).

2.4. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunogenicity
assessments

For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab samples were collected at days 1, 29, and 57 and RNA
was measured using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Viracor Eurofins Clinical Diagnostics, supplementary methods) [26]. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected
using a predetermined baseline cycle threshold value of 38. Participants experiencing pre-specified SARS-CoV-2 disease criteria during the study were asked to contact the study site for a prompt,
thorough clinical assessment.
Immunogenicity was assessed in blood samples collected on
days 1 and 29 (before administration of vaccine) and days 43,
and 57. The assay methods are detailed in the supplementary
methods. Briefly, serum binding antibody (bAb) levels against
SARS-CoV-2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) specific to the S-2P protein developed in collaboration with PPD laboratories (Richmond, Virginia, USA). The antispike antibody concentration (mg/ml) was determined by interpolation from an 11-point dilution of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody (clone CR3022, Rockland, Inc, Limerick, PA).
Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against SARS-CoV-2 were
measured using a live virus microneutralization (MN) assay based
on an in situ ELISA readout. The assay was qualified for evaluation
of human serum and conducted in accordance with Battelle laboratory protocols and qualified critical reagents (Columbus, Ohio,
USA). The final reportable value for each sample was the MN50
titer. Human sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients collected
at least 15 days post-infection confirmed by RT-PCR (BioIVT, Westbury, NY, USA and Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) served
as a reference for the ELISA and MN assays.

2.5. Outcomes

The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by the level of SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein-specific binding antibody (bAb) of 2 dose levels of
mRNA-1273 vaccine, each administered as two vaccinations,
28 days apart. The secondary objective was to evaluate the
immunogenicity of 2 dose levels of mRNA-1273 vaccine, each
administered as two vaccinations 28 days apart, assessed by nAb
titer. The primary safety endpoints were solicited ARs through
7 days after each injection, unsolicited AEs through 28 days after
each injection, MAAEs and SAEs throughout the entire study period, safety laboratory abnormalities at days 29 and 57 (cohort 2
only), and vital sign measurements and physical examination findings. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the level of bAb
measured by ELISA on days 1, 29, 43, 57, 209, and 394. The secondary objective endpoints were titer of SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb


29, 43, 57, 209, and 394 as measured by an increase of SARSCoV-2-specific nAb titer from below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to �LLOQ, or a 4-times higher titer in participants with
pre-existing nAb titers.

2.6. Statistical analysis

There was no formal hypothesis-testing in this study. No formal
power calculation was done. The number of proposed participants
was considered sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of the
safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of mRNA1273.
Data presented are from the primary analysis of safety and
immunogenicity when all participants had completed day 57 study
procedures but prior to the final analysis of all endpoints to be performed after all participants have completed 13-month study procedures. Descriptive results of safety and immunogenicity analyses
are presented. Analyses were performed by treatment group overall (2 cohorts combined) and for each cohort individually. Safety
analyses were based on the safety set consisting of all randomly
assigned participants who received any study vaccination, except
solicited ARs which were based on the solicited safety set comprising all participants who were randomly assigned, received any
study injection and contributed any solicited AR data. Safety analyses are presented as counts, percentages, and associated Clopper–
Pearson 95% confidence intervals, as appropriate, for local reactions, systemic events and any unsolicited adverse events, MAAEs
and SAEs according to preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (Version 23.0) by group. Summary statistics were provided for abnormal laboratory values and grading
shifts.
Immunogenicity analyses were performed in the per-protocol
dataset comprised of all randomly assigned participants who had
baseline data available and at least one post-injection assessment
for the analysis endpoint, complied with two injection schedule
and timings of immunogenicity blood sampling with postinjection results available for at least one assay component, and
did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline nor major protocol
deviations that could impact the immunogenicity analysis. For
the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean (GM) of specific
bAb levels and GM titers (GMT) for nAb with the corresponding
95% CI at each timepoint are reported. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum are also provided.
Antibody values reported as below the LLOQ were replaced by
0.5 � LLOQ. Values that were greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) were converted to the ULOQ. The number and
percentage of participants with seroconversion in SARS-CoV-2specific nAb titers from baseline are reported with a 2-sided 95%
CI using the Clopper-Pearson method at each post-baseline
timepoint.
All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 or higher
(SAS Institute).

3. Results

Between 22 May 2020 and 08 July 2020, 1090 participants were
screened and 600 eligible participants were randomized (Fig. 1). Of
these, 300 participants were included in each age cohort (�18–<
55 years and �55 years), and randomly assigned to receive 50 or
100 mg of mRNA-1273 vaccine or placebo administered as two
injections. Thirteen participants did not receive a second vaccination, including one who experienced an AE related to SARS-CoV-2
infection, five lost to follow-up, one who withdrew consent, two
AEs, one of which was considered serious and the other a solicited

Fig. 1. Trial profile. Percentages are based on the number of randomized participants in the study. [a]Confirmed adverse event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. [b]Considered a serious
adverse event due to community-acquired pneumonia that led to study vaccine discontinuation that occurred on day 33 and resolved on day 58, outside the primary
endpoint evaluation of unsolicited AEs through 28 days after each injection. [c]n = 92, 90, and 95 for both bAb and nAb in placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg mRNA-1273 groups,
respectively. [d]n = 94, 95, and 94 for bAb and 89, 89, and 91 for nAb in placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg mRNA-1273 groups, respectively. The ‘‘other” reasons for study vaccine
discontinuations included 3 false positive COVID-19 infection results reported from central labs and 1 participant that reported a positive COVID-19 infection result from an
external lab at day 15.


The baseline characteristics were generally balanced across
study vaccine groups in each cohort (Table 1). Mean ages were
37.4 (range 18–54) and 64.3 (range 55–87) years, 59% and 71%
were females, and the majority of participants were white (92%
and 97%) in the younger and older cohorts, respectively.
Solicited local and systemic ARs through day 7 were mainly
mild or moderate in severity in both cohorts after the first and second vaccinations (Fig. 2 and Table S2). The incidences of ARs
occurred at higher frequencies in participants who received
mRNA-1273 than placebo. The most commonly reported local AR
after vaccination one was pain at the injection site in younger participants in the 50 mg (73%) and 100 mg (86%) mRNA-1273 and placebo (14%) groups, and for 50 mg (58%) and 100 mg (81%) mRNA1273, and placebo (7%) in older participants. After vaccination
two, injection site pain was also the most frequent local AR with
higher incidences in the 50 mg (80%) and 100 mg (90%) mRNA1273 groups than placebo (10%) in younger recipients, and at
50 mg (79%) and 100 mg (81%) mRNA-1273 versus placebo (6%) in
older recipients.
The most frequent solicited systemic ARs after the first vaccination were headache in the 50 mg (29%) and 100 mg (25%) mRNA1273, and placebo (18%) groups in younger adults, and for 50 mg
(29%) and 100 mg (18%) mRNA-1273, and placebo (18%) in older
adults. Fatigue was also commonly reported in the 50 mg (24%)
and 100 mg (30%) mRNA-1273 and placebo (17%) groups in younger
participants and for 50 mg (24%) and 100 mg (20%) mRNA-1273, and
placebo (19%) in older participants. Systemic ARs occurred more
frequently after the second vaccination in the mRNA groups in
both cohorts and most commonly were headache for 50 mg (51%)
and 100 mg (56%) mRNA-1273 and placebo (15%) in the younger
cohort and 50 mg (48%) and 100 mg (50%) mRNA-1273 and placebo
(19%) in the older cohort. Fatigue was also frequently reported in
the 50 mg (45%) and 100 mg (66%) mRNA-1273 and placebo (20%)
groups in younger adults, and for 50 mg (61%) and 100 mg (64%)
mRNA-1273 and placebo (22%) in older adults. Additionally, incidences of myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and chills
increased after the second vaccination in the mRNA-1273 groups
of both cohorts.
The majority of solicited AR were mild and moderate in severity. The incidence of grade 3 reactions increased after the second
vaccination, particularly for systemic reactions. The greatest over

and myalgia (7.6%) after the second dose of 100 mg of mRNA1273. Mean durations for solicited ARs were similar across the placebo and mRNA-1273 groups and ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 days in
young adults and 2.1–3.7 days in older adults after vaccination
one (Table S3). The mean duration of any solicited ARs were also
generally comparable across the mRNA-1273 and placebo groups
after vaccination two, ranging from 3 to 4 days in younger and
1.9–3.4 days in older adults.
There were no significant differences in the rates of unsolicited
AEs reported through 28 days after each vaccination, across the
mRNA-1273 and placebo groups in the younger (77 [26%]) and
older (87 [29%]) cohorts (Table 2 and Table S4). The majority of
AEs were generally mild and moderate in severity, and no deaths
or serious AEs were reported. There were 11 (4%) severe events
in the younger and 5 (2%) in the older cohorts. The incidences of
MAAEs were similar in younger (29 [10%]) and older (27 [9%]) participants across placebo and mRNA-1273 groups regardless of
treatment attribution.
Unsolicited AEs related to study vaccine were reported in 31
(10%) younger and 25 (8%) older participants and occurred at a
higher incidence at 100 mg mRNA-1273 (18%) than placebo (6%)
in younger adults (Table 2). No deaths or unsolicited AEs that led
to discontinuation from study vaccine or the study occurred within
28 days. One SAE of community-acquired pneumonia occurred on
day 33 at 50 mg mRNA-1273 in the older cohort, resolved on day 58
and led to study vaccine discontinuation. This event was considered not related to investigational vaccine by the investigator. No
study pause rules were met. The overall incidence of study
vaccine-related severe AEs was low in both younger (7 [2%]) and
older (1 [<1%]) adults across the placebo and both mRNA-1273
groups. Severe events occurring in >1% of participants included
fatigue for placebo (2%), fatigue (1%), arthralgia (2%), and axillary
pain (1%) for 50 mg mRNA-1273, and headache (1%) for 100 mg
mRNA-1273 in younger individuals, and fatigue (1%) for 50 mg
mRNA-1273 in those older (Table S4). Study vaccine-related
MAAEs were higher in younger (5 [3%]) than older (2 [1%]) participants with all of the events in the younger cohort occurring in the
mRNA-1273 groups.
Three participants were symptomatic and had positive NP
swabs for SARS-CoV-2, two of whom had received placebo and
one who received 50 mg of mRNA-1273. Four participants were

the 100 mg group reporting exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and a smaller
number developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, none
had positive NP swabs at scheduled or unscheduled time points.
No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported
(Table S5).
None of the placebo or mRNA-1273 participants had detectable
anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb at baseline. Both doses of mRNA-1273


induced increases in the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb from
baseline by day 29, 28 days after the first vaccination (Fig. 3A).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb levels increased substantially by
14 days (day 43) after the second vaccination to GM mean (95%
CI) peak levels of 189 (173–207) and 239 (221–259) mg/ml at 50
and 100 mg mRNA-1273 respectively in younger participants, and
153 (135–175) and 162 (142–185) mg/ml in older participants.
These levels vastly exceeded those in convalescent COVID-19 sera
(48 [38–60] mg/ml). Antibody levels remained elevated through
day 57, 28 days after vaccination, in the younger (146 [132–161]
and 181 [164–200)] mg/ml) and older (107 [93–123)] and 121

[105–139)] mg/ml) cohorts at the 50 and 100 mg mRNA-1273 doses,
respectively.
Neutralizing antibody titers were undetectable at baseline in all
study participants. After the first vaccination at both mRNA-1273
doses, nAb GMTs increased from baseline by day 29, 28 days
post-vaccination one (Fig. 3B and Table 3). Fourteen days following
the second vaccination (day 43), nAbs were significantly enhanced
to maximum GMTs (95% CI) of 1733 (1611–1865) mg/ml at 50 mg
mRNA-1273 and 1909 (1849–1971) mg/ml at 100 mg mRNA-1273
in younger adults, and 1827 (1722–1938) mg/ml at 50 mg mRNA1273 and 1686 [1521–1869]) mg/ml at 100 mg mRNA-1273 in older
adults. These GMTs were 5–6 fold higher those of the convalescent
COVID-19 control sera (321 [235–438] mg/ml). Little numeric
change in nAb GMTs was observed at 28 days post-vaccination
two (day 57) with titers remaining high for both mRNA-1273 dose
levels and in both age groups.
SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb responses met criteria for seroconversion in 70% and 83% of younger recipients at the 50 and 100 mg
mRNA-1273 doses respectively, and 61% and 70% in older participants by day 29, 28 days after the first vaccination (Table 3). By
day 43, 14 days after the second vaccination, seroconversion rates
of 100% were observed for all participants tested in both cohorts.
Seroconversion rates of 100% were also observed at day 57 in
younger and older participants at both mRNA-1273 doses.
A post-hoc exploratory analysis of immunogenicity in subgroups of participants aged �55-<65, �65-74 and �75 years was
performed (Tables S6 and S7). Increases in levels of anti-SARSCoV-2-spike bAb and nAb at days 29 and post-second vaccination
at both the 50 and 100 mg doses were generally comparable across
the age subgroups and with those observed in the younger (18–
55 years) study participants. Seroconversion rates were also comparable across the age groups and with those in the younger participants. It should be noted that the small size of the �75 year-old
subgroup (n = 22) precludes definitive conclusions to be made.

4. Discussion

In this randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, the SARS-CoV-2
vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, administered as a two-dose vaccination regimen at 50 and 100 mg, exhibited robust immune
responses and an acceptable safety profile in healthy adults aged
18 years and older. Local and systemic adverse reactions were


duration and were less commonly reported in older compared with
younger adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing
antibodies were induced by both doses of mRNA-1273 within
28 days after the first vaccination, and rose substantially to peak
titers by 14 days after the second vaccination, exceeding levels of
convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. The antibodies
remained elevated through the last timepoint assessed at 57 days.
Neutralizing responses met criteria for seroconversion within
28 days after the first vaccination in the majority of participants,
with rates of 100% observed at 14 and 28 days after the second vaccination. While no formal statistical testing was done, binding and
neutralizing antibody responses were generally comparable in participants who received the 100 mg mRNA-1273 and the 50 mg dose
at all time points and across both age groups. Overall, the results of
this randomized, placebo-controlled trial extend previous
immunogenicity and safety results for mRNA-1273 in the phase
1 study in an expanded cohort including participants older than
55 years of age [16,19].
The safety and reactogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine
through 28 days after the last dose was consistent with data previously published for other mRNA vaccines, including those of recent
COVID-19 studies [12–20]. Solicited local and systemic symptoms
were reported more frequently after mRNA-1273 than placebo and
were reported at higher frequencies after the second dose. The
occurrence of some solicited AR, fever and chills for example, were
higher in participants who received 100 mg compared with 50 mg of
mRNA-1273; however, the reactogenicity was generally not dosedependent. The reported rates in participants �55 years of age
tended to be lower than in participants 18–55 years of age,
although formal statistical comparisons were not performed.
Unsolicited AEs, including severe AEs, regardless of relationship
to study vaccination, occurred at similar frequencies across the
mRNA groups and placebo groups in both age cohorts.
Treatment-related AEs occurred at higher rates in the mRNA group
compared with placebo in younger participants, attributed to a
greater frequency of injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema,
induration) reported as unsolicited events per criteria described
in the protocol. The safety profile of mRNA-1273 seen in the two
age cohorts in this study was also consistent with the results
observed in the phase 1 trial of mRNA-1273 [19].
Neutralizing antibody levels have been shown to correlate with
protection against viral diseases; however, immune correlates to

at the corresponding visit days. Antibody values below the LLOQ were replaced by 0.5 � LLOQ. Values greater than the ULOQ were converted to the ULOQ. For visit day 29,
visit window (�3/+7 days) was used to define per-protocol. If the visit (day 29) was disrupted and could not be completed at day 29 (�3/+7 days) as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, the window was extended to day 29 + 21 days. The 95% CI were calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-transformed values for GMT and GM levels, then
back transformed to the original scale for presentation. The bAb values reported are ELISA concentrations mg/ml and nAb values are MN50 titers (LLOQ = 91.1 and
ULOQ = 2031.9). Seroconversion rate at the participant level was defined as a change of nAb titer from below the LLOQ to �LLOQ, or a 4-times or higher ratio in participants
with pre-existing nAb. Human convalescent sera collected from COVID-19 symptomatic patients at least 15 days post-infection confirmed by RT-PCR, and tested by MN
(n = 32) and by ELISA (n = 119) served as reference control titers. [a]Responses in participants who received placebo averaged across days, study vaccine group and cohorts.

Antibody-mediated immune responses are likely to be effective
against SARS-COV-2, based on evidence from studies in nonhuman primate challenge models and the reported results for both
COVID-19 convalescent sera and monoclonal antibody therapies in
early clinical trials [24,27–30]. In that regard, it is encouraging that
vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited similar neutralizing activity


demonstrated in the phase 1 studies of mRNA-1273 [16,19,31].
Moreover, robust and comparable bAb concentrations and nAb
titers were observed at both mRNA-1273 dose levels and were substantially enhanced following the second vaccination to levels
higher than those in human convalescent serum from COVID-19
patients. Overall, these data indicate dose-dependent immune

mRNA-1273 and confirm that a robust immune response is generated at both 50 and 100 mg dose levels.
Vaccines developed based on mRNA technology can be rapidly
engineered and scaled-up, offering accelerated timelines to determine efficacy compared to more traditional approaches [10,11].
In particular, the mRNA platform provides an important rapidresponse strategy in times of epidemics and pandemics, as well
as for emerging pathogens, and other unmet medical needs. To
date, an mRNA medicine has not been approved for human use,
although multiple mRNA vaccines have shown encouraging
immunogenicity and safety results in early-stage clinical trials
against other viruses such as influenza, Zika, rabies, respiratory
syncytial, and cytomegalovirus [12–20]. The success of largerscale mRNA trials will further enhance the development of mRNA
vaccines. In line with this, recent preliminary results from two
large phase 3 trials demonstrated the efficacy of mRNA vaccines
for COVID-19 with no significant safety concerns [21,22].
While this was the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial to
evaluate the mRNA-1273 vaccine, there are some limitations. The
study population was not designed at the time to be representative
of those at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Importantly,
the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine is being assessed in larger and more diverse populations in the 30,000 participant-phase 3
Coronavirus Efficacy and Safety Study (COVE) study. Additionally,
the present study was not designed for statistical comparison of
superiority or equivalence between doses of mRNA-1273; thus,
conclusions are necessarily qualitative. Although antibody
responses were generated by mRNA-1273 that, on average,
exceeded those of convalescent sera, at the present time a serologic
correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Additional data informing the duration of immunogenicity

13-month follow-up to the end-of-study in this trial, as well as
from the expanded testing in the ongoing COVE trial.
In conclusion, the results of this phase 2 trial provide additional
evidence supporting the immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose
regimen of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine mRNA-1273 at 50 and 100 mg
doses. The 13-month end-of study assessment of this trial and
the ongoing phase 3 COVE trial may provide additional longerterm data on the safety and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 vaccine.
