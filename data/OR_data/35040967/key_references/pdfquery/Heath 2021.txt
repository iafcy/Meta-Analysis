BACKGROUND 
Early clinical data from studies of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (Novavax), a recom- 
binant nanoparticle vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) that contains the full-length spike glycoprotein of the prototype 
strain plus Matrix-M adjuvant, showed that the vaccine was safe and associated 
with a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. Additional data were 
needed regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of this vaccine in a 
larger population. 
METHODS 
In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted 
at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 
84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 
or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was viro- 
logically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset 
at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically 
negative at baseline. 
RESULTS 
A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included 
in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years 
of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 
participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom 
onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were 
reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection 
were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed 
an efficacy of 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant 
and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.5) against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was 
generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and 
similar in the two groups. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants 
conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy 
against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020 - 004123 - 16.)

acute respiratory syndrome coronavi- 
gence as a global pandemic, severe 
rus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated 
with more than 177 million cases resulting in 
more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide as of 
June 21, 2021.1 To control this pandemic, efforts 
were accelerated to develop safe and effective 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the 
spike glycoprotein of the prototype strain.2 By 
early 2021, several vaccine candidates had 
emerged as safe and effective in preventing coro- 
navirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), findings that 
supported the emergency use of these vaccines 
around the world.3-6 
In late 2020, reports from the United King- 
dom, Brazil, and South Africa confirmed the 
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants — B.1.1.7 (or 
alpha), P.1 (or gamma), and B.1.351 (or beta), 
respectively — that have been associated with 
increased transmission, more severe disease, 
and varying degrees of immune avoidance to 
Covid-19 vaccines.7-9 In the United Kingdom, the 
B.1.1.7 variant was identified from genomic se- 
quencing of samples obtained from patients with 
Covid-19 in the southeast of England in early 
October 2020. During December 2020, this new 
variant spread from the southeast region to Lon- 
don and the rest of the country. Subsequently, 
the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant has been 
increasing rapidly in Europe and the United 
States.7 These new variants may threaten our 
current attempts at controlling Covid-19 and 
lead to additional health and socioeconomic 
consequences. 
Early clinical data from studies of the NVX- 
CoV2373 vaccine (Novavax), which consists of 
5 μg of a recombinant nanoparticle spike protein 
plus 50 μg of Matrix-M adjuvant, have shown 
that a two-dose regimen administered 21 days 
apart was safe and associated with a robust im- 
mune response in healthy adult participants.10,11 
Here, we present data from the 2019nCoV-302 
study, a phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, 
placebo-controlled trial, to evaluate the efficacy, 
immunogenicity, and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in 
preventing Covid-19 in participants between the 
ages of 18 and 84 years in the United Kingdom. 
This ongoing trial was initiated during the pe- 
riod in which the B.1.1.7 variant was starting to 
circulate more widely. 

From September 28 to November 28, 2020, we 
enrolled participants at 33 sites in the United 
Kingdom. Eligible participants were men and 
nonpregnant women between the ages of 18 and 
84 years who were healthy or had stable chronic 
medical conditions, including human immuno- 
deficiency virus infection (for which they were 
receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy) and 
cardiac and respiratory diseases. Key exclusion 
criteria were a history of documented Covid-19, 
treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or a 
diagnosis of an immunodeficient condition. The 
protocol containing the statistical analysis plan 
is available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. All the participants provided written 
informed consent. 
Oversight 
The trial was designed and funded by Novavax, 
the manufacturer of NVX-CoV2373. The trial pro- 
tocol was approved by the North West–Greater 
Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee. 
The trial was performed in accordance with the 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the Interna- 
tional Council for Harmonisation. (Details re- 
garding trial oversight are provided in the Sup- 
plementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.) All 
data were gathered by the non-Novavax authors 
(representing each trial site) and their teams; all 
the analyses were performed by representatives 
of Novavax. Confidentiality agreements were in 
place between all the authors and the trial spon- 
sor. The first draft of the manuscript was written 
by the first author with subsequent contributions 
from all the authors. Editorial assistance in the 
preparation of the manuscript was provided by 
Phase Five Communications and funded by No- 
vavax. All trial data were available to all the au- 
thors. Safety oversight for specific rules regard- 
ing a pause in vaccination was performed by an 
independent safety monitoring committee. All 
the authors assume responsibility for the accu- 
racy and completeness of the data and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
Trial Procedures 
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive two 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or 




placebo (normal saline) administered 21 days 
apart by means of a centralized interactive- 
response system, according to a pregenerated 
randomization schedule. Randomization was 
stratified according to trial site and age (<65 years 
or ≥65 years). In a 400-person subgroup, partici- 
pants received a concomitant dose of seasonal 
influenza vaccine along with the first dose of 
NVX-CoV2373. Results of this subgroup analy- 
sis, along with immunogenicity data from the 
current trial, are not reported here. 
Because this was an observer-blinded trial, 
site personnel who were aware of trial-group as- 
signments managed the logistics and preparation 
of the trial vaccines but were not involved in trial- 
related assessments and did not have contact 
with the participants for data collection after 
vaccine administration. 
Safety 
Safety was assessed in all the participants who 
had received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 
or placebo. Solicited local and systemic adverse 
events were summarized according to the toxic- 
ity grading criteria of the Food and Drug Ad- 
ministration (FDA) (Appendix 4 in the protocol) 
and the time period after each injection. Unso- 
licited adverse events were coded according to 
the preferred terms and system organ classes 
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, ver- 
sion 23.1, and summarized according to severity 
(mild, moderate, or severe) and the assessed re- 
lationship to the vaccine. (Details are provided 
in Section 6.4.1.4 in the protocol.) 
After each injection, participants were ob- 
served for at least 30 minutes to monitor for any 
acute reactions. Solicited local and systemic ad- 
verse events were collected by means of an elec- 
tronic diary for 7 days after each dose in a sub- 
group of participants (solicited adverse event 
subgroup). All the participants were assessed for 
unsolicited adverse events from the first dose 
through 28 days after the second dose. In this 
ongoing study, we are evaluating serious adverse 
events, adverse events of special interest, and 
medically attended adverse events from the first 
dose through 1 year after the second dose. 
Efficacy 
The primary end point was the efficacy of the 
NVX-CoV2373 vaccine against the first occur- 
rence of virologically confirmed symptomatic 
mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19 with onset at 
least 7 days after the second dose among par- 
ticipants who were seronegative at baseline, as 
determined by the results of testing for anti– 
nucleocapsid antibody. Symptomatic Covid-19 
was defined according to the criteria of the FDA. 
The severity of Covid-19 cases was deter- 
mined in a blinded fashion on the basis of a 
prespecified, automated algorithm. This algorithm 
synthesized data points (e.g., symptom diary 
entries, emergency department and hospitaliza- 
tion records, findings on physical examination, 
and vital signs) collected throughout the trial to 
assign severity on the basis of the FDA criteria 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Symp- 
toms of suspected Covid-19 were monitored 
throughout the trial and collected with the use 
of an electronic diary (the InFLUenza Patient- 
Reported Outcome questionnaire) for at least 10 
days. At the onset of suspected symptoms, respi- 
ratory specimens from the nose and throat were 
collected daily over a 3-day period to confirm 
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a 
clinical assessment was performed. Virologic con- 
firmation was performed by means of polymerase- 
chain-reaction (PCR) assay at the U.K. Depart- 
ment of Health and Social Care laboratories with 
the TaqPath system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Samples were not available for sequencing, and 
virus-strain characterization was based on PCR 
data alone.12 Results were described as being 
S-gene negative (or having S-gene target failure) 
if the PCR target of the spike-protein gene was 
not detected but other PCR targets (i.e., N and 
ORF1ab genes) were detected; such results were 
presumed to indicate the presence of B.1.1.7 
variants. (Details regarding these analyses are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) 
Statistical Analysis 
We determined that the enrollment of approxi- 
mately 15,000 participants (resulting in a total 
number of 100 mild, moderate, or severe cases 
of Covid-19) would provide an overall power of 
more than 95% to determine a vaccine efficacy 
of 70% or more. A single interim analysis of ef- 
ficacy was to be conducted after the identifica- 
tion of approximately 50% of the total antici- 
pated primary end points (50 events) with the 
use of Pocock stopping boundaries. The main 



hypothesis-testing, event-driven interim and final 
analyses of the primary end point were per- 
formed at an overall one-sided type I error rate 
of 0.025 for the primary end point. 
The primary end point was analyzed in the 
per-protocol efficacy population, which consisted 
of the participants who were seronegative at base- 
line, had received both doses of trial vaccine or 
placebo, had no major protocol deviations affect- 
ing the primary end point, and had no confirmed 
cases of symptomatic Covid-19 during the period 
from the first dose until 6 days after the second 
dose. We also performed an intention-to-treat 
analysis, which included all the participants who 
had undergone randomization and had received 
at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Vaccine 
efficacy was defined as VE (%) = (1 – RR) × 100, 
in which RR is the relative risk of incidence be- 
tween the two trial groups. Mean values for 
disease occurrence are reported as the incidence 
per year per 1000 participants. The estimated 
relative risk and its confidence interval were 
calculated with the use of Poisson regression 
with robust error variance.13 Hypothesis testing 
of the primary end point was performed against 
the null hypothesis of a vaccine efficacy of 30% 
or less. The success criterion required rejection 
of the null hypothesis to show a vaccine efficacy 
that met the criteria for statistical significance. 
All other efficacy end points were analyzed by 
means of the same method that was used for 
determining the primary efficacy end point with- 
out adjustment for multiple comparisons (i.e., at 
a two-sided alpha of 0.05). 
Participants 
Of the 16,645 participants who were screened, 
15,187 underwent randomization (Fig. 1). A total 
of 15,139 participants received at least one dose 
of NVX-CoV2373 (7569 participants) or placebo 
(7570 participants); 14,039 participants (7020 in 
the vaccine group and 7019 in the placebo group) 
met the criteria for the per-protocol efficacy 
population. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the participants at baseline were well balanced 
between the groups in the per-protocol efficacy 
population, in which 48.4% were women; 94.5% 
were White, 2.9% were Asian, and 0.4% were 
Black. A total of 44.6% of the participants had 
at least one coexisting condition that had been 
defined by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention as a risk factor for severe Covid-19. 
These conditions included chronic respiratory, 
cardiac, renal, neurologic, hepatic, and immu- 
nocompromising conditions as well as obesity.14 
The median age was 56 years, and 27.9% of 
the participants were 65 years of age or older 
(Table 1). 
Safety 
A total of 2310 participants were included in the 
subgroup in which adverse events were solicited. 
Solicited local adverse events were reported more 
frequently in the vaccine group than in the pla- 
cebo group after both the first dose (57.6% vs. 
17.9%) and the second dose (79.6% vs. 16.4%) 
(Fig. 2). Among the vaccine recipients, the most 
commonly reported local adverse events were 
injection-site tenderness or pain after both the 
first dose (with 53.3% reporting tenderness and 
29.3% reporting pain) and the second dose (76.4% 
and 51.2%, respectively), with most events being 
grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) in severity and of 
a short mean duration (2.3 days of tenderness and 
1.7 days of pain after the first dose and 2.8 and 
2.2 days, respectively, after the second dose). 
Solicited local adverse events were reported more 
frequently among younger vaccine recipients (18 
to 64 years of age) than among older recipients 
(≥65 years). 
Solicited systemic adverse events were report- 
edly more frequently in the vaccine group than 
in the placebo group after both the first dose 
(45.7% vs. 36.3%) and the second dose (64.0% 
vs. 30.0%) (Fig. 2). Among the vaccine recipients, 
the most commonly reported systemic adverse

The full analysis set (safety population) included all the 
participants who had undergone randomization and re- 
ceived at least one dose of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine 
or placebo, regardless of protocol violations or missing 
data. The primary end point was analyzed in the per- 
protocol population, which included participants who 
were seronegative at baseline, had received both doses 
of trial vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol devia- 
tions affecting the primary end point, and had no con- 
firmed cases of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 
(Covid-19) during the period from the first dose until 
6 days after the second dose.

events were headache, muscle pain, and fatigue 
after both the first dose (24.5%, 21.4%, and 
19.4%, respectively) and the second dose (40.0%, 
40.3%, and 40.3%, respectively), with most events 
being grade 1 or 2 in severity and of a short

tively, after the first dose and 2.0, 1.8, and 1.9 
days, respectively, after the second dose). Grade 4 
systemic adverse events were reported in 3 vac- 
cine recipients. Two participants reported a

and the other after the second dose. A third 
participant was found to have had positive re- 
sults for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR assay at baseline. 
Five days after dose 1, this participant was hos- 
pitalized for Covid-19 symptoms and subsequent- 
ly had six grade 4 events: nausea, headache, fa-

adverse events were reported more often by 
younger vaccine recipients than by older vaccine 
recipients and more often after the second dose 
than after the first dose. Among the vaccine re- 
cipients, fever (temperature, ≥38°C) was reported 
in 2.0% after the first dose and in 4.8% after the

second dose. Grade 3 fever (39°C to 40°C) was 
reported in 0.4% after the first dose and in 0.6% 
after the second dose; grade 4 fever (>40°C) was 
reported in 2 participants, with one event after 
the first dose and one after the second dose. 
All 15,139 participants who had received at 
least one dose of vaccine or placebo through the 
data cutoff date of the final efficacy analysis 
were assessed for unsolicited adverse events. The 
frequency of unsolicited adverse events was high- 
er among vaccine recipients than among placebo 
recipients (25.3% vs. 20.5%), with similar fre- 
quencies of severe adverse events (1.0% vs. 0.8%), 
serious adverse events (0.5% vs. 0.5%), medically 
attended adverse events (3.8% vs. 3.9%), adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of dosing (0.3% 
vs. 0.3%) or participation in the trial (0.2% vs. 
0.2%), potential immune-mediated medical con- 
ditions (<0.1% vs. <0.1%), and adverse events of 
special interest relevant to Covid-19 (0.1% vs. 
0.3%). One related serious adverse event (myo- 
carditis) was reported in a vaccine recipient, 
which occurred 3 days after the second dose and 
was considered to be a potentially immune-medi- 
ated condition; an independent safety monitoring 
committee considered the event most likely to be 
viral myocarditis. The participant had a full re- 
covery after 2 days of hospitalization. No epi- 
sodes of anaphylaxis or vaccine-associated en- 
hanced Covid-19 were reported. 
Two deaths related to Covid-19 were reported, 
one in the vaccine group and one in the placebo 
group. The death in the vaccine group occurred 
in a 53-year-old man in whom Covid-19 symp- 
toms developed 7 days after the first dose; he 
was subsequently admitted to the ICU for treat- 
ment of respiratory failure from Covid-19 pneu- 
monia and died 15 days after vaccine adminis- 
tration. The death in the placebo group occurred 
in a 61-year-old man who was hospitalized 24 days 
after the first dose; the participant died 4 weeks 
later after complications from Covid-19 pneumo- 
nia and sepsis. 
Efficacy 
Among the 14,039 participants in the per-proto- 
col efficacy population, cases of virologically con- 
firmed, symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe 
Covid-19 with an onset at least 7 days after the 
second dose occurred in 10 vaccine recipients 
(6.53 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 3.32 to 12.85) and in 96 placebo 
recipients (63.43 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 
45.19 to 89.03), for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% 
(95% CI, 80.2 to 94.6) (Fig. 3). Of the 10 vaccine 
breakthrough cases, 8 were caused by the B.1.1.7 
variant, 1 was caused by a non-B.1.1.7 variant, 
and 1 viral strain could not be identified. Ten 
cases of mild, moderate, or severe Covid-19 (1 in 
the vaccine group and 9 in the placebo group) 
were reported in participants who were 65 years 
of age or older (Fig. 4). Severe Covid-19 occurred 
in 5 participants, all in the placebo group. Among 
these cases, 1 patient was hospitalized and 3 vis- 
ited the emergency department; a fifth partici- 
pant was cared for at home. All 5 patients met 
additional criteria regarding abnormal vital signs, 
use of supplemental oxygen, and Covid-19 com- 
plications that were used to define severity (Table 
S1). No hospitalizations or deaths from Covid-19 
occurred among the vaccine recipients in the 
per-protocol efficacy analysis. 
Additional efficacy analyses in subgroups 
(defined according to age, race, and presence or 
absence of coexisting conditions) are detailed in 
Figure 4. Among the participants who were 65 
years of age or older, overall vaccine efficacy was 
88.9% (95% CI, 12.8 to 98.6); efficacy among all 
the participants starting 14 days after the first 
dose was 83.4% (95% CI, 73.6 to 89.5). A post 
hoc analysis of the primary end point identified 
the B.1.1.7 variant in 66 participants and a non- 
B.1.1.7 variant in 29 participants; in 11 partici- 
pants, PCR testing had been performed at a local 
hospital laboratory in which the variant had not 
been identified. Vaccine efficacy was 86.3% 
(95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 variant 
and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.4) against non- 


Figure 3 (facing page). Kaplan–Meier Plots of Efficacy of 
the NVX-CoV2373 Vaccine against Symptomatic Covid-19. 
Shown is the cumulative incidence of symptomatic 
Covid-19 in the per-protocol population (Panel A), the 
intention-to-treat population (Panel B), and the per- 
protocol population with the B.1.1.7 variant (Panel C). 
The timing of surveillance for symptomatic Covid-19 be- 
gan after the first dose in the intention-to-treat popula- 
tion and at least 7 days after the administration of the 
second dose in the per-protocol population (i.e., on day 
28) through approximately the first 3 months of follow-up. 

B.1.1.7 strains. Too few non-White participants 
were enrolled in the trial to draw meaningful 
conclusions about variations in efficacy on the 
basis of race or ethnic group. 
A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vac- 
cine administered 21 days apart was found to be 
safe and 89.7% effective against symptomatic 
Covid-19 caused by both B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 
variants. The timing of accumulated cases in this 
trial allowed for a post hoc assessment of vaccine 
efficacy against strains that included the B.1.1.7 
variant, which is now circulating widely outside 
the United Kingdom and was the most wide- 
spread strain reported in the United States at the 
time of this report15 (Table S5). This variant is 
known to be more transmissible and to be associ- 
ated with a higher case fatality rate than previous 
strains.7 Vaccine efficacy was greater than that 
associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 
(AstraZeneca) (70.4%) in a smaller phase 2–3 trial.16 
Although the trial was not powered to assess 
efficacy for all the circulating SARS-CoV-2 
strains, it is reassuring that substantial efficacy 
was shown against all the strains that were de- 
tected in the trial participants. In particular, the 
efficacy estimate of 96.4% against the non- 
B.1.1.7 strains (the majority of which were the 
prototype strain17) is similar to the efficacy of 
95.0% reported against this strain for the 
BNT161b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine 
(BioNTech/Pfizer) and the efficacy of 94.1% for 
the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna).3,4 The vac- 
cine efficacy was also greater than that reported 
for the adenoviral vector vaccines.5,6 Finally, as 
assessed elsewhere,18 the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine 
has also shown efficacy against the B.1.351 vari- 
ant, albeit at a lower level (51.0%) than has been 
shown for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 strains. 
Prevention of severe disease (including hospi- 
talization, intensive care admission, and death) is 
an important objective of a vaccination program, 
and the two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 
vaccine showed very high efficacy against this 
end point, similar to that reported for other li- 
censed Covid-19 vaccines.3-6 In addition, although 
this trial was not designed to assess vaccine effi- 
cacy after a single dose, NVX-CoV2373 provided 
levels of protection after the first dose in a range 
similar to those of other Covid-19 vaccines.3-6 
The favorable safety profile that was observed 
during phase 1–2 studies of NVX-CoV2373 was

Shown is the efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups within the per-protocol population. 
Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals were derived with the use of Poisson regression with robust error variance. In the inten- 
tion-to-treat population, vaccine efficacy was assessed after the administration of the first dose of vaccine or placebo. Participants who 
identified themselves as being non-White or belonging to multiple races were pooled in a category of “other” race to ensure that the 
subpopulations would be large enough for meaningful analyses. Data regarding coexisting conditions were based on the definition used 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for persons who are at increased risk for Covid-19.

confirmed in this phase 3 trial. Reactogenicity 
was generally mild or moderate, and reactions 
were less common and milder in older partici- 
pants and more common after the second dose. 
Injection-site tenderness and pain, fatigue, head- 
ache, and muscle pain were the most commonly 
reported local and systemic adverse events. The 
incidence of serious adverse events was similar 
in the vaccine and placebo groups (0.5% in each), 
and no deaths were attributed to the receipt of 
the vaccine. 
This trial has several limitations. Although 
approximately 7500 participants received NVX- 
CoV2373, it is not possible to exclude the occur- 
rence of rare adverse events. However, such 
events may be captured through the ongoing 
follow-up of participants, which is planned to 
continue until 12 months after the administra- 
tion of the second dose of vaccine and is also be- 
ing assessed in the larger PREVENT-19 phase 3 
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04611802). 
The PREVENT-19 trial was also able to enroll a 
larger number of participants in racial and eth- 
nic minority groups, whereas only 5.7% of par- 
ticipants in the current trial were non-White. 
Similarly, the efficacy estimates reported here 
are derived from a relatively short duration of 
observation (median, 3 months after dose 2). 
Thus, the ongoing follow-up will provide data 
regarding the durability of vaccine efficacy, a con- 
tinued assessment of severe cases, and an assess- 
ment of efficacy against asymptomatic disease. 
A further limitation of the current trial is the 
lack of sequencing data on viral isolates, although 
the use of S-gene target failure, as detected by 
the TaqPath assay, has proved to be a reliable 
proxy for the presence of B.1.1.7 variants. 
The results of this trial provide further evi- 
dence that immunization with a protein-based, 
adjuvanted vaccine such as NVX-CoV2373 can 
prevent Covid-19 caused by either B.1.1.7 or non- 
B.1.1.7 variants. In addition, NVX-CoV2373 can 
be stored at standard refrigeration temperatures 
and has the potential to induce a broad epitope 
response to the spike protein antigen. Both of 
these attributes are important for the efficient 
implementation of this vaccine globally in view 
of the continued need to vaccinate against emerg- 
ing variants.
