BACKGROUND 
Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respira- 
tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as 
is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants 
of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa. 
METHODS 
We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess 
the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Partici- 
pants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two 
doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride 
solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after 
the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays 
against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points 
were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic 
coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. 
RESULTS 
Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults 
(median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of 
placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutraliza- 
tion assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples 
obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the 
primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 
placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an effi- 
cacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 par- 
ticipants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vac- 
cine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% 
(95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced 
between the vaccine and placebo groups. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection 
against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. (Funded by the Bill

coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has 
occurred with unprecedented speed.1-4 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, a replication-deficient chim- 
panzee adenoviral vector containing the sequence 
for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- 
navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) structural surface glyco- 
protein antigen, is one of six Covid-19 vaccines 
based on different platforms that have been au- 
thorized for emergency use,5-11 with efficacy re- 
sults for two additional vaccines having recently 
been reported.12,13 
Meanwhile, the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene has 
accumulated mutations within the receptor- 
binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal do- 
main (NTD).14,15 These domains are major targets 
of the antibody response elicited by the vaccines. 
The RBD mutations include the N501Y mutation, 
which is associated with increased affinity of 
SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting en- 
zyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.16 In contrast, the E484K 
and K417N RBD mutations and mutations in the 
NTD have been associated with neutralizing 
antibody escape.17 The B.1.1.7 (N501Y.V1) lineage, 
first identified in the United Kingdom, includes 
the N501Y mutation, which has been associated 
with 53% increased transmissibility.18 Neutral- 
izing antibody activity elicited by infection or by 
mRNA vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant are 
largely unaffected.19 The B.1.1.7 variant, how- 
ever, has now evolved to include the E484K 
mutation in the United Kingdom.20 
The B.1.351 (N501Y.V2) lineage first identi- 
fied in South Africa contains the three RBD 
mutations and five additional NTD mutations.14,15 
The sensitivity of B.1.351 to neutralizing anti- 
bodies from convalescent donors infected with 
the prototype lineage virus, assessed with a spike- 
pseudovirus neutralization assay, indicated that 
48% of serum samples were unable to neutralize 
B.1.351, with the rest showing a reduction in 
neutralization titers by a factor of 3 to 86.21 This 
finding was corroborated by a live-virus neutral- 
ization assay, with reduction in antibody activity 
ranging from a factor of 6 to complete knockout 
for the B.1.351 variant.14 Another independent 
lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (P.1) also containing the 
E484K, K417N, and some B.1.351 NTD muta- 
tions has been identified in Brazil.22,23 
A pooled analysis of the efficacy of the 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in the United King- 
dom, Brazil, and South Africa, performed before 
the emergence of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, 
reported an overall vaccine efficacy of 66.7% 
(95.8% confidence interval [CI], 57.4 to 74.0).24 
Recent analysis of the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 
nCoV-19 vaccine against the B.1.1.7 variant in the 
United Kingdom was 74.6% (95% CI, 41.6 to 88.9).25 
Here, we report findings from a multicenter 
phase 1b–2 trial in South Africa evaluating the 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in preventing symp- 
tomatic Covid-19. This interim analysis is limited 
to addressing the primary objective evaluating 
safety and the primary and key secondary objec- 
tives evaluating vaccine efficacy, including effi- 
cacy specifically against the B.1.351 variant. 
Furthermore, we report on immunogenicity of 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and on post hoc pseudovirus 
and live-virus neutralization assay investigations 
of the sensitivity of the original D614G virus and 
the B.1.351 variant to vaccine-elicited antibodies. 
Trial Objectives, Participants, and Oversight 
In this multisite, double-blind, randomized, pla- 
cebo-controlled trial conducted in South Africa, 
we assessed the safety and efficacy of two stan- 
dard doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, 
administered 21 to 35 days apart, as compared 
with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) placebo. 
Adults 18 to less than 65 years of age, with no 
or well-controlled chronic medical conditions, 
were eligible for participation. Included among 
the participants were 70 HIV-negative persons 
enrolled as group 1, in whom intensive safety 
and immunogenicity studies were planned. Key 
exclusion criteria were human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) positivity at screening (for the effi- 
cacy cohort), previous or current laboratory- 
confirmed Covid-19, a history of anaphylaxis in 
relation to vaccination, and morbid obesity (body- 
mass index [BMI, the weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters], ≥40). 
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are pro- 
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was developed at the 
University of Oxford, which was responsible for 
the conduct and oversight of the trial (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). 




The authors had full access to the trial data, 
confirm the accuracy and completeness of the 
data reported, and vouch for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). An 
independent data and safety monitoring com- 
mittee reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety 
data. A local trial-safety physician reviewed all 
serious adverse events as they occurred. The 
trial was monitored by an external clinical re- 
search organization, which ensured adherence 
to the protocol. 
The trial was reviewed and approved by the 
South African Health Products Regulatory Au- 
thority and by the ethics committees of the 
University of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, 
Stellenbosch, and OxTREC before trial initia- 
tion. All participants were fully informed about 
the trial procedures and the possible risks, and 
all signed written informed consent documents 
before enrollment in the trial. 
Trial Procedures 
Trial participants were randomly assigned to 
receive either a 0.33-to-0.5-ml dose (depending 
on the lot) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or 
placebo by intramuscular injection on the day of 
randomization and a second injection 21 to 35 
days later. Injections were administered into the 
deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm, and 
participants were observed for 30 minutes after 
the injection for acute reactions. Injections were 
prepared and administered by site staff who 
were aware of participants’ trial-group assign- 
ments but were not involved in any other trial 
procedures. Trial participants and all other trial 
staff remain unaware of trial-group assign- 
ments. Details of the trial procedures are pro- 
vided in the protocol (pages 68–73). Follow-up is 
ongoing. 
Safety 
The safety analysis evaluated the occurrence of 
solicited local and systemic reactogenicity with- 
in the first 7 days after an injection, unsolicited 
adverse events within 28 days after an injection, 
changes from baseline in safety laboratory mea- 
sures, and serious adverse events. Further details 
of methods used to evaluate safety and reactoge- 
nicity are provided in the Supplementary Appen- 
dix. Adverse event data through January 15, 2021, 
are included in this report. 
SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Whole-Genome 
Sequencing, and Genome Assembly 
Use of a nucleic acid amplification test for SARS- 
CoV-2 infection included sampling at routine 
scheduled visits (detailed in the protocol) and at 
nonroutine visits when participants had any 
symptom suggestive of Covid-19 illness. Partici- 
pants were advised at the time of randomization 
as to which clinical symptoms should trigger a 
visit for investigation of possible SARS-CoV-2 
infection (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen- 
dix). In addition, short messages were sent to 
participants every 2 weeks as a reminder to pre- 
sent for investigation if they had symptoms. 
Details of nucleic acid amplification testing, whole- 
genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis 
are described in Supplementary Appendix. 
Neutralization Assays 
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at randomization was 
evaluated with the use of an IgG assay of the 
nucleoprotein (N), as described elsewhere.8 For 
antibody-neutralization studies, pseudovirus neu- 
tralization assays (see the Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix) were performed 
at Monogram Biosciences, to prototype virus on 
serum samples obtained 2 weeks after the sec- 
ond dose of vaccine in 107 randomly selected 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients who were 
seronegative for IgG N protein at enrollment. 
To assess neutralization activity of vaccine- 
elicited antibodies against B.1.351, serum sam- 
ples from group 1 participants who had negative 
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at enrollment and vary- 
ing pseudovirus neutralization assay titers to the 
original D614G spike virus at 14 days after the 
second injection were tested with pseudovirus 
and live-virus neutralization assays for activity 
against the B.1.351 variant.14,21 Testing of neu- 
tralizing antibody activity against the original 
virus and the B.1.351 variant was undertaken be- 
fore unblinding of trial-group assignments. The 
pseudovirus assays for neutralization activity 
against the original D614G spike, an RBD triple 
mutant (containing only K417N, E484K, and 
N501Y), and the B.1.351 spike were performed at 
the National Institute for Communicable Dis- 
eases (South Africa).14 Live-virus neutralization 
assay testing was performed by a microneutral- 
ization focus-forming assay in Vero E6 cells at 
the African Health Research Institute, South 



Africa.14,21 Details of the pseudovirus and live- 
virus neutralization assays have been published 
and are described briefly in the Supplementary 
Appendix.14,21 
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary end point was efficacy against nu- 
cleic acid amplification test–confirmed symp- 
tomatic Covid-19 with onset more than 14 days 
after the second injection in participants who 
were seronegative at randomization. Confirmed 
symptomatic Covid-19 and the grading of mild, 
moderate, and severe disease were prespecified 
and are defined in Tables S1 and S2. Covid-19 
cases were evaluated by at least two physicians 
who were independent of the trial and were un- 
aware of trial-group assignments. Discordant 
assessments were discussed between the two 
reviewers. Vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 
variant was a prespecified secondary objective. 
Other secondary efficacy objectives included 
efficacy against Covid-19 in the overall popula- 
tion (including participants who were seroposi- 
tive at randomization), efficacy specific to the 
baseline seropositive group, and efficacy against 
Covid-19 with onset more than 14 or more than 
21 days after the first dose. Further details of 
secondary efficacy analyses are included in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Furthermore, a post 
hoc analysis was performed for the overall and 
seronegative populations, to evaluate vaccine ef- 
ficacy against illness occurring more than 14 days 
after the first injection, with end-point cases 
restricted until October 31, 2020, as a proxy for 
non–B.1.351 variant Covid-19. The B.1.351 vari- 
ant only began to be identified in the areas 
where the trial sites (Johannesburg and Tshwane 
in Gauteng, and Cape Metro in Western Cape 
Province) were based from mid-November 2020 
onward (Fig. S1).15 
Statistical Analysis 
Participants who received at least one dose of the 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or placebo and who 
returned diary cards completed until day 7 after 
the first injection were included in the safety 
reactogenicity analysis. The occurrence of each 
solicited local and systemic reactogenicity sign 
and symptom for 7 days after vaccination, ad- 
verse events, and serious adverse events through 
January 15, 2021, are presented according to trial 
group. 
The primary efficacy analysis was end-point– 
driven for the composite of mild, moderate, or 
severe Covid-19 and required 42 cases to detect 
a vaccine efficacy of at least 60% (with a lower 
bound of 0% for the 95% confidence interval), 
with 80% power. Vaccine efficacy was calculated 
as 1 minus the relative risk, and 95% confidence 
intervals calculated with the Clopper–Pearson 
exact method are reported. Only participants in 
the per-protocol population (all participants who 
received two doses of vaccine or placebo and 
were grouped according to the injection they 
received, regardless of their planned group assign- 
ment) who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at 
enrollment were included in the primary efficacy 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted 
that included seronegative participants in the 
modified intention-to-treat population (all par- 
ticipants who received two doses and were 
grouped by their planned assignment, irrespec- 
tive of the injection they received). Confidence 
intervals reported in this article have not been 
adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
Participants 
We screened 3022 persons across seven sites and 
enrolled 2026 HIV-negative persons in the trial 
between June 24 and November 9, 2020. All par- 
ticipants except 5 who did not receive vaccine or 
placebo were included in the safety analysis. The 
initiation of enrollment coincided with the peak 
of the first Covid-19 wave in South Africa (Fig. 
S2). Overall, 1010 participants received the vac- 
cine and 1011 received the placebo (Fig. 1). A 
total of 1467 seronegative participants (750 as- 
signed to the vaccine and 717 to placebo) were 
eligible for the primary efficacy analysis; rea- 
sons for exclusion are listed in Figure 1. 
The median age of the participants was 30 
years, 56.5% identified as male, and the racial 
distribution included 70.5% Black Africans, 
12.8% Whites, and 14.9% identifying as mixed 
race. Nineteen percent of participants were 
obese (BMI, 30 to 39.9), 42.0% were smokers,

2.8% had underlying hypertension, and 3.1% had 
chronic respiratory conditions. The median time 
between doses was 28 days, and the median 
duration of follow-up from enrollment and from 
14 days after the second dose of vaccine or pla- 
cebo was 156 and 121 days, respectively (as of 
January 15, 2021). Demographic characteristics 
of the baseline seronegative population were simi- 
lar to those of the overall population (Table 1). 
Safety 
Local and systemic reactogenicity data are pre- 
sented in Figures S3 and S4. The incidence of 
adverse events and serious adverse events was 
similar among vaccine and placebo recipients 
(Tables S3 and S4). The only serious adverse 
event attributed to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vac- 
cine was a body temperature above 40°C after 
the first dose; the fever subsided within 24 hours, 
and no reactogenicity was observed after the 
second dose. All other events were considered 
unrelated or unlikely to be related to the injec- 
tion received. 
Immunogenicity 
Humoral response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vac- 
cine induced strong neutralizing antibodies at 
28 days after the first dose (geometric mean 
titer, 132; interquartile range, 20 to 404), which 
rose further after a second dose (geometric 
mean titer, 277; interquartile range, 124 to 526) 
(Fig. 2A and Table S5). 
There were 25 participants in group 1 (the 
group of 70 participants who also had labora- 
tory measures evaluated as part of their safety 
analysis) who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at 
enrollment and had neutralizing antibody activ- 
ity against the original D614G virus on the pseu- 
dovirus neutralization assay at 14 days after the 
second dose. The serum samples from these 
participants, obtained 14 days after the second 
dose, were further tested with pseudovirus and 
live-virus assays for neutralizing activity against 
the B.1.351 variant. After unblinding of the data, 
6 of the 25 serum samples were identified as 
having been obtained from placebo recipients 
likely to have been infected with the original 
SARS-CoV-2 (which predated the emergence of 
the B.1.351 variant in South Africa) during the 
follow-up period. Furthermore, nucleic acid am- 
plification testing showed that 6 of the vaccine 
recipients were also infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 
14 days after the second dose. Six of 13 vaccine 
recipients (46%) without evidence of previous 
SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no neutralization 
activity against an RBD triple-mutant pseudo- 
virus (containing K417N, E484K, and N501Y vari- 
ants), and 11 of the 13 (85%) had no neutraliza- 
tion activity against B.1.351 pseudovirus (Fig. 2B). 
Geometric mean titers dropped from 297 
against the original virus to 85 against the RBD- 
only mutant and 74 against the B.1.351 variant. 
Vaccine recipients with nucleic acid amplifica- 
tion test–confirmed illness (before the emer- 
gence of B.1.351) showed results similar to those 
among participants with no confirmed illness 
(Fig. S6). Samples from the SARS-CoV-2–infect- 
ed placebo recipients showed similarly low neu- 
tralizing activity, with residual titers of less than 
100 (or undetectable) against the RBD triple- 
mutant pseudovirus and the B.1.351 variant 
(Fig. 2B). 
Live-virus assay showed lower neutralization 
overall, relative to pseudovirus assay (Fig. 2C). 
Of the 13 vaccine recipients without evidence of 
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during 
follow-up, one had undetectable neutralization 
activity against B.1.1 and B.1.351. Seven of the 
12 participants (58%) with neutralization activ- 
ity against B.1.1 had undetectable neutralization 
activity against the B.1.351 variant, and the re- 
maining 5 showed neutralization that was lower 
by a factor of 4.1 to 31.5 (Fig. 2C). As with the 
pseudovirus neutralization assay, six vaccine re- 
cipients with nucleic acid amplification test– 
confirmed illness showed results similar to those 
among participants with no confirmed illness 
(Fig. S6B, light gray points). Among the six place- 
bo recipients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, 
all had detectable neutralization of the B.1.1 
variant, whereas neutralization activity against 
the B.1.351 variant was undetectable in two 
cases, lower neutralization by a factor of 6.0 to 
9.5 was noted in three cases, and no change was 
seen in one case (Fig. 2C). 
Given the potential importance of T cells in 
protection from severe disease,26 we include data 
on 17 recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vac- 
cine from the United Kingdom, who were evalu- 
ated with T-cell–receptor variable beta-chain se- 
quencing for expansion of spike-specific T cells 
(see the Supplementary Appendix). The ChAdOx1 
nCoV-19 vaccine caused expansion of CD4+ and 
CD8+ T lymphocytes to specific epitopes of the 



spike protein. Of 87 spike-specific antigens 
identified by the sequencing, 75 remained unaf- 
fected by the B.1.351 mutations. Of note, the 
D215G mutation found in the B.1.351 variant is 
within a region that had prevalent T-cell antigen 
responses (Fig. S7).

Vaccine Efficacy 
All 42 cases of Covid-19 were graded as mild (15 
vaccine recipients and 17 placebo recipients) or 
moderate (4 vaccine recipients and 6 placebo 
recipients); there were no cases of severe disease 
or hospitalization in either group. The inci- 
dence of confirmed mild-to-moderate Covid-19 
more than 14 days after the second dose among 
previously seronegative participants was 93.6 
per 1000 person-years in the placebo group and 
73.1 per 1000 person-years in the vaccine group; 
vaccine efficacy was 21.9% (95% CI, −49.9 to 
59.8) (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Similarly, among 
seropositive participants who had had a non- 
reactive nucleic acid amplification test before 
or at randomization, the incidence of mild-to- 
moderate Covid-19 more than 14 days after the 
second injection did not differ between placebo 
(81.9 per 1000 person-years) and vaccine 
(73.2 per 1000 person-years) recipients; vaccine 
efficacy was 10.6% (95% CI, −66.4 to 52.2) 
(Table S6). 
Forty-one of the 42 nasal swab samples 
(97.6%) were successfully sequenced and classi- 
fied; 39 (95.1%) cases were caused by the 
B.1.351 variant and 2 (4.9%; both in the place- 
bo group) by the B.1.1.1 and B.1.144 lineages 
(Fig. S8). Further details of phylogenetic char- 
acterization are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix. In a secondary-outcome analysis, 
efficacy against B.1.351 was not evident (vac- 
cine efficacy, 10.4%; 95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8) 
(Table 2). 
Results of analyses of other secondary and 
exploratory efficacy end points are detailed in 
Table S6. Overall vaccine efficacy for Covid-19 
of any degree of severity more than 14 days 
after the first dose was 33.5% (95% CI, −13.4 
to 61.7). Also presented in Table S6 are effi- 
cacy estimates for any symptomatic illness or 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after the 
first and second injections; differences in effi- 
cacy estimates were nonsignificant and were 
similar to those for mild-to-moderate Covid-19 
estimates. 
In a post hoc analysis of vaccine efficacy at 
more than 14 days after a single injection 
through October 31, 2020, as a proxy for infec- 
tion by a non–B.1.351 variant (Fig. S1),15,27 the 
overall attack rate of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 
at least 14 days after the first injection was 
1.3% in placebo recipients and 0.3% in vaccine 
recipients; vaccine efficacy was 75.4% (95% CI, 
8.7 to 95.5) (Table S8). Similar efficacy esti- 
mates were observed in other post hoc analy- 
ses for end points occurring through October 
31, 2020. 


Figure 2 (facing page). Pseudovirus and Live-Virus 
NeutralizationAssay Findings. 
 
Panel A depicts the results of pseudovirus assay to as- 
sess neutralization of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus in 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients from the United 
Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa. Vaccine serum sam- 
ples from 107 participants in South Africa who were 18 
to 64 years old and seronegative at baseline and were 
assigned to receive two standard doses were evaluated 
in a validated pseudovirus neutralization assay at a cen- 
tralized facility at baseline, at 28 days after the first 
dose, and at 28 days after the second dose. Results for 
226 vaccine recipients enrolled in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
studies in Brazil and 326 in the United Kingdom have 
not been published previously but are included for com- 
parative purposes. Boxes show medians and interquar- 
tile ranges. In trial participants in the United Kingdom, 
Brazil, and South Africa, median titers at 28 days after 
the first dose were 41.35, 46.69, and 131.57, respective- 
ly, and 200.44, 154.40, and 276.61 at 28 days after the 
second dose. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients 
included in the analysis were randomly selected partici- 
pants from the efficacy trial who contributed to the pooled 
vaccine efficacy and safety results reported from those 
studies.8 Panel B shows the results of the pseudovirus 
assay to assess neutralization of the original virus, the 
RBD triple mutant, and the B.1.351 variant. Serum 
samples obtained from 13 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 
recipients without SARS-CoV-2 infection through 41 
days after vaccination (left) and 6 placebo recipients 
who had natural infection-induced antibody (right) 
were assessed with the pseudovirus assay to assess 
neutralization activity against the original D614G lineage, 
an RBD-only chimeric virus containing the K417N, E484K, 
and N501Y substitutions, and the B.1.351 variant. Back- 
ground colors indicate dilutional titers, and pie charts 
summarize the proportions according to dilutional titer. 
Geometric mean titers against each virus are shown 
below the graphs. Panel C shows the results of live-virus 
neutralization assay against the original virus and the 
B.1.351 variant in 13 vaccine recipients (left) and 6 pla- 
cebo recipients who had natural infection–induced anti- 
body (right) of B.1.1.117 (the sublineage [GISAID acces- 
sion EPI_ISL_602622] of B.1.1 used in the assay) and 
B.1.351 variants. Participants were as for the pseudo- 
virus neutralization assay. Neutralization is represented 
by the 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT50), 
the reciprocal of the 50% inhibitory dilution per partici- 
pant. Participants with no detectable neutralization 
(defined as PRNT50<1) are shaded in red. Bars and as- 
sociated numbers represent geometric means (using 
the limit of detection of PRNT50 = 1 for undetectable 
participants), and boxes 95% confidence intervals. 

In this trial, we found that two doses of the 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine had no efficacy 
against the B.1.351 variant in preventing mild- 
to-moderate Covid-19. There were no cases of 
hospitalization for severe Covid-19 observed in 
the study. The lack of efficacy against the 
B.1.351 variant should be considered in the con- 
text of the 75% efficacy (95% CI, 8.7 to 95.5) in 
preventing mild-to-moderate Covid-19 with on- 
set at least 14 days after even a single dose of 
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine that was observed 
before the B.1.351 variant emerged in South Af- 
rica. Of note, the vaccine efficacy in preventing 
Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant was esti- 
mated in a secondary analysis; the trial was 
powered for the primary objective of a vaccine 
efficacy of at least 60% in preventing Covid-19 of 
any severity, irrespective of variants. In addition, 
the demographic and clinical profile of the en- 
rolled participants contributed to the absence of 
severe Covid-19 cases; hence, the trial findings 
are inconclusive with respect to whether the 
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine may protect against 
severe Covid-19 caused by infection with the 
B.1.351 variant. 
The pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization 
assay experiments, however, provide evidence of 
reduced or abrogated vaccine-induced antibody 
neutralization against the B.1.351 variant. Al- 
though the degree of attenuation that compro- 
mises an effective neutralizing antibody re- 
sponse in vivo is unknown, the highest degree 
of neutralization achieved against B.1.351 in a 
vaccinated participant as determined with the 
live-virus neutralization assay was a 1:20 dilu- 
tion, and the highest remaining titer against 
B.1.351 was less than 1:200 with the pseudo- 
virus neutralization assay. Comparison of the 
RBD triple mutant and the B.1.351 variant in the 
pseudovirus neutralization assay suggests that 
much, though not all, of the vaccine-elicited 
neutralization is directed to the RBD. A similar 
loss of neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 
variant in antibodies induced by natural infec- 
tion after the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak 
has been reported.14 
The responses to the original SARS-CoV-2 
virus as determined by pseudovirus neutralization 
assays in recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vac- 
cine in our trial were similar to the responses in 






vaccinated participants in the studies conducted 
in the United Kingdom and Brazil (Fig. 2A and 
Table S5). The extent to which the effectiveness 
of other Covid-19 vaccines may be affected by 
variants with mutations similar to those of 
B.1.351 (and P.1) could depend on the magnitude 
of neutralizing antibody induced by vaccination. 
Whether an enhanced antibody response result- 
ing from a longer interval between the first and 
second doses of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, 
as described elsewhere,17,24 might confer better 
residual neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 
variant than that observed in our trial is not 
known. 
Although the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have 
modest neutralizing antibody activity after the 
first dose, they produce a greater increase in 
neutralizing activity after the second dose than 
that produced by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 
heterologous Sputnik V (adenovirus-26 followed 
by adenovirus-5 vector) Covid-19 vaccines.5,6,9 
Neutralizing activity of the two mRNA vaccines 
against the B.1.351 variant has also been ob- 
served to be lower, by a factor of 8.6 (mRNA- 
1273 vaccine [Moderna]) or 6.5 (BNT-162b2 vac- 
cine [Pfizer]) on pseudovirus neutralization 
assay, than activity against the D614G virus, 
whereas no difference was evident against the 
N510Y.V1 (B.1.1.7)–like mutant.19,28,29 
Results of a recent interim analysis of the 
NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle spike protein Covid-19 
vaccine (Novavax), described in a press release, 
have not yet been published. However, reports 
suggest that the vaccine may have lower efficacy 
against the B.1.351 variant than against the 
original virus or the B.1.1.7 variant.12 In the ab- 
sence of established correlates of protection 
against Covid-19 caused by the original virus or 
by B.1.351 or other variants, clinical evidence of 
the effectiveness of other Covid-19 vaccines

Another recent multinational study that in- 
cluded South Africa evaluated the efficacy of a 
single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S nonreplicating 
adenovirus type 26 vaccine (Janssen). Interim 
results from South Africa reported a vaccine effi- 
cacy of 57% against moderate-to-severe Covid-19 
and 89% against severe Covid-19 mainly due to 
the B.1.351 variant.13 The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
study, however, submitted for end-point adjudi- 
cation only cases confirmed by nucleic acid 
amplification test in patients who had at least 
three symptoms30; consequently, the vaccine- 
efficacy analyses were likely to have excluded the 
majority of cases of mild Covid-19 in the study. 
Of note, the immunogenicity of the Ad26. 
COV2.S vaccine is similar to that of the ChAdOx1 
nCoV-19 vaccine after the first and second doses 
have been administered.13,31 The neutralizing 
antibody response induced by the Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine against the B.1.351 variant has not yet 
been reported. 
Although the correlation between antibody 
response and vaccine efficacy is high, which 
suggests that the neutralizing antibody response 
is important, T-cell responses may contribute to 
protection from Covid-19 even in the presence of 
lower neutralizing antibody titers.32 In a post 
hoc analysis reported here, we found that in 
spike-specific T cells that expanded after vacci- 
nation with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the majority of 
antigens and epitopes remained intact in recog- 
nition of the B.1.351 variant. 
Although efforts to develop second-genera- 
tion Covid-19 vaccines targeted against B.1.351 
and P1-like variants are under way, the only 
Covid-19 vaccines likely to be available for most 
of 2021 have been formulated against the origi- 
nal virus. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is likely to be one 
of the most accessible of all the currently autho- 
rized Covid-19 vaccines,33,34 with expected manu- 
facture of approximately 3 billion doses during 
2021, and the least costly.35 Relative resistance to 
human neutralizing antibody responses is ex- 
pected to be a feature of the pandemic corona- 
virus in the years ahead, as a result of pressure 
on the virus to select for variants that can trans- 
mit despite immunity after natural infection or 
vaccination. Deliberations on the utility of the 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine also need to be made 
in the context of ongoing global spread and 
community transmission of the B.1.351 variant36 
and the evolution of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages 
that include similar mutations.
