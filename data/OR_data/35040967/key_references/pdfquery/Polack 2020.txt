BACKGROUND 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the 
resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people 
in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. 
METHODS 
In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy 
trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg 
per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA 
vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full- 
length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against 
laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. 
RESULTS 
A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received 
injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of 
Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants as- 
signed to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; 
BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 
97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups 
defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of 
coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first 
dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety 
profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the 
injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was 
low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in 
persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to 
that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov

A Quick Take

has affected tens of millions of people 
globally1 since it was declared a pandemic 
by the World Health Organization on March 11, 
2020.2 Older adults, persons with certain coex- 
isting conditions, and front-line workers are at 
highest risk for Covid-19 and its complications. 
Recent data show increasing rates of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection and Covid-19 in other populations, in- 
cluding younger adults.3 Safe and effective pro- 
phylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain 
the pandemic, which has had devastating medi- 
cal, economic, and social consequences. 
We previously reported phase 1 safety and im- 
munogenicity results from clinical trials of the 
vaccine candidate BNT162b2,4 a lipid nanoparticle– 
formulated,5 nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA)6 
encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, modi- 
fied by two proline mutations to lock it in the 
prefusion conformation.7 Findings from studies 
conducted in the United States and Germany 
among healthy men and women showed that two 
30-μg doses of BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody titers and robust antigen- 
specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T-cell respons- 
es.8 The 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers 
elicited by 30 μg of BNT162b2 in older and young- 
er adults exceeded the geometric mean titer mea- 
sured in a human convalescent serum panel, de- 
spite a lower neutralizing response in older adults 
than in younger adults. In addition, the reactoge- 
nicity profile of BNT162b2 represented mainly 
short-term local (i.e., injection site) and systemic 
responses. These findings supported progression 
of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3. 
Here, we report safety and efficacy findings 
from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 
trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and 
efficacy of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in preventing 
Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This 
data set and these trial results are the basis for an 
application for emergency use authorization.9 Col- 
lection of phase 2/3 data on vaccine immunoge- 
nicity and the durability of the immune response 
to immunization is ongoing, and those data are 
not reported here. 
Trial Objectives, Participants and Oversight 
We assessed the safety and efficacy of two 30-μg 
doses of BNT162b2, administered intramuscu- 
larly 21 days apart, as compared with placebo. 
Adults 16 years of age or older who were healthy 
or had stable chronic medical conditions, includ- 
ing but not limited to human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C vi- 
rus infection, were eligible for participation in 
the trial. Key exclusion criteria included a medi- 
cal history of Covid-19, treatment with immuno- 
suppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an im- 
munocompromising condition. 
Pfizer was responsible for the design and 
conduct of the trial, data collection, data analysis, 
data interpretation, and the writing of the 
manuscript. BioNTech was the sponsor of the 
trial, manufactured the BNT162b2 clinical trial 
material, and contributed to the interpretation 
of the data and the writing of the manuscript. 
All the trial data were available to all the authors, 
who vouch for its accuracy and completeness and 
for adherence of the trial to the protocol, which 
is available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. An independent data and safety mon- 
itoring board reviewed efficacy and unblinded 
safety data. 
Trial Procedures 
With the use of an interactive Web-based sys- 
tem, participants in the trial were randomly as- 
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 μg of 
BNT162b2 (0.3 ml volume per dose) or saline 
placebo. Participants received two injections, 21 
days apart, of either BNT162b2 or placebo, deliv- 
ered in the deltoid muscle. Site staff who were 
responsible for safety evaluation and were un- 
aware of group assignments observed partici- 
pants for 30 minutes after vaccination for any 
acute reactions. 
Safety 
The primary end points of this trial were solic- 
ited, specific local or systemic adverse events 
and use of antipyretic or pain medication within 
7 days after the receipt of each dose of vaccine 
or placebo, as prompted by and recorded in an 
electronic diary in a subset of participants (the 
reactogenicity subset), and unsolicited adverse 
events (those reported by the participants with- 
out prompts from the electronic diary) through 
1 month after the second dose and unsolicited 
serious adverse events through 6 months after 
the second dose. Adverse event data through ap- 
proximately 14 weeks after the second dose are 
included in this report. In this report, safety 




data are reported for all participants who pro- 
vided informed consent and received at least one 
dose of vaccine or placebo. Per protocol, safety re- 
sults for participants infected with HIV (196 pa- 
tients) will be analyzed separately and are not 
included here. 
During the phase 2/3 portion of the study, a 
stopping rule for the theoretical concern of vac- 
cine-enhanced disease was to be triggered if the 
one-sided probability of observing the same or a 
more unfavorable adverse severe case split (a split 
with a greater proportion of severe cases in vac- 
cine recipients) was 5% or less, given the same 
true incidence for vaccine and placebo recipients. 
Alert criteria were to be triggered if this probabil- 
ity was less than 11%. 
Efficacy 
The first primary end point was the efficacy of 
BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 with onset 
at least 7 days after the second dose in participants 
who had been without serologic or virologic evi- 
dence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after 
the second dose; the second primary end point 
was efficacy in participants with and partici- 
pants without evidence of prior infection. Con- 
firmed Covid-19 was defined according to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as 
the presence of at least one of the following 
symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or 
increased shortness of breath, chills, new or in- 
creased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with 
a respiratory specimen obtained during the symp- 
tomatic period or within 4 days before or after it 
that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid 
amplification–based testing, either at the central 
laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a 
protocol-defined acceptable test). 
Major secondary end points included the ef- 
ficacy of BNT162b2 against severe Covid-19. Se- 
vere Covid-19 is defined by the FDA as confirmed 
Covid-19 with one of the following additional 
features: clinical signs at rest that are indicative 
of severe systemic illness; respiratory failure; evi- 
dence of shock; significant acute renal, hepatic, 
or neurologic dysfunction; admission to an in- 
tensive care unit; or death. Details are provided 
in the protocol. 
An explanation of the various denominator 
values for use in assessing the results of the 
trial is provided in Table S1 in the Supplemen- 
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. In brief, 
the safety population includes persons 16 years 
of age or older; a total of 43,448 participants 
constituted the population of enrolled persons 
injected with the vaccine or placebo. The main 
safety subset as defined by the FDA, with a me- 
dian of 2 months of follow-up as of October 9, 
2020, consisted of 37,706 persons, and the reac- 
togenicity subset consisted of 8183 persons. The 
modified intention-to-treat (mITT) efficacy pop- 
ulation includes all age groups 12 years of age 
or older (43,355 persons; 100 participants who 
were 12 to 15 years of age contributed to person- 
time years but included no cases). The number 
of persons who could be evaluated for efficacy 7 
days after the second dose and who had no evi- 
dence of prior infection was 36,523, and the 
number of persons who could be evaluated 7 
days after the second dose with or without evi- 
dence of prior infection was 40,137. 
Statistical Analysis 
The safety analyses included all participants 
who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or 
placebo. The findings are descriptive in nature 
and not based on formal statistical hypothesis 
testing. Safety analyses are presented as counts, 
percentages, and associated Clopper–Pearson 
95% confidence intervals for local reactions, 
systemic events, and any adverse events after 
vaccination, according to terms in the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), ver- 
sion 23.1, for each vaccine group. 
Analysis of the first primary efficacy end 
point included participants who received the vac- 
cine or placebo as randomly assigned, had no 
evidence of infection within 7 days after the 
second dose, and had no major protocol devia- 
tions (the population that could be evaluated). 
Vaccine efficacy was estimated by 100 × (1 − IRR), 
where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed 
cases of Covid-19 illness per 1000 person-years 
of follow-up in the active vaccine group to the 
corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. 
The 95.0% credible interval for vaccine efficacy 
and the probability of vaccine efficacy greater 
than 30% were calculated with the use of a 
Bayesian beta-binomial model. The final analy- 
sis uses a success boundary of 98.6% for prob- 
ability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30% to 
compensate for the interim analysis and to 
control the overall type 1 error rate at 2.5%.

Participants 
Between July 27, 2020, and November 14, 2020, 
a total of 44,820 persons were screened, and 
43,548 persons 16 years of age or older under- 
went randomization at 152 sites worldwide 
(United States, 130 sites; Argentina, 1; Brazil, 2; 
South Africa, 4; Germany, 6; and Turkey, 9) in

The diagram represents all enrolled participants 
through November 14, 2020. The safety subset (those 
with a median of 2 months of follow-up, in accordance 
with application requirements for Emergency Use Au- 
thorization) is based on an October 9, 2020, data cut- 
off date. The further procedures that one participant in 
the placebo group declined after dose 2 (lower right 
corner of the diagram) were those involving collection 
of blood and nasal swab samples. 













































43,448 participants received injections: 21,720 
received BNT162b2 and 21,728 received placebo 
(Fig. 1). At the data cut-off date of October 9, a 
total of 37,706 participants had a median of at 
least 2 months of safety data available after the 
second dose and contributed to the main safety 
data set. Among these 37,706 participants, 49% 
were female, 83% were White, 9% were Black or 
African American, 28% were Hispanic or Latinx, 
35% were obese (body mass index [the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters] of at least 30.0), and 21% had at least 
one coexisting condition. The median age was 
52 years, and 42% of participants were older 
than 55 years of age (Table 1 and Table S2).

Figure 2. Local and Systemic Reactions Reported 
within 7 Days after Injection of BNT162b2 or Placebo, 
According to Age Group. 
Data on local and systemic reactions and use of medi- 
cation were collected with electronic diaries from par- 
ticipants in the reactogenicity subset (8,183 partici- 
pants) for 7 days after each vaccination. Solicited 
injection-site (local) reactions are shown in Panel A. 
Pain at the injection site was assessed according to 
the following scale: mild, does not interfere with activ- 
ity; moderate, interferes with activity; severe, prevents 
daily activity; and grade 4, emergency department visit 
or hospitalization. Redness and swelling were mea- 
sured according to the following scale: mild, 2.0 to 
5.0 cm in diameter; moderate, >5.0 to 10.0 cm in di- 
ameter; severe, >10.0 cm in diameter; and grade 4, 
necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis (for redness) and ne- 
crosis (for swelling). Systemic events and medication 
use are shown in Panel B. Fever categories are desig- 
nated in the key; medication use was not graded. Ad- 
ditional scales were as follows: fatigue, headache, 
chills, new or worsened muscle pain, new or worsened 
joint pain (mild: does not interfere with activity; mod- 
erate: some interference with activity; or severe: pre- 
vents daily activity), vomiting (mild: 1 to 2 times in 
24 hours; moderate: >2 times in 24 hours; or severe: 
requires intravenous hydration), and diarrhea (mild: 
2 to 3 loose stools in 24 hours; moderate: 4 to 5 loose 
stools in 24 hours; or severe: 6 or more loose stools in 
24 hours); grade 4 for all events indicated an emer- 
gency department visit or hospitalization. I bars repre- 
sent 95% confidence intervals, and numbers above 
the I bars are the percentage of participants who re- 
ported the specified reaction.

the injection site within 7 days after an injection 
was the most commonly reported local reaction, 
with less than 1% of participants across all age 
groups reporting severe pain (Fig. 2). Pain was 
reported less frequently among participants old- 
er than 55 years of age (71% reported pain after 
the first dose; 66% after the second dose) than 
among younger participants (83% after the first 
dose; 78% after the second dose). A noticeably 
lower percentage of participants reported injec- 
tion-site redness or swelling. The proportion of 
participants reporting local reactions did not 
increase after the second dose (Fig. 2A), and no 
participant reported a grade 4 local reaction. In 
general, local reactions were mostly mild-to-mod- 
erate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. 
Systemic Reactogenicity 
Systemic events were reported more often by 
younger vaccine recipients (16 to 55 years of age) 
than by older vaccine recipients (more than 55 
years of age) in the reactogenicity subset and 
more often after dose 2 than dose 1 (Fig. 2B). 
The most commonly reported systemic events 
were fatigue and headache (59% and 52%, re- 
spectively, after the second dose, among younger 
vaccine recipients; 51% and 39% among older 
recipients), although fatigue and headache were 
also reported by many placebo recipients (23% and 
24%, respectively, after the second dose, among 
younger vaccine recipients; 17% and 14% among 
older recipients). The frequency of any severe 
systemic event after the first dose was 0.9% or 
less. Severe systemic events were reported in less 
than 2% of vaccine recipients after either dose, 
except for fatigue (in 3.8%) and headache (in 2.0%) 
after the second dose. 
Fever (temperature, ≥38°C) was reported after 
the second dose by 16% of younger vaccine re- 
cipients and by 11% of older recipients. Only 0.2% 
of vaccine recipients and 0.1% of placebo recipi- 
ents reported fever (temperature, 38.9 to 40°C) af- 
ter the first dose, as compared with 0.8% and 
0.1%, respectively, after the second dose. Two 
participants each in the vaccine and placebo 
groups reported temperatures above 40.0°C. 
Younger vaccine recipients were more likely to 
use antipyretic or pain medication (28% after 
dose 1; 45% after dose 2) than older vaccine re- 
cipients (20% after dose 1; 38% after dose 2), 
and placebo recipients were less likely (10 to 14%) 
than vaccine recipients to use the medications, 
regardless of age or dose. Systemic events in- 
cluding fever and chills were observed within the 
first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved 
shortly thereafter. 
Daily use of the electronic diary ranged from 
90 to 93% for each day after the first dose and 
from 75 to 83% for each day after the second 
dose. No difference was noted between the 
BNT162b2 group and the placebo group. 
Adverse Events 
Adverse event analyses are provided for all en- 
rolled 43,252 participants, with variable follow- 
up time after dose 1 (Table S3). More BNT162b2 
recipients than placebo recipients reported any 
adverse event (27% and 12%, respectively) or a 
related adverse event (21% and 5%). This distri- 
bution largely reflects the inclusion of transient 
reactogenicity events, which were reported as 
adverse events more commonly by vaccine recipi- 
ents than by placebo recipients. Sixty-four vac- 
cine recipients (0.3%) and 6 placebo recipients 
(<0.1%) reported lymphadenopathy. Few partici- 
pants in either group had severe adverse events, 
serious adverse events, or adverse events leading 
to withdrawal from the trial. Four related serious 
adverse events were reported among BNT162b2 
recipients (shoulder injury related to vaccine ad- 
ministration, right axillary lymphadenopathy, 
paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmia, and right leg 
paresthesia). Two BNT162b2 recipients died (one 
from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest), 
as did four placebo recipients (two from unknown 
causes, one from hemorrhagic stroke, and one 
from myocardial infarction). No deaths were con- 
sidered by the investigators to be related to the 
vaccine or placebo. No Covid-19–associated deaths 
were observed. No stopping rules were met dur- 
ing the reporting period. Safety monitoring will 
continue for 2 years after administration of the 
second dose of vaccine. 
Efficacy 
Among 36,523 participants who had no evidence 
of existing or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 cases 
of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the 
second dose were observed among vaccine re- 
cipients and 162 among placebo recipients. This 
case split corresponds to 95.0% vaccine efficacy 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3 to 97.6; Ta-

ble 2). Among participants with and those with- 
out evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, 9 cases 
of Covid-19 at least 7 days after the second dose 
were observed among vaccine recipients and 169 
among placebo recipients, corresponding to 94.6% 
vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 89.9 to 97.3). Supple- 
mental analyses indicated that vaccine efficacy 
among subgroups defined by age, sex, race, eth- 
nicity, obesity, and presence of a coexisting condi- 
tion was generally consistent with that observed 
in the overall population (Table 3 and Table S4). 
Vaccine efficacy among participants with hyper- 
tension was analyzed separately but was consis- 
tent with the other subgroup analyses (vaccine 
efficacy, 94.6%; 95% CI, 68.7 to 99.9; case split: 
BNT162b2, 2 cases; placebo, 44 cases). Figure 3 
shows cases of Covid-19 or severe Covid-19 with 
onset at any time after the first dose (mITT popu- 
lation) (additional data on severe Covid-19 are 
available in Table S5). Between the first dose and 
the second dose, 39 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed, 
resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% CI, 
29.5 to 68.4) during this interval and indicating 
early protection by the vaccine, starting as soon 
as 12 days after the first dose. 
A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 (30 μg per 
dose, given 21 days apart) was found to be safe 
and 95% effective against Covid-19. The vaccine 
met both primary efficacy end points, with more 
than a 99.99% probability of a true vaccine ef- 
ficacy greater than 30%. These results met our 
prespecified success criteria, which were to es- 
tablish a probability above 98.6% of true vaccine 
efficacy being greater than 30%, and greatly 
exceeded the minimum FDA criteria for authori- 
zation.9 Although the study was not powered to 
definitively assess efficacy by subgroup, the 
point estimates of efficacy for subgroups based 
on age, sex, race, ethnicity, body-mass index, or 
the presence of an underlying condition associ- 
ated with a high risk of Covid-19 complications 
are also high. For all analyzed subgroups in 
which more than 10 cases of Covid-19 occurred, 
the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval 
for efficacy was more than 30%. 
The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases 
over time among placebo and vaccine recipients 
begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose,

‡ Race or ethnic group was reported by the participants. “All others” included the following categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, 

tion period of 5 days,10 indicating the early onset 
of a partially protective effect of immunization. 
The study was not designed to assess the efficacy 
of a single-dose regimen. Nevertheless, in the 
interval between the first and second doses, the 
observed vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 
52%, and in the first 7 days after dose 2, it was 
91%, reaching full efficacy against disease with 
onset at least 7 days after dose 2. Of the 10 cases 
of severe Covid-19 that were observed after the 
first dose, only 1 occurred in the vaccine group. 
This finding is consistent with overall high ef- 
ficacy against all Covid-19 cases. The severe case 
split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine- 
mediated protection against severe disease, al- 
leviating many of the theoretical concerns over 
vaccine-mediated disease enhancement.11 
The favorable safety profile observed during 
phase 1 testing of BNT162b24,8 was confirmed in 
the phase 2/3 portion of the trial. As in phase 1, 
reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate, 
and reactions were less common and milder in 
older adults than in younger adults. Systemic 
reactogenicity was more common and severe 
after the second dose than after the first dose, 
although local reactogenicity was similar after 
the two doses. Severe fatigue was observed in 
approximately 4% of BNT162b2 recipients, 
which is higher than that observed in recipients 
of some vaccines recommended for older adults.12 
This rate of severe fatigue is also lower than that 
observed in recipients of another approved viral 
vaccine for older adults.13 Overall, reactogenicity 
events were transient and resolved within a couple 





























































of days after onset. Lymphadenopathy, which 
generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to 
have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited im- 
mune response. The incidence of serious adverse 
events was similar in the vaccine and placebo 
groups (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively). 
This trial and its preliminary report have 
several limitations. With approximately 19,000 
participants per group in the subset of partici- 
pants with a median follow-up time of 2 months 
after the second dose, the study has more than 
83% probability of detecting at least one adverse 
event, if the true incidence is 0.01%, but it is not 
large enough to detect less common adverse events 
reliably. This report includes 2 months of follow- 
up after the second dose of vaccine for half the 
trial participants and up to 14 weeks’ maximum 
follow-up for a smaller subset. Therefore, both

the occurrence of adverse events more than 2 to 
3.5 months after the second dose and more 
comprehensive information on the duration of 
protection remain to be determined. Although 
the study was designed to follow participants for 
safety and efficacy for 2 years after the second 
dose, given the high vaccine efficacy, ethical and 
practical barriers prevent following placebo re- 
cipients for 2 years without offering active im- 
munization, once the vaccine is approved by 
regulators and recommended by public health 
authorities. Assessment of long-term safety and 
efficacy for this vaccine will occur, but it cannot 
be in the context of maintaining a placebo group 
for the planned follow-up period of 2 years after 
the second dose. These data do not address 
whether vaccination prevents asymptomatic in- 
fection; a serologic end point that can detect a 
history of infection regardless of whether symp- 
toms were present (SARS-CoV-2 N-binding anti- 
body) will be reported later. Furthermore, given 
the high vaccine efficacy and the low number of 
vaccine breakthrough cases, potential establish- 
ment of a correlate of protection has not been 
feasible at the time of this report. 
This report does not address the prevention 
of Covid-19 in other populations, such as young- 
er adolescents, children, and pregnant women. 
Safety and immune response data from this trial 
after immunization of adolescents 12 to 15 years 
of age will be reported subsequently, and addi- 
tional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 
in pregnant women, children younger than 12 
years, and those in special risk groups, such as 
immunocompromised persons. Although the 
vaccine can be stored for up to 5 days at stan- 
dard refrigerator temperatures once ready for use, 
very cold temperatures are required for shipping 
and longer storage. The current cold storage re- 
quirement may be alleviated by ongoing stability 
studies and formulation optimization, which 
may also be described in subsequent reports. 
The data presented in this report have sig- 
nificance beyond the performance of this vac- 
cine candidate. The results demonstrate that 
Covid-19 can be prevented by immunization, 
provide proof of concept that RNA-based vac- 
cines are a promising new approach for protect- 
ing humans against infectious diseases, and 
demonstrate the speed with which an RNA- 
based vaccine can be developed with a sufficient 
investment of resources. The development of 
BNT162b2 was initiated on January 10, 2020, 
when the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was re- 
leased by the Chinese Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention and disseminated globally by the 
GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influ- 
enza Data) initiative. This rigorous demonstration 
of safety and efficacy less than 11 months later 
provides a practical demonstration that RNA-based 
vaccines, which require only viral genetic sequence 
information to initiate development, are a major 
new tool to combat pandemics and other infec- 
tious disease outbreaks. The continuous phase 
1/2/3 trial design may provide a model to reduce 
the protracted development timelines that have 
delayed the availability of vaccines against other 
infectious diseases of medical importance. In 
the context of the current, still expanding pan- 
demic, the BNT162b2 vaccine, if approved, can 
contribute, together with other public health mea- 
sures, to reducing the devastating loss of health, 
life, and economic and social well-being that has 
resulted from the global spread of Covid-19.
