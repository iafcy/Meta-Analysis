BACKGROUND
NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 
spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.
METHODS
We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2 trial to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-μg and 25-μg doses, with 
or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assign-
ments) in 131 healthy adults. In phase 1, vaccination comprised two intramuscular 
injections, 21 days apart. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity; laboratory 
values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administra-
tion toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti–spike protein response (in en-
zyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units). Secondary outcomes included 
unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay), 
and T-cell responses (cytokine staining). IgG and microneutralization assay results 
were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples 
from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic. We performed a pri-
mary analysis at day 35.
RESULTS
After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with 
adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive 
placebo. No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild 
in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration 
(mean, ≤2 days). One participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day. Unsolicited 
adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events. 
The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose–
sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-μg adjuvanted 
regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutral-
ization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent 
serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
At 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that 
exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum. The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced 
CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype. (Funded by the Coali-

oronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 
has spread globally at a rapid pace since 
the novel coronavirus was first reported 
in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was 
declared a pandemic by the World Health Orga-
nization on March 11, 2020.1,2 As of August 1, 
2020, more than 17 million cases and over 
675,000 deaths due to Covid-19 have been re-
ported worldwide,3 caused by infection with the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2).4,5 NVX-CoV2373 contains Matrix-
M1 adjuvant6 and a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 
(rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine, constructed 
from the full-length (i.e., including the trans-
membrane domain), wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike 
glycoprotein, which mediates attachment of the 
virus to the human angiotensin-converting en-
zyme 2 (hACE2) receptor of host cells for cellular 
entry and serves as a key target for development 
of antibodies and vaccines.7,8 In rodent and non-
human primate challenge models, NVX-CoV2373 
induced high titers of antibodies measured against 
anti-spike protein that blocked hACE2 receptor 
binding and achieved neutralization of wild-type 
virus that exceeded the magnitude of responses 
measured in human convalescent serum and 
that provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 
challenge.9,10 In addition, polyfunctional CD4+ 
and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced with a 
T helper 1 (Th1) dominant phenotype.9
We report here the findings of the phase 1 
part of a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 
1–2 trial that commenced in May 2020 to evalu-
ate the safety and immunogenicity of 5-μg and 
25-μg doses of rSARS-CoV-2 with or without 
Matrix-M1 adjuvant (50-μg dose) in healthy adults 
younger than 60 years of age.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
Our phase 1 trial was conducted at two sites in 
Australia (Nucleus Network, Herston, Queensland, 
and Melbourne, Victoria). Eligible participants 
were healthy men and nonpregnant women, 18 to 
59 years of age, with a body-mass index (the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the 
height in meters) of 17 to 35. Healthy status, as-
sessed during the screening period, was based on 
medical history and clinical laboratory findings, 
vital signs, and physical examination. Participants 
with a history of SARS or Covid-19 or who tested 
positive at screening (by real-time polymerase-
chain-reaction [RT-PCR] assay or enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) along with par-
ticipants exposed to persons with confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 or working in an occupation at high 
risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. 
(Details of the trial design, conduct, oversight, 
and analyses are provided in the protocol and 
statistical analysis plan, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org.) All participants 
provided written informed consent before en-
rollment in the trial.
As a safety measure, 6 participants were ini-
tially randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 5-μg 
and 25-μg rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 groups 
(groups C and D), vaccinated in an open-label 
manner, and observed for reactogenicity for 48 
hours. Thereafter, the remaining 125 participants 
were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio and 
in a blinded manner to one of five vaccine groups 
according to pregenerated randomization sched-
ules, without stratification (Fig. 1).
The trial was designed by Novavax, with fund-
ing support from the Coalition for Epidemic Pre-
paredness Innovations. The trial protocol was 
approved by the Alfred Hospital Human Research 
Ethics Committee (Melbourne) and was performed 
in accordance with the International Council for 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 
Safety oversight for specific vaccination pause rules 
and for advancement to phase 2 was performed 
by an independent safety monitoring committee. 
The manuscript was written by the authors, with 
the first author as the overall lead author. No one 
who is not an author contributed to writing the 
manuscript. All authors had full access to the 
data on a vaccine-group level only. The authors 
assume responsibility for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol.
Trial Vaccine, Adjuvant, and Placebo
rSARS-CoV-2, developed by Novavax and manu-
factured at Emergent Biosolutions, is a recombi-
nant nanoparticle vaccine constructed from the 
full-length (i.e., including the transmembrane do-
main), wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 
(GenBank accession number, MN908947; nucle-
otides 21563–25384) optimized in the established 
baculovirus Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell-
expression system.9 rSARS-CoV-2 is generated with 
682-QQAQ-685 mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage

sites to confer protease resistance and two pro-
line substitutions at residues K986P and V987P 
at the top of the heptad repeat 1/central helix in 
the S2 subunit to stabilize the construct in a pre-
fusion conformation. rSARS-CoV-2 is resistant to 
proteolytic cleavage, binds with high affinity to 
the hACE2 receptor, and demonstrates thermo-
stability.9,11 Matrix-M1, a saponin-based adjuvant,12 
was manufactured by Novavax. Both vaccine and 
adjuvant were stored at 2°C to 8°C. Placebo was 
sterile 0.9% normal saline.
rSARS-CoV-2 and Matrix-M1 were mixed just 
before use. Each participant received two intra-
muscular injections of trial vaccine or placebo 
(injection volume, 0.6 ml) in the deltoid muscle, 
one injection on day 0 and one on day 21. Partici-
pants and trial site personnel managing the con-
duct of the trial remained unaware of vaccine 
assignment, with the exception of sentinel dosing 
(described below). Vaccination pause rules were 
in place to monitor participants’ safety (see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
Safety Assessments
Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated at 
specified time points throughout the trial (Fig. 1). 
The primary safety outcomes were the number 
and percentage of participants with solicited lo-
cal and systemic reactogenicity according to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicity 
grading scale (Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix)13 and their duration and peak inten-
sity for 7 days after vaccination (days 0 to 7 and 
days 21 to 28) and laboratory values (serum 
chemistry and hematology) according to FDA 
toxicity scoring (Table S5)13,14 at 7 days after vac-
cination (days 7 and 28). Reported secondary 
safety outcomes were laboratory values at day 21, 
unsolicited adverse events during the first 35 days 
according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) classification, severity score 
(mild, moderate, or severe), and relatedness to the 
vaccine; vital sign measurements assessed accord-
ing to FDA toxicity scoring (Table S6)13 after vac-
cination; and adverse events of special interest, 
which included SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-19 
disease manifestations (Table S3),14,15 and poten-
tial immune-mediated medical conditions (Table 
S4). In addition, participants underwent naso-
pharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 on day 
35 or any time they reported symptoms sugges-
tive of possible infection.
Participants were observed for at least 30 min-
utes after each vaccination for assessment of re-
actogenicity and were instructed to continue 
monitoring these events at home daily, for 7 days 
after each vaccination, using a diary. Predefined 
local (injection site) reactogenicity included pain,

tenderness, erythema, and swelling; systemic 
reactogenicity included fever, nausea or vomit-
ing, headache, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, and 
arthralgia.
Immunogenicity Assessments
The primary immunogenicity outcome was the 
anti-spike IgG ELISA unit responses to rSARS-
CoV-2 protein antigens, measured on days 0, 7, 
21, 28, and 35. Reported secondary immunoge-
nicity assessments were the wild-type virus mi-
croneutralization assay (MN) with an inhibitory 
concentration of >99% (MN IC>99%) on days 0, 
21, and 35 and intracellular cytokine staining of 
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at days 0 and 28 
in a randomly selected subgroup of 16 partici-
pants, 4 participants each from groups A, B, C, 
and D. Details of these assays are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Immunogenicity (IgG and MN) results were 
compared with a control panel of 32 (IgG) and 
29 (MN) convalescent serum specimens collect-
ed from patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19, 
obtained from Baylor College of Medicine, which 
were classified according to clinical severity at 
the same institution. Covid-19 clinical severity 
was classified as asymptomatic, exposed (sam-
ple collected from contact exposure assessment), 
symptomatic outpatient (sample collected from 
outpatients discharged from the emergency de-
partment; see Table S1 for a list of symptoms), 
and hospitalized (sample collected from hospi-
talized patients, including those receiving sup-
portive measures in the intensive care unit). 
Disease classification was conducted indepen-
dent of and before the study assays and analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size for the trial was based on clini-
cal and practical considerations, not on a formal 
statistical power calculation. Most end points 
were summarized with geometric means and 
95% confidence intervals that were based on the 
t distribution of the log-transformed values. No 
adjustments for multiplicity were made in these 
analyses, including the calculation of confidence 
intervals.
The primary safety and immunogenicity anal-
yses were conducted after all participants had 
been followed through day 35. Safety data on the 
sentinel participants (who received open-label 
vaccination) were analyzed separately from other 
participants because of potential investigator bias; 
immunogenicity data were combined for all par-
ticipants. Sponsor personnel who were involved in 
the analysis of data were not provided with indi-
vidual data; they received only vaccine-group as-
signment data.
Results
Trial Population
The trial was initiated on May 26, 2020; 134 
participants underwent randomization between 
May 27 and June 6, 2020, including 3 participants 
who were to serve as backups for sentinel dosing 
and who immediately withdrew from the trial 
without being vaccinated (Fig. S1). Of the 131 
participants who received injections, 23 received 
placebo (group A), 25 received 25-μg doses of 
rSARS-CoV-2 (group B), 29 received 5-μg doses 
of rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1, including three 
sentinels (group C), 28 received 25-μg doses of 
rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1, including three sen-
tinels (group D), and 26 received a single 25-μg 
dose of rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 followed by 
a single dose of placebo (group E). All 131 par-
ticipants received their first vaccination on day 
0, and all but 3 received their second vaccination 
at least 21 days later; exceptions include 2 in the 
placebo group (group A) who withdrew consent 
(unrelated to any adverse event) and 1 in the 25-μg 
rSARS-CoV-2 + Matrix-M1 group (group D) who 
had an unsolicited adverse event (mild cellulitis; 
see below). Demographic characteristics of the 
participants are presented in Table 1. Of note, 
missing data were infrequent.
Safety Outcomes
No serious adverse events or adverse events of 
special interest were reported, and vaccination 
pause rules were not implemented. As noted 
above, one participant did not receive a second 
vaccination owing to an unsolicited adverse event, 
mild cellulitis, that was associated with infec-
tion after an intravenous cannula placement to 
address an unrelated mild adverse event that oc-
curred during the second week of follow-up. 
Second vaccination was withheld because the 
participant was still recovering and receiving 
antibiotics. This participant remains in the trial.
Overall reactogenicity was largely absent or 
mild, and second vaccinations were neither with-
held nor delayed due to reactogenicity. After the

the five groups (local: 100%, 100%, 65%, 67%, 
and 100% of participants, respectively; systemic: 
86%, 84%, 73%, 58%, and 96%) who were un-
aware of treatment assignment. One participant, 
in group D, had a severe local event (tenderness), 
and eight participants, one or two participants 
in each group, had severe systemic events; the 
most common severe systemic events were joint 
pain and fatigue. Only one participant, in group D, 
had fever (temperature, 38.1°C) after the second 
vaccination, on day 1 only. No adverse event ex-
tended beyond 7 days after the second vaccina-
tion. Of note, the mean duration of reactogenicity 
events was 2 days or less for both the first vac-
cination and second vaccination periods.
Laboratory abnormalities of grade 2 or higher 
occurred in 13 participants (10%): 9 after the 
first vaccination and 4 after the second vaccina-
tion (Table S8). Abnormal laboratory values were 
not associated with any clinical manifestations 
and showed no worsening with repeat vaccina-
tion. Six participants (5%; five women and one 
man) had grade 2 or higher transient reductions 
in hemoglobin from baseline, with no evidence of 
hemolysis or microcytic anemia and with resolu-
tion within 7 to 21 days. Of the six, two had an

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike IgG and Neutralizing Antibody Responses.
Shown are geometric mean anti-spike IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) unit responses to recombinant severe acute re‑
spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) protein antigens (Panel A) and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay at an 
inhibitory concentration greater than 99% (MN IC>99%) titer responses (Panel B) at baseline (day 0), 3 weeks after the first vaccination 
(day 21), and 2 weeks after the second vaccination (day 35) for the placebo group (group A), the 25-μg unadjuvanted group (group B), 
the 5-μg and 25-μg adjuvanted groups (groups C and D, respectively), and the 25-μg adjuvanted and placebo group (group E). Dia‑
monds and whisker endpoints represent geometric mean titer values and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The Covid-19 human 
convalescent serum panel includes specimens from PCR-confirmed Covid-19 participants, obtained from Baylor College of Medicine (29 
specimens for ELISA and 32 specimens for MN IC>99%), with geometric mean titer values according to Covid-19 severity. The severity of 
Covid-19 is indicated by the colors of the dots for hospitalized patients (including those in intensive care), symptomatic outpatients 
(with samples collected in the emergency department), and asymptomatic patients who had been exposed to Covid-19 (with samples 
collected during contact and exposure assessment). Mean values (in black) for human convalescent serum are depicted next to (and of 
same color as) the category of Covid-19 patients, with the overall mean shown above the scatter plot (in black). For each trial vaccine 
group, the mean at day 35 is depicted above the scatterplot.

Trial of SARS-CoV-2 Recombinant Nanoparticle Vaccine
absolute hemoglobin value (grade 2) that re-
solved or stabilized during the testing period. 
Four participants (3%), including one who had 
received placebo, had elevated liver enzymes that 
were noted after the first vaccination and re-
solved within 7 to 14 days (i.e., before the sec-
ond vaccination). Vital signs remained stable 
immediately after vaccination and at all visits.
Unsolicited adverse events (Table S9) were 
predominantly mild in severity (in 71%, 91%, 
83%, 90%, and 82% of participants in groups A, 
B, C, D, and E, respectively) and were similarly 
distributed across the groups receiving adju-
vanted and unadjuvanted vaccine. There were no 
reports of severe adverse events.
Immunogenicity Outcomes
ELISA anti-spike IgG geometric mean ELISA 
units (GMEUs) ranged from 105 to 116 at day 0. 
By day 21, responses had occurred for all adju-
vanted regimens (1984, 2626, and 3317 GMEUs 
for groups C, D, and E, respectively), and geo-
metric mean fold rises (GMFRs) exceeded those 
induced without adjuvant by a factor of at least 
10 (Fig. 3 and Table S10). Within 7 days after the 
second vaccination with adjuvant (day 28; groups 
C and D), GMEUs had further increased by a 
factor of 8 (to 15,319 and 20,429, respectively) 
over responses seen with the first vaccination, 
and within 14 days (day 35), responses had more 
than doubled yet again (to 63,160 and 47,521, 
respectively), achieving GMFRs that were ap-
proximately 100 times greater than those ob-
served with rSARS-CoV-2 alone. A single vaccina-
tion with adjuvant achieved GMEU levels similar

Shown are scatter plots of 100% wild-type neutralizing 
antibody responses and anti-spike IgG ELISA unit re‑
sponses at 3 weeks after the first vaccination (day 21) 
and 2 weeks after the second vaccination (day 35) for

Panel A), the combined two-dose 5-μg and 25-μg adju‑
vanted vaccine (groups C and D, respectively; Panel 
B), and convalescent serum from patients with Cov‑
id-19 (Panel C). In Panel C, the severity of Covid-19 is 
indicated by the colors of the dots for hospitalized pa‑
tients (including those in intensive care), symptomatic 
outpatients (with samples collected in the emergency 
department), and asymptomatic patients who had 
been exposed to Covid-19 (with samples collected 
during contact and exposure assessment).

to those in asymptomatic (exposed) patients 
with Covid-19 (1661), and a second vaccination 
with adjuvant achieved GMEU levels that ex-
ceeded those in convalescent serum from symp-
tomatic outpatients with Covid-19 (7420) by a 
factor of at least 6 and rose to levels similar to 
those in convalescent serum from patients hos-
pitalized with Covid-19 (53,391). The responses 
in the two-dose 5-μg and 25-μg adjuvanted vac-
cine regimens were similar, a finding that high-
lights the role of adjuvant dose sparing.
Neutralizing antibodies were undetectable 
before vaccination and had patterns of response 
similar to those of anti-spike antibodies after 
vaccination with adjuvant (Fig. 3 and Table S11). 
After the first vaccination (day 21), GMFRs were 
approximately 5 times greater with adjuvant 
(5.2, 6.3, and 5.9 for groups C, D, and E, respec-
tively) than without adjuvant (1.1). By day 35, 
second vaccinations with adjuvant induced an 
increase more than 100 times greater (195 and 
165 for groups C and D, respectively) than single 
vaccinations without adjuvant. When compared 
with convalescent serum, second vaccinations 
with adjuvant resulted in GMT levels approxi-
mately 4 times greater (3906 and 3305 for groups 
C and D, respectively) than those in symptomatic 
outpatients with Covid-19 (837) and approached 
the magnitude of levels observed in hospitalized 
patients with COVID-19 (7457).
At day 35, ELISA anti-spike IgG GMEUs and 
neutralizing antibodies induced by the two-dose 
5-μg and 25-μg adjuvanted vaccine regimens were 
4 to 6 times greater than the geometric mean 
convalescent serum measures (8344 and 983, re-
spectively).
A strong correlation was observed between 
neutralizing antibody titers and anti-spike IgG 
GMEUs with adjuvanted vaccine at day 35 (cor-
relation, 0.95) (Fig.  4), a finding that was not 
observed with unadjuvanted vaccine (correlation, 
0.76) but was similar to that of convalescent se-
rum (correlation, 0.96). Two-dose regimens of 
5-μg and 25-μg rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 
produced similar magnitudes of response, and 
every participant had seroconversion according 
to either assay measurement. Reverse cumula-
tive-distribution curves for day 35 are presented 
in Figure S2.
T-cell responses in 16 participants who were 
randomly selected from groups A through D,  
4 participants per group, showed that adjuvant-
ed regimens induced antigen-specific polyfunc-
tional CD4+ T-cell responses that were reflected 
in IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α production on spike 
protein stimulation. A strong bias toward this Th1 
phenotype was noted; Th2 responses (as measured 
by IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines) were minimal (Fig. 5).
Discussion
The primary safety and immunogenicity analyses 
indicate that in healthy adult participants 18 to 
59 years of age, two-dose regimens of 5 μg and 
25 μg of rSARS-CoV-2 plus the Matrix-M1 adju-
vant had acceptable safety findings and induced 
high immune responses, with levels of neutral-
izing antibodies that closely correlated with an-
ti-spike IgG. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody 
responses after the second vaccination with 
rSARS-CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 exceeded values 
seen in symptomatic Covid-19 outpatients and 
were of the magnitude seen in convalescent se-
rum from hospitalized patients with Covid-19. 
The benefit of the Matrix-M1 adjuvant was clear 
in the magnitude of the antibody and the T-cell 
response, the induction of functional antibodies, 
and antigen dose sparing. The value of the sec-
ond dose on day 21 for the two-dose rSARS-
CoV-2 plus Matrix-M1 regimen is clearly demon-
strated and warrants the use of this vaccination 
schedule.
Although the effector mechanisms that might 
lead to protection with a Covid-19 vaccine are yet 
not known, it is presumed that neutralizing an-
tibodies will be associated with protection; this 
has led to the use of microneutralization testing 
in all recent human Covid-19 vaccine trials.16 In 
Covid-19 nonhuman primate challenge models, 
wild-type neutralizing antibodies are correlated 
with protection.17 It is notable that studies of 
respiratory syncytial virus, which is similar to 
Covid-19 as it infects cells through a type 1 fu-
sion protein mechanism, have clearly shown re-
duction in disease through the presence of both 
naturally induced neutralizing antibodies18 and 
prophylactically injected monoclonal antibodies; 
the key features of these antibodies are their abil-

ity to neutralize virus, and they have been shown 
to be highly protective in multiple studies using 
multiple constructs.19-21 In lieu of Covid-19-spe-
cific data that clearly correlate immunogenicity 
to efficacy, vaccine developers have compared 
vaccine responses with human convalescent se-
rum from Covid-19 patients. Here, we show that 
NVX-CoV2373 induced immune responses that 
compared well with anti-spike IgG and micro-
neutralization in a Covid-19 population with clini-
cally significant illness. We also found that when 
the human convalescent serum was stratified 
according to illness severity, anti-spike IgG and 
microneutralization titers closely resembled find-
ings in other Covid-19 studies in which illness 
severity and the magnitude of microneutraliza-
tion responses are proportional,22 a finding that 
suggests that the selection of comparative popu-
lations has to be interpreted in light of the clini-
cal severity of disease. Although the comparative 
immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 and convales-
cent serum from clinically ill Covid-19 patients 
must be interpreted with caution, the level of 
vaccine-induced immunogenicity appears prom-
ising and in line with protective responses seen 
in a similar respiratory disease.18 The theoretical 
concern for vaccine-induced enhanced disease is 
in part addressed in this trial by the use of an 
adjuvant, which stimulates both high neutraliz-
ing antibody responses and T cells with a pre-

Novavax has accumulated safety data on more 
than 14,000 participants in various nanoparticle 
vaccine trials, including children, pregnant wom-
en, and older adults25-28 and more than 4300 par-
ticipants exposed to Matrix-M1 adjuvant, from 
5 months to 85 years of age. The current study 
demonstrates a safety and immunogenicity pro-
file that is acceptable and comparable to past 
studies with the platform technologies. Most 
relevant to Covid-19, seasonal influenza hemag-
glutinin nanoparticle plus Matrix-M1 has dem-
onstrated induction functional immunity and 
T-cell responses in older adults, including those 
with a modest level of coexisting conditions, a 
population most at risk for severe Covid-19 dis-
ease.28-30
Limitations of this trial include the small size 
of the trial, the limited ethnic diversity (particu-
larly the low number of Black and Latinx par-
ticipants), the younger age of participants, the 
short period of follow-up, and the participants’ 
good health status. The populations at greatest 
risk for serious Covid-19 include people with co-
existing conditions and older adults, groups that 
will be included in our phase 2 program. Data 
collected during follow-up beyond 35 days in the 
current cohort will be analyzed after the partici-
pants have been monitored for 105 days.
Taken together, our findings indicate that the 
adjuvanted, recombinant, full-length spike protein 
nanoparticle vaccine NVX-CoV2373 is a promis-
ing candidate that warrants testing in efficacy 
studies. Phase 2 has commenced on the basis of 
the safety results of the day 35 primary analysis, 
and phase 3 is in preparatory stages.
