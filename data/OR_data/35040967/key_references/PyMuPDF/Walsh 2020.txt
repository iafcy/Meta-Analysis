BACKGROUND
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the 
resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of 
persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no 
vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the 
vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from 
trials in Germany and the United States.
METHODS
In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial 
conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years 
of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two 
lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: 
BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding 
domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-
length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was 
safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was 
a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, 
age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg). 
In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval be-
tween doses; in one group (100 μg of BNT162b1), participants received one dose.
RESULTS
A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 
15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 
was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than 
BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two 
vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geo-
metric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer 
of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.
CONCLUSIONS
The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine 
candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and im-
munogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany 
and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a 
pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
ince the first cases of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (Covid-19) in Wuhan, China, 
in December 2019, pandemic illness has 
spread to millions of persons worldwide. An in-
creased risk of severe disease and death has been 
noted among the elderly and among persons with 
preexisting medical conditions. No Covid-19 vac-
cines are currently available, and they are urgently 
needed to combat escalating cases and deaths 
worldwide.1
In response, BioNTech and Pfizer launched a 
coordinated program to compare four RNA-based 
Covid-19 pandemic vaccine candidates in um-
brella-type clinical studies conducted in Germany 
(BNT162-01) and the United States (C4591001). 
The program was designed to support the selec-
tion of a single vaccine candidate and dose level 
for a pivotal international safety and efficacy 
trial. On the basis of initial clinical-trial results 
in Germany,2 two lipid nanoparticle–formulated,3 
nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA)4 vaccine 
candidates against severe acute respiratory syn-
drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were evaluated 
in the phase 1 portion of the trial in the United 
States.5 One of these candidates, BNT162b1, 
encodes the SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding do-
main, trimerized by the addition of a T4 fibritin 
foldon domain to increase its immunogenicity 
through multivalent display.6-8 The other candi-
date, BNT162b2, encodes the SARS-CoV-2 full-
length spike, modified by two proline mutations 
to lock it in the prefusion conformation9 and 
more closely mimic the intact virus with which 
the elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies must 
interact.10
Previous articles have described the assess-
ment of BNT162b1, at multiple dose levels, in 
healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age.2,5 These 
studies indicated that dose levels of BNT162b1 
that elicited an acceptable level of reactogenicity 
also efficiently elicited titers that were as high as 
those in a panel of SARS-CoV-2 human convales-
cent serum samples and that were broadly neu-
tralizing across a panel of 17 SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-
viruses representing a diversity of circulating 
strains. BNT162b1 also elicited CD4+ type 1 
helper T (Th1) cell responses and strong 
interferon-γ–producing and interleukin-2–pro-
ducing CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses. This abil-
ity to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated an-
tiviral mechanisms makes BNT162b1 a promising 
vaccine candidate.
Here, we report the full set of safety and im-
munogenicity data from the phase 1 portion of an 
ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, observ-
er-blinded, dose-escalation trial in the United 
States that was used to select the final vaccine 
candidate, as well as the comparison of the safety 
and immunogenicity of both vaccine candidates 
and additional phase 1 data that have been col-
lected since candidate selection. These data in-
clude evaluation of the 10-μg, 20-μg, and 30-μg 
dose levels of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 in adults 
18 to 55 years of age and adults 65 to 85 years 
of age.
Methods
Trial Objectives, Participants, and Oversight
We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of 
three dose levels of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. 
Healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age or 65 to 85 
years of age were eligible for inclusion. Key ex-
clusion criteria were known infection with hu-
man immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, 
or hepatitis B virus; an immunocompromised 
condition; a history of autoimmune disease; a 
previous clinical or microbiologic diagnosis of 
Covid-19; the receipt of medications intended to 
prevent Covid-19; any previous coronavirus vac-
cination; positive test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG 
at the screening visit; and positive nasal-swab 
results on a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplifica-
tion test within 24 hours before the receipt of 
trial vaccine or placebo.
BioNTech was the regulatory sponsor of the 
trial. Pfizer was responsible for the trial design; 
for the collection, analysis, and interpretation 
of the data; and for the writing of the report. 
The corresponding author had full access to all the 
data in the trial and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publi-
cation. All the trial data were available to all the 
authors.
Trial Procedures
Using an interactive Web-based response technol-
ogy system, we randomly assigned trial partici-
pants to groups defined according to the vaccine 
candidate, dose level, and age range. Groups of 
participants 18 to 55 years of age and 65 to 85 
years of age were to receive doses of 10 μg, 20 μg, 
or 30 μg of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2 (or placebo) 
on a two-dose schedule; one group of participants

Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates
18 to 55 years of age was assigned to receive 
100-μg doses of BNT162b1 or placebo. All the 
participants were assigned to receive two 0.5-ml 
injections of active vaccine (BNT162b1 or 
BNT162b2) or placebo into the deltoid, adminis-
tered 21 days apart.
The first five participants in each new dose 
level or age group (with a randomization ratio of 
4:1 for active vaccine:placebo) were observed for 
4 hours after the injection to identify immediate 
adverse events. All the other participants were 
observed for 30 minutes. Blood samples were ob-
tained for safety and immunogenicity assessments.
Safety
The primary end points in phase 1 of this trial 
were solicited local reactions (i.e., specific local 
reactions as prompted by and recorded in an 
electronic diary), systemic events, and use of an-
tipyretic or pain medication within 7 days after 
the receipt of vaccine or placebo, as prompted by 
and recorded in an electronic diary; unsolicited 
adverse events and serious adverse events (i.e., 
those reported by the participants, without elec-
tronic-diary prompts), assessed from the receipt 
of the first dose through 1 month and 6 months, 
respectively, after the receipt of the second dose; 
clinical laboratory abnormalities, assessed 1 day 
and 7 days after the receipt of vaccine or placebo; 
and grading shifts in laboratory assessments 
between baseline and 1 day and 7 days after the 
first dose and between 2 days and 7 days after the 
second dose. Protocol-specified safety stopping 
rules were in effect for all the participants in the 
phase 1 portion of the trial. The full protocol, 
including the statistical analysis plan, is avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. 
An internal review committee and an external 
data and safety monitoring committee reviewed 
all safety data.
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity assessments (SARS-CoV-2 se-
rum neutralization assay and receptor-binding 
domain [RBD]–binding or S1-binding IgG direct 
Luminex immunoassays) were conducted before 
the administration of vaccine or placebo, at 7 days 
and 21 days after the first dose, and at 7 days 
(i.e., day 28) and 14 days (i.e., day 35) after the 
second dose. The neutralization assay, which also 
generated previously described virus-neutralization 
data from trials of the BNT162 candidates,2,5 
used a previously described strain of SARS-CoV-2 
(USA_WA1/2020) that had been generated by re-
verse genetics and engineered by the insertion of 
an mNeonGreen gene into open reading frame 
7 of the viral genome.11,12 The 50% neutralization 
titers and 90% neutralization titers were reported 
as the interpolated reciprocal of the dilutions 
yielding 50% and 90% reductions, respectively, in 
fluorescent viral foci. Any serologic values below 
the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0.5 
times the lower limit of quantitation. Available 
serologic results were included in the analysis.
Immunogenicity data from a human conva-
lescent serum panel were included as a bench-
mark. A total of 38 serum samples were obtained 
from donors 18 to 83 years of age (median age, 
42.5 years) who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 
infection or Covid-19; samples were obtained at 
least 14 days after a polymerase chain reaction–
confirmed diagnosis and after symptom resolu-
tion. Neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) 
in subgroups of the donors were as follows: 90, 
among 35 donors with symptomatic infections; 
156, among 3 donors with asymptomatic infection; 
and 618, in 1 donor who was hospitalized. Each 
serum sample in the panel was from a different 
donor. Thus, most of the serum samples were 
obtained from persons with moderate Covid-19 
who had not been hospitalized. The serum sam-
ples were obtained from Sanguine Biosciences, 
the MT Group, and Pfizer Occupational Health 
and Wellness.
Statistical Analysis
We report descriptive results of safety and im-
munogenicity analyses, and the sample size was 
not based on statistical hypothesis testing. Results 
of the safety analyses are presented as counts, 
percentages, and associated Clopper–Pearson 95% 
confidence intervals for local reactions, systemic 
events, and any adverse events after the admin-
istration of vaccine or placebo, according to terms 
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, 
version 23.0, for each vaccine group. Summary 
statistics are provided for abnormal laboratory 
values and grading shifts. Given the small num-
ber of participants in each group, the trial was 
not powered for formal statistical comparisons 
between dose levels or between age groups.

mean concentrations (GMCs) were computed 
along with associated 95% confidence intervals. 
The GMTs and GMCs were calculated as the 
mean of the assay results after the logarithmic 
transformation was made; we then exponentiated 
the mean to express results on the original scale. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were ob-
tained by performing logarithmic transforma-
tions of titers or concentrations, calculating the 
95% confidence interval with reference to Student’s 
t-distribution, and then exponentiating the limits 
of the confidence intervals.

Demographic Characteristics  
of the Participants
Between May 4, 2020, and June 22, 2020, a total 
of 332 healthy adults (men and nonpregnant 
women) underwent screening at four sites in the 
United States (two sites per vaccine candidate). 
A total of 195 participants were randomly as-
signed to 13 groups comprising 15 participants 
each; in each group, 12 participants received vac-
cine and 3 received placebo (Fig. 1). In all groups 
Figure 1. Screening and Randomization of the Participants.
The 54 participants who were not assigned to a trial group were screened but did not undergo randomization be-
cause trial enrollment had closed. All the participants received two doses of the vaccine (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) 
or placebo, except for the participants who were assigned to receive 100 μg of BNT162b1 or placebo, who received 
one dose.

Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates
but one, all the participants who underwent 
randomization received the assigned two doses 
of vaccine or placebo. Participants 18 to 55 years 
of age who had been assigned to receive 100 μg 
of BNT162b1 or placebo received one dose; the 
second dose was not administered because of 
reactogenicity in the participants who received 
active vaccine.5
The majority of participants were White (67 to 
100%) and non-Hispanic (89 to 100%) (Table 1). 
More older women than older men participated. 
The median age among the younger participants 
was 35 years in the BNT162b1 group and 37 years 
in the BNT162b2 group; the median age among 
the older participants was 69 years and 68 years, 
respectively.
Safety
Local Reactions
Participants 18 to 55 years of age who received 
10 μg, 20 μg, or 30 μg of BNT162b1 reported 
mild-to-moderate local reactions, primarily pain 
at the injection site, within 7 days after an injec-
tion; the local reactions were more frequent after 
the second dose.2,5 BNT162b1 elicited local reac-
tions in similar proportions of the participants 
in the younger age group and in the older age 
group. Among the older participants, mild-to-
moderate injection-site pain was reported by 92% 
after the first dose and by 75% after the second 
dose (Fig.  2). A similar pattern was observed 
after vaccination with BNT162b2. No older par-
ticipant who received BNT162b2 reported redness 
or swelling. No participant who received either 
BNT162 vaccine candidate reported a grade 4 lo-
cal reaction.
Systemic Events
Participants 18 to 55 years of age who received 
10 μg, 20 μg, or 30 μg of BNT162b1 frequently 
had mild-to-moderate fever and chills, with 75% 
of the participants reporting a temperature of 
38.0°C or higher after the second 30-μg dose 
(Fig. 3; and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org).5 In participants 65 to 
85 years of age who received BNT162b1, systemic 
events were milder than in the younger partici-
pants, although many older participants reported 
fatigue and headache after the first or second 
dose, and 33% reported a temperature of 38°C or 
higher after the second dose, including one older 
participant who reported a fever of 38.9 to 40.0°C 
(Fig. 3 and Fig. S2). As was observed with local 
reactions, systemic events were dose-dependent 
(greater after the second dose than after the first 
dose) and transient. Symptoms generally peaked 
by day 2 after vaccination and resolved by day 7.
Systemic events in response to BNT162b2 
were milder than those in response to BNT162b1 
(Fig. 3 and Figs. S1 and S2). For example, 17% of 
the participants 18 to 55 years of age and 8% of 
those 65 to 85 years of age reported fever (≥38.0 
to 38.9°C) after the second dose of 30 μg of 
BNT162b2. Severe systemic events (fatigue, head-
ache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain) were 
reported in small numbers of younger recipients 
of BNT162b2, but no severe systemic events were 
reported by older recipients of this vaccine candi-
date. No participant who received either BNT162 
vaccine candidate reported a grade 4 systemic 
event. After the first dose, systemic events that 
were reported by participants 65 to 85 years of 
age who received BNT162b2 were similar to those 
reported by participants who received placebo.
In both age groups and for both vaccine can-
didates, the use of antipyretic or pain medica-
tion increased with increasing dose level and 
with the number of doses administered. Fewer 
BNT162b2 recipients than BNT162b1 recipients 
reported using antipyretic or pain medication.
Adverse Events and Shifts in Laboratory Values
Through 1 month after the receipt of the second 
dose, adverse events that were considered by the 
Figure 2 (facing page). Local Reactions Reported  
within 7 Days after the Administration of Vaccine  
or Placebo, According to Age Group.
Panel A shows local reactions in participants 18 to  
55 years of age, and Panel B those in participants 65 to 
85 years of age. Injection-site (local) reactions were re-
corded in electronic diaries for 7 days after each injec-
tion. Pain at the injection site was graded as mild (does 
not interfere with activity), moderate (interferes with 
activity), severe (prevents daily activity), or grade 4  
(led to an emergency department visit or hospitaliza-
tion). Redness and swelling were graded as mild (2.0  
to 5.0 cm in diameter), moderate (>5.0 to 10.0 cm in  
diameter), severe (>10.0 cm in diameter), or grade 4 
(necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis for redness and ne-
crosis for swelling). I bars represent 95% confidence  
intervals. The numbers above the I bars show the over-
all percentage of the participants in each group who  
reported the specified local reaction. No participant 
who received either vaccine candidate reported a  
grade 4 local reaction.

Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates
investigators to be related to vaccine or placebo 
were reported by 50% of the participants 18 to 
55 years of age who received 30 μg of BNT162b1, 
as compared with 8% of those who received 
placebo.5 Adverse events that were considered to 
be related to vaccine were reported by 17% of the 
participants 65 to 85 years of age who received 
30 μg of BNT162b1 and by 25% of the partici-
pants 18 to 55 years of age who received 30 μg 
of BNT162b2. No participant 65 to 85 years of 
age who received 30 μg of BNT162b2 reported a 
related adverse event (Table S1).
No serious adverse events were reported, and 
no stopping rules were met as of the time of this 
report. The largest changes from baseline in labo-
ratory values were transient decreases in lympho-
cyte counts, which resolved within 1 week after 
vaccination (Fig. S3) and which were not associ-
ated with clinical manifestations.
Immunogenicity
The serologic responses elicited by BNT162b1 
and BNT162b2 were similar (Fig. 4). Two serum 
samples, both from the group of participants 
18 to 55 years of age who received 30 μg of 
BNT162b2, were obtained outside the specified 
time windows (one each at day 28 and day 35) 
and thus were excluded from the reported im-
munogenicity analysis. Antigen-binding IgG and 
virus-neutralizing responses to vaccination with 
10 μg to 30 μg of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2 were 
boosted by the second dose in both the younger 
adults2,5 and the older adults. Both vaccines elic-
ited generally lower antigen-binding IgG and vi-
rus-neutralizing responses in participants 65 to 
85 years of age than in those 18 to 55 years of 
age. Higher doses appeared to elicit somewhat 
higher antibody responses.
The highest neutralization titers were mea-
sured in samples obtained on day 28 (i.e., 7 days 
after the second dose) or on day 35 (i.e., 14 days 
after the second dose). Similar trends were ob-
served for the 50% and 90% neutralizing titers 
(Fig. S4). The 50% neutralizing GMTs for the 
two vaccine candidates at the 30-μg dose level 
on day 28 or day 35 ranged from 1.7 to 4.6 times 
the GMT of the convalescent serum panel among 
participants 18 to 55 years of age and from 1.1 to 
2.2 times the GMT of the convalescent serum 
panel among those 65 to 85 years of age. With 
10 to 12 valid results per assay from samples that 
could be evaluated for each group at each time 
point, pair-wise comparisons are subject to error 
and have no clear interpretation.
Discussion
Previously reported data from vaccination with 
10 μg or 30 μg of BNT162b1 in adults 18 to 55 
years of age suggested that it could be a promising 
Covid-19 vaccine candidate.2,5 Consistent with our 
strategy to evaluate several RNA vaccine candi-
dates and make a data-driven decision to advance 
the candidate with the best safety and immuno-
genicity profile, we compared clinical data ob-
tained after vaccination with BNT162b1,2,5 which 
encodes the RBD, with data obtained after vac-
cination with BNT162b2, which encodes the 
full-length spike. The data presented here in-
clude those that guided our decision to advance 
BNT162b2 at the 30-μg dose level to the phase 
2–3, international trial to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy in participants 18 to 85 years of age.
The primary consideration driving this deci-
sion was the milder systemic reactogenicity pro-
file of BNT162b2, particularly in older adults, in 
the context of the similar antibody responses 
elicited by the two candidate vaccines. Short-lived 
decreases in postvaccination lymphocyte counts 
had no associated clinical effect, were observed 
Figure 3 (facing page). Selected Systemic Events  
Reported within 7 Days after the Administration  
of Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.
Panel A shows systemic reactions in participants 18 to 
55 years of age, and Panel B those in participants 65 to 
85 years of age. Data on fever, chills, and fatigue are re-
ported here. (Data on headache, vomiting, diarrhea, 
muscle pain, and joint pain are reported in Fig. S1.) 
Data on systemic events were recorded in electronic di-
aries for 7 days after each injection. The fever scale is 
shown in the key. Chills and fatigue were graded as be-
ing mild (does not interfere with activity), moderate 
(interferes somewhat with activity), severe (prevents 
daily activity), or grade 4 (led to an emergency depart-
ment visit or hospitalization). I bars represent 95% 
confidence intervals. The numbers above the I bars 
show the overall percentage of participants in each 
group who reported the specified systemic event. No 
participant who received either vaccine candidate re-
ported a grade 4 systemic event or a temperature high-
er than 40.0°C.

Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates
across the age groups, and probably reflect a tem-
porary redistribution of lymphocytes from the 
bloodstream to lymphoid tissues as a functional 
response to immune stimulation by the vac-
cine.13-16 The immune response and toxicity pro-
file at the selected, relatively low, 30-μg dose 
level indicate that the BNT162b2 modRNA vac-
cine candidate has a favorable balance of reacto-
genicity and immunogenicity.17,18
The composition of the lipid nanoparticles, 
the formulation components, or the sequence 
selection for the vaccine RNA could influence 
the side-effect profile. The reason for the lower 
reactogenicity of BNT162b2 than of BNT162b1 is 
not certain, given that the two vaccine candi-
dates share the same modRNA platform, RNA 
production and purification processes, and for-
mulation of lipid nanoparticles. They differ in 
the nucleotide sequences that encode the vaccine 
antigens and in the overall size of the RNA con-
structs, which results in a number of RNA mol-
ecules in 30 μg of BNT162b1 that is approxi-
mately 5 times as high as that in 30 μg of 
BNT162b2. The nucleotide composition of RNA 
has been reported to affect its immune stimula-
tory activity and reactogenicity profile, and this 
is a possible explanation for the differences in 
these vaccine candidates.19
The immune responses elicited by BNT162b1 
and BNT162b2 were similar. As has been ob-
served with other vaccines and as is probably 
associated with immunosenescence,20,21 the im-
munogenicity of the two vaccine candidates de-
creased with age, eliciting lower overall humoral 
responses in adults 65 to 85 years of age than in 
those 18 to 55 years of age. Nevertheless, at 7 days 
and 14 days after the second dose, the 50% and 
90% neutralizing GMTs that were elicited by 30 μg 
of BNT162b2 in older adults exceeded those of 
the convalescent serum panel. Antibody respons-
es in both younger and older adults showed a clear 
benefit of a second dose.
This trial and interim report have several 
limitations. First, the relative importance of hu-
moral and cellular immunity with regard to pro-
tection from Covid-19 has not yet been fully char-
acterized. Although strong cell-mediated immune 
responses (Th1-biased CD4+ and CD8+) elicited 
by BNT162b1 have been observed and reported 
in the German trial,2 the cellular immune re-
sponses elicited by BNT162b2 are still being 
studied. Second, although the serum neutralizing 
responses that were elicited by the vaccine can-
didates relative to those elicited by natural infec-
tion are highly encouraging, the degree of pro-
tection against Covid-19 provided by this or any 
other benchmark is unknown. Third, the phase 
1 portion of this trial tested many hypotheses 
and was not powered to make formal statistical 
comparisons. Fourth, the human convalescent 
serum panels that have been used by different 
vaccine developers are not standardized among 
laboratories, and each represents a unique distri-
bution of donor characteristics and times of col-
lection. Therefore, the serum panel that we used 
does not provide a well-controlled benchmark 
for comparisons of the serologic responses elic-
ited by these two BNT162 vaccine candidates with 
those elicited by other Covid-19 vaccine candi-
Figure 4 (facing page). Immunogenicity of BNT162b1 
and BNT162b2.
Participants in groups of 15 received an injection with 
the indicated dose levels of one of either of the BNT162 
vaccine candidates (12 participants) or placebo (3 par-
ticipants) on days 1 and 21. Arrows indicate days of 
vaccination. Responses in the placebo recipients in 
each of the dose-level groups are combined. Serum 
samples were obtained before injection (on day 1) and 
on days 21, 28, and 35 after the first dose. The blood 
samples obtained on days 28 and 35 are those obtained 
7 days and 14 days, respectively, after the second dose. 
Human coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) or SARS-
CoV-2 infection convalescent serum (HCS) samples 
were obtained from 38 donors at least 14 days after 
polymerase chain reaction–confirmed diagnosis and at 
a time when the donors were asymptomatic. Panel A 
shows the geometric mean concentrations of recombi-
nant S1-binding IgG (lower limit of quantitation, 1.267; 
dashed line), and Panel B the 50% SARS-CoV-2–neu-
tralizing geometric mean titers (lower limit of quantita-
tion, 20; dashed line). On days that vaccine or placebo 
was administered, samples were obtained before the 
injection. Each data point represents a serum sample, 
and the top of each vertical bar represents the geomet-
ric mean with the 95% confidence interval (I bar). Data 
points associated with placebo, HCS samples, or the 
10-μg dose of vaccine are shown as circles, those for 
the 20-μg dose as squares, and those for the 30-μg 
dose as triangles. The numbers above the bars show 
the geometric mean concentration or geometric mean 
titer in the group. All the vaccine groups had 12 valid 
results from samples that could be evaluated at each 
time point except for the following: among participants 
who received BNT162b2, 11 results from day 28 in 
younger participants who received 30 μg, 10 results 
from day 35 in younger participants who received 30 
μg, and 11 results from day 35 in older participants 
who received 10 μg.

dates. Finally, the participants in this early-stage 
clinical trial were healthy and had limited racial 
and ethnic diversity as compared with the general 
population.
Many of the limitations cited above are being 
addressed in the international, phase 2–3 portion 
of this trial. In this later, pivotal part of the trial, 
we are assessing the safety and efficacy of two 
doses of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in up to 44,000 
participants (randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive vaccine or placebo) from diverse back-
grounds, including persons with stable chronic 
underlying health conditions, persons at in-
creased risk owing to occupational exposure, and 
persons from racial and ethnic backgrounds at 
higher risk for severe Covid-19.22 We are con-
ducting outreach to recruit trial participants from 
many backgrounds and are using U.S. Census data 
to locate trial sites in diverse communities.
