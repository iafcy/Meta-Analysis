Summary
Background As part of the accelerated development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), we report a dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a protein subunit vaccine 
candidate containing a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein (S-Trimer) combined with two different 
adjuvants.
Methods Our study is a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at a specialised clinical trials centre 
in Australia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers in two age groups: younger adults (aged 18–54 years) and older 
adults (aged 55–75 years). Participants were randomly allocated either vaccine or placebo using a list prepared by the 
study funder. Participants were to receive two doses of SCB-2019 (either 3 μg, 9 μg, or 30 μg) or a placebo (0·9% NaCl) 
21 days apart. SCB-2019 either had no adjuvant (S-Trimer protein alone) or was adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. 
The assigned treatment was administered in opaque syringes to maintain masking of assignments. Reactogenicity 
was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies 
and ACE2-competitive blocking IgG antibodies by ELISA and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 
microneutralisation assay. Cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric 
intracellular cytokine staining. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04405908; this is an interim analysis 
and the study is continuing.
Findings Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 151 volunteers were enrolled; three people withdrew, two for personal 
reasons and one with an unrelated serious adverse event (pituitary adenoma). 148 participants had at least 4 weeks of 
follow-up after dose two and were included in this analysis (database lock, Oct 23, 2020). Vaccination was well tolera­
ted, with two grade 3 solicited adverse events (pain in 9 μg AS03-adjuvanted and 9 μg CpG/Alum-adjuvanted groups). 
Most local adverse events were mild injection-site pain, and local events were more frequent with SCB-2019 
formulations containing AS03 adjuvant (44–69%) than with those containing CpG/Alum adjuvant (6–44%) or no 
adjuvant (3–13%). Systemic adverse events were more frequent in younger adults (38%) than in older adults (17%) 
after the first dose but increased to similar levels in both age groups after the second dose (30% in older and 
34% in younger adults). SCB-2019 with no adjuvant elicited minimal immune responses (three seroconversions by 
day 50), but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants induced high titres and seroconversion 
rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both younger and older adults (anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibody geometric 
mean titres at day 36 were 1567–4452 with AS03 and 174–2440 with CpG/Alum). Titres in all AS03 dose groups and 
the CpG/Alum 30 µg group were higher than were those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from 
patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses.
Interpretation The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum 
adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising 
activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

Introduction
As of Jan 23, 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic due 
to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has caused almost 100 million infections 
and 2·1 million deaths.1 Infections are causing unprece­
dented numbers of cases of severe respiratory illness, 
with substantial proportions of patients requiring admis­
sion to intensive care units.2 COVID-19 is associated 
with high transmission and, without adequately effective 
treatment, rising numbers of cases of respiratory distress 
are threatening to overwhelm global health-care capacity. 
Interventions are urgently required to reduce this disease

burden, leading to accelerated clinical development of 
at least 64 vaccine candidates.3
The main viral antigenic target is the glycosylated 
spike (S) protein, a trimeric protein consisting of 
two subunits (S1 and S2)4 that is essential for viral 
binding, fusion, and uptake into mammalian cells.5 The 
S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) interacts with human 
cell-surface human ACE2 and, after proteolytic cleavage, 
the S2 subunit undergoes a major conformational 
change leading to fusion and intracellular uptake of viral 
mRNA for replication.6,7 Interference with this process is 
the basis of most immunological approaches to prevent 
SARS-CoV-2 infections including vaccines.8
Trimer-Tag (Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Chengdu, 
China) is derived from the C-terminal region of human 
type I procollagen and is capable of self-trimerisation.9 
When soluble receptors or biologically active proteins are 
fused in-frame to Trimer-Tag, the resulting fusion proteins 
expressed in mammalian cells are secreted as disulphide 
bond-linked homotrimers. S-Trimer is a recombinant 
SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein produced using Trimer-Tag 
technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells. It preserves 
the native trimeric structure of S-protein in the prefusion 
form of the antigenic epitope, which is necessary for viral 
neutralisation, and it binds with high affinity to human 
ACE2.10 S-Trimer was highly purified via multiple steps, 
including removal of host cell proteins, residual DNA, and 
preventative viral inactivation agents, to meet Interna­
tional Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The 
resulting vaccine candidate, SCB-2019, is stable in liquid 
solution formulations at 2–8°C for at least 6 months, with 
longer term stability studies ongoing.10 When formulated 
with the oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant AS03, or the 
TLR9 agonist CpG combined with Alum (CpG/Alum),11 
SCB-2019 induced protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in-
animal challenge studies.10 We report an interim analysis 
of the first stage of a first-in-human phase 1 dose-finding 
and adjuvant justification study done to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of three dose levels of 
SCB-2019 administered to healthy adults as two doses 
21 days apart non-adjuvanted or formulated with either 
AS03 or CpG/Alum.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-
controlled trial at Linear Clinical Research, a specialised 
clinical trials centre with its own bed facility and pharm­
acy operating out of the QEII Medical Centre (Perth, WA, 
Australia). The first stage of the trial (reported here) 
was a placebo-controlled dose-escalation study done in 
two parts, with the first part done in younger adults (aged 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in accelerated 
development of many vaccine candidates based on various 
immunological methods to target specific antigens of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We did 
an unrestricted PubMed search on Dec 6, 2020, with the terms 
“COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “vaccine”. We initially identified 
268 references but this number decreased to 12 when we 
included the term “clinical trial”. Of these references, nine were 
reports of human clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and 
several were from the same studies of vaccines based on mRNA 
and human or chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored mRNA coding 
for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein, or SARS-CoV-2-inactivated 
vaccines. We separately identified a pre-publication paper on a 
clinical study of a nanoparticle vaccine containing recombinant 
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in a saponin-based adjuvant.
Added value of this study
Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to assess the 
effect of two different adjuvants (AS03 and CPG/Alum) on an 
S-protein subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (SCB-2019), 
which uses Trimer-Tag technology (Clover Biopharmaceuticals, 
Chengdu, China) to keep the natural trimeric structure of the 
S-protein (S-Trimer). Immune responses to the S-Trimer protein 
alone (SCB-2019 with no adjuvant) were inadequate but, with 
both tested adjuvants (AS03 and CPG/Alum), immune responses 
of SCB-2019 were increased to achieve neutralising antibody 
titres after two vaccinations. Responses were consistent with 
those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from 
patients with COVID-19. This neutralising activity directly 
correlates with the immune responses assessed as antibodies to 
the S-Trimer S-protein component and its receptor binding 
domain.
Implications of all the available evidence
mRNA vaccines coding for S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been 
reported to elicit protective immune responses, based on results 
in clinical trials and efficacy assessments, while producing 
neutralising antibody titres. For stability of mRNA candidate 
vaccines, storage is required at less than –70°C, whereas another 
vaccine candidate can be stored at 2–8°C. Using proprietary 
technology, we created the vaccine candidate SCB-2019, which 
comprises S-Trimer, a trimeric form of S-protein in its natural 
configuration, in two adjuvanted formulations, which are stable 
when stored at 2–8°C, greatly facilitating distribution and use. 
Both SCB-2019 adjuvanted formulations were generally well 
tolerated and are highly immunogenic when administered as 
two doses 21 days apart. They elicited levels of neutralising titres 
comparable with those recorded in convalescent serum samples 
from patients with COVID-19. These findings are similar to those 
seen with two doses of an adjuvanted recombinant S-protein 
nanoparticle vaccine, supporting the rationale of this protein 
subunit vaccine approach. Our data support further clinical 
development of both SCB-2019 adjuvanted formulations.

18–54 years) and the second part done in older adults 
(aged 55–75 years). Ten participants were each included 
in dose (3 μg, 9 μg, or 30 μg) and formulation (no 
adju­vant or AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvant) groups.
The first part of the study (done in younger adults) used 
a sentinel strategy in which the first two participants in 
each dose and formulation group were randomly assigned 
either vaccine or placebo and had study injections. These 
two sentinels were monitored for 48 h and safety data 
were reviewed by a safety monitoring committee (SMC) 
to assess any clinically significant adverse events that 
occurred. The remaining eight participants in each of 
the nine younger adult groups were then randomised 
to either vaccine or placebo (seven vaccine, one placebo).
No sentinel strategy was applied to the second part of 
the study done in older adults who were only recruited 
after safety data from the equivalent younger adult group 
(same dose and formulation) had been evaluated by the 
SMC. Older adults only received adjuvanted vaccine.
Eligible participants were male or female adults aged 
18–75 years who were healthy at enrolment based on 
medical history and medical assessment. Participants were 
recruited from an existing database maintained by Linear 
Clinical Research and through ethics-approved advertising 
on the study site’s website and social media as well as 
posters in the QEII Medical Centre. All volunteers were 
screened for serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as 
evidence of previous infection, and for acute exposure 
using RT-PCR; screening was repeated at study visits on 
days 22, 36, and 50. Inclusion criteria included the ability 
to understand and sign the informed consent, having a 
body-mass index of 18·5–35·0 kg/m², and availability for 
the duration of the study (6 months). Female participants 
of childbearing potential were not to be pregnant or 
breastfeeding and had to agree to use protocol-approved 
forms of contraception until 6 months after the first 
vaccination. Men were to use a protocol-approved form of 
contraception for 6 months from the day of first vaccination 
and to refrain from donating sperm over the same period.
Main exclusion criteria included positive serology 
for SARS-CoV-2; any uncontrolled chronic medical 
disorders; any known or suspected impairment of the 
immune system due to known immunosuppressive 
conditions, or any treatment with immunosuppressants 
or immunostimulants; known allergy to any vaccine 
components; malignant diseases; positive serology for 
HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; or previous receipt of 
any other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All volunteers were asked 
to avoid strenuous exercise from screening to day 50.
The study protocol was approved by the study centre 
institutional review board and done according to ICH 
and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants 
provided signed informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned to either non-
adjuvanted, AS03-adjuvanted, or CpG/Alum-adjuvanted 
groups using randomisation lists prepared by the study 
funder and formatted in accord­ance with Medidata 
standards (Medidata Solutions, New York, NY, USA), 
with randomisation codes uploaded through the 
Medidata randomisation and trial management system 
(RTMS). Only unblinded personnel had access to this 
list through Medidata RTMS. Participants were assigned 
a study number at enrolment and were vaccinated 
according to the randomisation list. All participants and 
personnel involved in safety data collection and immuno­
genicity assessments were unaware of the study treat­
ment. Vaccine preparation and administration was done 
by different unblinded study personnel, using opaque 
syringes to maintain masking of the participants since 
the vaccine and placebo are visually different.
Procedures
SCB-2019 (Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Chengdu, China) 
is supplied in single-use vials as a sterile, clear-to-slightly 
opalescent, colourless solution for injection, stored 
at 2–8°C. For use, the appropriate dose of SCB-2019 was 
diluted in a vial with sodium chloride (NaCl 0·9%). For 
adjuvant mixing and administration, 0·25 mL of AS03 
(GSK Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium) or 1·5 mg CpG 1018 
(Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA, USA) plus 
0·75 mg Alum (Alhydrogel, Croda, Goole, UK) per dose 
were added to the vial and mixed by gentle inversion at 
room temperature a maximum of 1 h before admin­
istration. Each 0·5 mL dose contained 3 μg, 9 μg, or 
30 μg SCB-2019 and adjuvants as appropriate, with 
sodium phosphate buffer and 0·05 mg polysorbate 80 in 
0·9% NaCl. Doses were withdrawn into a syringe and 
administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid 
region. Placebo was 0·5 mL 0·9% NaCl for injection.
On day 1, before vaccination, each adult received a full 
physical examination, at which vital signs were recorded 
and blood was collected for baseline safety lab­ora­tory 
variables. Further blood samples for safety analyses were 
obtained on days 8, 22, 36, and 50 for haem­atology, 
coagulation panel, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.
After vaccination, sentinel participants were monitored 
in the study centre for 6 h, whereas all other participants 
remained under observation for 60 min for potential 
immediate post-vaccination reactions. Participants then 
recorded solicited local reactions (pain, redness, and 
swelling at the injection site), systemic adverse events 
(headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea or vomiting, and 
diarrhoea and vomiting), and body temperature for 
7 days on electronic diary cards. Solicited reactions and 
adverse events were graded for severity (appendix pp 2–3) 
by the participants and assessed for causality by the 
investigator during interview at the following study visit. 
All unsolicited adverse events were recorded from day 1 
to day 50. Serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest (appendix p 2) occurring before database 
lock (on Oct 20, 2020) were to be reported immediately 
to the investigator and then to the study funder within

24 h. Any medication used during the study, including 
paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
for prophylaxis, was recorded. During the study, the 
SMC continuously assessed safety data with the option to 
authorise use of stopping or pausing rules predefined in 
the protocol (appendix pp 14–122). During trial pro­ce­
dures, personal protection and safety measures for study 
staff and volunteers were maintained at a high level to 
avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Serum samples were prepared for immunogenicity 
assessments before vaccinations on days 1 and 22, then on 
days 36 and 50. Serum samples were stored at –80°C or 
lower until shipment to the immunological laboratory 
(360biolabs, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) for analysis. 
Three immuno­logical assays were done to evaluate 
humoral immune responses to vaccination. The primary 
immunogenicity endpoint was based on the anti-SCB-2019 
IgG antibody titre at each blood sampling timepoint, 
measured by ELISA. Secondary immunogenicity assess­
ments included an ACE2-competitive ELISA measuring 
the inhibition of SCB-2019 binding to human ACE2 
receptor by serum IgG antibodies, and anti-wild-type 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity measured by wild-type 
microneutralisation assay (WT-MN50). A panel of 20 human 
convalescent serum samples from three hospitalised 
adults and 17 non-hospitalised adults with COVID-19 
(mean age 37 [SD 11; range 18–54] years; serum samples 
collected 20–57 [mean 39] days after symptom onset), 
and the National Institute for Biological Standards and 
Control (NIBSC; Potters Bar, UK) reference serum 
sample 20/130, were analysed using the same validated 
assays as comparators for the post-vaccination serum 
samples. Details of immunological assay methods are 
provided in the appendix (pp 4–5).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected 
from all participants at days 1, 22, 36, and 50 to assess 
T-cell mediated immune responses to vaccination 
using intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry to 
measure CD4+ T cells expressing markers including 
interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and

IL-17 after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein 
peptide pools.
Outcomes
Overall objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of three increasing doses of 
SCB-2019, non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS03 or 
CpG/Alum, in younger (aged 18–54 years) and older 
(aged 55–75 years) adults when administered as two 
intra­muscular doses 21 days apart. Long-term follow-up 
to 24 months is planned, to generate data on safety 
and anti­body persistence and to include SARS-CoV-2-
seropositive participants.
Statistical analysis
There was no formal statistical hypothesis in this phase 1 
study and all data summaries are presented descriptively 
by group. The study sample size was not based on any 
statistical hypothesis but is typical of such phase 1 studies 
and was deemed adequate to provide a preliminary 
assess­ment of vaccine safety and reactogenicity in each 
cohort.
The safety analysis set consisted of all randomised 
participants who received at least one dose of study 
vaccine or placebo, analysed according to treatment 
received (per-protocol). Reported summary statistics 
include counts and percentages of participants who 
reported at least one solicited local reaction or systemic 
adverse event, unsolicited adverse events (with severity 
and causality), and serious adverse events and adverse 
events of special interest, after the first and second doses. 
For this report, safety data for all participants with at least 
21-day safety follow-up after dose two are included.
The immunogenicity full analysis set consisted of all 
participants in the safety analysis set who had at least one 
post-vaccination blood sample collected and analysed for

immunogenicity. Data are summarised according to 
treatment received. Antibody responses are presented as 
geometric mean titres (GMTs) with 95% CIs at each blood 
sampling timepoint for each vaccine group. Geometric 
mean values are calculated on log10 (titres or data) values, 
with subsequent antilog transformations applied, the 
95% CI being calculated using Student’s t distribution. 
Seroconversion rates, defined as the percentage of 
participants with at least a four-fold increase in antibody 
titre over baseline within each study group, were calculated 
at days 22, 36, and 50. For between-group comparisons 
in geometric means, an ANOVA model was fitted to 
log-transformed assessment values (such as titre), based 
on participants with available data at each timepoint, then 
the geometric mean ratio and the 95% CI were calculated. 
Two-sided 95% CIs for the geometric mean ratio were 
obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t distribution 
for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed 
results and antilog transfor­mation of the confidence 
limits. In a post-hoc analysis, correlations between dif­
ferent antibody response mea­surements were evaluated 
with Pearson correlation coefficients computed for these 
analyses. All analyses, and summaries, were on group 
unblinded data and were done using SAS software 
(version 9.4 or higher) or GraphPad Prism (version 6.0c).

Role of the funding source
MD, BM, BH, IS, PiL, PeL, HHH, and JL are employed 
by the funder and parti­ci­pated in study design and 
development of the protocol, and in data analysis and 
data interpretation. RC and PR are scientific advisers for 
the study funder. The funder reviewed the protocol. 
PR worked with a medical writer (funded by Clover 
Biopharmaceuticals) to prepare a first draft report, 
which was reviewed and revised by all authors.
Results
Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 329 healthy adult 
volunteers were screened, of whom 151 (91 younger 
adults and 60 older adults) were enrolled after testing 
negative for SARS-CoV-2 (figure 1). Most screen failures 
(173 [97%] of 178) were due to exclusion criteria. 
One adult assigned 30 μg SCB-2019 withdrew before 
receiving any vaccination and was replaced with another 
volunteer. Demographics were similar across groups 
(table 1). In the younger adult group, the mean age of 
participants was 36·2 (SD 11·5) years for SCB-2019 
recipients (combined doses) and 32·6 (10·7) years for 
placebo recipients; 36 (40%) of 91 younger volunteers 
were male and most described themselves as white 
(72 [79%]) and neither Hispanic nor Latino (84 [92%]). 
In the older adult group, the mean age of participants 
was 61·1 (SD 4·9) years for SCB-2019 recipients and 
62·3 (5·9) years for placebo recipients; 28 (47%) of 
60 older adults were male and all (100%) were white.
At database lock (Oct 23, 2020), no deaths or hos­
pitalisations had been reported, and only two serious 
adverse events had been recorded, both in older adults. 
One older adult was diagnosed with cellulitis after a cat 
bite but completed the study, whereas another had 
hyponatraemia after receiving one dose in the 9 μg 
CpG/Alum group and was withdrawn from the study 
(figure 1). The participant was subsequently found to 
have a pituitary adenoma, which is a known to potentially 
cause hyponatraemia.12–14 Neither event was deemed to 
be associated with vaccination. One adult decided 
to withdraw from the 30 μg SCB-2019 (no adjuvant) 
group for personal reasons before receiving the second 
vaccin­ation. All other participants completed at least 
21 days of follow-up after dose two and up to day 50.
Non-adjuvanted SCB-2019 (S-Trimer protein alone), 
was generally well tolerated in terms of solicited local 
adverse events, with only one report of mild pain after 
the first dose (3 μg) and none after the second dose 
(figure 2). Formulations with AS03 adjuvant resulted 
in 54% (26 of 48) of participants having local adverse 
events after the first vaccination, consisting almost 
exclusively of transient grade 1 or 2 injection site pain 
(n=24); cases of redness (n=2) and swelling (n=2) were 
relatively infrequent (appendix p 6). The frequency and 
severity of local adverse events increased after the second 
dose, including one case of grade 3 pain after a 9 μg dose 
of AS03 adjuvanted SCB-2019. When formulated with 
CpG/Alum, dose-dependent induction of grade 1 local 
adverse events was noted, reported by five (31%) of 
16 adults after the first dose of 30 µg and by seven (44%) 
of 16 participants after the second dose of 30 µg. 
One grade 3 case of pain was reported after the second 
dose of 9 μg SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum adjuvant. All

local adverse events were transient and resolved within 
the reporting period. Younger adults reported local 
adverse events more frequently (39% of all dose levels 
combined; 28 of 72) than did older adults (21%; ten of 48) 
after the first dose, but incidence was similar in the 
two age groups, 35% (25 of 71) in younger adults and 
34% (16 of 47) in older adults after the second dose.
After the first dose of non-adjuvanted SCB-2019, 
solicited systemic adverse events were infrequent with 
3 μg and 9 μg doses (13% in each group; one of eight), but 
50% of the 30 μg group (four of eight) reported grade 1 or 2 
adverse events (figure 2). Fewer adverse events were 
recorded after the second dose (appendix p 7). By contrast, 
when formulated with AS03, the frequency of systemic 
adverse events was higher and not dose-dependent, 
reported by 25–38% per group after the first dose and 
44–56% after the second dose with a con­comitant increase 
in the proportion described as grade 2 (figure 2). Two 
participants, one each in the 9 μg and 30 μg groups, 
reported grade 3 fatigue and myalgia. The most frequently 
reported systemic adverse events were headache, fatigue, 
and myalgia, with six reports of fever (appendix pp 7–8); 
all events were grade 1 or 2 after the second dose of 
SCB-2019 with AS03 adjuvant. Frequen­cies of systemic 
adverse events in participants who received SCB-2019 
with CpG/Alum adjuvant (19–38%) were similar to those 
with the AS03 adjuvant after the first dose, but unlike the 
AS03 group there was no consistent trend to increased 
frequency or severity after the second dose of SCB-2019 
with CpG/Alum adjuvant (13–31%). As with local adverse 
events, the frequency of reported systemic adverse events 
was lower in older adults after their first dose (17%) than 
in younger adults (38%), and overall rates were similar 
after second doses, 30% in older and 34% in younger 
adults. No participants took prophylactic paracetamol or 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Unsolicited adverse events reported over the 50-day 
study period mainly consisted of cases of grade 1 or 2 
headache or gastrointestinal disorders (nausea or 
abdominal pain) that were recorded after the 7-day period 
for solicited adverse events. None of the two grade 3 
unsolicited adverse events (dizziness with 3 µg SCB-2019 
and AS03, and presyncope with 9 µg SCB-2019 and 
CpG/Alum) or two grade 4 unsolicited adverse events 
(hot flushes with 30 µg SCB-2019 and AS03, and hypo­nat­
r­aemia associated with a pituitary adenoma with 9 µg 
SCB-2019 and CpG/Alum) were causally related to 
vaccination. No consistent trends or clinically significant 
laboratory safety abnormalities were noted in any group 
at any timepoint. No cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
reported during the study. No adverse events of special 
interest, including potential immune-mediated diseases, 
were seen.
Anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibodies did not increase after 
the first dose of non-adjuvanted SCB-2019 by day 22, 
irrespective of dose level (figure 3). By day 50, 
three SCB-2019 recipients seroconverted, one (13%) of 
eight in the 3 μg group and two (29%) of seven in the 
30 μg group (table 2), although GMTs were low. In both 
adjuvanted cohorts, SCB-2019 dose-dependent IgG

responses were evident after a single dose in both age 
groups (figure 3). All participants at each dose level of 
SCB-2019 with AS03 adjuvant seroconverted by day 36 
(table 2). After a second dose of SCB-2019 with AS03 
adjuvant, striking increases in GMTs were seen, to 
higher levels than those observed in the convalescent 
serum samples and NIBSC reference serum 20/130 
(GMT 666 EC50 [95% CI 272–1628]; n=21) with a range of 
GMTs from 2510 to 4452 across dose levels in young 
adults and 1567 to 3625 in older adults (figure 3). 
Antibody titres persisted at high levels at day 50. Small 
dose-dependent IgG responses against SCB-2019 with 
CpG/Alum adjuvant were seen at all dose levels at day 22 
after one dose in young adults (GMTs 25–71), which 
greatly increased after the second dose, with GMTs of 
478–2440 on day 36. GMTs were lower in the equivalent 
older adult groups (15–22 at day 22), with GMTs of 
174–572 at day 36 (figure 3). High GMTs were maintained 
to day 50, when seroconversion rates were 87·5–93·8% 
in both age groups combined across doses (table 2).
When ACE2 receptor-competitive blocking antibodies 
were assessed (figure 4), little or no response to non-
adjuvanted SCB-2019 was seen, but robust responses 
were noted to the first and second doses of SCB-2019 
with AS03 adjuvant, for all dose levels. Similar EC50 
GMTs were achieved in both age groups at day 36, 
ranging from 435 to 754 in younger adults and from 
288 to 688 in older adults across all dose levels. Sero­
conversion rates for both age groups combined were 
94% for 3 μg and 100% for 9 μg and 30 μg. All groups 
had GMTs that were higher than those seen with 
convalescent serum samples, including the NIBSC 
ref­erence serum 20/130 (GMT 144 [95% CI 54–386]; 
n=21), and titres remained higher than convalescent 
serum samples at day 50 (figure 4). After vaccination 
with SCB-2019 plus the CpG/Alum adjuvant, dose-
dependent responses were noted in younger adults that 
were higher than in older adults and that only matched 
the levels seen in convalescent serum samples with 9 μg 
and 30 μg doses of SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum adjuvant 
in younger adults, who had seroconversion rates 
of 50–93% after two doses (table 2).
Serum neutralising activity of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 
showed a similar pattern of response to SCB-2019-binding 
IgG antibodies (figure 5). No increase in neutralising 
activity was seen with non-adjuvanted SCB-2019, with

shown by the geometric means of 1280–3948 MN50 across 
dose levels. Importantly the range of MN50 GMTs seen in 
older adult groups (1076–3320) were similar to those in 
the younger adult groups for all dose levels and were 
higher than convalescent serum samples (MN50 GMT 717 
[95% CI 213–2417]; n=21). Some decline in GMTs was 
seen, but high levels of neutralising antibodies persisted 
to day 50 in both age groups (figure 5), with a range of 
titres that overlapped those observed in convalescent 
serum samples from hospitalised COVID-19 patients and 
the NIBSC reference serum 20/130.
Dose-dependent increases in neutralising activity 
were also observed in the SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum 
adjuvant groups, but these responses were lower in 
magnitude than in the AS03 adjuvant groups (figure 5). 
In the older adult groups, the range of MN50 GMTs 
(123–263) was lower than in convalescent serum samples. 
High titres were maintained up to day 50, the last 
timepoint tested in this interim analysis.
When correlations between immune responses assessed 
by the three different immunological assays were 
investigated in convalescent serum samples and samples 
from vaccinated participants, significant linear relation­
ships were seen between each of the three assays (appendix 
pp 9–10). The calculated Pearson correlation coefficients 
(R) were 0·88 (p<0·0001) for ACE2-competitive blocking 
antibodies versus SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies, 
0·70 (p<0·0001) for SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies 
versus WT-MN50, and 0·67 (p<0·0001) for WT-MN50 versus 
ACE2-competitive blocking antibodies (appendix p 10). 
Further, the calculated ratios of neutralising antibodies to 
SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies in serum samples from 
vaccinated participants obtained at day 36 and day 50 after 
two doses of vaccine fell in the same range for SCB-2019 
with AS03 adjuvant and SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum 
adju­vant and convalescent serum samples (appendix p 11).
Assessment of T-helper (Th)-1-biased cell-mediated 
immune responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein 
were recorded in both adjuvanted vaccine groups with 
increases in IFN-γ-positive CD4+ T-cells, IL-2-positive 
CD4+ T-cells, or both, after the first dose, which further 
increased after the second dose (appendix pp 12–13). 
There were no cell-mediated immune responses with 
non-adjuvanted SCB-2019 and no observable increases 
in Th-2 (IL-4-positive or IL-5-positive CD4+ cells) or Th-17 
(IL-17-positive CD4+ cells) cellular immune responses in 
any group.
Discussion
The primary objective of this study was to assess the 
safety and reactogenicity of SCB-2019 when administered 
as the S-Trimer protein alone (non-adjuvanted) or as 
one of two adjuvanted formulations with either AS03 or 
CpG/Alum. For this phase 1 study, antigen and adjuvant 
were mixed before administration. Although a ready-
mixed single vial formulation would be preferable, this 
practice was successfully used for administration of 
approximately 90 million doses of the influenza vaccine 
Pandemrix (GSK, Wavre, Belgium) during the H1N1 
influenza pandemic in 2008.15 All formulations seemed 
to have an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-
related serious adverse events or study withdrawals. 
Non-adjuvanted SCB-2019 was well tolerated and, when 
admin­istered in combination with either adjuvant, 
showed acceptable reactogenicity with few grade 3 
solicited adverse events. Higher reactogenicity was noted 
with AS03, unaffected by the dose level of SCB-2019, 
which consisted of mainly transient grade 1 or 2 adverse 
events, which all resolved spontaneously without inter­
vention. No prophylactic paracetamol was used in this 
study and would not seem necessary for general use. All 
local adverse events resolved within the reporting period 
of 7 days post-vaccination. When the age of participants 
was considered, no overall effect on safety or reactogenicity 
was seen. Although older adults (aged 55–75 years) had 
fewer local and systemic adverse events than did younger 
adults (aged 18–54 years) after the first dose, the incidence 
of solicited adverse events was similar in both age groups 
after the second dose. Use of AS03 in pandemic H5N1 
influenza vaccines showed its general safety,15 whereas 
large trials of the same vaccine revealed a higher local 
reactogenicity than we noted in our trial, with injection 
pain in 89% of adults aged 18–64 years.16 Overall, this 
reactogenicity profile compares favourably with those of 
the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which had incidences 
of local pain approaching or reaching 100% in adults, and 
similar to those of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored 
vaccine.17–19 The rates of solicited adverse events in the 
CpG/Alum-adjuvanted vaccine groups were lower and 
consistent with licensed CpG-adjuvanted vaccines.20,21
Non-adjuvanted SCB-2019 (S-Trimer protein alone) at 
the tested dose levels was poorly immunogenic, but 
when combined with ether adjuvant system (AS03 or 
CpG/Alum) there were robust increases in func­tional 
immune responses detected as SARS-CoV-2 neutralising 
activity that correlated well with IgG antibodies against 
SCB-2019 or ACE2-competitive blocking antibodies. 
Neutralising responses were already seen after the first 
dose in the higher dose AS03 groups. Highest responses 
were seen with AS03 and, after completion of the two-
dose series, GMTs peaked at day 36 at levels that were 
higher than those recorded in convalescent serum 
samples from patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and 
the NIBSC reference serum sample. These high levels 
persisted until the end of this interim analysis at day 50. 
Little meaningful difference was seen between the 
immune responses to SCB-2019 with AS03 between 
younger and older adults. When adjuvanted with 
CpG/Alum, immune responses were lower than with 
SCB-2019 with AS03 adjuvant, and were dose-dependent. 
Further, the response to SCB-2019 with CpG/Alum were 
lower in the older age group. Further investigation of 
the cellular immune responses showed increases in 
Th1-polarised responses after both first and second doses

for both AS03-adjuvanted and CpG/Alum-adjuvanted 
SCB-2019. CD4+ T-cell responses have been suggested to 
complement humoral antibody responses in overcoming 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.20
Because a strong correlation between neutralising 
activity and ELISA IgG antibody responses to S-protein 
and RBD has been seen in convalescent serum samples 
from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,22 
we investigated these ratios in our assays. We confirmed 
strong correlations between neutralising activity and IgG 
measured in either the SCB-2019 or ACE2-receptor assays. 
This observation is important because it has been sug­
gested that low neutralising to binding antibody ratios 
could contribute to increased risk of antibody-enhanced 
disease.23 The magnitude of neutralising antibody titres 
and ratio to binding antibodies after two doses are similar 
to those seen in adults after adjuvanted recombinant 
protein nanoparticle vaccine24 and compare favourably 
with those to mRNA-based vaccines with reported 
efficacy17–19,25–27 when accounting for different assay 
methodologies by comparing GMTs in human conva­
lescent serum samples. This direct comparison between 
different vaccine candidates in different studies must be 
interpreted with caution. Immune responses against 
different vaccines were done in different populations 
using various assay formats and, different panels of 
convalescent serum samples. To mitigate bias, we 
compared ratios of neutralising antibodies to binding 
antibodies generated by different vaccine candidates from 
the reported studies as the ratio is mostly independent of 
the above factors. Moreover, we included the NIBSC 
reference serum 20/130 in the validated assays, and titres 
obtained for this reference serum are presented. Both 
adjuvanted formulations were protective in preclinical 
non-human primate and rodent animal models,11 but 
AS03 formulations seemed to induce superior humoral 
immunogenicity with an apparent lack of age effect on 
the response. Although the AS03 formulation had higher 
reactogenicity than did CpG/Alum, severity seemed to be 
lower than with the mRNA and some vector-derived 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines17,18,25,26 and mainly consisted of tran­
sient mild-to-moderate local and systemic adverse events. 
Cases of narcolepsy were reported after the vaccination 
campaign with AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine during 
the 2009–10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, but evidence 
suggests these cases were attributable to the H1N1 viral 
antigen, and AS03 adjuvant does not have a role in this 
observed increased risk of narcolepsy.28,29
Our study has several limitations, including the 
enrolment of seronegative participants only and its relative 
small numbers of participants per vaccine formulation 
per age group. These limitations hamper observation of 
any true effect of age on tolerability or immunogenicity 
but allows observation of apparent safety and general 
tolerability of the different formula­tions. Immune 
responses have only been assessed up to day 50, approxi­
mately 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Antibody 
persistence and the ability to boost, as well as safety, are 
being followed up in a long-term study. Because study 
recruitment was done in Australia, ethnic diversity 
was limited, these factors will be addressed in the 
phase 2/3 studies, and the extension of this study in 
Panama will provide an additional information in a 
Hispanic population. Although we have compared 
immune responses elicited by vaccination with those 
measured in convalescent serum samples of patients with 
PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the absence of 
an established serological correlate of protection, we 
cannot extrapolate our data to infer protection.
In conclusion, we have shown high neutralising antibody 
responses, with a Th1-biased cellular immune response, 
and an acceptable safety profile. Based on these results, 
9 µg SCB-2019 adjuvanted with AS03 and 30 µg SCB-2019 
adjuvanted with CpG/Alum are the preferred candidates to 
be taken into the phase 2/3 trial; the final selection will be 
determined by manufacturing considerations.
