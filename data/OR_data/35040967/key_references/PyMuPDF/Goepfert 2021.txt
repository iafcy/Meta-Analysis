Summary
Background CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion spike protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression 
system being developed against SARS-CoV-2. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-
human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.
Methods This phase 1–2, randomised, double-blind study is being done in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults 
in ten clinical research centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18–49 years and ≥50 years) and 
randomly assigned using an interactive response technology system with block randomisation (blocks of varying 
size) to receive one dose (on day 1) or two doses (on days 1 and 22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing low-
dose (effective dose 1·3 µg) or high-dose (2·6 µg) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 
(GlaxoSmithKline) or unadjuvanted high-dose antigen (18–49 years only). Primary endpoints were safety, assessed 
up to day 43, and immunogenicity, measured as SARS-C0V-2 neutralising antibodies (geometric mean titres), 
assessed on days 1, 22, and 36 serum samples. Safety was assessed according to treatment received in the safety 
analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose. Neutralising 
antibody titres were assessed in the per-protocol analysis set for immunogenicity, which included participants who 
received at least one dose, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, had no protocol deviation, had negative results 
in the neutralisation test at baseline, and had at least one valid post-dose serology sample. This planned interim 
analysis reports data up to 43 days after the first vaccination; participants in the trial will be followed 
up for 12 months after the last study injection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04537208, and is 
ongoing.
Findings Between Sept 3 and Sept 29, 2020, 441 individuals (299 aged 18–49 years and 142 aged ≥50 years) were 
randomly assigned to one of the 11 treatment groups. The interim safety analyses included 439 (>99%) of 441 randomly 
assigned participants (299 aged 18–49 years and 140 aged ≥50 years). Neutralising antibody titres were analysed in 
326 (74%) of 441 participants (235 [79%] of 299 aged 18–49 years and 91 [64%] of 142 aged ≥50 years). There were no 
vaccine-related unsolicited immediate adverse events, serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events 
classified as severe, or adverse events of special interest. Among all study participants, solicited local and 
systemic reactions of any grade after two vaccine doses were reported in 81% (95% CI 61–93; 21 of 26) of participants 
in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 93% (84–97; 74 of 80) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 89% (70–98; 23 of 26) in the 
high-dose plus AF03 group, 95% (88–99; 81 of 85) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 29% (10–56; five of 17) in the 
unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 21% (8–40; six of 29) in the placebo group. A single vaccine dose did not generate 
neutralising antibody titres above placebo levels in any group at days 22 or 36. Among participants aged 18–49 years, 
neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 13·1 (95% CI 6·40–26·9) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 
20·5 (13·1–32·1) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 43·2 (20·6–90·4) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 
75·1 (50·5–112·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 5·00 (not calculated) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 
5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group. Among participants aged 50 years or older, neutralising antibody titres 
after two vaccine doses were 8·62 (1·90–39·0) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 12·9 (7·09–23·4) in the low-dose 
plus AS03 group, 12·3 (4·35–35·0) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 52·3 (25·3–108·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 
group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group.
Interpretation The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age groups, and the high 
reactogenicity after dose two were probably due to higher than anticipated host-cell protein content and lower than 
planned antigen doses in the formulations tested, which was discovered during characterisation studies on the final 
bulk drug substance. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the 
optimal antigen formulation and dose.

Introduction
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 
December, 2019, in Wuhan, China, and a global 
pandemic was declared in March, 2020. More than 
2·8 million deaths and 128·6 million confirmed 
cases 
have 
been 
reported 
worldwide 
(as 
of 
March 31, 2021).1
Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will probably provide 
the most effective interventional long-term means of 
preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 
it has become an urgent global priority. Of more than 
60 vaccines in clinical development, several have reached 
phase 3 testing,2 with interim efficacy results already 
available for some of these through peer-reviewed 
publications3–5 or public statements.6–9 At the time of 
writing, a number of vaccines had received authorisation 
for conditional, emergency, or temporary use in countries 
worldwide, 
including 
two 
mRNA-based 
vaccines, 
BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), 
a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 
nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), a non-replicating viral 
vector vaccine, Sputnik V (Gamaleya Research Institute), 
and two inactivated vaccines, CoronaVac (Sinovac 
Biotech) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm).
The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein on the virion 
surface mediates host-cell entry, making the S protein a 
key target in vaccine development. The introduction of 
double proline substitutions at the beginning of the central 
helix of the S2 subunit of the closely related MERS-CoV 
S protein stabilised the protein in a pre-fusion confor­
mation and allowed induction of potent neutra­lising 
antibody responses in mice.10 Wrapp and colleagues11 
successfully applied this stabilising strategy to the SARS-
CoV-2 S protein. Sanofi Pasteur has developed a candidate 
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine containing the 
stabilised SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion S protein (CoV2 preS 
dTM). Another adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine 
candidate (Novavax) containing the stabilised SARS-CoV-2 
pre-fusion S protein showed robust immunogenicity and 
efficacy results, against COVID-19 mild, moderate, and 
severe illness in adults, including older adults (aged 
65 years or older), with acceptable safety.8,12
Although recombinant protein vaccines offer the 
advantages of fewer potential safety concerns and lower 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed from database inception to Feb 10, 2021, 
with no language restrictions, for studies reporting the safety 
and immunogenicity of adjuvanted recombinant protein 
vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 using the search terms 
“vaccine”, “clinical trial”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “recombinant protein”, 
and “adjuvant”.
One phase 1–2 human trial was retrieved, reporting the preliminary 
safety and immunogenicity of a trimeric recombinant full-length 
spike antigen delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant. The antigen 
shares design similarities with the antigen evaluated in our study 
and was manufactured using the same insect-cell expression 
system. The adjuvant in the phase 1–2 human trial was a saponin-
containing adjuvant, distinct from the oil-in-water based adjuvants 
evaluated in this trial.
Two additional vaccine candidates were known to the authors 
through joint development activities, both of which have 
reported preliminary interim results in preprints that were not 
retrieved through the search. One of the studies tested a 
virus-like particle vaccine manufactured in plants, which was 
found to induce higher antibody titres and cellular responses 
when adjuvanted with AS03 than with a second adjuvant. 
The second study investigated the safety and immunogenicity 
of a range of doses of a recombinant trimeric spike-protein 
antigen vaccine manufactured in a mammalian cell line, 
administered without adjuvant or adjuvanted with AS03 or a 
second adjuvant. For both of these AS03-adjuvanted vaccine 
candidates, the antibody responses were higher than antibody 
concentrations in panels of sera from patients recovering from 
COVID-19.
Added value of this study
This interim analysis represents the first-in-human evaluation of 
our adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine against SARS-
CoV-2, CoV2 preS dTM. In this study, although the vaccine raised 
antibodies capable of neutralising wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains 
in vitro, it had suboptimal immunogenicity, probably due to 
administration of lower antigen doses than planned due to use 
of an externally procured reagent in testing. Cytokine profiling 
using ex-vivo whole blood stimulation showed a more robust 
induction of T-helper-1 cell cytokines than T-helper-2 cell 
cytokines. Reactogenicity after the second dose was greater than 
expected, especially among participants receiving the adjuvanted 
formulations. This greater than expected reactogenicity was 
probably due to higher than expected levels of host cell proteins 
in the vaccine due to use of an externally procured reagent in 
testing. No other specific safety concerns were noted.
Implications of all the available evidence
Protein vaccines are widely used for vaccine-preventable 
diseases and represent a reliable and highly scalable technology, 
with products that can be distributed at 2–8°C, offering clear 
advantages for global distribution. The present vaccine 
candidate will require optimisation of the vaccine antigen 
formulation and dose before testing in phase 3 trials.

production costs than other traditional (eg, attenuated or 
inactivated) vaccines, they often require the use of 
an adjuvant to enhance the magnitude, quality, and 
persistence of the immune response.13 The antigen dose-
sparing qualities of adjuvanted formulations, allowing a 
reduced quantity of vaccine antigen to achieve a robust 
immune response compared with antigen alone, are 
particularly pertinent in a pandemic situation, in which 
there might be potential constraints on antigen supply. 
We used two different oil-in-water emulsions as vaccine 
adjuvant components for the candidate SARS-CoV-2 
recombinant protein vaccine, CoV2 preS dTM: the AF03 
adjuvant (Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l’Etoile, France)14 and 
the AS03 Adjuvant System (GlaxoSmithKline, Wavre, 
Belgium).15
This interim analysis evaluated the safety and 
immunogenicity, including binding and neutralising 
antibody responses and cell-mediated immunity, of 
CoV2 preS dTM, with the goal of informing selection of 
an adjuvant formulation, antigen dose, and immunisation 
schedule to proceed to further clinical development.
Methods
Study design and participants
This is an ongoing phase 1–2, randomised, modified 
double-blind (unmasked vaccine preparer or adminis­
trator, thus person has no role in evaluating the participant 
for safety outcomes; masked participant; and masked 
outcome assesor), first-in-human, parallel group, placebo-
controlled, dose-ranging study, with a sentinel safety 
cohort and early safety data review. The study is ongoing 
across ten clinical research centres in the USA, with a 
planned duration of approximately 12 months after the 
last study injection. Here, we present interim safety and 
immunogenicity data up to 43 days after first vaccination 
with the stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine, CoV2 
preS dTM.
Healthy adults aged 18 years and older were eligible 
for inclusion. A lateral flow immunochromatographic 
assay (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; Healgen 
Scientific, Houston, TX, USA) was used to identify those 
with recent or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; the test 
was done at each clinical site by trained personnel, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Individuals 
testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included 
in the study. Exclusion criteria included chronic illness or 
medical conditions considered to potentially increase the 
risk for severe COVID-19 illness; women who were 
pregnant or lactating; women of childbearing potential 
who were not using an effective method of contraception 
or abstinence from at least 4 weeks before the first 
vaccination until at least 12 weeks after the last vaccination; 
participation, or planned participation, in another clinical 
trial during the study period; receipt or planned receipt of 
any vaccine in the 30 days before the first, or up to 30 days 
after the last, study vaccination (except for influenza 
vaccination, which could be received at least 2 weeks 
before or after study vaccines); receipt of immunoglobulins, 
blood, or blood-derived products in the past 3 months; and 
active or previously documented autoimmune disease 
(appendix 1). Participants who received another authorised 
COVID-19 vaccine were not withdrawn from the study. No 
participant received another COVID-19 vaccine during the 
interim analysis period.
The study was done in compliance with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The protocol and amendments were approved 
by applicable Independent Ethics Committees and 
Institutional Review Boards and the regulatory agency 
as per local regulations. Written informed consent was 
obtained from the participants before any study 
procedures were done.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were stratified by age (18–49 years and 
≥50 years) and randomly assigned to one of 11 different 
treatment groups to receive one of five candidate vaccine 
formulations or placebo, as a single-dose or two-dose 
schedule. The candidate vaccine formulations were low-
dose antigen with AF03 or AS03 adjuvant, high-dose 
antigen with AF03 or AS03 adjuvant, or unadjuvanted 
high-dose antigen (appendix 2 p 3). No participant aged 
50 years or older was allocated to the unadjuvanted high-
dose antigen group as older adults are less likely than 
younger adults to respond without the presence of an 
adjuvant and to minimise the theoretical risk of vaccine-
enhanced disease. More participants in the two-dose 
cohort were allocated to receive AS03-adjuvanted 
formulations than AF03-adjuvanted formulations due to 
the substantial clinical and post-marketing experience, 
readiness for large-scale supply, and the extensive and 
multinational regulatory experience with AS03. Groups 
were randomly assigned using an inter­active response 
technology system by a contract research organisation, 
(Calyx, Nottingham, UK). Block randomisation was used, 
with blocks of varying sizes.
Initially, 30 participants aged 18–49 years were enrolled 
into a safety sentinel cohort and received a single dose of 
the intervention to which they were randomly assigned. A 
review of the safety data up to 9 days after the first dose, 
unmasked to treatment group, was done by the 
Sanofi Pasteur internal safety committee. Only upon 
demonstration of acceptable safety were the remaining 
participants enrolled.
Only the study site staff who prepared and administered 
the vaccine knew which vaccine was administered, and 
they were not involved in assessment of study data.
Procedures
The preS dTM was produced from a Sanofi Pasteur 
proprietary cell-culture technology based on the insect-
cell baculovirus expression vector system (appendix 2 
p 5). Purity was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate

polyAcrylamide 
gel 
electrophoresis 
and 
scanning 
densitometry, as described in the appendix 2 (p 5). The 
target quantities of the SARS-CoV-2 preS-antigen per 
vaccine dose were 5 µg for the low-dose formulation and 
15 µg for the high-dose formulation. However, during 
characterisation studies (appendix 2 p 5) on the final bulk 
drug substance, a key polyclonal antibody reagent used 
to detect the SARS-CoV-2 preS protein was found to also 
recognise glycosylated host-cell proteins. As a result, the 
purity and host-cell protein levels reported for the 
phase 1–2 clinical trial materials were inaccurate, and 
the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 preS protein in the 
formulated vaccine product was substantially lower 
(approximately four to six times) than planned. Upon 
recalculation, the effective dose levels administered in a 
0·5 mL vaccine dose in this study were 1·3 µg (low dose) 
and 2·6 µg (high dose) of functional SARS-CoV-2 
preS protein. The underdosing of the vaccine formulation 
was discovered after the study was fully enrolled and all 
participants had received at least one dose of their 
assigned product. The differences between the targeted 
and the effective dose levels correspond to an excess in 
host-cell protein content in the clinical materials 
(recalculated host-cell protein content was 3·7 µg in the 
low dose formulation and 12·4 µg high dose formulation). 
The AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur)14 and AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline)15 
adjuvants are oil-in-water emulsions, described in detail 
in the appendix 2 (p 5).
Vaccine formulations were supplied in two separate 
vials, one vial containing antigen suspension and another 
containing the adjuvant emulsion or phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) diluent. These were mixed before injection 
to give a final dose volume for injection of 0·5 mL, 
containing 0·25 mL antigen and 0·25 mL adjuvant 
emulsion or PBS diluent. Placebo recipients received 
0·5 mL 150 mM NaCl. Vaccine formulations and placebo 
were prepared by qualified and trained study personnel 
and administered into the deltoid region of the upper 
arm by intramuscular injection on day 1 and day 22 
(for the two-dose groups only; appendix 2 p 2).
Laboratory assessments included serum biochemistry 
tests, 
haematology 
(complete 
blood 
count 
with 
differential and platelets), and urine analyses. Adverse 
events were assessed for intensity (grade 1 to grade 3) 
and their relationship to the study intervention by the 
investigator at each site.
SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies were measured in 
serum samples with a microneutralisation assay at Sanofi 
Pasteur Global Clinical Immunology Swiftwater, PA, 
USA, using the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain (BEI 
Resources; catalog number NR-52281). The reduction in 
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, compared with that in the control 
wells, indicated the presence of neutralising antibodies 
in the serum sample. The 50% neutralisation titre 
was recorded16 (appendix 2 p 6). Binding antibody 
concentrations were measured using indirect ELISA 
done at Nexelis, Laval, Quebec, Canada (appendix 2 p 6), 
in which the reference standard was human serum with 
known concentration of anti-S protein IgG antibodies; 
quantitative results were reported in EU/mL.
A participant subset was randomly selected from 
the two-dose cohort for evaluation of cell-mediated 
immunity using an interactive response technology 
system. Immune responses mediated by T-helper-1 
(Th1) and T-helper-2 (Th2) cells were measured from 
blood samples obtained on days 1, 22, and 36, after ex-
vivo stimulation, using the TruCulture system (Myriad 
Biosciences, Austin, TX, USA). Blood samples (1 mL) 
were drawn directly into the TruCulture tubes, 
containing 2 mL of buffered media without stimulation 
(negative control), SARS-CoV-2 S protein for specific 
stimulation (S 2P-GCN4, GeneArt), or staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B plus anti-cluster of differentiation 28 for 
unspecific stimulation (positive control; appendix 2 
p 6). Validated cytokine profiling panels were used to 
evaluate concentrations of interferon-g (IFNg), tumour 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, 
and IL-13 (appendix 2 pp 6–7). When the initial 
regulatory guidances were made public, an emphasis 
was placed on the need to characterize polarization of 
T-helper responses as Th1 or Th2 predominant. This 
was viewed as a safety concern. In this spirit, we have 
considered the ratio of cytokines as the most efficient 
way to summarise these data and address this concern.
Outcomes
The primary objective was to describe the safety profile of 
the candidate vaccine formulations up to 12 months 
after the last dose in all participants. Safety endpoints 
included immediate unsolicited systemic adverse events 
(occurring within 30 min after each dose); solicited 
injection-site reactions (pain, erythema, and swelling) 
and solicited systemic reactions (fever, headache, malaise, 
and myalgia) up to 7 days after each dose; clinical safety 
laboratory measures 8 days after the last dose (on day 9 
for the single-dose cohort and day 30 for the two-dose 
cohort); unsolicited adverse events up to 21 days after 
each dose; and medically attended adverse events, serious 
adverse events, and adverse events of special interest, 
documented throughout the study. Adverse events of 
special interest included anaphylactic reactions and 
potential immune-mediated diseases. Potential immune-
mediated diseases are a subset of adverse events that 
include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory or 
neurological disorders of interest that might have an 
autoimmune aetiology.17 In this interim analysis, we 
describe primary safety endpoints up to day 43.
The primary immunogenicity objective was to describe 
the neutralising capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies 
at days 2, 22, and 36 for each study group. Secondary 
objectives for immunogenicity included descriptions 
of the neutralising antibody profile at days 181 and 
366 (single-dose cohort) or days 202 and 387 (two-dose 
cohort) and the binding antibody profile on days 1, 22,

36, 181, and 366 (single-dose cohort) or days 1, 22, 36, 
202, and 387 (two-dose cohort) for each study group. In 
this interim analysis, we describe cell-mediated 
immuno­genicity endpoints up to day 36 (exploratory 
endpoint).
In an exploratory analysis, neutralising antibody titres 
were measured in a panel of human convalescent serum 
samples (Sanguine Biobank, iSpecimen, and PPD). 
Convalescent samples were obtained from 93 donors 
between days 17 and 47 after PCR-positive diagnosis of 
COVID-19. Donors had recovered (with clinical severity 
ranging from mild to severe) and were asymptomatic at 
the time of sample collection.
Other study objectives include efficacy endpoints, 
specifically the occurrence of virologically confirmed 
COVID-19-like illness and serologically confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the association between 
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein 
and the risk of virologically confirmed COVID-19-like 
illness or serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(full list of study objective in appendix 1). These 
prespecified efficacy endpoints will be assessed as part 
of the ongoing study and reported separately.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were descriptive; there was no hypothesis 
testing. No sample size calculations were done. Approxi­
mately 440 participants were planned to be enrolled into 
this study (appendix 2 p 3), with 300 participants aged 
18–49 years (20 participants in each group, except 
AS03-adjuvanted groups in the two-dose cohort, with 
60 participants in each group) and 140 participants aged 
50 years or older (ten participants in each group, except 
in AS03-adjuvanted groups in the two-dose cohort, with 
30 participants in each group).
Participant demographic characteristics were described 
table 1 and table 2 for the full analysis set, which include 
all randomly assigned participants who received at least 
one dose; participants were analysed according to the 
treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. 
Safety objectives were assessed in the safety analysis set, 
which included all participants who received at least one 
dose; participants were analysed according to the study 
treatment received. The per-protocol analysis set was 
defined as the subset of participants who received at least 
one dose, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, had 
no protocol deviation, and had negative results in the

ELISA or neutralisation test at baseline. Neutralising 
and binding antibody profiles were assessed in the per-
protocol analysis set for immunogenicity, which included 
participants who had at least one valid post-dose serology 
sample within the predefined time window (appendix 1). 
Cell-mediated immunity analyses were done in a subset 
of participants in the per-protocol analysis set who 
provided at least one cell-mediated immunity sample 
within the predefined time window as per previous 
response. Immunogenicity analyses were done according 
to the treatment group to which a participant was 
randomly assigned.
Neutralising antibody profiles were described based on 
geometric mean titres (GMTs) and 95% CIs. Fold rises in 
serum antibody neutralisation titres after vaccination 
relative to day 1 were calculated, whereby pre-vaccination 
titres below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 
were converted to half the LLOQ. We calculated the 
percentage of participants with a four-fold rise in 
serum neutralisation titres relative to day 1 at days 22 
and 36 (before and after dose). We also calculated the 
proportion of participants with seroconversion, which 
was defined as detectable neutralisation titres at days 22 
and 36 in participants with baseline values below the 
LLOQ.
Binding antibody profiles were described based on 
S-specific antibody geometric mean concentrations 
measured at days 22 and 36. Antibody concentrations 
less than the LLOQ were converted to half the LLOQ 
(appendix pp 6–7).
95% CIs for GMTs, geometric mean concentrations, 
and GMT ratios were calculated using normal 
approximation of log10-transformed titres. 95% CIs for 
proportions were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson 
method.18 The differences in seroconversion rates 
between groups were computed along with the two-sided 
95% CIs using the Wilson-Score method without 
continuity correction.18
To characterise Th cell polarisation, the pre-vaccination 
(day 1) to post-vaccination (days 22 or 36) fold cytokine 
rises were computed by treatment group, and ratios of fold 
rises for cytokine pairs (IFNγ and IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13; IL-2 
and IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13; and TNFα and IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13) 
were computed (appendix pp 6–7). Statistical analyses 
were done using SAS (version 9.4). This study is ongoing 
and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04537208.

Results
Between Sept 3 and Sept 29, 2020, 441 participants were 
randomly assigned (299 aged 18–49 years and 142 aged 
≥50 years). Two participants aged 50 years or older 
from 
the 
low-dose 
plus 
AS03 
group 
(two-dose 
cohort) did not meet eligibility criteria. Therefore, 
439 participants received at least one dose and were 
included in the full analysis set: 269 in the two-dose cohort 
(179 participants aged 18–49 years and 90 participants 
aged ≥50 years; figure 1) and 170 in the single-dose cohort 
(120 participants aged 18–49 years and 50 participants 
aged ≥50 years; appendix pp 8–9). During randomisation, 
the specification of the maximum number of participants 
allocated to the single-dose cohort in the younger age 
stratum did not account for the allocation to the sentinel 
safety cohort. Therefore, among participants in the 
younger age stratum, more were allocated to the single-
dose cohort and fewer to the two-dose cohort than 
planned. The male to female participant ratio was 
balanced overall, and across most treatment groups. Most 
enrolled participants were White (table 1, table 2).
The reactogenicity profiles (solicited injection-site 
and systemic events) were similar across the adjuvanted 
groups in the single-dose cohort (appendix pp 12–13, 
16–17). Among the adjuvanted vaccine groups in the

two-dose cohort, solicited injection-site reactions (pain, 
erythema, and swelling) during the first 7 days after 
vaccination, including grade 3 reactions, occurred more 
frequently after the second dose than after the first dose 
(figure 2; appendix pp 10–12). Most injection-site reactions 
occurred on day 0 (pain) or days 1 and 2 (erythema and 
swelling; appendix pp 14–15). The unadjuvanted high-
dose formulation had a low frequency of injection-site 
reactions, similar to the placebo group (appendix 
pp 10–12). Overall, pain was the most frequently reported 
injection-site reaction: after dose two, 19 (73%) of 
26 participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 70 (89%) 
of 79 in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 19 (73%) of 26 in 
the high-dose plus AF03 group, and 78 (92%) of 85 in the 
high-dose plus AS03 group reported injection-site pain. 
Solicited injection-site reactions were generally less 
frequent and less severe in participants aged 50 years or 
older than in participants aged 18–49 years across 
adjuvanted groups, in partici­pants who received the 
AF03-adjuvanted formulations than in participants who 
received the AS03-adjuvanted formulations, and in 
participants who received the low-dose formulation than 
in participants who received the high-dose formulation 
(two-dose cohort; figure 2; appendix pp 10–12). No grade 3 
solicited injection-site reactions were observed after the 
first dose in any treat­ment group, and none were observed 
in the unadjuvanted high-dose or placebo groups after 
one or two doses. After the second dose, the highest 
frequency of grade 3 injection-site reactions was seen in 
the high-dose plus AS03 group; the most frequent grade 3 
injection-site reaction was erythema (observed in 20 [24%] 
of 85 participants in the high-dose plus AS03 group) and 
then swelling (11 [13%] of 85 participants in the high-dose 
plus AS03 group). No grade 3 injection-site reactions 
were considered serious, and all resolved within a median 
duration of 2 days.
Among the adjuvanted vaccine groups in the two-dose 
cohort, solicited systemic reactions (fever, headache, 
malaise, and myalgia) during the first 7 days after 
vaccination, including grade 3 reactions, were reported 
more frequently after the second dose than after the first 
dose in both age strata (figure 3; appendix pp 10–12).

Systemic reactions occurred most frequently on day 2 
after the second dose (appendix pp 14–15). Systemic 
reactions were generally less frequent and less severe in 
participants aged 50 years or older than in those 
in the younger age group, and in participants who 
received AF03-adjuvanted formulations than in those 
who received the AS03-adjuvanted formulations. The 
frequency of solicited systemic reactions among the 
unadjuvanted high-dose vaccine and placebo groups in 
the two-dose cohort was low and similar in both groups 
(figure 3; appendix pp 10–12). Myalgia, malaise, and 
headache were the most commonly reported solicited 
systemic reactions after the second dose of adjuvanted 
vaccine, with frequencies ranging from 46% (12 of 
26 participants; for myalgia in the low-dose plus AF03 
group) to 76% (65 of 85 participants; for myalgia in the 
high-dose plus AS03 group; appendix pp 11–12). Fever 
was reported after the second dose in four (15%) of 
26 participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 28 (36%) 
of 78 in the low-dose plus AS03 group, five (19%) of 26 in 
the high-dose plus AF03 group, and 23 (27%) of 84 in the 
high-dose plus AS03 group. Grade 3 systemic reactions 
also occurred more frequently after the second dose than 
after the first dose among the adjuvanted formulations, 
with the highest frequency in the low-dose plus AS03 
group (grade 3 headache, malaise, and myalgia occurred 
in nine [11%] of 80 participants, 13 [17%] of 79 participants, 
and 11 [14%] of 80 participants, respectively), high-dose 
plus AS03 group (grade 3 headache, malaise, and myalgia 
occurred in six [7%], 14 [17%], and nine [11%] of 
85 participants, respectively), and high-dose plus AF03 
group (grade 3 headache, malaise, and myalgia occurred 
in one [3%], three [12%], and three [12%] of 26 participants, 
respectively; figure 3; appendix pp 11–12). No grade 3 
solicited systemic reactions were considered serious, and 
all resolved with a median duration of 2 days.
No vaccine-related immediate unsolicited reactions 
were observed in any group (appendix pp 18–20). We 
observed an increase in the number of unsolicited 
adverse events after the second dose compared with 
placebo, mainly in the AS03 groups, with a small number 
of grade 3 reactions, primarily due to reporting of

reactogenicity-type (local and systemic) events (appendix 
p 18). Three serious adverse events were reported (two in 
the single-dose cohort, one each in the low-dose plus 
AF03 and high-dose plus AF03 groups; and one in the 
two-dose cohort in the high-dose plus AS03 group). 
All three were deemed not related to the vaccine 
by the investigator and the sponsor, and none led to 
discontinuation from the study. These serious adverse 
events included one transient ischaemic attack in a 
participant with a history of ocular occlusion and 
treatment with antiplatelet drugs, who did not receive 
a second dose; one hip fracture after the first dose in 
a participant who remained in the study; and one 
participant who developed breast cancer, who had 
symptoms before study vaccination, and did not receive 
a second dose. There were no potential immune-
mediated diseases reported and there were no adverse 
events of special interest, serious adverse events, or 
severe medically attended adverse events considered to 
be related to study vaccine by the investigator in any 
group (up to day 43 of the study).
A single vaccine dose did not generate neutralising 
antibody titres above placebo levels in any group 
at days 22 or 36 (appendix p 22). Among participants aged 
18–49 
years, 
neutralising 
antibody 
GMTs 
after 
two doses were 13·1 (95% CI 6·40–26·9) in the low-dose 
plus AF03 group, 20·5 (13·1–32·1) in the low-dose 
plus AS03 group, 43·2 (20·6–90·4) in the high-dose plus 
AF03 group, 75·1 (50·5–112·0) in the high-dose plus 
AS03 group, 5·00 (not calculated) in the unadjuvanted 
high-dose group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo 
group (figure 4A). Among participants aged 50 years 
or older, neutra­lising antibody titres after two vaccine 
doses were 8·62 (1·90–39·0) in the low-dose plus 
AF03 
group, 
12·9 
(7·09–23·4) 
in 
the 
low-dose 
plus AS03 group, 12·3 (4·35–35·0) in the high-dose plus 
AF03 group, 52·3 (25·3–108·0) in the high-dose plus 
AS03 group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo 
group. The GMT for the pooled convalescent serum panel 
was 72·4 (95% CI 17·6–297·5; figure 4A). After dose two, 
GMTs observed with the unadjuvanted high-dose 
formulation did not differ substantially from those in the 
placebo group. AF03-adjuvanted and AS03-adjuvanted 
high-dose formu­lations yielded approximately three-fold 
and four-fold higher GMTs, respectively, than did their 
low-dose formulation counterparts: GMTs on day 36 were 
30·2 (95% CI 16·3–55·9) in the high-dose plus AF03 
group and 67·6 (47·9–95·4) in the high-dose plus 
AS03 group versus 11·7 (6·50–20·9) in the low-dose plus 
AF03 group and 17·2 (12·1–24·5) in the low-dose 
plus AS03 group (both age strata combined).
At day 36, the proportion of all participants 
independently from the age group with a four-fold rise in

for participants aged 60 years or older (range across 
vaccine groups for ≥60 years was from 0% [0–98; 0 of one] 
in the low-dose plus AF03 group to 50% [16–84; four of 
eight] in the high-dose plus AS03 group; appendix p 23). 
Seroconversion for neutralising antibody titres at day 36 
was observed in 47% (95% CI 23–72; eight of 17) of 
participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 52% (39–65; 
33 of 63) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 71% (48–89; 
15 of 21) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, and 
88% (78–95; 60 of 68) in the high-dose plus AS03 group; 
appendix p 23). The proportion with seroconversion was 
lower in participants aged 50 years or older, particularly 
those aged 60 years or older, than in participants aged 
18–49 years (range across vaccine groups for ≥60 years 
was from 0% [0–98; 0 of 1] in the low-dose plus AF03 
group to 63% [25–92; five of eight] in the high-dose plus 
AS03 group; appendix p 23).
Binding antibody responses were noted in the single 
dose cohort, although geometric mean concentrations 
were ten-times lower than the corresponding two-dose 
group and none of the groups achieved higher than 
90% binding antibody seroconversion at D36 whereas 
100% binding antibody seroconversion was achieved 
in all of the two-dose adjuvanted vaccine groups (two dose 
groups Figure 4B; single dose groups appendix p 22). 
Some increases in binding antibody geometric mean 
concentrations were measured after the first dose, but 
greater increases were evident after the second dose in 
both age groups (figure 4B). Responses were higher in the 
AS03-adjuvanted groups than in the AF03-adjuvanted 
groups, and higher in the high-dose groups than the low-
dose groups; a small increase compared with placebo 
at 
day 
36 
was 
observed 
in 
the 
unadjuvanted 
high-dose group.
Cell-mediated immunity was assessed in a subset of 
87 participants from the two-dose cohort: 60 participants 
aged 18–49 years (18 per group for the AS03-adjuvanted 
vaccine groups; six per group for all other study groups) 
and 27 participants aged 50 years and older (nine per 
group in AS03-adjuvanted groups; three per group in all 
other study groups). Increases of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNFα 
cytokines from pre-vaccination to days 22 and 36 tended 
to be more robust than were the increases for IL-4, IL-5, 
and IL-13, especially in the AS03-adjuvanted groups, 
suggesting no Th2 cell bias in the cell-mediated 
responses (appendix p 24).
Discussion
In this descriptive, first-in-human study, a recombinant, 
pre-fusion stabilised trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-antigen, 
formulated with either AS03 or AF03 oil-in-water-based 
adjuvants, elicited neutralising antibodies with no 
specific safety concerns that preclude further development. 
Furthermore, a non-Th2 cell biased cytokine response was 
generated in AS03-adjuvanted vaccine groups, with IFN-γ 
production consistent with previous observations using 
the AS03 adjuvant system in influenza, hepatitis B, and 
SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines.19–22 In SARS-CoV-2-
seronegative participants aged 18–49 years, two doses of 
the adjuvanted candidate vaccine formulations were 
needed to generate neutralising antibody titres of a similar 
magnitude to those measured in patients recovering from 
PCR-confirmed infection (convalescent serum titres). The 
need for an adjuvant was shown as the unadjuvanted high-
dose group did not elicit a neutralising antibody response. 
Neutralising antibody titres among participants aged 
50 years or older were lower than those in the younger age 
group, showing an age effect with the formulations 
evaluated. This effect was further evidenced by lower 
proportions of participants aged 50 years or older than 
aged 18–49 years with a four-fold rise in neutralising 
antibody titres and who seroconverted, particularly those 
aged 60 years and older, a key population at risk of severe 
illness after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The high-dose 
formulation given with either AS03 or AF03 resulted in 
higher neutralising responses than the corresponding low-
dose formulation. The high-dose plus AS03 formulation 
consistently showed more robust neutralising and binding 
antibody responses compared with the other candidate 
vaccine formulations. However, not all participants in the 
high-dose plus AS03 group had seroconversion of 
neutralising antibodies after the second dose, especially 
among older participants (63% [95% CI 24·5–91·5] of 
those aged ≥60 years).
Previous human experimental coronavirus infection 
studies identified that the presence of pre-challenge 
neutralising antibodies was predictive of protection from 
infection or symptoms after challenge.23,24 A growing 
body of evidence from animal models suggests a key role 
for humoral responses, and specifically neutralising 
antibody responses, in protection against SARS-CoV-2. 
A study showed that adoptive transfer of purified IgG 
from convalescent macaques protected naive recipient 
rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a 
dose-dependent manner, with reasonably low neutralising 
antibody titres sufficient to protect against SARS-CoV-2 in 
this model.25 High neutralising antibody titres were able 
to achieve full protection in macaques, whereas ten-fold 
lower titres could still attain partial protection. These data 
suggest that neutralising antibodies might be sufficient 
for protection, even in the absence of cellular and innate 
immune responses.25 Our findings indicate that, although 
the best performing candidate vaccine formulation 
among younger adults was similar in terms of neutralising 
titres to the titres seen in convalescent serum titres, the 
responses in older participants were notably lower than 
convalescent serum titres.
The poor antibody responses observed in this study 
are most likely due to the use of substantially lower 
antigen doses than planned. Although other factors, for 
example poor characterisation of the expressed antigen 
or product matrix, or failure during bedside mixing, 
could theoretically lead to poor immune responses to the 
candidate vaccine formulations, these are unlikely given

the extensive characterisation undertaken in our study. 
Nevertheless, further development of the manufacturing 
process and assays to support characterisation of antigen 
content were ongoing in parallel to this first-in-human 
trial. Polyclonal sera used in antigen characterisation 
were discovered, after the study had commenced, to also 
bind to host-cell proteins, resulting in an overestimation 
of the S-antigen content during manufacture and under­
estimation of the host-cell protein content. Therefore, 
although the observed antibody responses support the 
selection of the AS03 adjuvant for further development, 
they also indicate that further optimisation of the antigen 
formulation or purification process and antigen dosage 
for the selected AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine is 
required. It should be noted that such evolution of 
manufacturing and production methods is typical during 
the development pathway but has been accelerated 
necessarily for COVID-19 vaccine development.
No vaccine-related serious adverse events, adverse 
events of special interest, or severe medically attended 
adverse events were reported after either one or two 
vaccine doses. There was a higher than anticipated 
number and severity of local and systemic solicited 
reactions after the second dose of the adjuvanted vaccine 
formulations, with the highest frequency in the high-dose 
plus AS03 groups. These reactions were generally less 
frequent and milder in the older adults than in younger 
adults. 
The 
unadjuvanted 
high-dose 
formulation 
generated similar reactogenicity profiles to placebo. 
Overall, these solicited local and systemic reactions were 
not serious, lasted a median of 2 days, and fully resolved. 
Although we did not assess a potential association 
of reactogenicity with the magnitude of the immune 
response, it is notable that both were greatest in the high-
dose plus AS03 groups of the two-dose cohort. Although 
transient, the reactogenicity profile observed after the 
second dose in the adjuvanted groups showed more 
frequent and more severe reactions than those reported 
in previous studies of influenza vaccine candidates (two-
dose schedules) containing the same adjuvants26–29 and 
the reactogenicity profiles reported for other SARS-CoV-2 
vaccine candidates using AS03-adjuvanted recombinant 
S proteins (Medicago [NCT04450004]22 and Clover 
Biopharmaceuticals [NCT04405908]). Notably, high levels 
of reactogenicity have been described during the clinical 
development of other SAR-CoV-2 vaccines, including the 
two recently authorised mRNA vaccines (BioNTech-Pfizer 
and Moderna),30,31 as well as for the Janssen adenovirus 
vector vaccine,32 the Novavax recombinant CoV2 preS 
vaccine (containing Matrix-M1 adjuvant),12 and the 
candidate mRNA-based vaccine CVnCoV (Curevac).33
We hypothesised that the high levels and severity of the 
reactogenicity observed in our study might be explained by 
the higher than anticipated content of host-cell protein in 
the clinical material (estimated at approximately 3·7 μg per 
vaccine dose in the low-dose groups and 12·4 μg per dose 
in the high-dose groups) resulting from the erroneous 
characterisation of S protein and host-cell protein content. 
Although a high host-cell protein content has been 
administered historically in the context of clinical 
development of a recombinant influenza vaccine using the 
same manufacturing platform, no such levels of host-cell 
proteins have been previously administered in combination 
with an adjuvant or in a two-dose injection schedule. In 
future clinical studies with the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine we 
therefore plan to use clinical material with host-cell protein 
content below that of the low-dose group in the present 
study, with the aim of improving the reactogenicity profile. 
There was no other medically relevant safety observation 
during the interim study period (up to day 43). Safety 
monitoring continues for up to 12 months after 
administration of the second vaccine dose.
A previously postulated theoretical safety concern 
with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the risk of potentiating 
immunopathology in vaccine recipients upon exposure to 
wild-type virus. Various hypothetical risk factors have 
been proposed, including the magnitude of the immune 
responses, the balance between binding and functional 
antibodies, the induction of antibodies with functional 
characteristics such as binding to particular Fc receptors, 
and the nature of the Th2 cell response, with Th2-polarised 
cellular responses being proposed to contribute to 
immunopathology.34–37 In this interim analysis, there was 
no evidence of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement. 
The results from our cell-mediated immunity analysis do 
not support a bias towards Th2 polarisation after the first 
or second dose of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine 
formulations; rather, we observed a consistent Th1 
response, as measured through IFNg, combined with 
low levels of Th2 responses, as measured through IL-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13. Although there is currently no evidence 
of any candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine giving rise to the 
phenomenon of vaccine-mediated enhanced disease, the 
observed cell-mediated immunity profile is reassuring.
The main limitation of this study is the erroneous 
characterisation of the content of protein and host-cell 
proteins used in the filled clinical materials administered 
in the trial, resulting in a substantially lower concen­
tration of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the formulated 
vaccine product than expected, and a correspondingly 
higher host-cell protein content. Other limitations 
include the necessarily small numbers of participants in 
this phase 1–2 study, such that rare serious adverse 
events and adverse events of special interest might 
not have been captured. Furthermore, an error in the 
specification of the caps on group sizes during 
randomisation resulted in more participants in the 
younger age stratum being allocated to the single-dose 
cohort and fewer participants in the two-dose cohort 
than planned. Further analysis of the cell-mediated 
immune responses is ongoing; in particular, cellular 
profiling will help determine the source of cytokines 
detected during ex-vivo stimulation of whole blood as 
described here.

The results from the candidate vaccine formulations 
tested here are informative in terms of the neutralising 
and binding antibody responses generated in healthy 
adults. Further improvement of the preS vaccine antigen 
formulation is needed to identify the optimal vaccine 
dose before evaluation in larger-scale phase 3 trials.
