Objective: To estimate the mortality rates from drug-related deaths and other causes among problem
drug users and population attributable risk of death due to opiate use in eight study sites in Europe.
Methods: Opiate users were recruited from drug treatment centres during the period 1990–1998 and
deaths followed up through national or local mortality registries. Gender-specific overall mortality rate,
proportion of deaths by cause (drug-related, HIV, other), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and
the attributable risk fraction (ARF) were estimated. Results: Crude mortality rates varied from 1 per
100 person-years in the Dublin and London cohorts to 3.8 per 100 person-years in Barcelona. The highest
drug-related mortality rate was 10 per 1000 person-years in Barcelona; the rates were 7 per 1000 person-
years in Denmark, London, Rome, and Vienna, and <3.5 per 1000 person-years for the others cohorts.
The mortality rate for AIDS was <2 per 1000 person-years in all the cohorts except Lisbon, Rome,
and Barcelona, for which it was 6 per 1000 person-years. The highest SMR among males was 21.1 in
Barcelona, and among females the highest SMRs were 53.7 and 37.7 in Barcelona and Rome, respectively.
In Denmark the ARF was 5%, whereas it was >10% in all other study sites and 24% in Barcelona.
Conclusion: Cohort mortality studies, especially in combination with estimates of prevalence, provide
useful insights into the impact of opiate use on mortality across European countries and emphasize how
preventing overall and drug-related deaths among opiate users can significantly improve the health of
the population.

T
he advantage of mortality statistics over most surveillance
systems is that they are invariably complete;1 information
on cause of death can also be obtained, although only on the
condition that one can identify the population one wants to be
informed about. Although drug poisoning/overdose and drug
dependence are key causes of death directly attributable to
problem drug use, problem drug users can die from many
other causes which are not readily visible in routine population
mortality statistics because we cannot identify problem drug
users in the register. Furthermore, any interpretation of drug-
related deaths2 over time has to distinguish between at least two
potential explanations: changes in the prevalence of opiate use
and in mortality risk. Mortality cohort studies which follow up
samples of problem drug users identify all causes of death and
measure both the overdose and all cause mortality rate. If
successful, they offer the opportunity of a full picture of
drug-related mortality and support the interpretation of
mortality statistics.3
The occurrence of heroin use and the mortality associated
with it vary between geographical areas.4–10 In general, the opi-
ate overdose mortality rate will be higher in populations with a
higher prevalence of injecting drug use. However, other factors
may govern the impact of opiate and injecting drug use on
opiate poisoning and all cause mortality, notably HIV preva-
lence among injecting drug users (IDUs) and also the average
age of the cohort and availability of substitution treatment.
Many longitudinal studies show IDUs to have higher overall
and cause-specific mortality rates than the general, gender-
and age-matched, population,7,11–13 with meta-analysis estimat-
ing that the risk of death among injectors was over 13 times
higher and that the drug-related mortality rate was 0.8% per
annum.14 In this study we estimate the excess of mortality
among opiate users enrolled in eight European cohorts
compared with the general population and the proportion of
deaths in the general population that may be attributable to
opiate use.
Methods
The study population included eight cohorts of opiate users
collected by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) working group on cohort mortal-
ity studies among opiate addicts. All cohorts consisted of opiate
users aged 15–69 years entering treatment during the period
1990–1999 and followed up using a comparable methodology.
Deaths among the subjects were traced by linking the cohorts
with national or municipal registers. A more detailed descrip-
tion of the different cohorts and the methodology has been
published elsewhere.15 Participant study sites were selected on

the basis of the availability of basic information on patients
entering treatment and access to population and/or mortality
registries. Subjects contributed person-years at risk up to the age
of 69 years, the end of the study period, or date of death,
whichever came first. Causes of death where available were
retrieved according to the following selection of ICD-IX and
ICD-X codes:
Drug-related deaths: 292; 304.0–.9; 305.2–.9; 965.0–.9; 969.0–.9;
E850–E858; E980.0-5; E980.9; E950.0-.5; E950.9; E962;
F11–F16; F18–F19; X40–X44, X49; Y10–Y14, Y19; X60–X64;
X85.
HIV-related deaths: 042.0–044.9; 279.1; 279.5; 279.8; B20–B24.
The remaining causes were classified as ‘other’.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated in
order to estimate the overall mortality excess among opiate
users compared with the general population of the same age and
gender. SMRs were calculated separately for males and females,
with the expected number of deaths in the cohort generated
from the mortality rate of the individual country by 5-year
age group (for the year in the middle of the follow-up period).16
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for SMRs were based on the
Poisson distribution. The attributable risk fraction (ARF) was
calculated as follows (for adults aged 15–49 years because preva-
lence estimates were available this age group):
ARF ¼ Popiate SMR  1
ð
Þ= Popiate SMR  1

Þ þ 1

:17
Estimates of the prevalence of opiate use were obtained from
the literature and EMCDDA sponsored studies.18–22 Credible
estimates for Lisbon were not available, so the ARF was not
calculated.
Results
The proportion of males in the cohorts ranged from 69% in
Vienna to 82% in Rome, and the average age at recruitment was
25–29 years in six of the cohorts and >30 years in the Danish and
Dutch cohorts. Table 1 shows the number of subjects in the
cohort, the study period, and crude death rates overall and
among males and females aged 15–69 years. The mortality
rate varied from just over 1 per 100 person-years in Dublin
and London to 2 per 100 person-years in Rome and 3.8 per
100 person-years in the Barcelona cohort (i.e. nearly 1 in
25 cohort subjects dying per year). Death rates for males and
females were similar in the cohorts from Amsterdam, Denmark,
Barcelona, Lisbon, and Rome, whereas in Dublin, Vienna, and
London the death rate was 2–3-fold lower among females in
the cohorts than among male opiate users (i.e. 0.5–0.8 per
100 person-years compared with 1.3–1.6 per 100 person-years).
Table 2 shows the mortality rates and proportion of deaths by
cause. The proportion of drug-related deaths varies from 7%
in Lisbon to 60% in the London cohort. The highest mortality
rate from fatal overdose was 13 per 1000 person-years in
Barcelona, compared with 7 per 1000 person-years in

Downloaded from 

Denmark, London, Rome, and Vienna. No deaths from AIDS
were found in the cohort recruited in London, while the pro-
portion of AIDS deaths varied considerably across the other
cohorts, from 2% in Denmark to 41% in Lisbon, with similar
death rates in Rome and Lisbon of 6 per 1000. Several of the
cohorts had substantial numbers of deaths with missing or
unascertained causes, e.g. in Lisbon, London, and Denmark
>10% were missing information on cause of death.
Table 3 shows the SMR comparing the mortality rate in the
cohort with the general population. In four of the eight sites the
mortality rate was 10 times higher than in the general popu-
lation. In Barcelona the SMR was 21.1 in males and 53.7 in
females; in Rome female opiate users were nearly 40 times
more likely to die than females in the general population. In
Lisbon the SMR among males was just over 6 times higher than
in the general population, and in Vienna the SMR among
females was just over 10 times higher. Given that death rates
in the adult population are higher in males than in females, the
largest differences in SMR between males and females were
observed for those cohorts where the mortality rate of opiate
users by gender was similar (see table 1), whereas cohorts with
higher death rates among male opiate users reported similar
SMRs for males and females.
Table 4 shows estimates of the ARF (i.e. the proportion of
deaths in the general population that may be attributable to
opiate use if the total surplus of deaths in the cohort were
causally related to opiate use). Denmark is the only country-
level cohort; it has a low prevalence of opiate use and therefore
<5% of adult mortality at ages 15–49 attributable to opiate use.
In contrast almost one in four adult deaths in Barcelona could be
a consequence of opiate use. In the other study sites the ARF
ranged from 10 to 17%.
Discussion
This descriptive study emphasizes the public health importance
of drug-related mortality, the scale of risk experienced by opiate
users (mostly heroin injectors), and the potential impact of
opiate use on the health of the adult population, especially in
cities in Europe. The evidence is clear: if we manage to prevent
opiate use, transmission of HIV among IDUs, and fatal overdose
we will improve significantly the overall health of the popula-
tion. The findings also underline the value of mortality cohort
studies. Further, the difference between the sites suggests that
there is unlikely to be any standard or inherent drug mortality
rate or SMR among problem drug users. Nevertheless, most of
the cohort estimates suggested a higher mortality rate and SMR
than an earlier meta-analysis14—i.e. that the annual mortality
rate of opiate users is >1 in 100 and could be as high as 3.7 per
100, with an SMR ranging from 6 to 54 and 10–20% of adult
mortality at ages 15–49 years attributable to opiate use. In
Barcelona nearly one in four deaths among young adults are
potentially due to opiate use. The drug-related mortality rate
across the sites was more consistent, ranging from 0.7 to 1% in
five of the sites. However, the lower rate, represented in Lisbon,
may reflect problems with the coding/certification of deaths.
Part of the variation in overall mortality between the cohorts
reflects the uneven distribution of HIV infection in Europe,
with high death rates and SMRs found in Southern European
countries where the prevalence of HIV also is higher.3
Although they illustrate the scale of the problem, the study
estimates need to be treated cautiously, and our analyses were
limited by a lack of information on the generalizability of
the cohorts to all opiate users and IDUs in the respective
sites. There are several potential biases that could lead to an

under- or overestimate of the different mortality measures. First,
the mortality rates observed among the cohorts may not be
representative of the rates of the total population of opiate
users. The study populations were recruited through treatment
centres, which under-represent recent opiate users. Moreover,
different criteria to enter treatment may result in differential
selection across countries. Cohort mortality may be higher if
treatment attracts those drug users with the most serious mor-
bidity or it may be lower (immediately after recruitment)
because of the protective effect of treatment.
Second, prevalence estimates and thus ARF are based on the
official population. Larger cities, however, may attract drug
users who do not belong to the registered population of that city.
Third, not all excess mortality is likely to be caused by opiate
use: strong risk factors for mortality such as deprivation, smok-
ing, drinking, and other risky behaviour are strongly associated
with opiate use; controlled for these might reduce the SMR.
Fourth, the SMR underestimates the risk ratio based on
the general population rather than a non-opiate using cohort.
However, it must be considered that because we use national
reference rates rather than local ones this effect will be small.
In addition to potential methodological issues, the infor-
mation about the cohorts is too limited to draw conclusions
concerning drug policy. Data on injecting status and drug pro-
file were not collected from enough of the subjects in the cohorts
to test whether these could explain differences in the mortality
rate between the cohorts. Moreover, although all subjects were
selected from treatment sites they also differ across sites in terms
of age distribution, years of follow-up, and length of time in
contact with treatment services, all of which can have an impact
on the risk of death.23–26 Thus, any differences in the distri-
bution of these factors between subjects in the cohort and the
underlying population would add bias to the findings.
Ideally the ARF would be estimated separately for males and
females; however, the prevalence estimates were not sufficiently
robust and we did not want to compound the uncertainty. In
general, the ARF would be larger for males than for females,
given that it is likely that about three-quarters of opiate users
would be male. Finally, the current cohorts include too many
unknowns to permit a comparative assessment of the risk of
death among countries. For instance, do the sites with higher
mortality rates indicate inequalities in provision of specialist
drug treatment or other harm reduction/prevention initiatives
and/or greater environmental risk?
Joint evaluation of the mortality rates, SMRs, and prevalence
of opiate use, however, could provide useful insights into the
impact of opiate use on mortality across European countries and
should be a goal of future surveillance of drug-related deaths.
Our data corroborate reports that in many European countries
drug users have a high mortality risk of death from infectious
diseases, AIDS, drug-related deaths, and violence.27–30 In con-
clusion, our results suggest that public health interventions
targeted towards opiate users/IDUs, though a comparatively
small proportion of the population, may produce a major effect
on the health of the general population overall, especially in
cities. Moreover, we urge investment in standardized mortality
cohorts of opiate users across Europe and reliable estimates of
the prevalence of opiate use. These instruments will enable a
clearer comparison among countries of the scale of different
causes of death among problem drug users in order both to
monitor this important public health problem and to identify
sites which have reduced the risk of death and improved the
health of the population.

Key points
 The study estimates mortality rates of opiate users
in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Denmark, Dublin, Lisbon,
London, Rome, and Vienna.
 Mortality rates range from 1 per 100 person-years
in Dublin and London to 3.8 per 100 in Barcelona
and are 6–54 times higher than expected in the general
population.
 10–20% of adult mortality at ages 15–49 years is
attributable to opiate use.
 Public health interventions targeted towards opiate
users/IDUs may produce a major effect on the health
of the general population overall.
 Investment in mortality cohort studies among drug
users is required to monitor temporal and geographical
trends in overall and cause-specific mortality.
