Objectives:
 To determine
 all-cause
 and  speciﬁc-causes
 mortality,
 in  the  years
 1999–2008,  among
 opioid-
dependent
 users  treated
 at methadone
 maintenance
 treatment
 (MMT)
 clinics
 in  Israel
 and
 to
 compare
the
 obtained
 results  with  data  from  relevant
 studies
 worldwide.
Method:
 The
 records
 of  patients
 treated
 at MMT  units
 were
 linked
 to  the  nationwide
 database
 of  causes
of
 death.
 Information
 about  the  Israeli  general
 population
 from
 the  Central  Bureau
 of Statistics
 was  used
for
 comparison
 to  match
 sex  and  age  to  the  cohort
 under
 study.
 Crude
 mortality
 rates
 (CMRs)
 per 100
persons
 per
 year  (PY)
 and  standardized
 mortality
 ratios
 (SMRs)
 with  95%  conﬁdence
 intervals
 (CIs)
 were
calculated.
Results:
 The  overall  CMR  for  MMT  users  was
 1.49/100
 PY  (CI  1.40–1.59)
 and  was
 not  associated
 with
gender,
 age
 at  entering
 MMT,  ethnicity,
 and  immigrant
 status.  The
 leading
 causes
 of  mortality
 were
sudden/undeﬁned
 death  (0.31/100
 PY,  CI 0.26–0.35),
 overdose
 (0.22/100
 PY,  CI 0.17–0.27),
 and
 cancer
(0.15/100
 PY,  CI  0.12–0.18).
 The  MMT  users
 were
 12.2  times
 more
 likely  to  die  from
 all
 causes
 than
people
 from  the  general
 population.
 Overall,
 our  estimates
 were  comparable
 with  the  ﬁgures
 pooled
from
 relevant
 studies.
Conclusions:
 The
 results
 suggest
 that  the
 excess  mortality
 of MMT  users
 is associated
 with  an  increased
morbidity,
 which
 alone
 or  in  combination
 with  service-related
 risks,  lead  to  worse
 outcomes.

 Introduction
Opioid
 dependence
 is
 a
 chronic
 medical
 disorder
 characterized
by
 an
 individual’s
 inability
 to
 stop
 using
 opioids,
 despite
 the
 sig-
niﬁcant
 social
 and
 health
 harm
 caused
 by
 that
 misuse
 (American
Psychiatric
 Association,
 1994).
 Apart
 from
 increased
 criminal
behavior
 with
 subsequent
 imprisonment,
 typical
 problems
 of
 these
people
 are
 opioid
 overdose
 and
 increased
 morbidity
 associated
with
 intravenous
 injecting
 of
 the
 drug,
 such
 as
 immunosuppres-
sive/immunoproliferative
 infections:
 human
 immunodeﬁciency
virus
 (HIV;
 Shiels
 et
 al.,
 2010),
 hepatitis
 B
 virus
 and
 hepati-
tis
 C
 virus
 (HBV/HCV;
 Amin
 et
 al.,
 2006),
 and
 human
 papilloma
virus
 (HPV;
 Walboomers
 et
 al.,
 1999).
 As
 a
 result,
 mortality
 rates
among
 opioid-dependent
 people
 are
 higher
 than
 for
 the
 general
population,
 with
 some
 differences
 between
 countries
 and
 ethnic-
religious
 groups
 (Degenhardt
 et
 al.,
 2011).

 and
 respiratory

 (Albion

 are
 higher
 than
 in
 the
 general
 population.
A
 recent
 meta-analysis
 of
 58
 prospective
 cohort
 studies
 reported
standardized
 mortality
 ratios
 (SMRs)
 from
 opioid-dependent
 sam-
ples
 (Degenhardt
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 and
 computed
 the
 pooled
 SMR
as
 14.66,
 with
 overdose
 as
 the
 most
 common
 cause
 of
 death.
 A
prospective
 observational
 study
 in
 UK
 reported
 that
 opiate
 sub-
stitution
 treatment
 with
 methadone
 or
 buprenorphine
 in
 primary
care
 had
 a
 greater
 than
 85%
 chance
 of
 reducing
 overall
 mortal-
ity
 among
 opiate
 users
 if
 the
 average
 duration
 of
 the
 treatment
approaches
 or
 exceeds
 12
 months,
 despite
 the
 increased
 mortal-
ity
 risk
 at
 the
 start
 and
 immediately
 after
 stopping
 the
 treatment
program
 (Cornish
 et
 al.,
 2010).
Only
 one
 prospective
 study
 was
 conducted
 in
 Israel
 that
 exam-

 and
 causes
 of
 death
 among
 opioid
 users
 in
a
 methadone

 This
 study
 found

 The
 study
 also
 noted
 that
 mortality
 was
 associated
 with
pre-treatment
 severity
 of
 opioid
 dependence
 and
 comorbidities.
Because
 the
 single-center
 study
 had
 small
 sample-size
 and
 person-
years
 of
 observation,
 its
 ﬁndings
 are
 inconclusive
 at
 country-level.
Therefore,
 a
 study
 using
 data
 from
 all
 MMT
 centers
 in
 Israel
 would
provide
 more
 accurate
 information.
This
 study
 aimed
 (1)
 to
 determine
 all-cause
 mortality
 and
 spe-
ciﬁc
 causes
 of
 death
 of
 MMT
 users
 in
 Israel
 between
 1999
 and
 2008,
and
 (2)
 to
 examine
 how
 mortality
 rates
 vary
 by
 sex,
 age,
 ethnicity,
and
 immigrant
 status.
2.
 Method
2.1.
 Data
 sources
 and
 study
 sample
The
 number
 of
 MMT
 clinics
 in
 Israel
 comprises
 13.
 Records
 of
 patients
 who
 were
ever
 treated
 were
 collected
 from
 the
 different
 clinics.
 The
 identity
 of
 patients
 was
veriﬁed
 by
 comparison
 with
 the
 national
 population
 registry,
 which
 enabled
 veriﬁ-
cation
 and
 completion
 of
 sociodemographics
 (gender,
 age,
 ethnicity,
 and
 immigrant
status),
 and
 removal
 of
 duplicate
 records,
 since
 many
 patients
 were
 treated
 at
 more
than
 one
 facility.
 For
 2.5%
 of
 the
 records
 sent
 to
 the
 national
 population
 registry,
 a
match
 was
 not
 found,
 and
 they
 therefore
 did
 not
 enter
 the
 study.
 The
 study
 period
for
 mortality
 follow-up
 was
 from
 1999,
 when
 patient
 data
 was
 more
 complete
 and
reliable.
The
 sample
 consisted
 of
 patients
 who
 had
 ever
 been
 treated
 or
 were
 currently
 in
treatment
 in
 MMT
 clinics
 till
 2008.
 Total
 person
 years
 of
 follow-up
 were
 calculated
from
 the
 beginning
 of
 study
 (1999)
 or
 ﬁrst
 treatment
 (if
 after
 the
 beginning
 of
 1999)
till
 death
 or
 end
 of
 the
 study
 (2008)
 or
 age
 65.
 Maximum
 period
 of
 follow
 up
 was
thus
 10
 years.
The
 nationwide
 database
 of
 causes
 of
 death
 is
 under
 the
 responsibility
 of
 the
Central
 Bureau
 of
 Statistics
 (CBS).
 Since
 1998,
 causes
 of
 death
 were
 coded
 according
to
 the
 International
 Classiﬁcation
 of
 Diseases-Tenth
 Edition
 (ICD-10)
 (World
 Health
Organization,
 1993;
 see
 Goldberger
 et
 al.,
 2011).
Using
 deterministic
 record
 linkage
 design,
 the
 mortality
 records
 with
 causes
 of
death
 for
 the
 years
 of
 our
 study,
 1999–2008,
 were
 linked
 to
 the
 veriﬁed
 records
 of
MMT
 users,
 via
 their
 unique
 9-digit
 national
 identiﬁcation
 number,
 to
 ﬁnd
 those
who
 died
 and
 their
 cause
 of
 death.
2.2.
 Study
 variables
The
 outcome
 variable
 was
 all-cause
 death
 (incidence
 of
 mortality).
 Crude
 mor-
tality
 rates
 (CMRs)
 were
 calculated
 by
 age
 (grouped
 as:
 18–35,
 35–44,
 45–54,
 and
55–64)
 gender,
 ethnic
 group
 and
 immigrant
 status.
 Death
 rates
 were
 calculated
for
 all
 causes,  all
 natural
 and
 all
 external
 causes,  and
 largest
 subgroups
 for
 addicts,
natural:
 cancer
 (C00–C97),
 heart
 diseases
 (I00–I09,
 I11,
 I13,
 and
 I20–I51),
 viral
 hep-
atitis
 (B17–B19),
 chronic
 lower
 respiratory
 diseases
 (J40–J47),
 chronic
 liver
 disease
and
 cirrhosis
 (K73–K74
 and
 K70),
 psychoactive
 substance
 abuse
 (F10–F19)
 and
 sud-
den/undeﬁned
 cause
 of
 death
 (R96–R99);
 external:
 suicide
 (X60–X84
 and
 Y870),
homicide
 (X85–Y09
 and
 Y871),
 accidental
 drug
 poisoning
 (X40–X44),
 drug
 poison-
ing
 of
 undetermined
 intent
 (Y10–Y19),
 and
 other
 accidents
 or
 other
 external
 causes
(V01–X39,
 X45–X59,
 Y20–Y86,
 Y88–Y89,
 and
 Y872).
2.3.
 Data
 analysis
All
 data
 were
 linked
 and
 analyzed
 using
 SAS
 9.2
 (Cary,
 NC:
 SAS
 Institute
 Inc.).
Expected
 number
 of
 total
 and
 cause-speciﬁc
 deaths
 was
 calculated
 as
 the
 sum
 of
person
 years
 of
 treated
 subjects
 in
 each
 age
 group
 multiplied
 by
 the
 age
 speciﬁc
 rate
in
 the
 general
 population
 of
 Israel.
 SMRs
 were
 calculated
 by
 dividing
 the
 number
 of
observed
 deaths
 by
 the
 expected
 number
 of
 deaths.
 Calculation
 of
 95%
 conﬁdence
intervals
 (CIs)
 of
 SMRs
 was
 based
 on
 the
 assumption
 that
 the
 observed
 number
followed
 a
 Poisson
 distribution.
 Since
 the
 large
 majority
 of
 subjects
 were
 male,
 sex
pooled
 SMR
 analyses
 were
 used.
3.
 Results
The
 sample
 consisted
 of
 9,818
 individuals
 (86.1%
 male
 and
 79.8%
Jewish),
 who
 had
 ever
 been
 treated
 or
 were
 currently
 in
 treatment
in
 MMT
 clinics
 till
 2008
 (Table
 1).
 The
 immigrants
 and
 females
 were
younger
 than
 the
 non-immigrants
 and
 males,
 respectively.
 Their
total
 person-years
 of
 follow-up
 were
 64,225.
 The
 mean
 follow-up
time
 was
 6.54
 years
 (SD
 =
 3.31)
 and
 median
 follow-up
 time
 was
 7.13
years.
 The
 majority
 of
 participants
 (82%)
 began
 treatment
 before
age
 45,
 and
 21.8%
 were
 immigrants
 to
 Israel
 since
 1991.
 Of
 those
who  died
 more
 than
 60%
 were
 under
 treatment
 or
 within
 6
 months
of
 the
 last
 treatment,
 and
 only
 7.5%
 were
 more
 than
 5
 years
 from
the
 end
 of
 last
 treatment
 in
 the
 MMT
 program.

 characteristics.
 Over
 the
 10-year
 follow-up
 period,
there
 were
 960
 deaths.
 No

 were
 found
between
 the

 overall
 and
 by
 different
 causes
 of
 death.
The
 overall
 CMR
 for
 the
 MMT
 cohort
 was
 1.495
 per
 100
 PY.
 In
addition
 to
 deaths
 with
 an
 underlying
 cause
 directly
 related
 to
drug
 abuse—from
 liver
 disease,
 viral
 hepatitis,
 drug
 dependence,
and
 drug
 poisoning
 (accidental
 and
 undetermined
 intention),
accounting
 for
 30%
 of
 deaths,
 a
 further
 20%
 of
 deaths
 were
 sud-
den/undeﬁned
 deaths
 which
 could
 also
 be
 drug-related,
 and
 9%
were
 from
 suicide
 or
 homicide.

 Comparison
 with
 the
 general
 population
Table

 shows
 also
 that
 mortality
 was
 higher
 for
 all
 causes
amongst
 MMT
 users
 compared
 to
 the
 general
 population,
 with
 SMR
of
 12.2
 (95%
 CI
 11.4–13.0)
 for
 all
 deaths,
 and
 even
 higher
 (16.5,
 95%
CI
 14.6–18.3)
 for
 deaths
 from
 external
 causes.
 The
 highest
 SMR’s
as
 expected
 were
 for
 causes
 related
 to
 drug
 dependence.
 But
 other
natural
 causes
 with
 deaths
 about
 25
 times
 higher
 for
 MMT
 users
were
 chronic
 lower
 respiratory
 disease,
 liver
 disease,
 and
 sudden
or
 undeﬁned
 deaths.
 Suicide
 and
 homicide
 were
 also
 much
 higher,
while
 deaths
 from
 cancer
 and
 heart
 disease,
 while
 also
 higher,
 had
the
 lowest
 SMR’s,
 3.9
 and
 6.1,
 respectively.
 Results
 are

 pre-
sented
 for

 deaths,
 since
 there
 were
 only
 15
 cases
 amongst
 MMT

 Discussion
4.1.
 Comparison
 with
 the
 general
 population
As
 expected,
 a
 signiﬁcant
 proportion
 of
 mortality
 of
 those
 in
MMT  treatment
 was
 due
 to
 causes
 directly
 or
 indirectly
 connected
with
 their
 drug
 usage.
 The
 SMR
 for
 viral
 hepatitis,
 in
 particular,
associated
 with
 intravenous
 injecting
 of
 the
 drug,
 is
 very
 high,
since
 it
 is
 rare
 among
 the
 general
 population,
 as,
 for
 example,
was
 reported
 in
 a
 cohort
 study
 that
 prevalence
 of
 viral
 infec-
tions,
 HIV,
 HBV
 and
 HCV
 were
 signiﬁcantly
 more
 common
 among
injecting
 drug
 users
 compared
 to
 native
 Israelis
 (Loebstein
 et
 al.,
2008).
 Other
 excess
 mortality
 from
 natural
 causes
 suggests
 either
an
 increased
 morbidity
 (Lawrence
 et
 al.,
 2010)
 or
 a
 worse-case
 out-
come,
 even
 if
 incidence
 is
 not
 increased.
 High
 risk
 behaviour
 of
more
 tobacco
 and
 alcohol
 involvement
 than
 the
 general
 population
was
 reported
 in
 case–control
 studies
 using
 convenience
 samples
of
 heroin-dependent
 Jewish
 men
 (Neumark
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Isralowitz
et
 al.,
 2001).
A
 recent
 study
 in
 Israel
 (Grinshpoon
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 reported
increased
 compared
 to
 the
 general
 population,
 cancer
 morbidity
among
 MMT
 users,
 with
 higher
 age-standardized
 incidence
 ratio
for
 lung,
 larynx
 and
 liver
 cancers
 among
 Jewish
 men
 and
 for
 cervix
uteri
 cancer
 among
 Jewish
 women.
 Another
 possible
 explanation
for
 the
 excess
 mortality
 of
 opioid
 users
 from
 natural
 causes
 is
service-related
 risks,
 i.e.,
 barriers
 for
 receiving
 appropriate
 and
timely
 medical
 care
 and
 poor
 recognizing
 and
 treatment
 of
 physi-
cal
 conditions
 which
 they
 share
 in
 common
 with
 people
 suffering
from
 other
 mental
 disorders
 (Kisely
 et
 al.,
 2007;
 Haklai
 et
 al.,
 in
press).
Higher
 mortality
 from
 external
 causes
 of
 homicide,
 suicide,
 and
accident
 suggests
 that
 opioid
 users
 are
 substantially
 exposed
 to
risk-taking
 behaviors
 other
 than
 actually
 taking
 drugs,
 such
 as
having
 unprotected
 sex,
 gambling,
 robbing,
 committing
 an
 act
 of
aggression
 or
 violence.
 The
 reasons
 for
 these
 behaviors
 are
 com-
plex,
 but
 the
 major
 motive
 for
 risk
 takers
 is
 gratiﬁcation
 from
 the
danger
 involved
 in
 these
 antisocial
 activities.
 Antisocial
 risk
 takers
generally
 have
 a
 socially
 negative
 outlook
 and
 repeatedly
 engage
 in
activities
 that
 society
 perceives
 as
 abnormal
 and
 leading
 to
 violence
and
 self-destruction
 (Wilson
 et
 al.,
 2002).
4.2.
 International
 comparisons
Our
 overall
 CMR
 (1.50)
 was
 somewhat
 lower
 than
 the
 pooled
CMR
 reported
 (Degenhardt
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 for
 57
 cohorts
 across
 the
world
 (2.09),
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 limit
 of
 our
 follow
 up
 to
 age
 65.
The
 overall
 SMR
 in
 our
 study
 (12.20)
 also
 was
 lower
 than
 the
 pooled
SMR
 (14.66).
 Cause
 speciﬁc
 mortality
 rates
 were
 also
 similar
 except
for
 drug
 overdose,
 which
 was
 much
 lower.
 But
 if
 deaths
 coded
 as
sudden
 or
 unknown
 cause
 of
 death,
 likely
 also
 to
 be
 due
 to
 drug
overdose
 (CMR
 =
 0.30/100
 PY),
 are
 added
 to
 those
 from
 drug
 over-
dose
 (CMR
 =
 0.33/100
 PY),
 the
 total
 is
 almost
 identical
 to
 that
 of
 the
pooled
 estimate
 (CMR
 =
 0.65/100
 PY).
 Amongst
 natural
 causes,
 the
SMR
 for
 cancer
 was
 considerably
 higher
 in
 Israel.
4.3.
 Factors
 associated
 with
 mortality
The
 relatively
 increased
 risk
 of
 mortality
 for
 males
 was
 simi-
lar
 to
 the
 pooled
 results
 from
 33
 cohorts
 (Degenhardt
 et
 al.,
 2011)
and
 probably
 reﬂects
 the
 younger
 age
 of
 females.
 We  did
 not
ﬁnd
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 mortality
 among
 Israeli-Arabs
 or
 recent
immigrants,
 although
 general
 death
 rates
 are
 considerably
 higher
amongst
 Israeli-Arabs
 (Gal
 et
 al.,
 2012),
 and
 a
 recent
 epidemi-
ological
 study
 found
 that
 mortality
 among
 former
 Soviet
 Union
immigrants
 (who
 form
 the
 majority
 of
 recent
 immigrants)
 from
external
 causes
 and
 cancer
 considerably
 exceeded
 that
 of
 the
 host
country
 (Ott
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 The
 increased
 risk
 of
 mortality
 seems
higher
 for
 Jews
 and
 Others
 than
 Israeli-Arabs.
 The
 younger
 average
age
 of
 the
 new
 immigrant
 group
 might
 account
 for
 their
 relatively
low
 rates.

 Strengths
 and
 limitations
The
 strengths
 of
 this
 study
 are:
 (1)
 the
 representative
 sample
that
 covered
 all
 opioid
 users
 treated
 in
 all
 MMT
 centers
 in
 Israel
from
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 1990s.
 (2)
 Coding
 causes
 of
 death
 were
coded
 according
 to
 ICD-10,
 which
 helps
 eliminate
 inconsistencies
in
 recording
 drug
 related
 deaths.
 (3)
 Calculation
 of
 all-cause
 and
cause-speciﬁc
 CMRs
 and
 SMRs
 enabling
 future
 international
 com-
parisons.
Our
 study
 was
 limited
 since
 our
 data
 on
 dates
 of
 treatment
episodes
 was
 not
 sufﬁciently
 exact
 to
 compute
 in
 and
 out
 of
 treat-
ment
 rates,
 to
 conﬁrm
 the
 ﬁnding
 of
 higher
 out
 of
 treatment
mortality
 rates
 (Peles
 et
 al.,
 2010;
 Haklai
 et
 al.,
 in
 press).
 Our
 follow-
up
 period
 was
 also
 a
 maximum
 of
 10
 years,
 which
 did
 not
 enable
study
 of
 treated
 patients
 of
 older
 ages—we
 limited
 the
 study
 to
those
 aged
 fewer
 than
 65
 since
 so
 few
 were
 older.
4.5.
 Conclusions
Our
 study
 shows
 much
 higher
 mortality
 rates
 amongst
 MMT
users
 than
 the
 general
 population,
 similar
 to
 results
 found
 in
 other
studies.
 The
 excess
 mortality
 from
 natural
 causes
 may
 be
 associ-
ated
 with
 increased
 morbidity,
 which
 alone
 or
 in
 combination
 with
service-related
 risks,
 lead
 to
 worse-case
 outcomes.
