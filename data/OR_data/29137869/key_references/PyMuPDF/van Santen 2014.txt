Objectives: We aimed to identify temporal trends in all-cause and cause-speciﬁc
mortality rates among people who use drugs (PWUD) compared with the general
Dutch population and to determine whether mortality trends differed by hepatitis C
virus (HCV)/HIV (co) infection status.
Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Methods: Using data from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies among 1254 PWUD (1985–
2012), all-cause and cause-speciﬁc standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calcu-
lated; SMRs were stratiﬁed by serological group (HCV/HIV-uninfected, HCV-mono-
infected, and HCV/HIV-coinfected) and calendar period. Temporal trends were
estimated using Poisson regression.
Results: The overall all-cause SMR was 13.9 (95% conﬁdence interval 12.6–15.3). The
SMR signiﬁcantly declined after 1996, especially due to a decline among women
(P < 0.001). The highest SMR was observed among HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals
during 1990–1996 (SMR 61.9, 95% conﬁdence interval 50.4–76.0), which signiﬁ-
cantly declined after this period among women (P ¼ 0.001). In contrast, SMR for HCV-
monoinfected, and HCV/HIV-uninfected PWUD did not signiﬁcantly change over time.
The SMR for non-natural deaths signiﬁcantly declined (P ¼ 0.007), whereas the SMR for
HIV-related deaths was the highest during all calendar periods.
Conclusions: We found evidence for declining all-cause mortality among PWUD
compared with the general population rates. Those with HCV/HIV-coinfection showed
the highest SMR. The decline in the SMR seems to be attributable to the decline in
mortality among women. Mortality rates due to non-natural deaths came closer to those
of the general population over time. However, HIV-related deaths remain an important
cause of mortality among PWUD when compared with the general Dutch population.
This study reinforces the importance of harm-reduction interventions and HCV/HIV
treatment to reduce mortality among PWUD.

Introduction
People who use drugs (PWUD) are at an increased risk of
premature mortality compared with the general popu-
lation. In the Netherlands, the start of a major heroin
epidemic
occurred
during
the
1970s
[1,2].
The
prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) peaked during
the 1980s, when more than 85% of ever-injectors tested
HCV-positive [3,4]. The HIV epidemic commenced
during the 1980s [5,6]. In 1985, the prospective
Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) among PWUD were
initiated to track the HIV epidemic [5].
To minimize the damage PWUD inﬂict upon themselves
and society, harm-reduction interventions were imple-
mented in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 1979,
making it one of the ﬁrst countries to do so [7,8]. These
included methadone programs and needle exchange
programs (NEPs) [7,8]. Especially, the combination of
methadone programs and NEP uptake has been associated
with a lower risk of HIV and HCV acquisition among
people who inject drugs (PWID) [9]. For HIV-infected
individuals, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)
became widely available from 1996, which has been
shown to substantially reduce HIV-related mortality [10–
12]. However, HIV-infected PWID tend to initiate
cART at a later stage than other risk groups [13], leading
to a diminished probability of survival [14–16]. For
HCV-infected PWUD, HCV treatment became rela-
tively easy to access in Amsterdam from 2005, when a
special unit was launched to treat HCV-infected PWUD
[17], and might have reduced liver-related mortality,
which generally requires two to three decades of chronic
HCV infection [18].
Previous studies have shown that PWUD have a 4.4–47.6
higher risk of dying than the general population [19–24].
This increased risk of dying differs between studies and
countries, which could be ascribed to differences in
calendar period of follow-up, study population charac-
teristics, drug-use practices, HIV/HCV incidence and
background prevalence, and availability and uptake of
harm-reduction interventions [20].
As the ACS have reached 27 years of follow-up, which is
one of longest worldwide, we had the unique oppor-
tunity to identify changes in mortality rates over different
calendar periods. Trends in mortality rates can serve as a
proxy for changing health patterns and the effectiveness of
health-related interventions that have been implemented.
We hypothesized that because of the introduction and
availability of harm-reduction interventions and HCV
and HIV therapy, PWUD have reached mortality rates
closer to those of the general Dutch population in recent
calendar periods. Our study aimed to identify temporal
trends in all-cause and cause-speciﬁc mortality rates
among PWUD compared with the general Dutch
population; and to determine whether excess mortality
trends differed by HCV/HIV status.
Methods
Study population
The ACS among (injecting and non-injecting) PWUD is
an open, prospective cohort study initiated in 1985,
aiming to investigate the epidemiology, natural history,
and pathogenesis of HIV, and to evaluate the effect of
interventions. Participation in the ACS is voluntary and
written informed consent is obtained at intake [25].
Recruitment is by means of local methadone outposts, a
sexually transmitted diseases clinic, and word of mouth.
PWUD visit the Public Health Service of Amsterdam
every 4–6 months; they give blood and complete a
standardized questionnaire about their health and sexual
and drug use behavior during each cohort visit. To
encourage continued participation, 12 Euros were paid
per follow-up visit. Participants, aged between 20 and 64
years with at least two cohort visits and with both
longitudinal HCVand HIV test results (1254/1661), were
included in our study. This study was approved by the
Medical Ethical Committee of the Amsterdam Medical
Centre, the Netherlands.
Laboratory methods
At entry, the ACS participants were tested for HIV
antibodies by ELISA and at every follow-up visit if
previously negative. In 2005, participants with at least two
cohort visits between December 1985 and January 2005
were retrospectively tested for HCV antibodies with a
third-generation ELISA (AxSym HCV version 3.0;
Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). Individuals who were
anti-HCV-negative at entry were tested for HCV
antibodies at the most recent visit. On ﬁnding HCV
seroconversion
(deﬁned
as
the
presence
of
HCV
antibodies in a previously HCV-seronegative individual),
we tested samples between the ﬁrst and the most recent
visit to obtain the most exact seroconversion interval.
From 2005 onwards, HCV testing occurred prospec-
tively.
Deﬁnitions and statistics
Information about vital status was obtained by matching
the ACS data at regular intervals against the municipal
and national population registries in the Netherlands.
Causes of death (CODs) were systematically obtained
from hospital records, general practitioners, the national
HIV Monitoring Foundation, or coroners. The CODs
were divided into four categories: HIV-related deaths;
liver-related deaths; natural causes other than HIV or
liver-related deaths (e.g. cardiovascular-related deaths,
non-AIDS-related cancers); and non-natural causes (i.e.
overdose, accidents, homicide, and suicide).

Follow-up time was calculated from the ﬁrst cohort visit
until: loss to follow-up, last known date to be alive, death,
or cohort censoring date (i.e. 31 December 2012).
Calendar periods were deﬁned as follows: period 1
(1985–1989) – pre-cART and before adequate metha-
done dose (60mg/day) was generally available in
Amsterdam; period 2 (1990–1996) – pre-cART with
adequate methadone substitution therapy; period 3
(1997–2000) – early cART era; period 4 (2001–2005)
– late cARTera; period 5 (2006–2012) – late cART and
HCV treatment era.
Four HCV/HIV serological groups were deﬁned: HCV/
HIV-uninfected,
HIV-monoinfected,
HCV-monoin-
fected, and HCV/HIV-coinfected. HIV and HCV status
were treated as time-dependent variables. For HIV and
HCV seroconverters, the midpoint between the last
negative and the ﬁrst positive antibody test was used to
estimate the moment of seroconversion. After the last
cohort visit, the serological group was carried forward
until the end of follow-up. In a sensitivity analysis, a more
stringent censoring strategy was applied (i.e. censoring
took place at the end of the calendar period of the last
cohort visit) to check whether results were robust.
Crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 1000 person-years,
including 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs), were calcu-
lated. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to
compare the mortality rate among the PWUD with the
mortality rate in the general Dutch population. SMR is
the ratio of the observed deaths among PWUD from the
ACS and the expected number of deaths. Expected deaths
were calculated by multiplying the person-years accrued
from our study population by the mortality rate of the
general Dutch population matched by age group, sex, and
calendar period.
Mortality rates of the general Dutch population were
obtained from the Human Mortality Database (HMD)
(www.mortality.org), and the numbers of deaths per
COD
were
obtained
from
Statistics
Netherlands
(www.cbs.nl). To calculate the mortality rate of the
general Dutch population per calendar period, age group,
and sex, the following formula was used:
MR ¼ Total deathsGP  Total deathsACS
mPopulationGP  PopulationACS
where MR is the mortality rate; GP the general popu-
lation; and m the average.
The SMRs for each calendar period, serological group,
and COD were calculated using univariable Poisson
regression models with the natural logarithm of the
expected deaths as offset term; the exponential of the
coefﬁcient of the Poisson model is the SMR. Multi-
variable Poisson models, with the same offset term, were
used to obtain the effect of calendar period and
serological group on the SMR and are expressed in
SMR ratios; SMR ratios can be interpreted as a relative
SMR. P values for trends were obtained from the
multivariable models. Multivariable models were cor-
rected for age group, sex and serological group. We
additionally checked for interactions between calendar
period and the other covariates. For the calculation of
the SMR per cause of death, PWUD were included in
the analysis irrespective of their HCV/HIV status. Stata
version 11.2 was used (Stata Statistical Software: Release
11; Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas, USA).
Results
Out of 1254 PWUD, at entry, 63.9% (n ¼ 801) were men,
their median age was 30 years [interquartile range (IQR)
26–36], and 72.4% (n ¼ 908) had ever injected drugs
(Table 1). The median follow-up time was 15.0 years
(IQR 9.5–20.9). At the study entry, the proportion of
those who ever injected was similar among those included
(i.e. at least two cohort visits) and excluded in this study.
However, individuals included in our study were older,
more often of Dutch nationality, less often homeless and a
higher proportion of them were men compared to the
excluded PWUD.
The characteristics and demographical distribution of
PWUD changed across the calendar periods (Table 1).
During the ﬁrst calendar period, 82.4% of PWUD were
aged between 20 and 34 years compared with only 11.9%
in the most recent calendar period. The percentage of
participants who ever injected drugs or injected drugs
during the calendar period decreased over time. During
the ﬁrst calendar period, 20.2% were HCV/HIV-
uninfected, 1.3% HIV-monoinfected, 52.3% HCV-
monoinfected,
and
26.3%
HCV/HIV-coinfected.
During the latest calendar period, 38.8% were HCV/
HIV-uninfected,
1.8%
HIV-monoinfected,
45.6%
HCV-monoinfected, and 13.9% HCV/HIV-coinfected.
During 18 575 person-years of total follow-up time, 96
PWUD seroconverted for HIV and 54 for HCV.
Overall mortality rates
Among 1254 PWUD, 406 deaths were observed during
the study period. The overall CMR for all-cause
mortality was 21.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI
19.8–24.1). The overall effect of calendar period on the
CMR was signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.003) (Table 2). The highest
CMR was observed between 1990 and 1996 (27.5 per
1000 person-years; 95% CI 23.1–32.6) (Table 2). The
CMR declined from 27.5 in 1990–1996 to 17.4 in
2001–2005, and was followed by a slight increase to 23.7
in the period 2006–2012 (Fig. 1a).
The overall SMR was 13.9 (95% CI 12.6–15.3),
meaning that drug users from the ACS had a 13.9 times
higher mortality rate compared with the age, sex, and

calender-matched general Dutch population. During
1985–1990, the SMR was 15.8 (95% CI 9.7–25.9), it
increased to 25.5 (95% CI 21.5–30.3) in 1990–1996,
followed by a decline to 14.1 (95% CI 11.2–17.8) in
1997–2000, 9.9 (95% CI 7.9–12.3) in 2001–2005, and
10.8 (95% CI 9.0–13.1) in 2006–2012 (Fig. 1b, Table 3).
The SMR decreased with increasing age (SMR20–34 ¼
22.9, 95% CI 18.7–28.2; SMR35–49 ¼ 15.5, 95% CI
13.7–17.5; SMR50–64 ¼ 7.3, 95% CI 5.8–9.3) and was
higher among women (SMRmen ¼ 12.8, 95% CI 11.3–
14.4; SMRwomen ¼ 16.6, 95% CI 14.0–19.6).
In multivariable analysis, a signiﬁcant interaction between
calendar period and sex (P ¼ 0.03) was observed. The
SMR signiﬁcantly decreased in later calendar periods
among women [adjusted SMR ratio (aSMRr)2006–2012¼
0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.9, compared to 1990–1996; P < 0.001]
(Table 3), while remaining stable among men. HCV-
monoinfected(aSMRr ¼ 1.9,95%CI1.4–2.8)andHCV/
HIV-coinfected (aSMRr¼ 7.0, 95% CI 5.0–9.8) PWUD
had a signiﬁcantly higher SMR compared with HCV/
HIV-uninfected PWUD (P < 0.001) (Table 3).

Although the overall effect of calendar period was not
signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.16), the CMR for HCV/HIV-unin-

onwards (Fig. 1c, Table 2). The overall SMR was 4.7

(95% CI 3.5–6.5) (Table 3). As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the
SMR slightly increased after 2000, although the overall
effect of calendar period was not statistically signiﬁcant in
multivariable analysis (P ¼ 0.54) (Table 3).
HIV-monoinfected people who use drugs
The overall CMR for HIV-monoinfected PWUD was
37.9 (95% CI 19.0–75.9) (Table 2) and the overall SMR
was 26.3 (95% CI 13.2–52.6). Given the small number of
HIV-monoinfected PWUD and deaths among them, the
SMRs per calendar period were not calculated for them.
Hepatitis C virus-monoinfected people who use drugs
The CMR for HCV-monoinfected PWUD was border-
line signiﬁcantly different across the calendar periods
(P ¼ 0.05) and was the highest between 2006 and 2012
(CMR ¼ 22.7, 95% CI 17.1–30.0) (Fig. 1c, Table 2). The
overall SMR was 9.5 (95% CI 8.1–11.3) (Table 3). As
illustrated in Fig. 1d, the SMR decreased until 2001–
2005 and was followed by a slight increase in 2006–2012,
although the overall effect of calendar period was not
statistically
signiﬁcant
in
the
multivariable
analysis
(P ¼ 0.23) (Table 3).
Hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected people who use drugs
The CMR for HCV/HIV-coinfected PWUD signiﬁ-
cantly differed across the calendar periods (P ¼ 0.03) and
was the highest between 1990 and 1996 (CMR ¼ 67.5,
95% CI 55.0–82.9), which is also the highest CMR
observed in this study (Fig. 1c, Table 2). The CMR for
HCV/HIV-coinfected PWUD was more than twice that
of the CMR for all PWUD and had a pattern similar to
the CMR for all PWUD over time (Fig. 1a and c, Table
2). The overall SMR was 35.9 (95% CI 31.5–41.0) (Table
3). HCV/HIV-coinfected PWUD had the highest SMR
during all calendar periods compared with the other
serological groups and especially during the period 1990–
1996 (SMR ¼ 61.9, 95% CI 50.4–76.0) (Fig. 1d). As
illustrated in Fig. 1d, the SMR declined after 1990–1996
and remained stable in the two most recent periods. In
multivariable analysis, the effect of calendar period was
signiﬁcantly different among women and men (P ¼ 0.03).
Among women, the SMR was signiﬁcantly lower in the
last three calendar periods compared with 1990–1996
(P < 0.001), whereas the SMR remained relatively stable
over time among men (Table 3).
Mortality per cause of death
The most common CODs were natural deaths (n ¼ 111),
followed by non-natural (n ¼ 107), HIV-related (n ¼ 87),
and liver-related deaths (n ¼ 30).
Natural causes
The CMR for natural deaths signiﬁcantly increased over
time (P ¼ 0.001) – from 1.7 (95% CI 0.4–6.7) between
1985 and 1989 to 10.0 (95% CI 7.5–13.4) between 2006
and 2012 (Fig. 1e, Table 2). The overall SMR was 5.0
(95% CI 4.1–6.0) and was the lowest of the cause-speciﬁc
Standardized mortality ratios in people using drugs van Santen et al.

SMR. As illustrated in Fig. 1f, the SMR for natural causes
decreased after 1990–1996 (Fig. 1f), although the overall
effect of calendar period was not signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.38)
(Table 4).
Non-natural causes
In contrast to the CMR for natural causes, the CMR for
non-natural deaths signiﬁcantly decreased over time
(P ¼ 0.001) – from 9.2 (95% CI 5.1–16.6) in 1985–1989
to 3.0 (95% CI 1.8–5.1) in 2006–2012 (Fig. 1e, Table 2).
The overall SMR for non-natural deaths was 21.3 (95%
CI 17.6–25.7), and we observed a steady decline of the
SMR over time (P ¼ 0.007) (Fig. 1f, Table 4).
HIV-related causes
The CMR for HIV-related deaths reached its peak in the
period 1990–1996 (CMR ¼ 11.0, 95% CI 8.4–14.4),
followed by a statistically signiﬁcant decline after 1996
(P < 0.001) (Fig. 1e, Table 2). The overall SMR was
798.2 (95% CI 647.0–984.9). As illustrated in Fig. 1f, we
observed a higher HIV-related SMR after 1990, although
the overall effect of calendar period was not signiﬁcant in
the multivariable analysis for
men (P ¼ 0.30) and
bordeline signﬁcant for women (P ¼ 0.06) (Table 4).
Liver-related causes
The overall CMR for liver-related deaths was 1.6 (95%
CI 1.1–2.3) and did not signiﬁcantly differ across the
calendar periods (P ¼ 0.38) (Table 2). The overall SMR
for liver-related deaths was 72.4 (95% CI 50.6–103.5). As
illustrated in Fig. 1f, the SMR for liver-related deaths
decreased after 2000, although the overall effect of
calendar period was not signiﬁcant in the multivariable
analysis (P ¼ 0.11) (Table 4).
Finally, in a sensitivity analysis with a more stringent
censoring strategy, comparable results were observed.
Discussion
We investigated whether mortality among PWUD from
the ACS has come closer to that of the general Dutch
population in recent calendar periods. As hypothesized,
we observed a decline in mortality among PWUD
compared with the general Dutch population after 1996.
However, despite this decline, mortality rates among
PWUD are still 11 times higher than those of the general
population in the most recent calendar period. Of
interest, mortality due to non-natural deaths came closer
to the general Dutch population over time.
The decline in the SMR among PWUD seems to be
mainly attributable to the decline in mortality after 1996
among HCV/HIV-coinfected women; this is in line with
a study among PWID in Norway, which showed that
compared to men, women had a lower risk of mortality in
the long term, although in the short term – within 3 years
of inclusion in the study –, women had a higher risk of
mortality [26]. One explanation for
the
different
mortality trends among men and women might be that
women sought HIV and/or drug treatment earlier than
men and were less likely to be imprisoned [26].
Furthermore, the decline among HCV/HIV-coinfected
PWUD might be explained by the availability of cART
from 1996 onwards. In line with our ﬁndings, a study
among HIV seroconverters showed that overall and
cause-speciﬁc mortality rates decreased after the intro-
duction of cART [27]. However, the beneﬁts of cART
appeared to be less pronounced for PWUD than for
MSM [27]. Nonetheless, cART availability alone cannot
explain the decrease of the SMR observed, as a more
constant SMR would be expected because the positive
effects of cART have also reduced mortality among HIV-
infected individuals in the general Dutch population.
Hence, the decline of the SMR after 1996 is also likely to
be attributable to the signiﬁcant decline in non-natural
deaths over time. This is in contrast to the ﬁndings from

the 2008 Annual Report by the European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in which a
rebound of overdose mortality was observed in many
European countries from 2003 to 2005 [28]. The
observed decline in non-natural deaths in our study
could be explained by a decrease in the popularity of
injecting drug use in Amsterdam over time [29,30].
During 2006–2012, only 26.9% of the ACS participants
injected drugs compared with 77.6% during 1985–1989.
Also, PWID might have become safer injectors over time,
reducing the risk of overdose. These changes in injecting
risk behavior could be ascribed to harm-reduction
interventions and demographical changes, as recently
demonstrated in our modeling study [31]. To summarize,
a
combination
of
factors
such
as
availability
of
comprehensive harm-reduction interventions, HIV and
HCV therapy and changing drug patterns among
PWUD probably led to the reduction in mortality
observed in the present study, especially among HCV/
HIV-coinfected
women.
In
addition,
HIV-infected
PWUD who survived the pre-cART period might have
been the PWUD exhibiting less risk behavior and the
lowest risk of dying.
Of interest, the HIV-related CMR among PWUD
signiﬁcantly and substantially decreased after 1996,
whereas the HIV-related SMR did not signiﬁcantly
change over time. HIV-related mortality is dependent on
the incidence and prevalence of HIV in a population.
Therefore, given our higher proportion of HIV-infected
PWUD compared with the general Dutch population, as
expected, we observed a high HIV-related SMR.
However, even though the proportion of HIV-infected
PWUD in our study population decreased over calendar
time, no decrease was observed in the HIV-related SMR.
Therefore, the HIV-related mortality in the general
Dutch population probably decreased at a faster rate than
it did for PWUD from the ACS. HCV-coinfection,
which is common among our study population, might
play a role as it has been shown that HCV/HIV-
coinfected individuals have a higher risk of death from
HIV/AIDS than HIV-monoinfected individuals [12,32].
Also, even though the beneﬁts of cART have been
observed in all risk groups [33], the HIV-positive
individuals from exposure groups other than PWUD
might have easier access to care, be more adherent to
cART, have a better socioeconomic status, and a healthier
lifestyle.
In line with the two studies [22,34] we found that HCV/
HIV-coinfected PWUD have a higher SMR than HIV-
monoinfected and HCV-monoinfected PWUD. Our
overall SMR (35.9) for HCV/HIV coinfection was
higher than the SMR (12.8) described by Hernando et al.
[22], but was very similar to the ﬁndings by McDonald
et al. (34.0) [34]. The difference in SMR between the
studies might be explained by differences in the study
period. Hernando et al.’s study comprises data from the
cARTera (1997–2010), whereas both our and McDonald
et al.’s study had follow-up both during the pre-cART
and the cART era [22,34].
The SMR for liver-related deaths did not signiﬁcantly
change over time. This could be attributed to an increase
in liver-related deaths in the general Dutch population
[35]. Furthermore, HCV/HIV-coinfected PWUD might
have died of HIV-related causes before experiencing the
consequences of HCV [4]. However, the burden of
HCV-related disease among PWUD in our study was
made visible by the increased liver-related CMR during
the latest calendar period.
We found that the CMR for natural causes signiﬁcantly
increased over time. This can be partly explained by
ageing of our cohort participants and the lower risk of
HIV-related mortality among PWUD in the cART era.
However, if CODs are misclassiﬁed (i.e. underlying HCV
and HIV-related cause of death is not recognized), this
might contribute to the increasing CMR for natural
deaths. Nevertheless, the SMR for natural causes did not
signiﬁcantly change over time.
Several limitations of our study should be mentioned.
First, even though we adjusted for age group, sex,
calendar period, and serological group, other determi-
nants, such as active drug use, alcohol consumption,
hepatitis B, or smoking, were not taken into account.
Second, PWUD who were ever positive for HCV
antibodies were considered HCV-positive for the whole
study period, thus spontaneous or treatment-induced
HCV clearance was not taken into account. Although
the minority, especially in HCV/HIV-coinfected indi-
viduals, clears the virus spontaneously, this deﬁnition of
HCV positivity might have led to an underestimation of
the SMR for PWUD with a chronic HCV infection.
However, active PWID who clear the virus are at risk
of HCV re-infection. Third, although coverage and
components of harm-reduction interventions changed
during the study period, they were already implemented
before the ACS started; therefore we do not have a
proper comparison with a period without such inter-
ventions. Furthermore, our sample of PWUD might
not be representative for the general PWUD Dutch
population.
In conclusion, in line with our hypothesis, signiﬁcant
declines in all-cause and non-natural morality rates were
observed among PWUD compared with the general
Dutch population. Women with an HCV/HIV coin-
fection contributed to the decline in the all-cause SMR
over time. However, PWUD are still at an increased risk
of dying even when uninfected with HCVand HIV. Our
results also suggest that, despite the availability of cART,
HIV-related deaths remain an important cause of
mortality among PWUD when compared with the
general Dutch population. This study reinforces the
