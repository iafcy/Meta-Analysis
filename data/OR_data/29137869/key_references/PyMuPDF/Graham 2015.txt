Background: Mortality is known to be extremely high among people who have been imprisoned, but there is
limited information about the factors that explain this increased risk. Methods: Standard record linkage methods
were used to link Scottish prison records and mortality data for all individuals imprisoned in Scotland for the first
time between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2007. Results: Among 76 627 individuals there were 4414 deaths
(3982 in men). When compared with the general population, the age-standardized mortality rate ratio for those
imprisoned was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3) for women. Further adjustment for an area measure
of deprivation accounted for part but not all of this excess risk [adjusted rate ratio 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2)
for men and women, respectively]. Relative risks were highest for drug and alcohol related causes, suicide and
homicide and were markedly higher among women than men. Out of prison deaths were most frequent in the
first 2 weeks after release from prison. Mortality rates were lower in those with longer total duration in prison and
higher in those with multiple short episodes in prison. Conclusion: People who have been imprisoned in Scotland
experience substantial excess mortality from a range of causes that is only partly explained by deprivation. The
association of increased mortality with multiple periods in prison and the concentration of deaths in the early
period after prison release both have implications for policy and practice.

Introduction
P
eople who have been imprisoned experience much higher all-
cause mortality than the general population, largely due to
their increased risk of death from suicide, drug misuse and
alcohol.1 There is conflicting evidence about mortality experience
while in prison, with some studies finding increased all-cause
mortality compared with the general population2–4 and others
similar5 or reduced6–8 levels. However, there is consistent evidence
that mortality outside prison is substantially higher than that in the

general population, particularly during the first few weeks after
release.1,3,9–14 Prisoners are more likely to come from a deprived
area than the non-prison population,15 but it is not clear whether
this accounts for their increased mortality rates. Multiple episodes of
imprisonment have been associated with a chaotic lifestyle and
possibly with increased mortality, but there is limited evidence
about whether total duration of imprisonment5,16 or the numbers
of episodes in prison16–18 are the most relevant.
Our objectives were to examine the mortality of people who had
been imprisoned in Scotland: to describe the pattern of causes
of death; to examine the relative contribution of length and
numbers of episodes of imprisonment and to estimate the contribu-
tion of socioeconomic status (using an area measure of deprivation
as a proxy) to excess mortality.
Methods
We used a retrospective cohort design to examine mortality among
those imprisoned in Scotland for the first time between 1996 and
2007. Data on those imprisoned in Scotland at any time between 1
January 1996 and 31 December 2007 were extracted from the
Scottish Prison Service databases (PR1 and PR2), including dates
of
imprisonment,
age
at
first
imprisonment,
marital
status,
religion and ethnic group. Postcode of residence prior to imprison-
ment was used to derive the Carstairs index, an area based measure
of deprivation.19 The Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS
National Services Scotland routinely obtains data on all deaths in
Scotland from the National Records of Scotland (NRS). Linkage of
the prisoner dataset to these death records (using probabilistic
linkage methods) was used to identify all those who had died up
to 31 December 2007. Personal identifiers were removed to produce
an anonymized analysis dataset. The sample size was based on data
availability so a power calculation was not carried out.
Carstairs deprivation scores were divided into quintiles based on
the whole Scottish population. The total time spent in prison was
grouped into eight categories: <11 days; 11–28 days, 29–54 days,
55–109 days; 110–219 days; 220–447 days; 448–910 days and 911
and more days. The period of first imprisonment was grouped into
3-year periods: 1996–98; 1999–2001; 2002–04 and 2005–07. Causes
of death were examined by chapter groupings from the International
Classification of Disease, 9th revision (for deaths prior to 2000) and
10th revision (for subsequent deaths). Drug and alcohol related
deaths were examined separately using the ICD9 and ICD10 codes
shown in Table 3. Place of death (in or out of prison) was derived
using the incarceration and death dates. Cases with missing data for
a specific variable were excluded from analyses using that variable.
The linked dataset was used to calculate indirectly standardized
mortality ratios (SMRs) for the prison cohort for men and women
separately using a person-years approach which took account of
the
time
each
individual
spent
in
different
age
categories.
The whole Scottish population was used as the reference standard.
For the deprivation-adjusted analyses the 2001 Carstairs quintile
population estimates by age-band and sex were assigned across the
whole period. All-cause and disease-specific SMRs were calculated
for men and women, adjusting for age (in 5-year bands) and for
Carstairs index quintile. Those with missing postcode (and therefore
Carstairs) information were assigned to the most deprived quintile.
A sensitivity analysis was carried out excluding all those with missing
postcodes. SMRs were calculated separately for deaths occurring
in and out of prison using the person-years method described
earlier. Poisson regression was used to obtain adjusted mortality
rate ratios. A series of models were explored and model fit
assessed by examining standardized residual plots and the Akaike
Information Criterion. Models were checked for over-dispersion. All
analyses were carried out using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX).
The data linkage was approved by the Scottish Privacy Advisory
Committee, which provides ethical advice to ISD and NRS.
Results
The Scottish Prison Service database recorded 92 383 people who
were in prison at some time between 1 January 1996 and 31
December 2007. Individuals already in prison on 1 January 1996
or known to have been in prison at any time before this date were
excluded (15 756), leaving 76 627 people imprisoned in Scotland for
the first time between 1996 and 2007.
Of these, 89% were male (Table 1). The median age at study entry
(first imprisonment) was 26.7 years for men and 27.0 years for
women. The mean number of imprisonments during 10 years of
follow up was 2.8 for men and 2.4 for women, although around
half had only one imprisonment. The median follow up time was
6.9 years for men and 6.1 years for women. Similar proportions of
men and women were married, divorced or separated. The majority
reported their religion as Christian, and the overwhelming majority
described their ethnic group as white (92.4% of men, 93.8% of
women). Among those with non-missing postcodes, 24.2% of men
and 24.5% of women were living in an area in the most deprived
Carstairs deprivation quintile at the time of their first imprisonment.
However, postcodes were unknown for a substantial proportion of
both men (42.0%) and women (43.7%).
Data linkage identified 4414 deaths during the study period (3982
in men). The highest age-specific rate ratios were at younger ages for
both men and women (Table 2). The overall SMR (standardized for
age and year of death) for prisoners compared with the general
population was 3.3 (95% CI 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3)
for women. After further standardization for deprivation the corres-
ponding figures were 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2), so that

adjustment for deprivation accounted for 43% of the excess risk in
men and 29% in women. When records with missing deprivation
information were excluded, the SMR was 3.2 for males and 7.5 for
females, falling to 2.6 for males and 6.3 for females after additional
standardisation for deprivation, 26 and 18% of the excess risk re-
spectively (data not shown).
In absolute terms, the most common cause of death for both men
and women was mental and behavioural disorders, (24% of male
deaths and 40% of female deaths) which were almost exclusively
due to drug and alcohol related causes (Table 3). The second most
common cause of death was from suicide and deaths of undetermined
intent, but cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease also accounted
for substantial numbers of deaths among both men and women.
Mortality rates among those who had been imprisoned were
higher than the general population for almost all causes with differ-
ences more extreme among women. Compared with the general
population, men who had been imprisoned were more than four
times as likely to die from a mental and behavioural disorder and
women 24 times as likely to die. Men were 3.7 times more likely and
women 16.9 times more likely to die of accidental poisoning. Men
were 3.5 times more likely than the general population to die from
suicide and deaths of undetermined intent, and women 11.7 times
more likely to do so. Substantially increased mortality rates were also
apparent for homicide among men (SMR 4.3) and women (22.5),
for all drug related deaths among men (4.4) and women (19.6) and
for all causes directly related to alcohol among men (2.8) and
women (9.1).
The vast majority (98%) of deaths occurred outside prison.
Compared with the general population, mortality among men was
significantly lower while in prison (SMR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5, 0.7).
Mortality among women in prison was higher (SMR 1.9, 95% CI
0.9, 3.5) although the confidence interval was wide. Compared with
the general population, the risk of death while outside prison was
substantially raised for both men (SMR 2.5, 95% CI: 2.4, 2.6) and
women (SMR 5.9 95% CI: 5.4, 6.5) and in both cases the out of
prison mortality rate was substantially higher than the in-prison
rate. Out-of-prison deaths were most likely to occur in the first
month after release, particularly in the first 2 weeks; of 1715
deaths in the first year after release 477 (28%) occurred in the
first 4 weeks after release; of these 232 (49%) occurred in the first
week and a further 121 (25%) in the second week.
Consistent with the finding of lower in-prison mortality, adjusted
mortality rates fell with increasing time in prison (Figure 1).
In contrast, after controlling for other factors including total
length of time in prison, mortality rose with increasing numbers
of short prison episodes (defined as <6 months in duration), with
the highest mortality seen in those with 3–7 short prison episodes.
Mortality rates were not significantly raised in the highest category
(8–60 episodes), though the CI was wide. Compared with 1996–98,
there was a slight reduction in mortality in 2002–04 but no
significant change between the start and the end of the study
period. Those who were married or in common-law partnerships
had the lowest mortality and mortality was also significantly lower
among those of no or non-Christian religion or from non-White
ethnic groups.
Discussion
We found substantially increased all-cause mortality among those
who had been in prison in Scotland. Excess mortality was largely
confined to the time out of prison, particularly the immediate period
after release, and relative mortality was increased among women and
those with multiple short episodes of detention. The relative
mortality excess was largest for accidental poisoning, suicide,
homicide and alcohol and drug related causes but was also raised
for cardiovascular and respiratory causes, infections and (in women)
lung cancer. The mortality risk was largest among younger age
groups, with the highest relative risks seen among younger
women. In absolute terms, drug-related deaths and suicides were
the most important single causes of death. Adjustment for socio-
economic status (using area deprivation as a proxy) accounted for
less than half of the observed mortality excess. Longer duration of
imprisonment was associated with lower mortality. There was little
change in mortality over time.

Excess mortality among prisoners

This study is among the larger studies of prisoner health interna-
tionally and includes a substantial period of follow up. It is the first
comprehensive report of cause-specific mortality in a large sample of
prisoners in Scotland. The accuracy of linkage by probability
matching is limited by the quality of the identifiers in the datasets
being linked and the range of identifiers available. Personal identi-
fiers on the deaths and prison datasets are of high quality, and full
name and date of birth were available. Based on validation studies of
hospital data linked to deaths in Scotland, we estimate that our
matching procedures should be around 98% accurate.20 We were
able to assess the contribution of deprivation to the observed
mortality excess seen in our study, which, to our knowledge, has
not been previously reported on. The complete national coverage of
the prison database means that these results are generalisable to the
Scottish prisoner population.
The postcode of previous residence was unknown at study entry
for over 40% of the cohort, limiting our ability to adjust for depriv-
ation. We assigned all prisoners with a missing postcode to the most
deprived quintile, which has the effect of increasing the estimate of
‘expected’ mortality and providing a conservative (or maximum)
estimate of the contribution of deprivation to the observed excess
of mortality in prisoners. As expected, excluding records with
missing
postcodes
reduced
the
extent
to
which
deprivation
accounted for the prisoner mortality excess.
Individual measures of socio-economic status were not available.
The area measure of deprivation used in this study is an ecological
measure of socioeconomic status and therefore the possibility of
residual confounding remains. No information was available on
the number of released prisoners who died outside Scotland; such
deaths would lead to an underestimate of mortality but we do not
think that this number is likely to be substantial.
Population estimates by deprivation category are only available at
census years, so we used Carstairs 2001 population estimates as the
denominator for deprivation-adjusted analyses across the whole
study time period. The population size is therefore slightly
underestimated, particularly in more recent time periods. This
slightly overestimates national death rates and expected deaths and
so underestimates relative mortality for prisoners. However we
believe that this effect is likely to be small.
We excluded 15 756 prisoners who had an imprisonment recorded
prior to, or were already imprisoned, on 1 January 1996 in order to
avoid bias caused by including a selected group at low mortality risk
who had survived to this date. A sensitivity analysis examining
relative mortality by year of first imprisonment produced findings
similar to those presented here (data available from authors).
As with all mortality studies, these results rely on the quality of
death certification. However the large mortality excesses we observed
seem unlikely to be explained by death certification inaccuracies.
The lack of modifiable risk factor information is an additional
weakness of this and most previous similar studies, and an
important point to address in future research.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies of prisoner
mortality, which have reported SMRs ranging from 1.0 to 9.4 in
men and 2.6 to 41.3 in women.9 Others have also noted increased
mortality for mental and behavioural disorders, particularly alcohol
and drug related deaths, suicide and homicide.2–4,9,10,12 In keeping
with our findings, other studies have also reported increases in car-
diovascular5,11,13 and respiratory2,9,11 mortality and lung cancer.11
Our results are also consistent with many studies that have found
higher mortality immediately following release.1,3,9–11,13,21
Other studies have reported either lower mortality in prison than
in the general population6,7 or a lower mortality excess while in
prison than out, for all cause mortality,5 natural causes1,2,5 or spe-
cifically for homicide and suicide.8 Although a 20-year study of the
mortality of those in prison in England and Wales found a lower risk
of mortality from deaths from natural causes, (SMR 0.7) overall
mortality was higher than the general population (SMR 2.93).2 A
data linkage study of prisoners in Australia found a higher mortality
risk in prison than in the general population,3 while mortality
among prisoners in Tennessee in the early 1970s was 20 times

higher than among the general population.22 In keeping with our
findings, Binswanger reported that increasing years of incarceration
was associated with lower risk of mortality23 though Kariminia
reported
increased
mortality
with
increasing
duration
of
incarceration.16
After controlling for length of time in prison, we found higher
mortality in those with multiple short prison episodes. Kariminia16
reported stronger associations with number of imprisonments; being
imprisoned four or more times more than doubled the risk of all-
cause mortality; others have reported similar findings.24
The high mortality from drugs, alcohol and suicide is likely to
relate to the known levels of substance misuse25 and mental health
problems in the Scottish prison population.26 However, elevated
risks of mortality are observed across nearly all causes of death,
suggesting risk factors are not confined to a narrow range.
The security arrangements, daily routine and limited availability
of drugs and alcohol together with relative protection from
accidental death or homicide whilst in prison may contribute to
the reduced in-prison mortality. The successful introduction of
suicide prevention strategies and enhanced drug services in the
Scottish Prison Service in the early 2000’s are also likely to have
had a positive effect.27 Another relevant factor may be the higher
consultation
rate
of
prisoners
compared
with
the
general
population,28 some of which may be attributed to prison policies

such as routine medical examination on admission. Prisoners who
are terminally ill are normally released to die in the community;
adjustment for such compassionate release may contribute to
lower in-prison mortality.21
There was little change in mortality rates over time during a
period when drug and alcohol related mortality was increasing in
the Scottish population as a whole,29,30 suggesting that prison health
services may have helped mitigate the impact on prisoners.
Others have noted the striking health inequalities associated with
the prison population and the opportunities to tackle health
inequalities by providing support and supervision in prison and
after release.1 Although numbers are small, the substantially
elevated mortality among women and in younger age groups
suggests the need for targeted interventions and consideration of
community sentences when appropriate.
The very high mortality rates immediately after release may be due
to the problems of adjustment to freedom on release or to particu-
larly high levels of risky behaviour. Drug deaths, suicide and
homicide
all
make
substantial
contributions
to
post-release
mortality. Opiate substitution therapy has been shown to be an
effective measure to reduce drug deaths following liberation31 and
the provision of naloxone (an opiate antagonist) to prisoners at
release has the potential to make an additional contribution.
Sustained suicide prevention strategies are vital, from the point of
reception to release and beyond. A range of suicide risk factors have
been identified in prisoner populations, in particular a previous psy-
chiatric history; substance misuse, previous suicide attempts and key
psychological characteristics.32,33 Violence reduction measures in
prison and more widely in the community are also important.
However, elevated risks of mortality are observed across nearly all
causes of death, indicating the need for a comprehensive approach to
risk factor reduction such as pre-release assessment and planning and
facilitating the transition to life outside prison.
Multiple episodes of short-term imprisonments can result in loss
of continuity of key relationships, housing and employment
opportunities which may be important risk factors for mental and
other health problems. The escalating risk of mortality associated
with this pattern of imprisonment supports criminal justice
approaches
that
limit
repeated
short
periods
of
detention,
promote alternatives to custody and provide closer supervision
and support immediately following release.
Addressing the healthcare needs of prisoners has the potential to
reduce re-offending. More generally, these findings support a
broader public health approach to prevention, early detection and
intervention in offending lifestyles to prevent imprisonment.
The data linkage methods used by this study offer an efficient and
low
cost
method
of
collecting
further
information
on
this
population. This could provide information on long term trends
in overall and cause-specific mortality which could be used as
baseline
and
follow
up
indicators
for
intervention
studies.
Mortality rates could also act as health care performance outcome
indicators for prison based health services.

Key points
 Using a large linked database with complete national
coverage, this study confirms the strikingly high mortality
previously observed among people who have been in prison
 Although
this
group
is
from
a
substantially
socially
disadvantaged background, the mortality excess can only
partly be explained by material deprivation
 Multiple short periods in prison are associated with
increased mortality risk, which may relate to disruption of
key relationships, housing and employment opportunities as
well as repeated exposure to the high risk of death in the
immediate period following prison release
 In addition to the need for wider use of opiate substitution
and naloxone provision these results suggest the need to
consider community sentences where appropriate

Background: Both media use and cancer knowledge have been identified as important predictors of a healthy
lifestyle. However, little is known about the interplay between these two variables, and about differences
between cancer diagnosed and non-diagnosed consumers of media and knowledge. This study investigated the
relationship between media use (television and internet exposure) and lifestyle choices of cancer diagnosed
and non-diagnosed individuals, and looked at the influence of cancer knowledge on this relationship. Methods:
A cross-sectional, quantitative survey (the Leuven Cancer Information Survey) was administered to 621 cancer
diagnosed and 1387 non-diagnosed individuals, aged 16–88 years old in Flanders (Belgium). Bivariate analyses,
hierarchical linear regression analyses and advanced moderation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results:
Internet exposure was not a predictor of lifestyle choices. Television exposure, however, was a negative predictor
of healthy lifestyle choices. Moreover, television exposure was a direct negative predictor of cancer knowledge,
which in turn positively predicted lifestyle choices. However, no differences were found in the investigated rela-
tionships between the two subsamples. Conclusion: These results indicate that higher levels of television exposure
coincide with less cancer knowledge and with less healthy lifestyle choices. It offers a pathway for intervention by
suggesting that improving cancer knowledge through television might positively affect lifestyle choices.
.........................................................................................................
Introduction
R
esearch suggests that 4 out of 10 cancers could be prevented by
healthier lifestyle choices (e.g. fruit and vegetable consumption,
increased physical activity) and by early detection.1,2 Increased
physical activity, for instance, has been linked to a decreased
breast cancer risk.2 Several predictors of lifestyle choices have been
identified in the literature. This study will examine two communi-
cation-related predictors of lifestyle choices: media use and cancer
knowledge.
One of the media most commonly associated channels with
unhealthy lifestyle choices is television. Exposure to television has
been linked to a more sedentary lifestyle,3,4 snacking,5 insufficient
consumption of fruits and vegetables4 and earlier smoking onset.6 In
comparison to television, relatively little is known about the rela-
tionship between internet use and lifestyle choices, despite the
enormous amount of health information available on the internet.7
While television exposure is usually identified as a predictor of
unhealthy lifestyle choices, knowledge has been identified as a
predictor of healthy lifestyle choices.8 One study reported that a
low level of cancer knowledge was one of the most crucial
predictors of insufficient cancer screening.9 A study among Latin-
American women found that cancer knowledge was positively
associated with perceived self-efficacy for cancer screening.10 Other
research
also
found
a
positive
relationship
between
cancer
knowledge and screening behaviour.11
