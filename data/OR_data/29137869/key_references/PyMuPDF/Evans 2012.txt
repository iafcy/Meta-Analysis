This study examined associations between mortality and demographic and risk characteristics among young
injection drug users in San Francisco, California, and compared the mortality rate with that of the population. A total
of 644 young (<30 years) injection drug users completed a baseline interview and were enrolled in a prospective
cohort study, known as the UFO (‘‘U Find Out’’) Study, from November 1997 to December 2007. Using the National
Death Index, the authors identiﬁed 38 deaths over 4,167 person-years of follow-up, yielding a mortality rate
of 9.1 (95% conﬁdence interval: 6.6, 12.5) per 1,000 person-years. This mortality rate was 10 times that of
the general population. The leading causes of death were overdose (57.9%), self-inﬂicted injury (13.2%),
trauma/accidents (10.5%), and injection drug user-related medical conditions (13.1%). Mortality incidence was
signiﬁcantly higher among those who reported injecting heroin most days in the past month (adjusted hazard
ratio ¼ 5.8, 95% conﬁdence interval: 1.4, 24.3). The leading cause of death in this group was overdose, and
primary use of heroin was the only signiﬁcant risk factor for death observed in the study. These ﬁndings highlight
the continued need for public health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this population in order to
reduce premature deaths.

Injection drug use has been associated with excess mor-
bidity and mortality (1, 2). A number of studies have
reported incidence that greatly exceeds that of the general
population (3–5). Risk factors that have been associated with
mortality among injection drug users (IDUs) from prior studies
include infectious diseases, such as human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (3, 6–8). Given
improvements in medical care for HIVand HCVas well as
more widespread implementation of public health interven-
tions for IDUs (needle exchange, overdose prevention, opiate
substitution treatment, and so on), current studies are needed
to assess whether the incidence and causes of mortality have
shifted over time. Additionally, studies of unique subpopula-
tions such as young IDUs are needed to understand the patterns
and risk factors for mortality in order to inform future tailored
interventions.
The current study was undertaken to assess the incidence
of mortality and risk factors for mortality among young in-
jection drug users in San Francisco, California. Given that
the UFO (‘‘U Find Out’’) Study has been collecting detailed
information on young IDUs since the late 1990s, it provides
a unique opportunity to study mortality trends and risk factors
for mortality in this population. The speciﬁc aims of the
study were as follows: 1) to investigate trends in mortality
incidence overall and overdose-speciﬁc mortality, 2) to
calculate standardized mortality ratios, and 3) to identify
risk factors for mortality in young injectors in San Francisco
between 1997 and 2007.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Beginning in 1997, young (<30 years) IDUs in San
Francisco have been offered participation in multiple pro-
spective studies under variations of the shared title known
as the UFO Study and described previously (9–11). In brief,
young IDUs were recruited by peer outreach workers fa-
miliar with neighborhoods in San Francisco where young
IDUs congregate, using study invitation cards and ﬂyers,
contacts with youth friendly neighborhood groups and com-
munity providers, and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria for
screening were the following: 1) less than 30 years of age;
2) self reported use of injection drugs in the past 30 days,
3) ability to provide informed consent, 4) understanding
spoken English and, after 2005, 5) self-reported HCV-negative
or unknown status. The UFO Study had 3 waves of data
collection between November 1997 and December 2007. In
the ﬁrst wave from 1997 to 1999, subjects completed a baseline
screening interview and underwent counseling and serologic
testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C virus. Subjects
without evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection or immunization to HBV were eligible for enrollment
in a prospective study of HBV vaccination (UFO-2 Study).
Starting in 2000, subjects who were HCV negative at the base-
line screening were eligible for enrollment into the UFO-3
Study. The UFO-3 Study had 2 waves of recruitment, from
2000 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2007. Participants were in-
cluded in this analysis only if they were enrolled prior to
December 31, 2007, the end date for searching for death
records. All research protocols and informed consent were
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University
of California, San Francisco.
Survey instrument and measures
Eligible consenting participants were interviewed, coun-
seled, and tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and
presence of viremia (HCV RNA) at baseline. Follow-up in-
cluded monthly ‘‘check-ins’’ and quarterly study visits that
included structured interviews to assess risk (principally drug-
related and sexual) exposures, HCV status (including anti-
HCV and HCV RNA testing), and risk reduction counseling
and referrals. In the ﬁrst and second study waves, testing for
antibodies to HIV and HBV was performed at baseline and
follow-up visits. Deaths were ascertained though the National
Death Index (NDI) through the end of 2007. Methods for
establishing a match are described in detail on the NDI Web
site (http://www.csc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm). In brief, records are
matched by ﬁrst and last name, date of birth, sex, and state of
birth. Causes of death were obtained from the NDI-Plus. The
underlying cause of death was based on the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision. The primary
outcome for this analysis was date of death as identiﬁed by
an NDI match. Causes of death were reviewed, and overdose
death was deﬁned as ICD, Tenth Revision, codes X42, X44,
X62, and Y14. Sociodemographic variables included in the
analyses were age, gender, race/ethnicity (Caucasian vs. non-
Caucasian), educational level (less than high school vs. high
school or greater), recent (past 3 months) homelessness, and
incarceration. Starting in wave 2, participants were asked about
participation in drug treatment programs in the past 3 months
and in the past week in wave 3. Recent drug treatment pro-
grams included drug detoxiﬁcation, residential treatment,
methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, and 12-step pro-
grams. Risk-related exposures included duration of injection
drug use; frequency of injection; injection of heroin, cocaine,
methamphetamine, crack, or heroin mixed with methamphet-
amine or cocaine; noninjection crack use; and nonfatal heroin
overdose. Overdose was deﬁned as a loss of consciousness
where at least one intervention was attempted by a third party.
Data analysis
We calculated mortality incidence overall and by demo-
graphic and risk characteristics reported at the baseline
interview. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated in
3-year intervals adjusting for age, sex, and race by using na-
tional mortality statistics from the National Center for Health
Statistics. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated over-
all, separately for males and females, and for overdose-
related deaths only; 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated
by assuming that the observed deaths followed a Poisson dis-
tribution. Cox regression models with time-varying covariates
were used to identify predictors of mortality. Survival time
was deﬁned as the time from initiation of injection (self-
reported as age at ﬁrst injected drugs) to death. Given that
subjects were current injectors at the start of the study, data
were left truncated. Subjects entered into the analysis at the
baseline visit, and they remained until the date of death or were
censored at December 31, 2007, or the last interview date if
the last interview was after December 31, 2007. Covariates
were included in the multivariate model if the incidence rate
ratio for mortality reached statistical signiﬁcance at a level
of P < 0.10 in the bivariate analysis or were potential con-
founders (study wave, age, gender, HCV status, and duration
of injection drug use). Baseline characteristics including age,
gender, duration of injection, and study wave were entered
into the model as ﬁxed covariates. Drug use and injection-
risk behaviors, overdose, and HCV status were entered as
time-varying covariates. All analyses were conducted with the
Stata statistical software package (release 11.2; StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
A total of 644 participants completed a baseline interview
and were enrolled in the prospective cohort from November
1997 to December 2007. The median age was 22.0 years
(interquartile range (IQR): 19.8–25.0), and participants had
injected for a median of 4.0 years (IQR: 1.7–6.7) at the base-
line interview. Sixty-eight percent of participants were male,
and 78% were Caucasian (Table 1); 47% had less than a high
school education, and 68% reported being homeless or
marginally housed. At the most recent interview, the drug
most often injected in the past 30 days was heroin (63%)
followed by methamphetamine (27%); 31% reported injecting
every day in the past month, 68% used a syringe exchange in
the past month, and 32% were anti-HCV positive.
We identiﬁed 38 deaths over the follow-up period through
2007 using the NDI. The overall mortality rate over 4,167

person-years of follow-up was 9.12 (95% conﬁdence inter-
val (CI): 6.63, 12.53) per 1,000 person-years of observation.
In females, the mortality rate was 6.51/1,000 person-years
of observation and, in males, 10.42/1,000 person-years of ob-
servation. The median age at death was 26 years (IQR: 23–30),
and the median time from initiation of injecting until death
was 7.7 years (IQR: 4.9–11.3).
Increased mortality was observed among those who identi-
ﬁed heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs as the drug in-
jected most days in the 30 days prior to the most recent
interview, relative to those who injected methamphetamine
(incidence rate ratio (IRR) ¼ 3.03, 95% CI: 1.47, 6.23)
(Table 1). The incidence of mortality was signiﬁcantly
higher in those who reported having an overdose in the
past 3 months compared with those who did not (IRR ¼ 2.71,
95% CI: 1.35, 5.47). Mortality rates were elevated among
HCV-seropositive individuals compared with negatives
but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (IRR ¼ 1.66,

95% CI: 0.88, 3.15) at P < 0.05. Mortality incidence did not
differ by age, race/ethnicity, ever having overdosed, duration
of injection, or incarceration in the past 3 months.
By use of national mortality as the reference, the over-
all adjusted standardized mortality ratio for 1999–2001
was 15.3 (95% CI: 7.6, 27.3), which decreased to 10.6
(95% CI: 5.8, 17.8) in 2002–2004 and 8.3 (95% CI: 4.4, 14.3)
in 2005–2007 (Table 2). When data were stratiﬁed by wave
of recruitment, temporal declines in mortality persisted (data
not shown). In females, the adjusted standardized mortality
ratios were higher than in males across all time bands. Further-
more, there did not appear to be a trend toward a decreasing
standardized mortality ratio over time among women, as there
appeared to be for men. Incidence of overdose mortality also
declined between 2000 and 2007 (Table 3). However, women
had lower rates of overdose mortality compared with men,
and their rates did not appear to decline. The principal cause
of death for the overall cohort was overdose (57.9%), fol-
lowed by self-inﬂicted injuries (13.2%), other drug-related
medical conditions (13.2%), trauma or accidents (10.5%),
and other causes (5.3%).
In Cox regression with time-varying covariates adjusting
for age and duration injecting, participants who used heroin
or heroin mix most days or who had a recent overdose had
elevated mortality (Table 4). Of these factors, heroin/heroin
mix as the drug used most days in the past month was the
only one independently associated with mortality (adjusted
hazard ratio ¼ 5.76, 95% CI: 1.37, 24.30) (P < 0.05). Having
a recent nonfatal overdose was associated with higher relative
hazards of death, although this did not quite meet statistical
signiﬁcance. After adjustment for other covariates, being
HCV infected was not signiﬁcantly associated with increased
relative hazards of death.
DISCUSSION
This study of young IDUs in San Francisco between 1997
and 2007 found overall mortality rates 10 times higher than
those in the general population. Mortality appeared to decline
over the 10-year period; however, stratiﬁed results suggested
that declines were restricted to males. The leading cause of
death in this cohort was overdose, and primary use of heroin
was the only signiﬁcant independent risk factor for death that
was observed in the study. Together, these ﬁndings highlight
the substantial mortality risk associated with injecting drugs
for young persons and point to a continued need for public
health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this
population in order to reduce premature deaths.
The overall mortality rate observed in this study of IDUs
in San Francisco was 9.12 per 1,000 person-years of obser-
vation. Another study of young and recent-onset injectors
that included data from 5 different cities in the United States

found a similar mortality rate (3). That study found an initial
increase of mortality in the 2 years of the cohort study, fol-
lowed by a decrease, which led the authors to hypothesize
that the immediate years following initiation of drug use might
be a period of higher risk. In contrast, our study found only
a continuous decline in mortality over calendar periods. The
prior study by Vlahov et al. enrolled only recently initiated
IDUs (<5 years) and therefore did not include a range of age
and duration of drug use to clarify period effects. Our study
included participants with a wide range of injecting exposure
time (median ¼ 4 years, IQR: 1.7–6.7), and we performed
multivariate Cox models to analyze the independent effects
of age and duration of use. The results did not support an
association between duration of use and mortality.
There are several potential explanations for the observed
decline in mortality in our cohort of young injectors. First,
it is possible that public health interventions could have
led to fewer deaths over the years. In the past decade, several
overdose prevention programs have been implemented in the
United States including the distribution of the overdose-
reversal drug, opiate antagonist naloxone (NARCAN; Endo
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania), to IDUs
(12–16). One of the longest running naloxone prescription
programs in the United States was implemented in San
Francisco in 2003 and has provided overdose prevention train-
ing and prescribed naloxone to nearly 2,000 individuals as
of December 2009 (16). Furthermore, improved access to
treatment for opioid dependence may be a factor, as opioid
substitution treatment in IDUs has been shown to be a sig-
niﬁcant factor in reducing the risk of mortality (17). There
could have been a change in the purity of heroin over the
years (18). Finally, because there was ongoing enrollment of
our cohort, differences in mortality over time may be associ-
ated with unmeasured differences in the UFO Study population
over time, such that subjects with lower risk were recruited
during later phases of the study. To test this hypothesis, we
included a variable for period of study recruitment in our
Cox models. Although we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences
in the hazard ratios for death by enrollment wave, the hazard
ratios were less than 1.0 comparing the later with earlier
years, suggesting that this could be an underlying factor.
Furthermore, when we investigated changes in the UFO Study
population across the 3 waves of data collection, we found
that participants in the ﬁrst wave were more likely to inject
heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs in the past month and
were signiﬁcantly less likely to inject methamphetamine
in the past month at baseline (data not shown). Since pri-
mary use of heroin as the drug of injection was strongly
predictive of death in our Cox models (hazard ratio ¼ 5.76,
95% CI: 1.37, 24.30), this observed decline in heroin injection
in later waves of study recruitment is a likely contributor to
the decline in overdose mortality over time.
Our study of young injection drug users found the most
common causes of death to be overdose and trauma, which
is consistent with prior studies (3, 6, 7, 19). This supports
a continued focus on overdose prevention in this age group.
Of the risk factors examined in this study, only use of heroin
as the main injecting drug was independently predictive of
death. This contrasts with 2 prior studies of young IDUs
that found HIV infection to be signiﬁcantly associated with
mortality (3, 6). This difference can likely be explained by
the relatively small absolute number of participants included
in our sample and the small number of persons with HIV.
Also, HIVas a cause of death has been shown to have peaked
in the 1990s (20, 21), before the advent of highly active anti-
retroviral therapy, and is less likely to impact mortality in
young versus older injectors (7).
Our study showed differences in death rates between men
and women. Although the incidence of death was higher
among men compared with women, standardized mortality
ratios were higher for women. Female injectors were 12 times
more likely to die compared with females in the general
US population; in contrast, male injectors were 8 times more
likely to die compared with the male US population. A similar
difference in sex-stratiﬁed standardized mortality ratios has
been reported in a cohort of young IDUs in Canada (6). In
addition, although rates of death appeared to decline over
time among men, rates appeared relatively stable for women
over the 10-year period. Sex-stratiﬁed results should be
interpreted with caution however, as the sample size was
relatively small and resulted in wide conﬁdence intervals for
period-speciﬁc mortality rates.
There were a number of important limitations to this study.
Mortality rates may be underestimates because of deaths that
were not captured by the NDI search criteria. A number of
study participants were believed to have given pseudonyms
rather than birth names, which would not allow matching, and
incorrect birth dates may have been given. Causes of death
were based on ICD codes on death certiﬁcates that may be
inaccurate (22). Analyses used baseline predictor data, and
some covariates measured constructs that could change over
time (HIVand HCV infections, injecting behaviors, incarcer-
ation, and so on). Therefore, analyses of certain predictors
should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the relatively
modest sample size and small absolute number of deaths are
limitations, particularly with regard to sex-stratiﬁed results.
In conclusion, this study of young IDUs in San Francisco
demonstrated that injection drug use is associated with sub-
stantially increased risk for death, and that most of the excess
risk is due to overdose and trauma. Results also suggest that,
among young adult injectors in San Francisco, mortality
rates are decreasing over time but are generally restricted
to males. Research is needed to conﬁrm these results and
explore reasons for sex-speciﬁc differences in mortality in
young IDUs.
