**Abstract**

Multiple factors affect injecting drug-related mortality, many of which will vary over time and between jurisdictions. There are relatively few
studies of mortality among injecting drug users (IDU) in Australia. We aimed to provide data comparable to those reported internationally on the
rate of mortality among IDU in Australia. We retrospectively examined mortality among participants (N = 220) from the first Australian cohort
study of IDU by linking coded personal identifier records with a national death register. The overall mortality rate among those followed-up was
0.83 per 100 PY (95% CI, 0.56–1.21 per 100 PY). This rate is lower than those reported internationally but comparable to the limited Australian
data from other cohorts of IDU. Mortality was higher among males, most common among those aged in their early thirties and drug-related
mortality occurred typically after substantial injecting careers. Extensive experience of incarceration (≥3 times) was associated with increased
risk of mortality. These results suggest that rates of mortality among Australian IDU may be lower than those reported internationally, with low
HIV prevalence and Australia’s long-held harm reduction framework potentially contributing to this result. Further studies using defined cohorts
followed over time are needed to examine long-term outcomes among IDU in Australia.

**1. Introduction**

Injecting drug users (IDU) are at considerably greater risk of
morbidity and mortality than their non-injecting peers (WarnerSmith et al., 2001). Characteristics such as gender and age
(Hickman et al., 2003), psychosocial factors such as unemployment and imprisonment (Brugal et al., 2005), dose and frequency
of injection (van Ameijden et al., 1999), medical complications
from injecting drugs (Warner-Smith et al., 2001), and healthcare and drug treatment utilisation (Langendam et al., 2001) are
important factors determining mortality risk among IDU. Risk
may also be affected by structural and environmental character

istics related to drug policy environments (Burris et al., 2004;
Kerr et al., 2007).
Few studies of mortality among IDU cohorts have been conducted in Australia, with most research focused on coronial
data. While these studies are important, they cannot determine
IDU mortality rates as the size of the population at risk is
unknown. Given the complexity of the factors described above
and variations in the characteristics of IDU and drug using environments internationally, we would expect to see differences
in rates of mortality between jurisdictions. Indeed, substantial variations in mortality rates have been reported between
countries and over time (EMCDDA, 1999). For this reason it
is important to understand IDU mortality in Australia, where
harm minimisation is the overarching drug policy (Ritter et al.,
2004).
We retrospectively examined mortality within the Victorian
Injecting Drug Users Cohort Study (VICS) of Australian IDU
recruited in the early 1990s. Our aim was to provide IDU mortality data comparable to those reported internationally and

examine characteristics associated with mortality in an Australian context.

**2. Methods**

_2.1. VICS_

VICS was the first longitudinal study of IDU conducted in Australia. A
detailed description of VICS is reported elsewhere (Crofts and Aitken, 1997).
Briefly, VICS was a longitudinal study of 626 IDU recruited through the social
networks of ‘privileged access’ interviewers (PAIs; former or continuing IDU
with extensive experience of the IDU “scene”) and ‘snowballing’ from these
networks. VICS PAIs interviewed participants at approximately nine-month
intervals between 1990 and 1995, recording detailed demographics, drug use
characteristics and life events.

_2.2. Case ascertainment_

Mortality was determined using National Death Index (NDI) matching of
coded unique identifiers extracted from VICS records. These identifiers, a combination of letters of participants’ first and second names, gender and dates of
birth, were only available for 220 participants interviewed by two PAIs, hereafter
referred to as the mortality cohort. The remaining participants were interviewed
by other PAIs who had not kept the requisite records or were no longer contactable. The mortality cohort was recruited between 21st June 1990 and 5th
September 1994 and final follow-up interviews were conducted between 19th
November 1990 and 12th October 1995. The median number of interviews per
participant was three (IQR 1–5), the median time between VICS interviews was
253 days (IQR 163–435), with an average length of VICS follow-up of 2 years.

_2.3. Data matching_

The NDI contains records of all deaths in Australia since 1980. The NDI
compared identifier codes from the mortality cohort to those from all deaths
occurring between 1990 and 18th September 2006. Date of death and cause
of death codes (only primary underlying ICD9 codes prior to 1997, thereafter
primary and all secondary ICD10 codes) from matched cases were merged into
the VICS database. Overdose deaths were defined as cases where accidental
poisoning (ICD-10 X40-X49), intentional self-poisoning (ICD-10 X60-X64)
and/or poisoning by drugs/toxic substances (ICD-10 T36-T65) were assigned
as primary or secondary causes of death.

_2.4. Analysis_

Selection bias was assessed by comparing characteristics (e.g. sociodemographics, current/past injecting characteristics, incarceration history) of
the mortality cohort with the rest of the VICS cohort using independent-sample
_t-tests for interval data and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney rank tests for ordinal_

data. Mortality was estimated with person-years (PY) of follow-up determined
from first interview date to either death or censorship at 18th September 2006.
Mortality rates were calculated using standard formulas and the standardised
mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated indirectly using time-specific age and sex
matched Australian population data. Characteristics associated with mortality
were determined using bivariate and multivariate Cox regression. Criterion for
the inclusion of predictors in regression models were based on a combination of
bivariate results, theoretical importance in relation to mortality and the overall
magnitude of regression coefficients.
This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the
Department of Human Services, State Government of Victoria.

**3. Results**

In assessing selection bias, there were few statistically significant differences between the mortality cohort and the remainder
of the VICS participants, except that the mortality cohort was
more likely to have drug treatment experience and less likely
to report government benefits as their primary income source
(neither of which were associated with mortality in the mortality cohort). Characteristics of the mortality cohort sample were
generally similar to those of other samples of IDU recruited in
Australia (e.g. NCHECR, 2007a). The mean age of the mortality
cohort was 28 years (S.D. = 6.6), 57% were male, 34% reported
previous incarceration, and 64% reported heroin as the drug they
injected most at final VICS interview.
Twenty-sixparticipantsdiedduringthefollow-upperiod.The
average age at death was 33 years (S.D. = 6.33, min. 21, max.
46). The overall mortality rate was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.56–1.21) per
100PY,withanSMRof6.08(95%CI,4.14–8.93),higheramong
males, and highest among those aged 30–34 years (Table 1).
Drug overdose was the most common cause of death
(14/26), producing an overdose mortality rate of 0.44 (95% CI,
0.26–0.75) per 100 PY. A further four mortality cases were probably injecting-related – one each of endocarditis, air embolism,
pulmonary embolism with thrombosis of deep lower extremity vessels, and open wound of hand (likely septicaemia); their
addition produced a drug-related mortality rate of 0.57 (95% CI,
0.36–0.91) per 100 PY. The average length of injecting career
at death was 17 years (S.D. = 7.05, min 3.86, max 29.79).

Differences in survival were explored using Cox proportional
hazards modelling. Table 2 shows adjusted HRs for factors associated with mortality. Being male, aged less than 35 years at
baseline and incarceration three times or more at baseline were
associated with higher mortality risk. HIV status was not associated with mortality (HR = 0.87 (base HIV negative); 95% CI,
1.13–7.71) and the inclusion of HIV status had no effect on the
coefficients of other variables included in the model.

**4. Discussion**

Overall and overdose mortality rates in this cohort were lower
than those reported in Europe and the USA, where overall mortality among IDU over comparable years range largely between
1–5 per 100 PY, but were typically in the order of 3 per 100
PY (e.g. EMCDDA, 1999; Langendam et al., 2001; Vlahov et
al., 2004). A few previous Australian studies also show relatively low mortality rates. A follow-up of methadone patients
(1976–1991) produced an overall mortality rate of 1.12 per 100
PY and an overdose mortality rate of 0.61 per 100 PY(Caplehorn
et al., 1996). The only other Australian cohort study of mortality
retrospectively followed amphetamine and heroin users admitted to hospital and psychiatric institutions between 1985 and
1998 and reported an overall mortality rate of 1.57 per 100 PY
(Bartu, 2006; Bartu et al., 2004).
Onepossiblereasonfortherelativelylowmortalityratefound
in this and other Australian studies is low HIV prevalence among
Australian IDU (NCHECR, 2007b). Studies in Europe (Brugal
et al., 2005; EMCDDA, 1999) and the USA (Vlahov et al.,
2004) over comparable periods report considerable proportions
of AIDS deaths among IDU. However, even after removing
AIDS deaths from these studies, mortality rates from other
causes remain higher than those reported here. The low mortality rate found in this study might result from high participation
rates in pharmacotherapy (Berbatis et al., 2000). Maintenance
pharmacotherapies have been widely available and well-utilised
in Victoria since the late 1980s (VGDHS, 2007). Research
consistently demonstrates the protective effect of methadone


maintenance treatment on mortality (e.g. van Ameijden et al.,
1999) and studies in Europe have reported mortality rates similar
(Langendametal.,2001)orlower(Brugaletal.,2005)thanthose
reported here among IDU enrolled in methadone maintenance.
While it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding relationships
between broader ecological factors and IDU mortality, a harm
reduction framework and public health responses to injecting
drugs, established early in the epidemic cycle, possibly underpin
the relatively low IDU mortality rates in Australian studies.
Consistent with previous research (e.g. Hickman et al., 2003)
mortality rates were higher among males and those aged in
their early to mid-thirties. Drug-related mortality also typically
occurred after lengthy injecting careers. However, as shown in
the proportional hazards model, those aged 35 years and over
at VICS recruitment were at substantially lower mortality risk
over the follow-up period compared to younger participants. It is
likely that many of these older participants either reduced their
injecting frequency or ceased injecting at some point over the
post-VICS follow-up period, so much of their significant period
of risk had passed.
More extensive experience of incarceration was associated
with increased mortality risk. Others have reported associations
between cumulative length in detention and non-fatal overdose
risk (Ochoa et al., 2005; Seal et al., 2001), and many studies have
shown elevated overdose mortality risk among IDU during the
immediate post-release period (e.g. Bird and Hutchinson, 2003;
Seaman et al., 1998). This mortality has been largely attributed
to the loss of drug tolerance (Seaman et al., 1998), although high
rates of post-release non-drug-related mortality are also reported
(Bird and Hutchinson, 2003). While we could not determine
incarceration history between last VICS interview and censorship, or the temporal relationship between prison release and
mortality, our findings suggest that causes other than drug overdose were primarily responsible for the association between
imprisonment and mortality. We found a lower overdose mortality risk compared to all-cause mortality among those imprisoned
three times or more, while most overdose deaths (71%) occurred
among participants with no prison history at the time of VICS
interviews. Others have argued that long-term health outcomes
of IDU with an incarceration history go beyond mortality and

morbidity directly attributable to drug use and include psychosocial factors related to poor health, such as socio-economic status,
homelessness, and psychological stress associated with re-entry
into the community (Galea and Vlahov, 2002).
Our study is limited in several ways. First, we were unable to
include all VICS participants. The only selection biases apparent
were that the mortality cohort was more likely to have a history
of drug treatment and less likely to report government benefits
as their primary income source compared to the remaining VICS
participants. Both these factors are potentially protective of mortality, so mortality may have been higher among the remaining
VICS participants. Second, we may have under-ascertained mortality cases because complete identifying information was not
available. Using alpha-numeric identifier codes, this study was
susceptible to incorrect identifying information (either reported
by participants or recorded by researchers) affecting the reliability of data linkage. Third, in retrospective cohort studies such as
this, events occurring between the last follow-up and censorship
are unknown. This is particularly important when exploring correlates of mortality and means that the predictors of mortality
reported here should be interpreted with caution. For example,
given the association between illicit drug injecting and incarceration, some participants are likely to have had prison experience
between the final interview and data linkage. Fourth, the precision of estimates in this study was affected by the small number
of deaths. Finally, overdose and drug-related mortality rates may
be under-estimated because prior to 1997 only the primary cause
of death was recorded in the NDI register.
Few studies have reliably estimated mortality rates among
Australian IDU. The scarcity of Australian prospective studies
of IDU has produced deficiencies in our knowledge of the natural
history and long-term outcomes of IDU within the Australian
context. While cohort studies are expensive and are logistically
difficult to conduct with this population, better use of record
linkage methods offers a viable alternative. Our study suggests
that mortality rates among Australian IDU are lower than those
reported internationally. Further research with other Australian
cohorts will establish the reliability of these findings.
