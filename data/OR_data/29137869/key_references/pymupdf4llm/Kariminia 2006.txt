#### Objectives: Describe the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and its trend in adults who have served time in prison.

 Design: A retrospective cohort study of 85 203 adults imprisoned in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2002.

 Methods: We obtained information on deaths by record linkage with the Australian National Death Index (NDI). Mortality rates were estimated using the person-time method. SMRs were calculated using sex, age, and calendar-specific death rates from the NSW population. Time trends in SMRs were assessed using the test for linear trends.

 Results: The median overall follow-up of the cohort was 7.7 years. We identified 5137 deaths (4714 men, 423 women) among the cohort of which the vast majority (4834, 94%) occurred following release from custody. All-cause SMR was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.6–3.8) in men and 7.8 (95% CI: 7.1–8.5) in women. SMRs were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders (men: 13.2, 95% CI: 12.3–14.0; women: 62.8, 95% CI: 52.7–74.9) and drug-related deaths (men: 12.8, 95% CI: 12.2–13.5; women: 50.3, 95% CI: 43.7–57.8). The SMR for death by homicide was 10.2 (95% CI: 8.9–11.7) in men and 26.3 (95% CI: 17.8–39.0) in women. Aboriginal men were 4.8 times, and Aboriginal women 12.6 times, more likely to die than the general NSW population. Over the study period on average all-cause SMR decreased significantly in men (p 5 0.003) and women (p 5 0.05) largely due to the decline in SMRs for drug-related deaths and suicide.

 Conclusion: In the largest study so far reported, mortality of male and female offenders was far greater than expected for all major causes, especially deaths caused by drug overdose. Despite some indication of a reduction in excess mortality in recent years, there remains an overwhelming need for enhanced responses to mental health and drug problems for people who have been in prison.

## Introduction

Prison inmates are recognized as a population with a high
burden of disease from a wide range of physical and mental
health problems. Studies have examined risky sexual and
substance misuse behaviours among people who have served
time in prisons, demonstrating their extreme vulnerability to
sexually transmissible infections,[1] viral hepatitis,[2] drug dependence,[3] and mental ill health.[4]


-----

A number of studies have addressed death as the ultimate
consequence of these health problems. Most mortality
studies have focused on deaths occurring while in custody
and showed that prisoners are more likely to die prematurely
especially of suicide, than people who have not been in
custody.[5–8]

Several studies have assessed post-release death and provided
an indication that those released from custody are at an
increased risk of death.[9–12] These studies, however, have not
reported on all major causes of death, mainly because of the
small sample size or limited follow-up period. The present study
is a comprehensive assessment of mortality among individuals
who have been exposed to the prison environment. It aims to
describe the relative importance of the main causes of death in
people sentenced to full-time custody in New South Wales
(NSW), Australia, to compare inmate mortality with that of the
general NSW population, and to examine time trends in
mortality during the 15 year study period.

## Methods


#### Study population

We conducted a retrospective study using data linkage to
examine the mortality risk and causes of death among a cohort
of prisoners. The study cohort included all adults who had
experienced full-time custody in NSW between 1 January 1988
and 31 December 2002. The prisoner cohort was identified by
the NSW Department of Corrective Services (DCS) from their
operational computer system, Offender Integrated Management System (OIMS). OIMS is used to manage information on
the State’s offender population throughout their sentence.
Prisoners are assigned a unique identification number, which
is also used for all subsequent imprisonments. The extracted
list contained the unique identification number, full name,
gender, date of birth, and country of birth. Importantly, it also
contained information on any known aliases or pseudonyms
used by prisoners. The list was used for the data linkage to the
Australian National Death Index (NDI) and consisted of
145 979 records comprising 85 203 unique records.
We also received secondary information on the commencement and release dates (to community, parole, or home
detention) of all episodes of incarceration (both sentenced and
remand). This dataset was used to calculate the time spent in
custody or in the community during the study period. Those
imprisoned during the study period who first entered prison
prior to 1 January 1988 were considered to be at risk from
1 January 1988.


the calendar years 1988–2002. Matching was performed using
the integrity probabilistic record linkage software package.[13]

Linkage was based on the common identifiers: full name,
sex, date of birth, and date of last contact with the prison
system. The NDI search algorithm generated many potential
matches, which were reviewed by a blinded reviewer to
decide if a match was a true one. Only highest level matches
(matches on gender, surname, first name, middle name
and date of birth) were accepted. Based on 311 deaths in
prison, and 7558 offenders known to be alive in prison, the
matching process was found to be 88.4% sensitive and 99.7%
specific.[14]

For all matches the NDI returned information on
death registration number, date of death, State or Territory
in which death occurred, and the underlying cause of death.
Deaths were coded using the International Classification of
Diseases, 10th Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM),
for deaths in 1997 or later, and using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) for deaths prior to 1997.
We analysed deaths from all major ‘disease-related’ and
‘external’ causes categories and subcategories. In addition,
we examined death from smoking-related cancers (ICD-9 140,
141, 143–150, 157, 160–163, 188, 189; ICD-10 C00–C06, C09–
C15, C25, C30–C34, C38, C64–C68), hepatitis C liver-related
cancer (ICD-9 155.0; ICD-10 C22.0); hepatitis C liver-related
diseases (ICD-9 571–573; ICD-10 K70, K73–K74); transport
accidents (ICD-9 E800–E848; ICD-10 V01–V99); and accidental
poisoning (ICD-9 E850–E858; ICD-10 X40–X44). We also
established a separate category ‘drug-related death’ by
combining those cases where the underlying cause of death
was inferred to be directly related to drug use. These included
deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders (ICD-9 304,
305.2–305.9; ICD-10 F11–F16, F19, F55); suicide (ICD-9
E950.0–E950.5; ICD-10 X60–X64); homicide (ICD-9 E962.0;
ICD-10 X85); accidental (ICD-9 E850–E858; ICD-10 X40–X44);
and undetermined intent (ICD-9 E980.0–E980.5; ICD-10
Y10–Y14). For deaths due to alcohol-related mental and
behavioural disorder, we included (ICD-9 303, 305.0;
ICD-10 F10).

#### Statistical analysis


#### Mortality data sources

Deaths in our study cohort were identified by record linkage
with the NDI, a database managed by the Australian Institute
of Health and Welfare (AIHW) containing information on all
deaths reported in Australia since 1980. Source documentation
for the NDI consists of death certificate information provided by
the Registrar of Births Deaths and Marriages in each State and
Territory. At the time of the linkage, the NDI was expected
to contain information on all reported deaths up to 31
December 2002.
Information, including aliases, on 85 203 inmates was
forwarded to the AIHW for linkage to the NDI records for


The follow-up period was from the date of first imprisonment
after 1 January 1988 until the date of death or the end date of
the study (31 December 2002). Mortality rates were estimated
using the person-time method (number of deaths divided by
person-years of follow-up). We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) by comparing the observed and expected
number of deaths. Expected mortality was calculated based on
age, sex, and calendar-specific death rates for the entire NSW
population for the years 1988–2002. The expected rate from
the general NSW population was also used to calculate SMRs
for the Aboriginal group, as accurate information on this
population and their mortality was not available for the period
of the study. Ninety five per cent confidence intervals for SMRs
were based on the Poisson distribution. Time trends in
mortality rates were assessed using the test for linear trends.[15]

We used STATA Statistical Software, Release 8.0[16] for all
statistical analyses.

## Results

#### Cohort characteristics


The offender cohort consisted of 85 203 (76 383 men,
8820 women) individuals (Table 1). The median age at the
study entry for men was 27.2 years (range 5 18–86) and for
women 27.3 years (range 5 18–83). The majority (68%) were
Australian born. Of 97% (82 807) of prisoners who reported
Aboriginal status, 11% (9353) self-identified as Australian
Aboriginal. The median overall follow-up period was 7.7 years
for men and women (range 5 1 day to 15 years). The average
number of incarcerations during the study period was
2.5 (range 5 1–78) for men and 2.5 (range 5 1–38) for women.

#### Comparative mortality


death was 36.6 years for men and 32.7 years for women. Of
the 5137 deaths, 303 (295 men, eight women) occurred in
custody.
The crude mortality rate was 797 per 100 000 person-years
for men and 685 per 100 000 person-years for women.
Compared with the NSW population, overall mortality was
significantly higher in male (SMR 5 3.7, 95% CI: 3.6–3.8) and
female (SMR 5 7.8, 95% CI: 7.1–8.5) prisoners (Table 2). SMRs
were highest in the younger age groups (18–44 years), with
greater SMRs among women than men. Mortality excess was
higher for Aboriginals (men: SMR 5 4.8, 95% CI: 4.4–5.3;
women: SMR 5 12.6, 95% CI: 10.0–15.8).

#### Cause-specific mortality


In total, during the follow-up period we identified 5137 deaths
(4714 men, 423 women). The median age at the time of

Overall, the two leading causes of death were accidental and
mental and behavioural disorders (Table 3). The main cause of
death in men was accidental (1028, 22%) and in women was
mental and behavioural disorders (124, 29%). The high
mortality from mental and behavioural disorders was principally due to a large number of deaths associated with drug
overdose (971, 91%). Aggregating deaths due to drugs, we
identified 1477 (31%) deaths in men and 197 (47%) deaths in
women. Heroin was the major contributor to most drug-related
deaths. Prisoner drug-related deaths accounted for 26% of
all drug-related deaths in NSW. About 14% of deaths in
men and 7% in women were due to a cardiovascular disease.
HIV infection was the underlying cause of death for 24 men
in the cohort. There were no deaths from HIV among
women.
Table 3 shows that for all causes of death, except cancer in
women, the mortality rate was significantly higher in
the prisoner cohort in comparison with the NSW population.
SMRs were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and
behavioural disorders in men (13.2, 95% CI: 12.3– 14.0) and in
women (62.8, 95% CI: 52.7–74.9). SMRs were also substantially raised for homicide in men (10.2, 95% CI: 8.9–11.7) and

in women (26.3, 95% CI: 17.8–39.0). Mortality from Hepatitis
C liver-related diseases was considerably higher among the
cohort (men: SMR 5 4.8, 95% CI: 4.1–5.7; women: SMR 5
12.0, 95% CI: 6.6–21.6).
Suicide was a significant component of the mortality
among offenders. The crude mortality rate for suicide was
135 per 100 000 person-years for men (SMR 5 4.8) and 79 per
100 000 person-years for women (SMR 5 12.1). Hanging was
the most common method, implicated in 56% of suicides.
The overall SMR was substantially raised following release
from prison into the community in both men (4.0, 95% CI:
3.9–4.2 vs. 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5–1.9) and women (8.2, 95% CI:
7.4–9.0 vs. 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0–4.2). The excess all-cause mortality
increased with increasing number of imprisonments (Table 4).
Our estimated all-cause SMR was not dependent on
the total length of previous imprisonments. In men the SMR
for drug-related mortality was 14.5 (95% CI: 13.8–15.3)
after release and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.0–3.6) while in custody. In
women, all drug-related deaths except one occurred in the
community. In men the risk of suicide was the same for
released prisoners (SMR: 4.8, 95% CI: 4.4–5.2) and those
still in custody (SMR: 4.6, 95% CI: 3.8–5.5). The risk of
homicide was slightly higher after release (SMR: 10.4, 95%
CI: 9.0–12.1 vs. 8.8, 95% CI: 6.1–12.9). The majority of deaths
in men and women from all the other causes occurred after
release from prison.


#### Time trends (1988–2002)

SMRs over time for all-cause mortality, drug-related deaths,
suicide and all disease-related deaths excluding mental and
behavioural are shown separately for men and women in
Figure 1. In both men and women there was a large decrease
in the overall SMR and SMR for drug-related deaths
between 1989 and 1990, possibly related to changes in the
prison population in NSW at this time. Over the entire period
all-cause SMR, on average, decreased significantly in men
(p 5 0.003; Figure 1a) and women (p 5 0.05; Figure 1b). In
men this decrease was largely due to a decrease in both
drug-related SMR (Figure 1c) and SMR for suicide (Figure 1e)
and in women due to a decrease in the drug-related SMR
(Figure 1d). The disease-related SMR increased over the study
period in both men and women (Figure 1g and 1h). This
increase was only significant in men (p 5 0.003).


## Discussion

This study is, by far the largest investigation ever conducted
of mortality in people who have been imprisoned. We found
elevated cause-specific SMRs among adults who had been
in full-time custody in NSW, particularly in those aged
18–44 years. There was a decreasing trend over time in the
overall SMR almost entirely due to decreases in drug-related

between 1988 and 2002.
We found particularly high and significant SMRs for deaths
due to mental and behavioural disorders, suicide and
drug-related deaths, which suggest high levels of co-morbid
psychiatric illnesses and drug use among this population. The
homicide rate for men and women in our cohort was many
times higher than that for the general population which is an
indication of the risky lives lead by this group. Significantly
elevated risk for disease-related causes is consistent with greater
exposure among this population to risk behaviours such as
drug-injection, excess alcohol use, smoking and poor diet.[17]

The excess mortality was higher among ex-prisoners compared with prisoners; drug-overdose was responsible for much
of this excess. It has been suggested that reduced tolerance
to certain drugs following periods of abstinence or reduced
intake during incarceration may be the reason for the higher
risk of drug-related deaths following release.[10,18,19] A possible
explanation for the higher disease-related deaths among
ex-prisoners is that these deaths most often occur later in
life when offenders have reached the end of their criminal
career and thus are more likely to be living in the community.
The finding that male and female Aborigines had a higher
overall SMR than the cohort as a whole is of significant public
health importance. Aboriginal people are hugely over represented in the Australian prisoner population[20] (11% of this
cohort), but constitute around 2% of the NSW population.[21]

Detailed analysis on these data is needed to make meaningful
conclusions about the findings.
Several studies have reported on significant excess mortality
among people with a history of imprisonment.[6,9–12] Although
differences exist in the methods used to define study cohorts
and the follow-up of individuals to determine vital status, the
results were broadly similar to those from our study. The
higher SMRs found for our study population are in line with
the findings of studies on other socially disadvantaged
populations such as those with a severe mental illness,[22]

homeless people,[23] and a cohort of women prostitutes.[24]

Mortality declined in both men and women between 1988
and 2002 relative to the trend in the NSW population, largely


due to a decline in drug-related deaths and suicide. It is unclear
whether this trend represents improved provision and access to
treatments programmes for drug addicts and mentally ill
prisoners over the study period. Specific projects addressing
actual services received by prisoners are necessary before any
conclusion regarding this finding is possible.
We observed a sharp decrease in drug-related mortality
between 1989 and 1990. This may be related to the
introduction of the Sentencing Act in NSW in 1989.[25]

Following this legislative change, the average number of
days in custody increased for most offences, resulting in a
decrease in the number of prisoners released from custody. We
also observed a continuing decline in drug-related mortality
between 2001 and 2002. This may be due to the welldocumented reduction in heroin availability in Australia—the
so-called ‘heroin drought’.[26,27]

Our analyses are based on a large linkage study of more than
85 000 male and female offenders. It covers 15 years of
follow-up to enable investigation of long-term trends in
mortality in a period in which intervention programmes,
such as the methadone maintenance treatment, started in
prisons and in communities.[28,29] It is likely that we underestimated SMRs among our study cohort. Based on applying
our linkage procedure to prisoners with known vital status, we
were able to estimate the sensitivity of the linkage procedure to
be 88.4% and the specificity to be 99.7%.[15] Assuming that any
misclassification was not differential in this study, these rates of
sensitivity and specificity would lead to underestimation of the
SMRs by around 7%.[30] Sensitivity and specificity were also
calculated for drug-related deaths (92.3% and 99.6% respectively); suicide (93.8% and 98.1%); homicide (100.0% and
100.0%); cardiovascular (98.2% and 100.0%) and cancer
(100% and 100%). These figures would probably lead to the
slight underestimatation of the SMRs. The only exception is
suicide for which we would have probably overestimated
the SMR by 4%. Further overestimation of suicide was
prevented by not including ‘undermined intent deaths’
among suicide deaths.
It is highly unlikely that misclassification in the linkage
procedure could have caused the decreasing trend in SMR for
drug-related deaths. This could only have been caused by a

large decrease in sensitivity and specificity in the linkage
procedure over time. We were unable to assess time trends in
sensitivity and specificity empirically, but improvements to the
NDI over this time period would suggest that increasing
sensitivity and specificity would seem more likely.


In summary, this is the largest study to date on mortality
among offenders and is based on data linkage with the
Australian National Death Index. We have shown that people
with a history of imprisonment, particularly at younger ages,
are at a considerably greater than expected risk of death. The

high mortality was attributable primarily to mental health
problems and drug use. We observed a decreasing trend in
all-cause mortality, drug-related and suicide between 1988 and
2002. The underlying reason for this decline remains to be
established. It is important that programmes and support in the
post-release period are available to assist this disadvantaged and
marginalized group to obtain a quality life. Problems of
particular concern to this group are mental health and those
related to drug abuse.
