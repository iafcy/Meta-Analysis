Abstract
The health and social conditions of women living in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside has recently been the focus of
substantial international attention. Since few studies have examined rates and correlates of death among addicted women in
Canada, we have characterized patterns of mortality among female injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver. The
Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) is a prospective open cohort study of IDUs. The analyses presented here,
were restricted to women enrolled between May 1996 and May 2002 and who were aged 14 years or older. We estimated
cumulative mortality rates using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression was used to calculate univariate and adjusted
relative hazards. Between May 1996 and May 2002, 520 female IDUs have been recruited from the Vancouver area among
whom 68 died during the study period. Elevated rates of mortality were observed among those who reported, baseline sextrade involvement, those with HIV-infection at baseline, and those who lived in unstable housing at baseline (all log-rank:
p B/0.05). In adjusted analyses, HIV infection (RH �/3.09 [95% CI: 1.86 �/5.11]; p B/0.001), unstable housing (RH�/1.74

[95% CI: 1.10 �/2.86]; p�/0.029) and sex-trade involvement (RH �/1.82 [95% CI: 0.95 �/3.45]; p�/0.071) were associated
with the time to death. When the number of observed deaths was compared to the number of expected deaths based on the
general female population of British Columbia using indirect standardization, the rate of death among female IDUs was
elevated by a factor of 47.3 (95% CI: 36.1 �/58.5). In Vancouver, female IDUs have rates of mortality almost 50 times that of
the province’s female population. Our findings are consistent with a growing number of reports from other settings
internationally, and demonstrate the need for an appropriate evidence-based strategy to address the health and social needs
of addicted women.


We’re like the living dead down here, in the

Introduction

While there has been much research into mortality
among injection drug users (Gossop et al., 2002;
Hickman et al., 2003; Selwyn, 1991) few studies
focus on mortality rates and causes of death among
addicted women (Smith et al., 2003). In British
Columbia, Canada the case of over sixty missing
women who have disappeared from Vancouver’s
Downtown Eastside has garnered both national
and international attention (BBC, 26 Feb 2002;
Guardian, 11 Feb 2002; National Post, 3 Oct 2002).
Media furore has been focused upon the search of a
pig farm, the identification of DNA linked to a large
number of missing women and the subsequent
criminal case against the farm’s owner in rural BC


(BBC, Feb 26 2002; Guardian, Feb 11 2002;
National Post, Oct 3 2002). However, emerging
evidence suggests that the health and social crisis
among addicted women in Vancouver is much larger
than this single serial murder investigation. For
example, while addicted women in Vancouver involved in sex work continue to be exposed to
appalling levels of drug-related harm, predation,
and violence (Lowman, 2004; Lowman & Fraser,
1996; Spittal et al., 2003) analyses conducted in
Vancouver have also demonstrated that women
(Spittal et al., 2002; Spittal & Schechter, 2001)
particularly Aboriginal women (Benoit et al., 2003;
Craib et al., 2003) are at markedly elevated risk of
HIV infection. A recent analysis from the same
setting has also demonstrated that HIV-infected
women and Aboriginal persons are also less likely
to ever receive the benefits of HIV treatment prior to
death (Wood et al., 2003). Unfortunately, these
observations are consistent with many settings internationally where addicted women suffer from elevated rates of violence and health-related harms

Locally, recent cut backs and closing of services
for women in British Columbia and concomitant
threat of sweeping social welfare cuts (Globe & Mail,
21 Oct 2003) have resulted in increased scepticism
from several international bodies, regarding the
commitment of this provincial government to the
health and social wellbeing of the most marginalized

[Human Rights Watch, 2003; United Nations,
2003]. For instance, while praising the significant
strides made in advancing the rights of women, a
recent UN report was derisive of the high number
of women who remain entrenched in poverty in
Canada (United Nations, 2003).
Nevertheless, the intersecting epidemics of poverty, HIV/AIDS, violence and death that threaten
the lives of addicted women in Canada remain
poorly understood. We have been following a cohort
of more than 1400 injection drug users in Vancouver
since 1996 of whom approximately 35% are women.
Follow up of the cohort now allows for an investigation aimed at examining predictors of mortality and
careful examination of causes of death among
women who used injection drugs in one of Canada’s
poorest neighbourhoods.

Methods

The Vancouver Injection Drug User Study (VIDUS)
is a prospective cohort study of injection drug users
recruited through self-referral and street outreach
from Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside that was
initiated in May 1996 (Strathdee et al., 1997).
Persons were eligible to participate in the VIDUS
study if they were 14 years of age or older, had
injected illicit drugs at least once during the month
prior to enrolment, and resided in the greater
Vancouver region. All participants provided written
informed consent. Participants were given a stipend
($20 CDN) at each study visit in order to compensate them for their time and to facilitate transportation. The study was approved by the University of
British Columbia/Providence Healthcare Research
Ethics Board.
VIDUS study protocol participants are followed
semi-annually; at baseline and at each visit, participants completed interviewer administered questionnaires that elicited data regarding demographic
characteristics, injection and non-injection drug
use, injection practices, and sexual risk behaviours.
In addition, venous blood samples were drawn at
each visit, and tested for HIV and hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) antibodies. All study volunteers had private
interviews, were offered both pre- and post-test
counselling with trained nurses and referral for


HIV/AIDS care was provided to those who tested
positive.
The present study was restricted to female IDUs
recruited since 1 May, 1996 and who were followed
until 31 May, 2002. Transsexual IDUs (male to
female) were excluded. As an initial analysis we
evaluated the baseline demographic characteristics
of female IDUs. Due to the well-known association
of sex-trade work and premature mortality on the
harms of sex trade, we stratified this analysis by sextrade involvement at baseline (Lowman & Fraser,
1996; Spittal et al., 2003). Sex trade was defined as
exchanging sex for money, drugs, or anything else
including food or shelter. Variables of interest
included: baseline age, Hepatitis C (HCV) status,
HIV status, unstable housing, having ever been
sexually abused, incarceration in the last six months,
having sought but been denied addiction treatment,
shooting gallery use, emergency room use, and
having ever attempted suicide. As previously, unstable housing was defined as living in one of the
Downtown Eastside’s single room occupancy hotels
(SROs), shelters or other transitional housing, or
living on the street (Craib et al., 2003; Spittal et al.,
2002).
We determined all cause mortality rates among
VIDUS participants through ongoing follow-up with
contacts provided by participants and through a
confidential record linkage with British Columbia
Vital Statistics. In addition, because of the large
number of women who have disappeared from
Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, we also examined
how many women in the cohort were on the official
missing women list compiled by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP) (RCMP, 2003).
For the primary analysis of time to death, we
examined variables that we a priori hypothesized
may be associated with elevated risk of mortality.
Here, we examined age, sex-trade involvement,
unstable housing, HIV and HCV infection, years
injecting, incarceration, historical sexual abuse,
methadone maintenance therapy, requiring help
injecting, binge drug use, recent non-fatal overdose,
frequency of heroin and cocaine injection and crack
cocaine use, and condom use. Methadone maintenance (MMT) was defined as accessing methadone maintenance therapy in the last six months. As
in previous work (Spittal et al., 2002; Wood et al.,
2001), clients who reported injecting cocaine or
heroin once or more per day were defined as
frequent cocaine and frequent heroin users respectively. Bingeing was defined as periods when drugs
were injected more frequently than usual. Always
using condoms with regular partners, casual partners
and clients were evaluated as markers of sex-related
risk


-----

Cumulative all cause mortality rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. In these analyses, time zero was defined as the date of enrolment
into the study. Participants who did not die during
follow-up were censored as of 31 May, 2002.
Participants were stratified upon baseline characteristics and mortality rates were compared by the logrank test. In addition, in order to evaluate the impact
of time varying characteristics, such as sex-trade
involvement and drug use patterns in the last six
months, Cox proportional hazards regression was
used to assess the independent effect of both fixed
and time-dependent covariates on time to death.
Values for time-dependant variables were included
from all available visits. Age was treated as a
continuous variable without transformation. The
multivariate model was fitted using an a priori
defined protocol of adjusting for all variables that
were statistically significant at the p B/0.1 level in
bivariate analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 8.0 (SAS, Cary,
NC).

Results

A total of 1,478 participants were recruited and
completed an enrolment questionnaire between 1
May 1996 and 31 May 2002, among whom 520
(35.2%) were women. The characteristics of the
entire cohort have been described elsewhere (Strathdee et al., 1997). The median age of women at
enrolment was 32 (Inter-quartile range: 24 �/38), 204
(39.2%) were Aboriginal, and at baseline the median
number of years injecting was 9 (Inter-quartile
range: 3 �/18).
Table I shows the baseline socio-demographic and
risk behaviour characteristics of the cohort of female
stratified by sex-trade involvement at baseline. As
shown here, those who reported sex-trade work at
baseline were more likely to be HCV-positive
(p B/0.001), HIV-positive (p�/0.007), to reside in
unstable housing (p B/0.001), to have experienced
lifetime sexual abuse (p B/0.001), to have been
recently incarcerated (p �/0.044), to have recently
used a shooting gallery (p B/0.001), and were more
likely to inject cocaine daily (p B/0.001). Sex-trade
workers were more likely to have attempted suicide
(p B/0.060) but this did not attain conventional
statistical significance. Baseline age and daily heroin
injection were similar between both groups, and
having sought but been denied addiction treatment
in the last six months was also similar at approximately 20% at baseline.
Ongoing follow-up with contact information provided by participants and a confidential record
linkage with British Columbia Vital Statistics revealed that there were 61 deaths among women In

addition, from the RCMP’s missing women task
force, we determined that there were seven female
VIDUS participants for which murder charges have
been laid due to the discovery of DNA evidence
(RCMP, 2003). Together the 68 events among
female participants produced a crude all-cause
mortality rate of 13.1%. When the age-specific death
rates observed among female participants were
compared to the female population of British Columbia aged 18 to 64 (BC Vital Statistics Agency,
1991 �/1999), using indirect standardization (Shyrock & Siegal, 1976), the standardized mortality ratio
was 47.3 (95% CI: 36.1 �/58.5). By way of comparison, the corresponding SMR among male participants was 20.7 (95% CI: 17.2 �/24.2). The specific
causes of death are shown in Table II.
Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier cumulative
mortality estimates. As shown in Panel (a), the
mortality rate at 48 months among women who
reported sex-trade involvement at baseline was
15.1% vs 7.0% among non-sex-trade workers (logrank: p �/0.046). As shown in Panel (b), the mortality rate among those with HIV infection at baseline
was 21.9% vs 9.1% among those who were not HIV
infected at baseline (log-rank: p B/0.001). Finally, as
shown in Panel (c), the mortality rate among those
with unstable housing at baseline was 15.0% vs 9.8%
among those who lived in stable housing (log-rank:
p �/0.037).
We then considered fixed and time-updated variables in Cox regression analyses as shown in Table
III. With the exception of age, number of years
injecting, history of sexual abuse and previous non
fatal overdose that were fixed at baseline, all other
variables were time dependant. In univariate analyses the number of years injecting (relative hazard

higher than deaths exhibited by the general female
British Columbia population. Elevated rates of

primarily related to overdose, homicide, and HIV/
AIDS.
The fact that so many addicted women are dying
in Vancouver from non-AIDS related conditions is
an indicator of their extreme vulnerability (Cohen et
al., 2002). Previous studies have demonstrated that
homelessness and living in shelters is associated with
elevated frates of violence, rape, recruitment into the
sex-trade and injection drug use among women
(Fisher et al., 1995; Wechsberg et al., 2003). We
recognize that unstable housing was independently
associated with mortality in our analyses because it is
likely a marker for these underlying risk factors


which are highly prevalent in this setting (Kushel et
al., 2003). While our findings would suggest that
shelters, low-income housing, and other interventions known to potentially prevent these deaths
should be expanded, it is noteworthy that in British
Columbia, funding for services for at risk women
have recently been markedly reduced (United Nations, 2003). Further, studies have demonstrated
that, in such environments, women may trade sex for
basic necessities including food and shelter (Miller &
Neaigus, 2002; Spittal et al., 2003). Sex trade
involvement was associated with death in our setting
although this did not attain statistical significance.

However, we had diminished power to detect such
an association as more than 82% of women in our
study reported sex trade involvement. Any association of sex trade with mortality is likely due, in part,
to the fact that street level sex trade workers are often
forced to work in environments, such as remote and
unlit areas, that leave them particularly vulnerable to
predation and violence (Fisher et al., 1995; Wechsberg et al., 2003). Presently, sex workers have very
limited opportunity to access adequate services at
night and in appropriate locations where they may be
at highest risk (Spittal & Schechter, 2001). In order
to reduce harm experienced by sex-trade workers,
innovative models that have been effective elsewhere
need to be implemented in consultation with experiential women (Ellen et al., 2001; Lowman, 2004;
Lowman & Fraser, 1996). In addition, others have
noted that unless an evidence-based socio-legal
environment is created that puts the safety of sextrade workers first, ongoing harms will persist (Lowman, 2004).
Fatal overdose and HIV-related mortality are well
recognized to be preventable causes of death (Tyndall et al., 2001). The number of deaths due to
overdose is of grave concern. However, it is noteworthy that these data were derived prior to the
opening of North America’s first supervised injection
facility and it is hoped that this intervention will help
to reduce the burden of avoidable deaths among
addicted women (Kerr & Palepu, 2001). However, it
has been previously demonstrated that there are
substantial gender differences in risk of HIV-infection and overdose death, and it has been noted that
there must be continued efforts to mainstream
gender based concerns into overall drug strategies
(Remis, 2002; Spittal et al., 2002). Equally distressing are the numbers of women who are dying from
AIDS related illness despite access to free antiretroviral therapy. Over 5 years ago, Strathdee et al.
conducted a study exploring the barriers to the use
of free antiretrovirals among IDU in British Columbia and found that women were half as likely to
receive HIV treatment (Strathdee et al., 1998).
Subsequently, we demonstrated that women and
Aboriginal people continue to die from HIV/AIDS


related illness without ever accessing the benefits of
HIV treatment and care (Wood et al., 2003b). In
light of these data, progress must be made in
addressing the barriers to HIV care for women,
particularly for those who remain addicted and
engaged in prostitution (Wood et al., 2003a). The
challenges faced by women must be incorporated
into culturally appropriate training programmes for
HIV clinicians and alternative models of the delivery
of sustained care must be urgently considered
(Burke et al., 2003; Mellins et al., 2003; Wood et
al., 2003). We have also recently demonstrated the
substantial harms of limited access to addiction
treatment in our setting (Wood et al., 2004), and it
is noteworthy that while use of methadone was
protective for male IDUs, the use of methadone
was not associated with reduced mortality among
female IDUs. Future studies will be required to
examine barriers addiction treatment for addicted
women, and why methadone was not protective
against mortality in our setting.
As previously discussed, although we have previously demonstrated that the cohort appears to be
highly representative of IDUs in the Downtown
Eastside, VIDUS is not a random sample. We should
also note that we used a crude definition of unstable
housing that included single room occupancy hotels
(SROs), shelters or other transitional housing, or
living on the street. Similarly, sex-trade was similarly
loosely defined as trading sex for money, drugs,
shelter, or anything else in exchange. However,
previous studies have demonstrated that all definitions of housing and sex-trade generally have limitations, and it is noteworthy that if misclassification
existed due to our broad definitions, this would have
biased our analyses towards no association (Culhane
et al., 2001; Spittal et al., 2003). In Vancouver,
women injection drug users have rates of mortality
almost 50 times that of the general British Columbian population, and sex-trade, unstable housing,
and HIV-infection were associated with mortality.
International experts in the area of drug policy and
public health have argued that rates of avoidable
mortality among drug users is a barometer of the
effectiveness of drug strategies (Hickman et al


-----

2003). As such, our data suggest that Canada’s drug
strategy is desperately failing addicted women. Without supportive access to voluntary HIV testing,
counselling and treatment services, and increased
availability of safe housing more women will die. Our
findings reinforce the need for an appropriate
evidence-based drug strategy (Oscapella, 1995),
and demonstrate that further inaction on the part
of policy-makers will likely result in continued
elevated mortality rates among women in this setting
(Lowman, 2004).
