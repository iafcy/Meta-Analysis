**SUMMARY**

_Aim: To determine the mortality in a cohort of very young injecting drug users (IDUs), and the factors associated with it._
_Design: A database linkage prospective (follow-up) cohort study._
_Setting: A convenience sample of clients of 2 low-threshold facilities, 1 drug treatment clinic, and one special facility for children with severe_
behavioural disorders, who were all younger than 19 and older than 15, was interviewed one or more times in 1996-8 and asked to agree with
their being interviewed again after 10 or more years.

_Participants: 151 (65 male, 86 female) IDUs recruited in October 1996 – December 1998._
_Measurement: Database linkage study compared unique identifiers (IDs) of the recruited subjects with the general register of deaths to determine_
the life status, and the causes of death of those deceased. Where necessary, we examined the death protocols directly.

_Findings: Altogether, 8 deaths were registered between recruitment and 31st December 2008 (1,660 person-years). All the deceased were male,_
and all their deaths were “unnatural” – that is, caused by drug overdose or accident. This translates into the crude mortality rates for the whole
cohort being 4.8 deaths per 1,000 person-years (PY), and into a specific mortality ratio in the males SMR=14.4 with the peak at the age of 15–20
(SMR=60.1), declining to SMR=8.2 at the age of 25–30. Except gender, we found no “predictors of death” in this high-risk cohort.

_Conclusion: The overall mortality in the cohort was substantially higher than in the general population; in the male part of the cohort of young_
injecting drug users it was excessively high in the first three years after recruitment, and caused by external causes exclusively; the mortality in
the female sub-cohort was zero, i.e. lower than in the general population of the same age range. Our findings suggest a need to develop targeted
prevention of overdoses and other unnatural deaths in young male drug injectors.

**INTRODUCTION**

The mortality of some illegal drugs users, and IDUs in par­
ticular, is known to be extremely high when compared with the
general population – albeit differing from one group of drug
users to another depending on factors such as sociodemography,
the availability of specialised services, and others – in most of
the “Western world”.

A major review that summarised the results of studies on the
overall mortality of drug users performed in the European Union
Member States in the period from the 1960s through to 2007
found a low level of mutual comparability both in terms of the
methodologies used and the definitions of the target population
(1); however, most of the overall mortality studies studied heroin
injectors and almost all of them recruited exclusively “problem
drug users” as defined by the European Monitoring Centre for
Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), that is, long-term and regular and/
or injecting users of opioids and/or cocaine and/or amphetaminetype drugs (2). The “approximate, modal or typical results” were:
crude mortality rate 1–2% annually, with injectors’ modus at 3%;
overdoses accounted for 20–60% of the overall mortality of drug


users in the studies reviewed, and the proportion of 40% seemed
to be an “average” figure for fatal overdoses as causes of death in
the studies reviewed. Major differences in overall mortality were
found between “high-HIV” and “low-HIV” EU countries; in Italy,
Spain, Scotland and in some German studies, HIV-related deaths
accounted for as much as approximately 40% of the mortality
of drug users. The majority of the studies reviewed (1) reported
standardised mortality ratios (SMR) to be between 10 and 15.

According to a recent review paper with a wider geographic
scope than the previous one, the crude mortality rate (CMR) of
opiate users is estimated to be 2.09 deaths per 100 person-years
(PY) (95% CI; 1.93, 2.26) globally, and the standardised mortality
ratio (SMR) is estimated to be as high as 14.26 (95% CI: 12.82,
16.50), with males having a higher CMR and lower SMR than
females (3). For users of stimulants, fewer studies of sufficient
quality are available; the recent review reports the CMRs as
ranging from 0 in Australia to 2.95 in Thailand; the SMRs were
not found for stimulant users except a 2007 Czech study (4–6).
A new Swedish study of 561 patients admitted to detoxification
in 1970–78 found the SMR to be 5.94, with a large SMR differ­
ence in subjects aged 20–44 (SMR=18) and 45+ (SMR=5). As

for predictors of death, in an Australian study of the mortality of
users of opiates, the only statistically significant predictor was
a prior history of opiate overdoses (7); in other studies, there
are no statistically significant predictors found, and some of the
suspected predictors can be rather seen as “proxies” of “chaotic
lives” – typically, history of a frequent imprisonment, or the
reported use of “drug cocktails” in one injection (for the concept
of the “chaotic live proxies”, see, e.g., 8).

**MATERIAL AND METHODS**

In 1995–1998, Csemy ran a set of surveys and field studies in
different groups of adolescents and young adults using and not
using drugs; the studies were parts of a broader project seeking
predictors of several types of risky behaviours (9). One of the
groups studied consisted of 183 injecting drug users younger than
nineteen and older than fifteen years of age. All the members of
this group were interviewed thoroughly, answering questions on
their social and demographic status, their drug career, and a set of
other questions. Field researchers asked every study participant
to agree with their further participation in a follow-up study that
would include further interviews “after 10 or more years after
recruitment” within the process of informing them about the study
and their signing an informed consent. Of the 183 participants ap­
proached, 151 agreed and were included in the reported follow-up
study. The main characteristics of our sample are shown in Table 1.

In 2010, we conducted a database linkage study in order to exam­
ine the life status of the 151 participants who agreed to be followed
up. The IDs used for linkage of the database of participants in the
1990s study with the general mortality register was their personal
ID enciphered by the control sum-based one-way ciphering program
“EpiCrypt”, which is approved for use in similar studies by the
Czech Office for Personal Data Protection as unbreakable by any
other means than a brute force attack, which is seen by this national
data protection authority as technically unreasonable (10). We used
the STATA 11 statistical package for data management and analysis.

**_Table 1. The sample characteristics_**


**RESULTS**

We followed our cohort for 1,659.7 person-years (M 676.3 PY,
F 983.4 PY), of which the heroin users were followed for 692.0
PY, users of pervitin (methamphetamine) for 863.2 PY, and us­
ers of other drugs for 104.6 PY. After linking the databases, we
identified 8 cases of death in our cohort in the period between their
recruitment and 31st December 2008. After a careful verification
of the death causes and in cases where the ICD-10 coding (11)
in the general mortality database was absent or ambivalent, we
identified the deaths, their causes and principal characteristics of
the deceased as summarised in Table 2.

All of the cases of death were found in males; in females, no
death was registered during the follow-up period; this represents
a level of mortality “lower” than expected in the standardised
female population. All the cases of death were “unnatural” – that
is, caused by external causes. Four deaths (numbers 2–5 in Table
2; 50% of all those identified) were caused by a lethal overdose
of an illegal drug; another fatal overdose (No. 1 in Table 2) was
a suicide committed with cyanide and yet another lethal overdose
(No. 8 in Table 2) was caused by (legal) alcohol. The remaining
two deaths were (violent) accidents, with one of the two cases (No.
6 in Table 2) representing another suspected suicide (hit by a train).

Our findings represent high crude mortality rates of 1.48% per
year for males, and 0.48% per year for the whole cohort. Given the
extremely young age of the cohort members, this translates into a
very high specific mortality ratio for males (SMR=14.4) with the
peak at the age of 15–20 (SMR=60.1), declining to SMR=8.2 at
the age of 25–30. The highest SMR was found in the male heroin
injectors aged 15–19 (point estimate 127.8); the peak of mortality
for methamphetamine (pervitin) occurred somewhat later, in the
20–24 age group (for details, see Table 3; for survival estimate
of males in the cohort and the cumulative hazard estimates for
both genders see Figures 1 and 2, respectively).

We attempted to find “predictors” of death, using as independ­
ent variables the sociodemographic data, variables related to drug
career, data covering mental health and family anamnesis, and

SMR estimates the excess of mortality rate of the cohort that was followed as compared with a standardised population, i.e. with the mor­
tality of the “average” population of the same country with a gender and age structure identical to the cohort that was followed.

variables related to contacts with helping institutions, all of which
were gathered by Csemy’s study in the 1990s (9). Altogether,
we performed a set of statistical tests using 52 independent vari­
ables; however, in this phase of the study, we found no statisti­
cally significant predictors of death in our cohort except gender
(p<0.001). Similarly, we did not find any statistically significant
proportional hazard model.

**DISCUSSION**

The recruitment took part in the declining phase of the first
(and, so far, last) heroin epidemic, which hit the Czech Republic
in the early 1990s and was particularly pronounced and visible
in the capital city, Prague, and in Western Bohemia (for details,
see, e.g., 12–15). Early after the fall of communism, problem

drug use was less concentrated in the marginalised and socially
disadvantaged strata of society than in countries with a longer drug
history, and the Czech Republic nowadays: of the 151 members of
our cohort, only eleven people were homeless/living on the street,
and 100 of the study participants lived with their parents at the
time of recruitment, when they were using the service(s) specified
in Table 1. Despite the relatively low number of members in our
cohort, which represents its main limitation, the relatively long
follow-up period makes our study unique since to the best of our
knowledge it is the only prospective cohort study covering quite
different periods of the Czech “drug history”.

Most of the deaths occurred at a very young age and relatively
shortly after recruitment; as it is obvious in the cumulative hazard
function, after a “high-risk” period that is as long as 3 years after
recruitment, a long plateau followed, with two deaths at the end of
the follow-up period (see Fig. 2). Except one suicidal poisoning,

all these early deaths were caused by drug overdoses – despite the
fact that our cohort includes larger number of methamphetamine
injectors, three fatal overdoses were caused by heroin, and only
one by methamphetamine, which is probably related to the dif­
ferent levels of toxicity of the two substances (16). Our findings
are also in accord with the results of other studies of mortality
among drug users, which show higher potential for overdoses in
opiates than in stimulants, and point out the extremely elevated
risk of fatal overdoses (and deaths in general) in young male
injectors in the first years of their injecting careers (3, 4, 17–19).

The comparison of our results with much larger cohorts from
Czech retrospective studies of the mortality of medical in-patients
and/or patients of opiate substitution treatment (OST) (5, 20)
shows that the survival probabilities in our study are substantially
lower (Fig. 1) than those found in the two extensive retrospective
studies; in Table 4, we show the survival probabilities found in
the larger and more recent retrospective study (20), where the
cohort was recruited from patients of in-patient facilities and OST
patients in 1997–2007. This difference in survival probabilities
may be explained by the very young age in our cohort, and by
the fact that most of the cohort participants were recruited in
low-threshold facilities – that is, in facilities providing services
to those users of illegal drugs who are not able and/or willing
to cease their drug use (usually high-risk injecting drug use) at
that moment; by definition, this is the second most vulnerable
population of drug users (next to non-institutionalised problem
drug users (see, e.g., 21, 22)).

In our study, all the deaths were violent and as such, prevent­
able. Since naïve, young and relatively inexperienced drug users
are those most at risk not only in terms of deaths, but also in terms
of other health hazards such as blood-borne infections related
to drug use (23, 24). Thus, our findings further stress the public
health’s need to develop interventions targeting this group of new
injectors in order to protect their lives and health in general, such
as active support for switching from injecting to other patterns
of drug use with similar perceived drug effects (25), or the safe
injecting rooms/facilities that are increasingly being introduced
in the cities of the EU, Australia and the Americas (26).

**CONCLUSION**

The mortality in the male part of the cohort of young injecting
drug users recruited in 1996–1998 in Prague was excessively high
in the first three years after recruitment and all cases of death were
caused by external causes exclusively. The mortality in females
was zero, i.e. lower than in the general population of the same age


group, and substantially lower than in other studies that included
female drug users both abroad and in the Czech Republic.

Our findings suggest a need to develop targeted prevention
strategy aimed at danger of overdoses and other unnatural causes
of death in very young male drug injectors, and in new, “naïve”
IDUs. Introduction and support for innovative harm reduction
measures specific to these overlapping target groups should be
considered in the Czech Republic.
