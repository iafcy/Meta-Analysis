**ABSTRACT**

**Aims** To examine changes in causes of death in a cohort treated for opioid dependence, across time and age; quantify
years of potential life lost (YPLL); and identify avoidable causes of death. Design People in New South Wales (NSW)
who registered for opioid substitution therapy (OST), 1985–2005, were linked to a register of all deaths in Australia.
**Setting** NSW, Australia. Measurements Crude mortality rates (CMRs), age–sex-standardized mortality rates
(ASSRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) across time, sex and age. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were
calculated with reference to Australian life tables and by calculating years lost before the age of 65 years.
**Findings** There were 43 789 people in the cohort, with 412 216 person-years of follow-up. The proportion of
the cohort aged 40+ years increased from 1% in 1985 to 39% in 2005. Accidental opioid overdoses, suicides, transport
accidents and violent deaths declined with age; deaths from cardiovascular disease, liver disease and cancer
increased. Among men, 89% of deaths were potentially avoidable; among women, 86% of deaths were avoidable.
There were an estimated 160 555 YPLL in the cohort, an average of 44 YPLL per decedent and an average of
29 YPLL before age 65 years. Conclusions Among a cohort of opioid-dependent people in New South Wales,
1985–2005, almost nine in 10 deaths in the cohort were avoidable. There is huge scope to improve mortality among
opioid-dependent people.

**Keywords** Ageing, heroin, injecting drug use, mortality, opioid dependence.

**INTRODUCTION**

Elevated mortality rates and excess mortality have been
well described in opioid-dependent populations in developed countries. Dependent opioid users in these countries
may be 15 times more likely to die than their non-opioidusing peers [1]. Drug overdose is the most common cause
of death and chronic diseases, suicide and injury also
contribute to excess mortality [1–3].
In recent decades changes have been observed in the
contribution of different causes of death to premature
mortality in opioid users. For example, AIDS-related
deaths in Italy and Spain increased throughout the
1980s and 1990s, and then decreased after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy [2,4–6].
Recent studies have reported an increased contribution


of liver disease [7,8] and cancer [9] to mortality in
Australian cohorts. Few studies, however, have described
the full range of causes of death in this population and
how they have varied over time and with age [1,10]. This
is a particularly pertinent issue given the ageing of
opioid-dependent populations in Australia and western
Europe [11,12].
A second important public health consideration is to
what extent deaths among opioid-dependent people are
avoidable, given current knowledge about effective preventive and health care [13]. Analysis of ‘avoidable
mortality’ and years of potential life lost may identify
potential targets for intervention [10]. Avoidable mortality includes conditions in which current health care may
reduce case fatality, as well as conditions for which there
are effective preventive interventions [13].


-----

We were able to examine causes of death and potentially avoidable mortality in a cohort of all opioiddependentpeoplewhoenteredopioidsubstitutiontherapy
(OST) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between
1985 and 2005. Our aims were to (i): describe changes in
causes of death across time and age group (ii); quantify
years of potential life lost; and (iii) identify potentially
avoidable causes of death in an Australian population of
opioid-dependent people seeking treatment.

**METHODS**

**Data sources and linkage**

Data for this study were derived from the Pharmaceutical
Drugs of Addiction System (PHDAS) database and the
National Death Index (NDI).The PHDAS contains records
of all people in New South Wales (NSW) who register for
opioid substitution treatment. Records for all people registering for OST during the calendar years 1985–2005
were linked probabilistically to the NDI, a statutory register of all deaths, including cause of death, in Australia.
Linkage was performed by staff at the Australian Institute
of Health and Welfare (the NDI data custodian) using an
in-house probabilistic record linkage program called
REMA (REcord MAtcher). The variables used for matching included full name, date of birth, sex and date and
State of last known contact.

**Measurements and coding**

Causes of death were recorded in the NDI using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 9 (for
deaths occurring 1985–96) and version 10 (1997–
2005). Using data coded using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 in
Australia for 1997 and 1998, we found ICD-9 and
ICD-10 groupings to be consistent [14].
The most common causes of death were classified
according to the categories defined in Randall et al. [15].
This coding scheme is intentionally neither mutually
exclusive nor exhaustive. Deaths were classified as drugrelated (with subordinate categories of accidental opioidrelated or accidental other drug-related), unintentional
injuries (with subordinate category of motor vehicle accident), violence, suicide, liver-related (with subordinate
categories of chronic liver disease and viral hepatitis),
cardiovascular, cancer, HIV, alcohol-related, chronic respiratory disease and respiratory infections.
A set of mutually exclusive causes of death was also
coded, with the most common causes of death given
prominence. Mutually exclusive categories were: accidental opioid-related, accidental other drug-related, suicide,
motor vehicle accidents, violence, liver-related, cardiovascular, cancer and HIV, with all other deaths coded as


‘other’. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes included in each category are available in the online appendix.
We followed Page et al. [13] in classifying conditions
into the broad ‘avoidable’ category, that included ‘amenable’ causes—for which existing health-care interventions could reduce case fatality—and ‘preventable’
causes—mortality which could be avoided through prevention at the individual and/or population level through
life-style and environmental modification or health
policy. Their taxonomy of conditions was applied to the
causes of death in our cohort (for details of all conditions
see [13]). It is important to note that we have reported
only the overarching category of ‘avoidable’ because of
changes over the study period in availability of effective
prevention and treatment interventions and access to
these interventions.The intent with these analyses was to
estimate the extent of avoidable mortality (regardless of
whether or not it could be avoided through prevention or
treatment). While there may have been some changes to
causes of deaths considered ‘avoidable’ during the study
period, Page et al. applied their taxonomy to Australian
deaths between 1997 and 2001, and the bulk of the
deaths in our data (82%) occurred after 1995.

**Data analysis**

All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 [16].
Total and cause-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) and
Poisson 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
from the number of deaths and the number of personyears (PY) follow-up. PY were calculated by age, calendar
year and sex, from the first treatment registration until
death or 31 December 2005, whichever occurred first.
Directly age–sex–standardized mortality rates (ASSRs,
standardized to the average age and sex profile of the
cohort) and Poisson 95% CI were calculated and year
group (1985–89, 1990–94, 1995–99, 2000–05) was
entered into a Poisson regression model adjusted for age
group and sex to determine the significance of trends in
standardized mortality over time. Standardized mortality
ratios (SMRs) with Poisson 95% CI were calculated as the
observed number of deaths divided by the expected
number of deaths, with age-, sex- and year-specific mortality rates in the NSW population used to calculate the
expected number of deaths.
We compared the percentage of avoidable deaths in
the cohort by sex to the percentage of these causes of
death in the general Australian population for 15–64year-olds in order to achieve a reasonably comparable age
group.
Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated in
two ways. First, we used Australian life tables available on
[the Australian Bureau of Statistics website (http://](http://www.abs.gov.au)
[www.abs.gov.au). Life tables by year and sex were avail-](http://www.abs.gov.au)


-----

able from 1993 to 2005; for 1985 to 1992, the 1993 life
tables were used. For each death, the number of years of
potential life lost was determined by the difference
between the average life expectancy for someone of the
same age and sex in that calendar year, and the age at
death of the cohort member. Secondly, we calculated the
number of years of life lost before the age of 65. This is
the YPLL method used by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [17].

**Ethical approval**


Approval for the study was obtained from the NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee
and the University of New South Wales Human Research
Ethics Committee.

**RESULTS**


The study cohort included 43 789 people; 28 939 men
(66%) and 14 860 women. There was a total of 412 216
PY of follow-up, with a median follow-up duration of 8.7
years. The age profile of the cohort changed over time,
with the proportion of the cohort aged 40 years or older
increasing from 1% in 1985 to 39% in 2005 (Cochrane–
Armitage trend test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The sex profile of
the cohort also changed, with the proportion of men in
the cohort increasing from 57% in 1985 to 65% in 2005
(Cochrane–Armitage trend test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1).

**Mortality over time**


due to unintentional injuries (n = 975; 26% of all deaths)
and suicide (n = 484; 13% of all deaths).
There was a dramatic decrease in standardized drugrelated mortality rates from 1999–2000 to 2001–02
(Table 1, Fig. 2). Furthermore, there were strong
increases in accidental injury mortality rates across the
follow-up period (Table 1). It is important to note that
there may have been period and cohort effects in these
mortality rates which it is difficult to disentangle.
The overall age-, sex- and year-standardized mortality
ratio was 6.5 (95% CI = 6.3–6.7), indicating that our
cohort had 6.5 times the rate of mortality than that
expected in the population. Cause-specific excess mortality across time is shown in Table 2. The causes with the
greatest excess mortality rates were viral hepatitis (SMR
46.3; 95% CI = 38.5–55.2) and drug-related deaths
(SMR 39.9; 95% CI = 38.0–41.8).
Table 3 shows that women were significantly more
likely than men to die of cardiovascular disease
(P = 0.03), cancer (P = 0.03) or violence (P = 0.002),
while men were significantly more likely than women to
die of suicide (P = 0.05). There were clear trends in
causes of death with increasing age. Accidental opioid
overdoses (P < 0.0001), suicides (P < 0.0001), motor
vehicle accidents (P < 0.0001) and violent deaths
(P = 0.003) all declined with age, while deaths related
to cardiovascular disease (P < 0.0001), liver disease
(P < 0.0001) and cancer (P < 0.0001) increased with
age.

**Avoidable mortality**


There were 3685 deaths in the cohort between 1985 and
2005 for a crude mortality rate of 894 per 100 000 PY
(95% CI = 865, 923) (Table 1). The majority of deaths
were drug-related (n = 1932; 52%), with most of these
(n = 1574; 82% of all drug-related deaths) coded as accidental opioid deaths. The bulk of remaining deaths were


Eighty-eight per cent (3240 of 3685) of all cohort deaths
were from potentially avoidable causes: 89% of deaths in
men and 86% of deaths in women. To provide a comparison for illustrative purposes, 73% of deaths among the
Australian population aged 15–64 years from 1997 to
2001 were considered avoidable [13].

**Years of potential life lost (YPLL)**

Using the Australian life tables approach, there was an
estimated 160 055 YPLL in this cohort, an average of 44
YPLL per person who died, and 29 years of YPLL before
age 65 (Table 4). Just under half (45%) of the YPLL were
due to accidental opioid-related deaths (an average loss
of 46 years of potential life, or 31 years prior to age 65).


Motor vehicle accidents accounted for the highest
average YPLL, 47 years, or 33 years before age 65.

**DISCUSSION**

We have reported mortality over 21 years in all people
entering OST at some point between 1985 and 2005 in

NSW. This cohort is likely to represent the majority of
opioid-dependent people in that State during this period,
perhaps as high as 80% [18]. The proportion of males in
the cohort increased marginally over time. The cohort
aged significantly over the study period, reflecting a combination of the ageing of cohort members who enrolled
early in the study period and lower rates of younger
entrants in the latter part of the study period. This ageing
effect has been noted in other Australian studies of people
who inject drugs as well as opioid users. One potential
reason for this trend could be the Australian ‘heroin
shortage’ (discussed in more detail below) beginning
in 2001. From 2001, there is good evidence that
population-level drug injecting decreased [19] as did
blood-borne virus (BBV) notifications among young


people [20]. Younger injectors may have ceased injecting
following the reduction in heroin supply and there were
fewer new initiates to heroin use [21]. Since 2001, surveillance studies of needle and syringe programme
attendees [22] and regular drug injectors sampled in the
Illicit Drug Reporting System [18,23,24] have documented steady increases in the average age of injectors.
The substantial increase in accidental drug-induced
deaths during the mid to late 1990s coincided with ready
availability of heroin in major Australian drug markets

[25]. This was followed by a substantial decrease in
drug overdose mortality in 2001 that coincided with a
decrease in heroin availability and an increase in its price
in Australia [26] after the beginning of 2001 and was
sustained for the remainder of the study period [27–29].


-----

Further impacts of the Australian ‘heroin shortage’ have
been discussed in detail elsewhere [27,30].
Liver disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer
became increasingly important sources of mortality over
time. It is likely that this trend will continue in the future,
as the cohort ages. These findings agree with the results
of similar analyses of mortality in the United Kingdom,
where mortality from chronic diseases increasingly dominates mortality in opioid users over 40 years of age [31].
Our examination of mortality due to various causes in
a population of Australian opioid users found different
results from opioid-dependent cohorts in Spain [4]. The
higher HIV-related mortality in Spain reflects the much
lower levels of HIV infection among Australian users,
thanks in part to the HIV prevention effects of the early
introduction of OST and needle and syringe programmes
(NSPs) in the mid-1980s [32,33].
The average of 44 years of potential life lost for each
fatality in the cohort highlights the fact that deaths in
opioid users often occur at a young age. This was particularly the case for avoidable causes of death such as drug
overdose and injuries. The pattern of YPLL was broadly
similar to previous analyses of a Californian male cohort
(n = 581) in the United States, followed from 1962 to
1997 [10]. Both studies found that opioid overdoses were
the largest contributor to YPLL, but suicides made a
larger contribution toYPLL in our cohort, and homicide a
larger contribution in the Californian cohort. An additional, striking difference was that the averageYPLL prior
to the age of 65 years per death was far higher in our
cohort than in the US cohort (mean of 28.7 years versus
18.3 years, respectively).
The results suggest the need for different approaches
to reducing mortality in younger and older opioid users.
The highest mortality risk at younger ages is from overdose, which remains the most frequent cause of death in
this population despite the sustained and substantial
decrease in these deaths since 2001. Enrolment in OST
decreases the risk of fatal overdose significantly [1], but
poor retention [34] means that many clients are exposed
to an elevated overdose risk after treatment cessation
and on re-induction to methadone [34,35]. In previous
analyses of treatment exposure in this cohort, we
observed that at least half of follow-up time was spent out
of treatment [35]. This means that there is clearly substantial room to improve retention rates in OST in this
population and thereby decrease overdoses. There are
additional elevated risks of drug-related mortality in particular following release from prison [36], which is a
common experience for many opioid-dependent people.
In other work with this cohort, four in 10 had had at least
one prison episode between 2000 and 2012 [37].
Additional interventions are needed to reduce overdose deaths when opioid-dependent people are not


enrolled in OST.These include making naloxone available
for peer administration to reduce fatal overdose [38–40]
and measures to reduce overdose mortality after release
from prison [36], where evidence is needed urgently on
effective preventive interventions. Safe injection facilities
can probably reduce overdose events in those who use
them, but their limited scale of operation in most of the
countries that allow them suggests that these facilities
will have limited impact on opioid overdose mortality at a
population level [41].
In older opioid-dependent people there are higher
rates of death due to chronic diseases, reflecting
increased risks of chronic infection with BBV such as
HCV [42], heavy and dependent alcohol use [43] and
cigarette smoking [43]. Although HIV is not prevalent
among opioid-dependent people in Australia [44], this is
an additional risk for mortality in many populations of
opioid users world-wide [1]. Targeted prevention and
treatment strategies are clearly needed. These include
HCV screening and treatment [45]; HBV vaccination

[46]; HIV prevention and treatment [33]; screening for
and treatment of hazardous alcohol use; and smoking
cessation interventions.
Older OST clients are likely to have a broader range of
physical and mental health problems for which they
might seek treatment [47,48]. These could be delivered
via OST clinics dealing with an ageing population with
better retention in older users. It is also important to consider alternative platforms where this population may
present or receive other health interventions and where
preventive interventions may still be delivered, including
general practice, hospital emergency departments and
aged care services [49].

**Limitations**

This study has several limitations. First, it relied on
administrative data sets that were not designed for
research purposes. The two data sets were linked
probabilistically, creating a potential for errors in linkage.
We believe that the linkage accuracy is high, given the
similarity in our overall mortality patterns to that in Australian cohort of illicit drug users, where more detailed
individual information was used to link to causes of death

[50]. Secondly, although our cohort is comprised of
opioid users who sought treatment, sentinel surveillance
studies of people who inject drugs (98% of whom have a
history of heroin use) suggest that half the opioiddependent population are in OST at any time, and more
than 80% report at least one episode of OST [18,23,24].
Thus, we believe that our cohort is reasonably representative of dependent opioid users in NSW. Thirdly,
although we identified a cohort of people who were
opioid-dependent upon treatment entry, not all people


-----

would have remained dependent for the entire period of
follow-up. This means that we are not necessarily tracking mortality in actively dependent opioid users. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that many
remained actively opioid-dependent. For example, among
those who entered OST between 1985 and 1994 and who
were still alive on 1 January 1995 (n = 17 253), 11 060
(64%) had an episode of treatment in the period 1995–
2006. This suggests that the great majority of our cohort
were opioid-dependent across the study period. In so far
as a proportion of this cohort was not, then our study
findings have underestimated mortality among opioiddependent people. Additionally, there are some exposures
that occur during periods of active opioid use (e.g.
hepatitis/HIV infection) whose consequences (e.g. AIDS
and viral hepatitis-related deaths) persist even if opioid
use ceases, so mortality related to these causes does not
necessarily lessen with abstinence.

**CONCLUSIONS**

This study documented elevated mortality among opioiddependent people, and a large loss of years of life because
of the early age at which many deaths occurred. Accidental drug overdose was the largest contributor to death,
especially among younger users, and contributed most to
YPLL. As this cohort has aged, the profile of deaths has
changed. Strategies to reduce deaths vary with age. In
younger users, it is desirable to increase retention in OST
to reduce overdose deaths and provide naloxone to reduce
deaths outside treatment. In older adults, strategies to
reduce BBV infection and liver disease and cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases need to be the focus.

**Declaration of interests**

Louisa Degenhardt has received untied educational grant
funding from Reckitt Benckiser (RB) to conduct postmarketing surveillance of buprenorphine–naloxone in
Australia. The design, conduct, reporting and interpretation of the results of that work were determined by the
study investigators. RB had no knowledge of this paper.
