**1. Introduction**


#### a b s t r a c t

The study aimed to determine mortality rates, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), and correlates of
mortality amongst the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS) cohort of 615 heroin users over
the period 2001–2009. The cohort was followed for a total of 4820.1 person years. A total of 31 deaths
(5% of the cohort) occurred across follow-up. The mean age at death was 34.5 years, and 58% were
male. The most common cause of death was overdose (68%). The crude mortality rate was 6.43 per
1000 person years, with no gender difference, and the SMR was 4.56 (males = 2.95, females = 18.57). The
only significant bivariate (hazard ratio = 3.69) and multivariate (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.03) correlate of
mortality was a history of opioid overdose prior to baseline. Mortality rates were lower than those seen
outside Australasia. Screening for overdose by those treating heroin users would be appropriate, and may
contribute to reductions in overall mortality.

Globally, opioids make the largest contribution to illicit drugrelated death, carry a higher mortality risk than other commonly
used drugs, and are associated with annual mortality rates typically ranging between one and three percent (Bartu et al., 2004;
Darke et al., 2007a; Miller et al., 2007; Bauer et al., 2008; Bird,
2010; Stenbacka et al., 2010). It is worth noting that mortality
rates vary considerably by geographic region. Rates appear highest in Asia, being approximately twice those of western Europe,
three times those of North America and five times those of Australasia (Zhang et al., 2005; Bargagli et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007;
Quan et al., 2007; Azim et al., 2008; Vlahov et al., 2008; Degenhardt
et al., 2009; Bird, 2010). This may reflect differences in underlying
regional population mortality rates, as well as differences in access
to drug treatment and health care.
The major causes of death are overdose, disease (predominantly AIDS), suicide and trauma (Bartu et al., 2004; Antolini et al.,
2006; Soyka et al., 2006; Bargagli et al., 2006; Darke et al., 2007a;
Degenhardt et al., 2009). The relative contribution of these, however, varies considerably across countries. In countries with a high
HIV seroprevalence amongst injecting drug users (IDU), AIDS is a
major cause of death, while in low prevalence countries overdose,

suicide and trauma play far greater roles (Oppenheimer et al., 1994;
Antolini et al., 2006; Bargagli et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2008; Soyka
et al., 2006; Vlahov et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). A number
of predictors of mortality have been identified. These include not
being enrolled in drug treatment, injecting as a route of administration, HIV positive serostatus, older age, a longer heroin using career,
polydrug use, the presence of clinically significant psychopathology
and a suicide history (Quaglio et al., 2001; Bartu et al., 2004; Brugal
et al., 2005; Soyka et al., 2006; Darke et al., 2007a; Azim et al., 2008;
Bauer et al., 2008; Clausen et al., 2008; Stoove et al., 2009). Baseline
predictors are of potentially great clinical importance for determining the mortality risk of patients at treatment in-take, which may
affect treatment delivery.
The current study aimed to examine mortality rates, and correlates, amongst the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS)
cohort over the period from commencement in February 2001
until October 2009. The cohort consists of entrants to treatment
for heroin dependence in opioid maintenance, detoxification, and
residential rehabilitation, as well as a comparison group of nontreatment users. The Australian setting for the cohort has a HIV
seroprevalence amongst IDU of less than two percent, with population wide access to free health care (Mathers et al., 2008). At
baseline, a wide range of drug use, overdose, psychological, health
and psychosocial measures were collected (Ross et al., 2005). These
data were used to determine what were the clinically important
baseline characteristics predict death over the study period, as in
similar other studies of opioid users (Gossop et al., 2002).

Specifically, the study aimed to:

1. Determine the mortality rates of the ATOS cohort.
2. Determine standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for the cohort,
stratified by gender.
3. Determine bivariate and multivariate associations of baseline
characteristics with mortality rates.

**2. Methods**

2.1. Procedure

The data were collected as part of ATOS. Baseline interviews
were conducted between February 2001 and August 2002, with
three month (89% followed up), 12 month (80%), 24 month (76%)
and 36 month (70%) follow-up interviews conducted. Prior to
recruitment, all treatment agencies in the three modalities across
the greater Sydney region were mapped. Agencies were then randomly selected, stratified by modality and area health service. The
agencies comprised ten methadone/buprenorphine maintenance
(MT) agencies, four drug free residential rehabilitation agencies
(RR) and nine detoxification facilities (DTX). In addition, a group of
heroin users not currently in treatment (NT) were recruited from
needle and syringe programs in the regional health areas from
which treatment entrants were recruited. Ethics approvals were
obtained from the University of New South Wales, and all relevant area health services. Eligibility criteria were: (i) no treatment
for heroin dependence in the preceding month, (ii) no imprisonment in the preceding month, (iii) agreed to give contact details
for follow-up interviews, (iv) aged 18 years or over, and (v) fluent in English. The total baseline cohort was 615 heroin users: MT
(n = 201), DTX (n = 201), RR (n = 133) and NT (n = 80). Participants
were interviewed at baseline, and at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months postbaseline, and paid A$20 for completion of each interview. A search
of the Australian National Death Index was conducted in October
2009, and details of deaths that had occurred amongst participants
since 2001 was obtained. Participants were matched by full name,
gender and date of birth.

2.2. Structured interview

At baseline, participants were administered a structured interview that included demographics, treatment history, drug use
history, overdose history, suicide history and a range of psychopathology. Drug use, needle sharing, injection-related health
problems and criminal behaviours over the month preceding interview were measured using the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) (Darke
et al., 1992). Current (1 month) global mental and physical health
were measured using the Short-Form 12 (SF12), in which lower
scores indicate poorer health (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10)
(Ware et al., 1996). DSM IV diagnoses of current (1 month) Major
depression and lifetime Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were
obtained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI) (World Health Organization, 1993). Diagnoses of Antisocial
Personality Disorder (ASPD) were obtained from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Robins et al., 1981), modified to obtain
DSM IV diagnoses. International Classification of Diseases (10th
edition) (ICD-10) diagnoses of BPD were obtained using the International Personality Disorders Examination Questionnaire used in
the National Survey of Mental of Health and Wellbeing (Andrews
et al., 1999).

2.3. Statistical analyses

Means and standard deviations were reported for continuous
variables. Person years of follow-up were calculated from baseline


interview date until date of death or censorship at October 2010,
when the search was conducted. Crude mortality rates per 1000
person years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, as were standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) by reference to
age specific death rates in the Australian population (Australian
Bureau of Statistics, 2010). Bivariate Cox proportional hazards
regressions were performed to determine unadjusted hazard ratios
(HR) for baseline characteristics in the domains of demographics,
drug use, overdose, suicide, psychopathology health and crime. In
order to determine independent predictors of mortality, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted. Age,
sex and all variables with a p value <0.1 from the bivariate analyses
were entered into the model. All analyses were conducted using
PASW, Release 18 (SPSS Inc., 2009).

**3. Results**

3.1. Cohort characteristics at baseline

The mean age of participants was 29.3 years (SD 7.8, range
18–56), and 66% were male. The sample had completed a mean
of 10.0 years of secondary education (SD 1.7, range 2–12), 29%
had completed a trade/technical course, and six percent a university degree. The main sources of income were: social security
allowances (46%), criminal activity (24%) and wage/salary (18%).
It should be noted that these are main, and not sole, sources of
income.
The mean age of first intoxication was 13.7 years (SD 3.3, range
2–34 years). The mean age of first heroin use was 19.6 years (SD 5.3,
range 9–43 years), and the mean length of heroin use career at time
of interview was 9.5 years (SD 7.4, range <1–35 years). The sample had used heroin on a mean of 20.1 days (SD 8.1, range 1–28)
in the four weeks preceding interview, 54% reported a history of
heroin overdose, and 8% were non-injectors. The sample had used
a mean of 9.0 (SD 1.7, range 3–11) drug classes in their lives, and
4.8 (SD 1.7, range 2–9) in the preceding month. Ninety percent had
previously been enrolled in a treatment program for opiate dependence. The mean SF12 global physical health score was 43.9 (SD
9.8, range 15.5–65.4) and the mean global health score was 31.7
(SD 11.1, range 8.9–67.3). A diagnosis of current (1 month) major
depression was received by 25%, and 33% has attempted suicide.
Forty one percent met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, 46%
for a diagnosis of BPD and 73% for ASPD.
Across the 36 month follow-up period of ATOS, there was substantial cross-over between treatment modalities (Teesson et al.,
2008). Amongst the NT group, 93% received some form of treatment by 36 months (MT 40%, RR 21%, DTX 50%). Similarly, there
was substantial crossover between baseline treatment groups: MT
(RR 5% and DTX 11%), RR (MT 26% and DTX 36%) and DTX (MT 33%
and RR 37%).

3.2. Mortality

The cohort was followed for a total of 4820.1 PY. A total of 31
deaths (5%) occurred across follow-up, of which 18 (58%) were
male. The crude mortality ratio was 6.43 per 1000 PY (95% CI
4.37–9.13 per 1000 PY), with no significant gender difference
(Table 1). The SMR for the cohort was 4.56 (CI 3.09–6.47). Males
had a SMR of 2.95 (CI 1.75–4.66) and females 18.57 (CI 9.89–31.52).
Causes of death were: overdose (n = 19, 68%), disease (n = 7, 23%)
and suicide (n = 2, 7%). In 3 cases the cause of death was unknown,
due to lags in the National Death Index in providing full details of
a death. Of the 19 known overdose fatalities, 16 had a history of
overdose prior to enrolment in ATOS, and both suicides had made
attempts prior to ATOS enrolment.

-----

The mean age at death was 34.5 years (SD 8.1, range 20–55
years), with no difference between males and females (36.2 v 33.0,
p = 0.28). The mean elapsed time between baseline and death was
4.4 years (SD 2.4, range 0.2–8.0 years), and mean length of heroin
use 15.2 years (SD 8.6, range 1–32 years). There were no differences between the index treatment groups in the proportions of
decedents (p = 0.44): MT (3.5%), RR (7.5%), DTX (5.0%) and NT (5.0%).

3.3. Predictors of mortality

The only significant bivariate association with mortality was a
history of opioid overdose (Table 1). There was no significant difference in mortality rates for those who had overdosed on a single
occasion (11.43 95% CI 5.24–21.72 per 1000 PY) and those who had
overdosed on multiple occasions (8.96, 95% CI 5.12–14.54 per 1000
PY) There were no significant associations with demographic characteristics, length of drug use career, past month heroin and other
drug use, suicide history, psychopathology, baseline health (one
month) or baseline criminal activity (one month).
In order to determine independent predictors of mortality and
adjusted hazard ratios, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression was conducted. Age (years), sex (Male = 1, Female = 0)
and all variables with a p value <0.1 from the bivariate analyses
were entered into the model: baseline benzodiazepine use (Yes = 1,
No = 0), baseline antidepressant use (Yes = 1, No = 0), overdose history (Yes = 1, No = 0), baseline suicide attempt history (Yes = 1,
No = 0). Again, the only significant predictor of mortality was a
history of overdose prior to baseline (Table 1).

**4. Discussion**

Several major findings emerged. First, the cohort died at four and
a half times the expected population rate, and at rates consistent
with earlier Australian studies. Second, overdose was overwhelmingly the major cause of death. Finally, and related to this, overdose
history was the only significant predictor of mortality.
The crude mortality rate of the cohort was consistent with earlier Australian studies of opioid users (Bartu et al., 2004; Digusto
et al., 2004; Tait et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009), and was
substantially lower than those seen in Europe, Asia and North
America (Zhang et al., 2005; Bargagli et al., 2006; Miller et al.,
2007; Quan et al., 2007; Vlahov et al., 2008; Bird 2010). In all probability this reflects the very low rates of HIV infection amongst
Australian opioid users. In all Australian mortality studies conducted to date, disease has played a negligible role in mortality
compared to cohorts from other regions. As noted above, it may also
partially reflect the relative ease of access to free drug treatment in
the Australian health system.
The demographic characteristics of decedents were typical of
opioid deaths worldwide, in that they were predominantly male,
aged on average in their thirties, injectors and had long heroin use
careers. Despite the predominance of male fatalities, there was no
gender difference in mortality rates, which is consistent with the
bulk of studies internationally that report small, or no, gender differences (Oppenheimer et al., 1994; Sanchez-Carbonell and Seus,
2000; Bartu et al., 2004; Darke et al., 2007a; Bargagli et al., 2006;
Bauer et al., 2008; Stenbacka et al., 2010). Consistent with earlier
work, however, female SMRs were substantially higher than those
of males, reflecting the lower base population mortality rate of
females. If the mortality rates of male and female illicit drug users
are similar, as here, the SMR of female drug users will always be
far greater compared to other females, than for male drug users
compared to other males.
Consistent with earlier Australian research, and the status of
Australian IDU as a low HIV seroprevalence population, overdose


dominated the cause of death (Bartu et al., 2004; Digusto et al.,
2004; Tait et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). In the Australian
setting it is the risk of overdose that poses the single greatest threat
to the life of the active heroin user. Interestingly, there was no discernable difference between single or multiple overdose histories
prior to baseline. It is an overdose history per se that is of clinical relevance for mortality risk. The fact that an overdose history
predicted subsequent mortality is consistent with earlier studies
of non-fatal overdose in which a prior history of overdose strongly
predicted future non-fatal overdose (Cook et al., 1998; Powis et al.,
1999; Coffin et al., 2007; Darke et al., 2007c). Amongst the ATOS
cohort over the initial 36 months, an overdose in any one year was
associated with an approximately six fold increase in the risk of an
overdose in the subsequent year (Darke et al., 2007c). The current
study indicates that this risk extends to predicting death. Indeed,
of the 19 known overdose deaths, 16 had overdosed prior to ATOS
enrolment. The data are consistent with retrospective data of those
previously attended for overdose, where overdose was associated
with subsequent risk of overdose mortality (Stoove et al., 2009).
Similarly, both known suicides had histories of suicide attempts,
consistent with the cohort’s pattern of past attempts strongly predicting future ones (Darke et al., 2007b).
The study is also of interest for what did not predict mortality. The most salient example was the absence of difference
between those entering the treatment modalities and those not
seeking treatment. As discussed earlier, treatment is associated
with reduced drug use and mortality (Soyka et al., 2006; Clausen
et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). The natural history of the
cohort, however, eroded the validity of such comparisons. By 12
months, three quarters of the NT group had entered drug treatment, and over 90% had done so by 36 months (Ross et al., 2006;
Teesson et al., 2008). Similarly, there was substantial movement
between the treatment modalities across time, which confounds
any comparative analyses of mortality rates between modalities.
Route of administration also did not predict mortality, despite being
associated with lower rates of non-fatal overdose in the cohort
(Darke et al., 2008), and being associated with lower death rates
in other studies (Bird, 2010). As with treatment, however, comparisons were eroded by the fact that transitions between routes
occurred, primarily from non-injecting to injecting (Darke et al.,
2008). No form of psychopathology predicted death, in all probability reflecting the role of overdose, rather than suicide, as the
predominant cause of death. The absence of health as a predictor
reflects the low rate of HIV amongst Australian opioid users, and the
relative health of the cohort. While the global health of the cohort
was half a standard deviation below the population norm at baseline, by 12 months the cohort average had improved to population
norms (Teesson et al., 2008).
The major implication of this research for treatment agencies
concerns screening for overdose histories. Overdose was the major
cause of death, and a history of overdose increased the risk of death
three fold across follow-up. Indeed, it was only overdose histories that predicted death. Screening for overdose histories would
appear prudent in determining patient risk, both for overdose and
death, and tailoring intervention for high risk patients.
As in all studies, caveats must be borne in mind. First, caution
should be exercised in extending conclusions to other heroin using
populations. The ATOS cohort, like most cohorts, was regular heroin
users, with an extensive previous treatment history. There may well
be differences in mortality rates and correlates amongst less frequent heroin users. It must be borne in mind, however, that the
overwhelming demographics of death amongst heroin users are
long-term users, similar in characteristics to the ATOS cohort. Second, the exclusion of those who had been in prison in the month
prior to baseline interview should be borne in mind, as this is a
high risk period. Third, official statistics are always prone to lags


-----

and possible omissions. We were thus not able to determine the
cause of death for three cases. Finally, the detailed treatment and
life events history of the cohort across the period were unknown,
and follow-up interviews were restricted to 36 months. As noted
above, however, this was a study of clinically relevant baseline
characteristics that might be of use in determining the mortality
risk for new treatment entrants. Also, the natural history of treatment means that any comparison between the modalities would
be confounded by exposure to enrolments in multiple modalities.
In summary, death rates amongst this cohort were lower than
those seen outside Australasia. Overdose dominated the deaths
amongst the cohort, and an overdose history was the sole predictor
of mortality. Screening for overdose by those treating heroin users
would be appropriate, and may contribute to reductions in overall
mortality.
