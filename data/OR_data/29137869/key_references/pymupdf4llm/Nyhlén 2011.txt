Abstract

Background: Few longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric
disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug
related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/
hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades.
Methods: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit
January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data,
substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death
were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the
incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing
risks Cox regression analysis.
Results: Of 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561
patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15
years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model,
male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an
increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a
decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while
chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of
non drug related death.

Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related
premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety
disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in
opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any
impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death.

Background
Drug abusers have an increased risk of premature mortality which is influenced by a number of factors, including types of substances used, patterns of administration,
risk behavior, contracted infectious diseases, gender, age
and life style.
During the period when the studied cohort entered
treatment amphetamine was the single most common
substance of abuse in Sweden nationally as well as in
the local area, where 35-45% of the drug abusers had
amphetamine as the most prevalent substance of abuse

[1,2]. However, in the 1970s substance use patterns in
Sweden changed from a predominance of amphetamine
abuse to include the abuse of opiates as well as other
substances [2]. Most studies report higher mortality for
opiate users than for other substance users [3-7], but a
few studies have found lower mortality rates among the
former [8]. The standardized mortality ratio [SMR] in
more recent studies is still higher in groups that do not
receive opiate agonist treatment such as methadone,
buprenorphine or other opioids [7,9-12].
Overdose is a major cause of death among opiatedependent patients. About 0.7% of opiate dependent
users die every year from an overdose [13]. Several studies of clinical samples have reported that 35-40% of all
deaths in opiate users are overdoses [3,14-18]. Unlike
opiates, cocaine and amphetamine are seldom direct
causes of death [13]. Still, stimulant use has been associated with increased mortality, either due to lifestyle
factors indirectly associated with stimulant use, such as
violent behavior or violent deaths, or with diseases
acquired through intravenous administration [19]. A
recent epidemiological study of a cohort of 100,000 substance users of amphetamine/methamphetamine and
ecstasy in England and Wales 1997-2007 identified an
increasing number of amphetamine deaths from 30 to
70 over this period of ten years [20].
Cannabis, on the other hand, is the most common
substance worldwide, used by as many as 166 million
people per year, but few studies have to our knowledge
evaluated mortality associated with cannabis [21]. We
know of no studies that have examined the particular
long-term risks of death associated with cannabis use in
clinical samples of substance dependent patients.

Influence of psychiatric disorders
The impact of psychiatric disorders on premature mortality in substance abusers has only recently been recognized as an important issue. A few prospective studies
have suggested that some psychiatric disorders may contribute to premature death in drug abusers (15). In a
Swedish cohort study of drug abusers, low levels of psycho-social functioning measured by Global Assessment
of Functioning (GAF) and a high level of psychiatric


symptoms assessed by Symptom Checklist 90 (GSI) at
the 5-year follow-up, predicted mortality at the 15-year
follow-up, whereas abstinence did not [22]. The most
prevalent personality disorder in drug abusers; antisocial personality disorder, was not associated with a
higher level of premature death [19,22].

Aims of the study
To identify predictors of increased risk of drug related
death and non drug related death within a cohort based
on broadly defined psychiatric groups and substance use
of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades.

Methods
Setting and subjects
The setting was an inpatient detoxification and shortterm rehabilitation unit. The ward was a typical low
threshold unit of the period, accepting all drug abusing
patients seeking treatment but only to a minor extent
patients with alcohol dependence. The catchment area
for the unit was the entire county of Scania in southern
Sweden with a population of 977,783 people in 1970,
and of 1,126,606 in 2000. Southern Sweden is an urban
area which in the early 1970s had a low rate of unemployment (5%) which increased to 11% during the observation period.
A national case-finding study estimated that the number of heavy drug abusers in the southern region having
a daily intake of illegal drugs was around 1500 - 2000
persons in 1978, of which 1500 (75%) were injection
drug users [23].
All patients admitted to the detoxification unit January
1970 to February 1978 were included in the cohort. The
admission was completed only after the patient had had
a formal somatic and psychiatric screening and had
completed the intake procedures with laboratory specimens. The cohort was followed up through the Swedish
Central Person Register, death certificates and autopsy
reports were obtained for all subjects who died before
2007, and causes of death were analyzed. For this study
all causes of death were coded according to ICD-10,
based on autopsy reports or, in a few cases, death certificates in addition to hospital records. The study was
approved by the Ethical Committee of Lund University
(LU 22/1983 and Dnr 587/2005).

Assessment at first admission and at follow up
Substance type and other drugs including alcohol were
identified with interviews and validated by mandatory
urine samples. Demographic data, types of substances
used and psychiatric diagnoses were collected in a standardized manner. Standardized clinical interviews (SWEDATE) and hospital records contained background data


-----

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 244X/11/122

and mandatory information on length and intensity of
substance abuse by mode of administration [24]. At
intake all patients received an identification number and
gave verbal consent for participating in the study upon
completing the admission routines. All patients were
evaluated by the senior consultant of psychiatry at the
detoxification ward. A clinical psychologist provided
additional psychological assessment. Patients with psychosis were evaluated both at the detoxification unit
and independently by an external consultant in psychiatry at a special psychosis unit in the same hospital. A
formal diagnosis of psychosis demanded two or more
treatment admissions or a longer observation period in
the unit before a final diagnosis was issued.
The ICD-8 diagnoses were filed at discharge: The psychiatric disorders are in this presentation categorized
into three broad groups represented as dummy variables: psychosis, neurosis and personality disorder. The
neurosis category included depression (minor and major
without psychotic symptoms), and anxiety disorders and
a few cases of phobias. The personality disorders were
anti-social, hysterical and infantile. For the present analysis drug use was re-coded into dichotomous variables,
with 0 representing no use and 1 representing regular
use for each drug on a daily basis, or a minimum of
three days a week, for at least 12 months.
Coding and identifying causes of death
In the follow-up study the patients’ national identification numbers were linked to the Swedish Central Person Register and the Causes of Death Register. The
coverage of deaths in the Swedish Central Bureau of
Statistics (SCB) registers is close to 100%. SCB codes
causes of death are based upon death certificates,
which are issued but not coded by physicians and/or
coroners. All causes of death in the cohort were coded
(ICD-10) by a senior consultant physician (A.N.) and
an associate professor of forensic medicine (P.K.). The
causes of death diagnoses issued by the coroner were
never changed by the researchers. The diagnoses from
the forensic autopsy protocols, including toxicology
tests, as well as the death certificates were coded
according to ICD-10. ICD codes permit classification
of death causes according to the rules specified in the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, published by WHO [25].
ICD-10 provides improved coding possibilities for
many drugs compared to previous versions of ICD.
The first one hundred causes of death were coded
independently (by A.N and P.K). For this study, deaths
were classified as either drug related or non drug
related as defined below. The reliability was good (� =
.98). Only 12 out of 204 ratings differed. The final coding used in the analysis was always based on a mutual
agreement between the two raters.


1. Drug related death
Our definition of drug related death used is the one
adopted by Bargagli [26] and Degenhardt [13]. Drug
related death both refers to those cases where the
underlying cause of death is directly associated with illicit substance use, sometimes in combination with licit
drugs according to death certificates and/or autopsy
protocols, and those cases when substance use disorder
was listed as a contributing cause of death. Preset rules
(a manual of coding) determined if death was drug
related. The decision was based on the total amount of
data present: hospital records, police reports and coroners’ evaluation including toxicology reports, which
always took precedence over other documents.
2. Non drug-related death
Non drug related death was classified as such if death
was caused by somatic diseases or by accidents, suicide
or other violent deaths without illicit or/and licit drugs
or alcohol being involved in the death.

Statistical analysis
The data were subjected to a competing risks Cox
regression to analyze the incidence of drug related premature deaths and non drug related deaths with important covariates. Competing risks procedures make it
possible to estimate the likelihood of an incidence when
other incidences take place that alter the probability of
the event of interest. The significance of the covariates
is reported, as well as their coefficients (B) and the predicted change in the hazard for a unit increase of the
predictor, Exp (B) = Odds Ratios (OR). The competing
risks program, developed by Robert Gray for the R statistical package, was used to estimate the coefficients.
The text of the program published by Pintilie [27]
guided our analysis.
The hypotheses in this study stated that a) different
types of diagnostic classes: psychosis, neurosis and personality disorder, as well as b) patterns of substance use
at first admission predicted premature death many years
later. Two patterns of causes of death were studied:
drug related death versus non drug related death. The
cumulative incidence of premature death was modeled
with these predictors under a competing risk situation.
Models for drug related death were compared with
models of non drug related causes of death. Next, the
subject’s gender and age served as covariates in the
models. To test the hypothesis, a hierarchical procedure
was used starting with age and gender, followed by the
three psychiatric diagnostic classes and finally by the
substance pattern at first admission.
The predictor variables were selected a priori, and
time to death was calculated from the first admission.
Since the ethnic diversity of Sweden today is low, (by
2006, 13% were born in another country, most of them

in Finland [28] and was even lower in the 1970s, adjusting for race or ethnicity was not considered necessary.

Results
Characteristics of the cohort
All patients admitted to the detoxification unit between
January 1970 and February 1978 were included (n =
561). The cohort was characterized by a low degree of
selection, thus resembling drug patterns prevalent
among persons with heavy drug use during the period.
Twenty patients who did not complete the intake examination, did not have a correct identification number,
nor gave verbal consent were excluded from the cohort.
Of the patients included, 31% discontinued the detoxification treatment prematurely, 20% within the first week.
However, these individuals went through the same
admission procedure as the rest of the cohort, and their
data were included in the analyses. There was no association between dropout rate and dominant substance
abuse at the first admission. At follow-up 11 of the 561
individuals were not included, due to clerical errors,
emigration or by failing to locate them by 2006. The
mean observation time was 27.1 years with a range of
one to 37 years.
The sample was predominately male, 70%, and almost
90% were young (m = 24.3 years) at first admission to
detoxification (Table 1). Regular intravenous illegal substance use was reported in 79% of the patients, and of
these were 97% opiate users and 91% amphetamine


users. The patients’ age at first use of drugs was 15.5
years (MD = 15.0, SD = 3.3) for men and 16.2 (MD =
15.0, SD = 4.7) for women.
The drugs most regularly used at first admission,
according to urine testing, were opiates (34%), stimulants (42%), cannabis (51%) and barbiturates (15%).
About 3% of the patients had chronic alcoholism. Abusing two or more substances regularly (poly drug use)
was reported for 59% of the cohort. All substances were
proportionally more common among males than among
females, but only opiates (p < .02) and cannabis (p <
.009) were significant. The deceased individuals were
more likely to have used opiates (c[2] = 10,8, p < .002),
barbiturates (c[2] = 6,71, p < .01), and alcohol (c[2] = 4,52,
p < .03) at first admission compared to those alive in
2006. Patients who were alive at follow-up used amphetamine (c[2] = 4,52, p < .03) and cannabis (c[2] = 13,01, p
< .001) to a greater extent.
In a comparison of the cohort characteristics with the
case-finding study [23], the age in 1978:was 26 vs 27
years and the dominant pattern of substance abuse: opiates 37% vs 28%, and amphetamine 31% vs 32%. The
incidence of injection use was 79% v s 75%. In other
words, the profile was reasonably similar. The major difference was that substance abusers admitted to the
treatment unit had a higher proportion of persons using
cannabis regularly, with 23% vs 8% and more women in
the cohort (31%) compared to the case-finding study
(23%).

The reliability of the original diagnoses (ICD-8) in the
hospital records was good when rated by two independent psychiatrist (� = .97). The most frequent diagnoses
in the group of psychoses (14.4%) were schizophrenia
(4.5%) and substance-induced (toxic) psychosis (6.5%).
The group of patients diagnosed with neurosis (14.8%)
according to ICD-8 mainly included patients with neurotic depression (12%, ICD-8 code; 300.40) and/or anxiety (8%, ICD-8 code; 300.00) and a few patients with
diagnoses of hysteria, phobias, or obsessive-compulsive
neurosis. Affective disorders (ICD-8 codes: 296.00,
298.00) were filed separately. Diagnoses of personality
disorder, mainly anti-social personality disorder, were
issued for 20% of the cohort (ICD-8 codes 301.00 301.99).

Mortality rates
By 2006, 204 of the 561 patients in the cohort were
deceased (36.4%). The age at the time of death for men
was 39.9 years (MD = 39.9, SD = 11.9) and 42.9 (MD =
43.9, SD = 14.6) for women. The age of death for the
youngest man was 17.9 years compared to the youngest
woman (20.9 years). The average age of substance
related death was 35.7 years (MD = 34.9, SD = 10.1)
and for non substance related deaths 47.6 years (MD =
48.5, SD = 12.7).
The crude annual mortality was 1.3%. The SMR was
5.94 (95% CI = 5.5-6.8), compared to the local genderand age matched population computed from data issued
by the Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics [28].

Causes of death
Information of date and place of death was available for
204 dead persons in the cohort. Information of the causes
of death was missing in two cases. The coding of the 204
deceased individuals was based on forensic autopsy
reports (85%) or, to a minor extent, on autopsy reports
from general hospitals (5%). Toxicology reports were
available for 87%. In 10% of the cases no autopsy report
could be retrieved, and the subjects were classified on the
basis of death certificates. In addition, data were also
obtained from hospital records and police reports. The
causes of death for 4 persons who died outside Europe
remained inconclusive. The reliability of drug related versus non drug related causes of death was good when
rated by the two independent experts (AN) and (PK) (� =
.98). The minor inconsistencies between the ratings were
considered non-substantial, as they were related to contributing and not underlying causes of death, and the
final coding was based on a mutual agreement.
Drug related death
Death was drug related in 120 of 204 deaths (59%). Toxicological analyses were available for all of them. In this
group 46 deaths were caused by overdoses of illegal


drugs, of which 43 (94%) involved opiates and 3 (6%)
stimulants. Twenty-nine of 120 deaths (24.2%) were violent ones like suicide, homicide, and accidents. Of the
four patients who died within three month after discharge none died from an overdose. About 40% of substances detected at postmortem examinations were illicit
and about 60% were licit. Alcohol was found postmortem in 23%.
Non drug related death
Somatic diseases (cardiovascular diseases 42%, infections
36%, and cancer 22%) were the primary cause of death
in 59 of 84 non drug related deaths (70%) and the primary cause of 30% of all deaths in the cohort (59/204).
Other causes of death included suicide, accidents, and
homicides.

Risk factors
Gender and age
The cumulative incidence of the two competing risks,
drug related vs. not drug related, is displayed in Figure
1. The incidence of drug related death increased somewhat more steeply in the beginning of the period, but in
the later part of the evaluation period the incidence of
non drug related causes of death was similar to that of
drug related deaths. As can be discerned in the figure,
there was a slight curvilinear association between time
and risk of drug related death. The cumulative risk
increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out at
later points of time. The covariates controlled for in this
study were the subjects’ gender and age.
Female gender was significantly related to lower risk
of drug related death (B = -.50; OR = .61; p = .021), as


-----

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 244X/11/122

was the age of the subjects (B = -.03; OR = .97; p > .05).
Age was related to non drug related deaths, with an
increasing risk with a higher age (B = .09; OR = 1.09; p
< .001), with older patients being represented to a
higher extent than younger ones.
Psychiatric disorders
When psychiatric disorders, here neurosis, psychosis and
personality disorder were included together with the
subjects’ gender and age in the model, only psychosis
remained related to drug related death. The incidence of
such death was lower in the psychosis group (B = -1.02;
OR = .36; p = .009). Personality disorders were not
related to drug related causes of death and were consequently dropped in the forthcoming analyses.
Drug type/Drug abuse
Next, the drug pattern at first admission was added to
the model. Three out of five different drug types were
significant. The coefficients from the competing risk
analyses are displayed in Table 2. Male gender, higher
age and neurosis now became significant predictors of
drug related death, while psychosis was only marginally
significant (p = .10).
Barbiturates and opiates were related to a higher risk
of drug related death, while cannabis was related to a
lower risk. The risk of death related to drugs was about
1.55 times higher if opiates was abused at first admission and about 1.39 times higher risk if barbiturates
were abused. The risk was 0.87 if cannabis was the main
drug abused.
As regards non drug related death, higher age and
alcohol were associated with increased risk; the risk of
premature death from non drug-related causes was
about 1.83 times higher if chronic alcohol problems
were present at first admission.
Figure 2 displays the distribution of risk of drug
related death for four drug types over a period of 37
years. The most prevalent groups of drugs are shown.
Opiates and barbiturates had a significant impact on
drug related death, while cannabis showed a negative

association. The use of stimulants had no impact on
premature mortality.

Discussion
The results of the study confirm the long-lasting
increased risk for premature death in drug dependent
patients. Although the largest risk of drug related
death occurred during the first 15 years, the level of
such causes of death continued to be high throughout
and above the 37-year follow-up period, and premature
mortality remained significantly increased up to the
age of 69. This stresses the chronic nature of drug
abuse and dependence. The age at drug related death
in the cohort was 35.7 years, which is close to the
mean age of drug induced deaths in some recent European studies [29].
Male gender, opiate and barbiturate use at first admission, as well as neurosis were risk factors for premature
drug related death and alcohol use for non-drug related
death. Premature mortality was lower in women over
time, an observation previously reported in other Scandinavian studies of drug users [4,6,30]. Earlier studies
reflecting differences between sexes are not conclusive

[3,8,16,19,22]. However, mortality in women in this
study was higher in the younger age groups than for
men, even though, with regard to the proportion of substances, the age at first use of drugs and age at first
admission showed a similar pattern regardless of sex.
The relatively lower body weight in women in combination with a propensity to use doses similar to those used
by men, might be one explanation for the greater risk of
fatal accidental intoxication.

In the European population aged 15 to 49 years,
between 10% and 23% of the mortality is attributed to
opioid use [26]. Not surprisingly, opiate use predicted
drug related death in the studied cohort. In a meta-analysis of mortality the death rates among opiate abusers
were about 13 times the norm for their age [31] and 2.4
times higher compared to those of amphetamine users

[3]. Fifty-nine percent of the cohort was poly drug users.
Mixing several drugs poses a real danger, since non
lethal doses of heroin can become lethal in combination
with alcohol and sedatives such as benzodiazepines[32].
This study started when barbiturate abuse was common.
Barbiturates caused several drug related deaths, mostly
in combination with opiates. Both barbiturates and opiates cause respiratory depression which is the major
mechanism of opiate death [33]. The use of stimulants
had no impact on premature mortality in this cohort.
Stimulants do not have the same lethal effects as opiates, but, according to a study of Gossop et al [15], the
use of amphetamine in combination with opiates
increased the risk of mortality.
Despite the fact that cannabis use in this study did not
reflect “recreational use” but a chronic abuse persisting
over several years, the association between cannabis use
and drug related death was negative. This finding
remains in the present cohort even after controlling for
the use of other drugs, and support the results of other
studies indicating that cannabis is not associated with
increased premature mortality [34,35]. It is possible that
a passive lifestyle associated with cannabis use in heavy
drug abusers exposed these persons to a lesser risk of
violent deaths as suicide, homicide and traffic accidents.
In support of this suggestion, cannabis abusers from a
later cohort from the same hospital showed less risk of
committing property and violent crime compared with
other types of drug addicts [19]. In contrast, opiate/heroin abuse requires many activities related to pursuing
drugs and money by stealing, prostitution or, in some
cases, violent offences and, as Hser et al stated in their
follow-up study: “heroin addicts also have extensive
involvement in criminal activities even into older age”

[[36], Pp 308]. However speculative, future research will
need to address if cannabis use is also generally associated with lowered risk for overdoses among poly drug
abusers.
To our knowledge, no other cohort study of patients
with different types of abuse (opiates, amphetamine/stimulants, cannabis, barbiturates, sedative/hypnotics and
hallucinogens) has tracked causes of death over almost
four decades. Cohort studies of mortality in opiate
addicts showed a higher percentage of deceased persons,
58% in a Danish study [9] and 49% in the Californian
study by Hser et al [36] compared to the findings of
36% deceased in the present cohort, which included


opiates as well as other drugs. Despite variations in time
to follow-up, we conclude that the drug use pattern has
the strongest impact on drug related deaths.
Half the cohort was diagnosed with psychiatric disorders at first admission. The prevalence of co-morbidity
in substance abusers has been reported to increase over
the last two decades or longer [37]. The rate of psychoses was however, similar between the present cohort
and a later cohort of patients treated from March 1978
to June 1995, while depressions, anxiety and personality
disorders became more prevalent [38]. In our cohorts of
drug abusers the increase of co-morbidity reflected the
more systematic application of diagnostics rather than a
general increase in prevalence rates [38].
Two patterns remained in the analysis; neurosis predicted drug related premature death and chronic psychoses did not. The explanation is that only a few
patients with chronic psychoses in this study used opiates or amphetamine intravenously. Still, the prevalence
of psychotic disorder in this cohort was much higher
than in the Lundby population study [39] conducted in
the same region. The prevalence of psychoses was at
that time 4.2% in the local suburban general population
compared to 14.4% in this cohort. The neurosis group
included mainly patients with depressive and anxiety
symptoms, constituting 15% of the cohort compared to
a prevalence of neurosis of 0.4% in the general population [40]. This group of patients could be expected to
use more alcohol and sedatives/hypnotics, prescribed or
not, for alleviating psychological suffering as a kind of
“self-medication”, which in combination with opiates
increases the risk of premature death. High levels of
anxiety have been shown to increase the risk of premature mortality, and regular use of benzodiazepines predicted overdoses in a prospective study of substance
abusers in the UK [15]. It is possible that intoxication
among suicides may have contributed to the association
between neurosis and drug-related premature death.
However, given the sample size, having more than two
risk outcomes for the competing risks model was not
feasible. Future research should investigate this question
using larger cohorts.
Some researchers found no association between mortality and psychiatric conditions [9], while others suggest
that psychopathology causes increased premature mortality [3,15,22]. Instead of discussing the general impact
of the co-morbidity of psychiatric disorders on mortality
in drug dependent persons, the case might be that various psychiatric disorders have a differential influence
on causes of premature death.
Somatic diseases constituted 70% of the non drug
related deaths, and violent death the remaining 30%

[41]. In this study alcohol use predicted non drug
related deaths. Alcohol dependence is known to

contribute to a wide range of somatic diseases, such as
liver failure, cancer, coronary diseases, stroke and diabetes. A J-shaped relationship between alcohol and total
mortality was confirmed in both men and women in a
meta-analysis from 2006 [42]. While moderate consumption of alcohol was inversely associated with total
mortality, higher consumption was associated with
increased mortality. Illicit drugs contributed to death for
those who died from liver failure associated with viral
hepatitis and/or chronic alcoholism and for those who
died from HIV or HIV-induced opportunistic infections
and cancers (AIDS).
Among the strengths of this study are the long observation period and the fact that the cohort was reasonably representative for drug abuse patterns in the
southern region of Sweden at the time. According to
data from the national case finding study from the end
of the 1970s, the cohort was reasonably similar in drug
use, age and incidence of intravenous abuse to the
population of substance abusers at the time [23]. The
slight overrepresentation of women in the clinical
cohort was typical for a more pronounced treatmentseeking behavior in women substance abusers compared
to substance abusing men [2,6]. In the substance abusing population in Sweden at the time some 25% were
women, while in clinical settings women constituted
33% [24]. This was the case also in this cohort.
Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 classification by a senior consultant physician and an associate professor of forensic medicine, a procedure which
eliminated inconsistencies in recording drug related
deaths, which are often found when data from national
cause of death registers are used as only source. This
procedure increased the rate of drug related death by
35% compared to register data only.
There are however some limitations. The first is that
the cohort design by necessity provides a more limited
number of subjects for analysis, thus restricting its statistical power more than is the case in large epidemiological samples. Secondly, we have not been able to
include important aspects of the patients life-situation.
Premature death may be predicted by life events like
traumas, separation and loss of close friends and relatives, data known to be associated with suicide. Such
data were however seldom registered in the patient
records in a systematic fashion and have not been
included in the analysis.
Thirdly, patients’ behavior during treatment as well as
their discharge status may be potential indicators of
long term risk of premature death. Dropout from treatment is known to increase the risk of death by overdose
in opiate abusers [15]. In this study however no overdose was diagnosed in the few patients who died within
three months after premature termination of treatment


and no association was found between dropout and
dominant substance of abuse. Based on the available
data, we cannot determine if discharge status at first
admission is a predictor of premature death many years
later.
Finally, the categorization of co-morbid psychiatric
disorders into three broad groups is another limitation.
The psychiatric nomenclature used at the time when the
patients entered the cohort (ICD-8) might be considered
somewhat dated by today’s standards. Neurosis, for
example, is today replaced by more refined and specific
diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders. Personality disorders had lower prevalence in the cohort than is
the case in more recent clinical materials of substance
dependent persons [19,22,38]. It is likely that the low
prevalence reflected the critical stance of the 1970s drug
addiction treatment towards personality assessment in
general and psychiatric diagnostics in particular, as
articulated by, for example, Thomas Szasz [43].

Conclusions
About two thirds of all deaths in this cohort of substance dependent persons were drug related. Male gender, abuse of opiates and barbiturates as well as a
diagnosis of neurosis, mainly neurotic depression and
anxiety at first admission, predicted premature drug
related mortality while chronic psychoses and personality disorders did not. The risk of drug related death
was about 1.6 times higher if opiates were abused at
first admission and about 1.4 times higher risk if barbiturates were abused. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in
opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed time
period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have
any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related
death.
