Aims: To conduct a systematic review of mortality among cohort studies of cocaine users.
Methods: Three electronic databases were searched (EMBASE, Medline and PsychINFO); other online
databases were searched using online libraries and repositories of reports and literature in the drug and
alcohol field, with requested contributions from trained librarians and experts. Searches and extraction
were undertaken using protocols and cross-checking of decisions by two authors. Additional data were
requested from study investigators where studies did not report relevant data.
Results: 1911 articles and 2 reports were identified from searches, with data from another four studies
located from review articles. Seven cohorts of “problem” or dependent cocaine users reported data that
permitted mortality rates to be estimated. Crude mortality rates ranged from 0.53 (95% CI: 0.10–1.58)
to 6.16 (95% CI: 5.21–7.11) per 100PY. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) reported in four studies
suggested that mortality was four to eight times higher among cocaine users than age and sex peers in
the general population.
Conclusions: There are limited data on the extent of elevated mortality among problematic or dependent
cocaine users and it is unclear how generalisable the results of these studies may be to other populations
of problematic cocaine users. Greater attention to both the method of recruitment, and the characteristics
of cocaine users, would enhance our understanding of the mortality risks of problematic cocaine use.

**1. Introduction**

Globally, cocaine use is thought to be concentrated in Western
Europe and the Americas, but its use is thought to be spreading
geographically (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2009).
In the latest World Drug Report, the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime (UNODC) reported that although cocaine consumption
may have levelled off in North America, use has increased in Europe
over the past decade and perhaps in some West African countries
(United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2009). Cocaine may be
used as powder or “crack” cocaine: the powder form can be snorted
(taken intranasally), injected or inhaled when in the form of freebase. Crack cocaine can be injected or smoked, but is rarely snorted
– snorting tends to cause nosebleeds for this form of cocaine, and
is generally avoided as a route of administration.
Regular cocaine use is associated with a range of adverse consequences that potentially increase mortality. These include the
risk of: developing dependence, experiencing cardiovascular complications (most commonly acute myocardial infarctions but also
significant arrhythmias), psychotic episodes and panic attacks, and
acquiring blood-borne viral infections, particularly among users
who inject the drug. Cocaine use is among the leading causes of
acute drug-related deaths in the United States (Brody et al., 1990;
Harruff et al., 1991; Hood et al., 1990; Ruttenber et al., 1997; Tardiff
et al., 1995; Wysowski et al., 1993).
Despite these mortality risks, there has never been a systematic review of prospective studies quantifying crude and excess
mortality risk among people who are problematic or dependent
cocaine users. This paper reviews the mortality risk of problematic or dependent cocaine use derived from a systematic search
of prospective cohort studies of mortality of regular, injecting or
dependent cocaine users. This approach has been used in multiple
other systematic reviews of mortality among drug users (Calabria
et al., 2010; Degenhardt et al., in press; Hulse et al., 1999; Singleton
et al., 2009; Wilcox et al., 2004). We focus upon this study design
rather than registries of poisonings, overdose or population registers where cocaine is mentioned or detected post mortem for
several reasons. First, many causes of death among drug users,
although often directly or indirectly drug-related, are not due to
acute intoxication (Darke et al., 2006). Second, many deaths may
not be identified post mortem as drug-related deaths. Third, they
may not be recorded as deaths that have occurred among people who have used the drug. These data therefore underestimate
mortality among cocaine users. This is even more marked since
in many countries, suspected drug-related deaths are not necessarily subject to toxicological testing, and even fewer countries
routinely report these data. Even acute deaths directly related to
cocaine use are likely to be underestimated in population mortality
registers.
The aims of this review are to systematically review prospective
studies of cocaine users to examine: (1) crude mortality rates; (2)
excess mortality; (3) the causes of mortality across studies; and (4)
mortality according to HIV status. Our intent was to locate studies
of dependent users of cocaine to enable comparisons with mortality studies of problem opioids users. All cohorts where cocaine
users were examined were included in this review. We note the


way in which cocaine users were identified and defined in each of
the studies located.

**2. Method**

2.1. Identifying studies

A systematic literature review identified peer-reviewed articles and other
sources of data describing mortality related to cocaine use published between 1990
and 2008. After consultation with librarians, tailored search strings were devised
and used to search three electronic databases: EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO
(see Appendix A for database information) to provide the most complete coverage
of catalogued literature. Search strings contained keywords and database specific
terms (MeSH headings, EMTREE terms and explode terms). Search strings were
developed for four themes: cocaine, drug use, mortality epidemiology and cohort
studies (see Appendix B for search strings). Multiple variations of the four search
themes were combined to produce a single set of results (see Appendix C for search
combinations).
The database search set was reviewed and the combination of cocaine + mortality
epidemiology was selected for review. This search was the most comprehensive of
the combinations and it produced a total of 1911 papers (once the duplicates were
removed). We also identified literature held outside these peer-reviewed literature
databases (referred to as “grey literature”) that included technical reports and monographs that reported on mortality among cocaine users. The latter was identified
using online databases, library databases and general online searches (the complete
list of websites reviewed can be in (Calabria et al., 2008)). Two researchers (JS and
LD) independently reviewed these studies to compile a shortlist of relevant articles
and reports. The shortlists were compared and any differences in the inclusion or
exclusion of data were resolved by consensus.

2.2. Included studies

We included cohort studies that reported raw data on mortality related to the
problematic use of or dependence on cocaine. The final list of relevant articles was
distributed to experts in drug research who were asked to identify any studies or
data sources we had been missed. Further contacts were made with study authors
where additional data or further information was needed.

2.3. Excluded studies

Several criteria were grounds for excluding papers: not reporting on a cohort
study; not reporting on mortality among cocaine users, not reporting primary
research data, and only reporting case studies of cocaine-related deaths (without
permitting analysis of the denominator of the number of problem cocaine users).

2.4. Data extraction

The data extraction process followed the recommendations outlined in the
Strengthening the Reporting if Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
guidelines (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007; von Elm et al., 2007) that parallel the
CONSORT guidelines for reporting on randomized trials (Mohler et al., 2001). Data
were extracted by two researchers into a Microsoft Excel[®] spreadsheet, with bibliographic information and study specific details were recorded. Study details
recorded were the location, country and region; and sample characteristics such
as, age structure and sex were recorded. Mortality estimates reported in the study
(e.g. crude mortality rate (CMR), odds ratios, hazard ratios, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs)) and causes of death were recorded along with methodological
aspects of the research, including the way in which cocaine use or dependence was
ascertained, and the sampling method used to obtain the cohort. A quality index
adapted from (McGrath et al., 2004) was used (see Appendix D for details). Study
information pertaining to the quality criteria was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet. Each criterion included a rating scale and the individual scores were tallied
to provide an overall quality score, with higher scores indicating a higher quality. After data extraction was complete, the results of the two researchers were
compared for consistency. Any differences were discussed and resolved through
consensus.

2.5. Reporting of mortality estimates

The reporting of mortality estimates was poor. Most cohort studies (n = 5)
reported crude mortality rates (CMRs, i.e. the number of deaths per 100 person-years
of follow up), and four reported a standardised mortality ratio (SMR, a measure of
the mortality relative to expected mortality among persons of the same age and sex in
the general population of that country). Two only reported case fatality rates (CFRs,
i.e. the proportion of cases dying over the entire follow up period). 95% confidence
intervals for estimates were also often unreported.
Person years of follow up were not always reported and in some studies it was
difficult to estimate the overall years of follow up. In the face of the inconsistencies
in the format of the reported data, we calculated summary estimates as follows:
reported crude mortality rates were converted to per 100 person years; when person years of follow up were reported, the crude mortality rate was calculated. In
studies that only reported the number of deaths and the overall years follow up, we
calculated an approximate crude mortality rate by assuming that all deaths occurred
exactly half way through the follow up period and so each case contributed half
the person years follow up of the survivors. No pooled estimates of mortality were
made because of the very limited number of studies, variable nature of the populations studied across countries and the limited reporting of statistics that would
have allowed for adjustment for study and population variables.
The limited precision of approximated CMRs, differences in reporting, and variations in sample characteristics and duration of follow up need to be considered
when interpreting the estimates presented here. Comparisons of mortality rates
across individual cohorts should be cautiously made.

**3. Results**

The cocaine + mortality epidemiology search combination produced 1911 results. An additional 4 references were added after
searching review article bibliographies. Three studies from nonpeer reviewed sources and two studies with data provided from
study coordinators were also included. The abstracts of the articles not in English were reviewed and where possible the full texts
were searched for relevant keywords. Only one article (in Spanish) provided relevant data which was not otherwise available in
English. Fourteen articles published in languages other than English
were excluded; none of them reported mortality in cohort studies.
Fig. 1 describes the numbers of studies identified and reasons for
exclusion.


1160 of the 1917 articles (61%) were excluded because they
did not focus on cocaine use and 452 (24%) because they did
not report on mortality among cocaine users. 151 (8%) were case
studies, 32 (2%) did not report raw data on mortality, 23 did not
contain data for the required time period and 17 were duplicate
reports. Seventy-one studies remained, which provided primary
data on cocaine-related mortality. Of these, 10 articles/reports
reported on nine different cohort studies that examined mortality among cohorts of dependent or problematic cocaine
users.
Since 1990, nine prospective cohort studies examined mortality among the cohorts and included cocaine users (Table 1); two
were excluded from further discussion because they did not provide sufficient data to permit reliable estimates of mortality among
cocaine users (Table 1). The cohorts that were included came from
the United States of America (2), Canada, France, the Netherlands,
Brazil and Italy.
The way in which “cocaine use” was operationalised varied
markedly between cohorts. For example, studies largely comprised
non-injecting dependent crack cocaine users in the Italian and
Brazilian cohorts; the French cohort comprised those arrested for
cocaine use/dealing, and the cohorts in North America comprised
cocaine injectors and/or crack cocaine smokers. For the purposes
of this review, we will refer (when making summary statements)
to “problematic or dependent cocaine users” because this described
the cocaine users in all cohorts, who comprised those who: had
legal problems related to their use (French study), were injecting
the drug (typically daily) (Dutch, North American studies) or were
receiving treatment for dependent cocaine use (Brazilian, Italian
studies).

3.1. All-cause mortality

Mortality estimates were reported in a variety of forms that
included odds ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios and crude mortality rates (CMRs). Overall CMRs were most common; these are by

One study in the Netherlands that followed-up 632 drug users in
1993 from the original sample of 650 (enrolled between 1985 and
1992) found a CMR of 4.6/100PY among HIV seronegative primary
cocaine injectors (Van Haastrecht et al., 1996).
One study reported on a cohort of 131 dependent crack cocaine
users recruited from treatment clinics in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Ribeiro
et al., 2004, 2006). During 5 years of follow up, the CMR was
3.51/100PY. A 12-year follow up (70% of the original sample were
followed-up) reported that a further four cohort participants had
died, but no person years, CMRs or SMRs were reported (Dias et al.,
2008).
A cohort of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver, Canada
(the VIDUS study), was followed between 1996 and 2004 (Miller
et al., 2007; Tyndall et al., 2001). Among the 717 primary cocaine
injectors there were 161 deaths over the follow up period, a CMR
of 6.16/100PY (95% CI: 5.21–7.11) (Table 1; Thomas Kerr, personal
communication, September 2008). In further analyses of mortality according to HIV status, mortality among HIV-positive cocaine
IDUs was 9.83/100PY (95% CI: 7.59–12.54), and among those who
were HIV-negative, it was 4.91/100PY (95% CI: 3.98–5.99). These
rates were significantly different from each other (p < .001; Kathy
Li, personal communication, October 2008).
In 2001, O’Driscoll et al. (2001) reported on deaths observed
in the RAVEN study: a cohort of IDUs in Seattle and King County,
Washington State, USA. The overall case fatality rate for “primary”
injectors of cocaine was 4.29%. This study reported separate rates
according to daily cocaine use by non-injection (crack smoking)
and injecting routes (these were not mutually exclusive – some
participants used through both routes): those who smoked crack
cocaine at least daily had a CMR of 3.53/100PY; those who injected
cocaine at least daily had a CMR of 0.53/100PY (95% CI: 0.10–1.58;
Table 1).
The ALIVE study (AIDS Link to the IntraVenous Experience), in Baltimore, USA, investigated mortality in a cohort of
IDUs, 2957 of whom were daily cocaine injectors, and 25% of
whom were HIV-seropositive at baseline (Wang et al., 2005).
Among cocaine-only IDUs, the CMR was 4.69/100PY, and among
cocaine and heroin injectors (cocaine + heroin IDUs), the CMR
was 4.37/100PY (95% CI: 4.07–4.68; Erin Ricketts, personal communication, September 2008). There were clear differences in
mortality according to HIV status. Mortality among HIV-positive
IDUs was 7.74/100PY for cocaine + heroin IDUs, and 7.98/100PY
for cocaine-only IDUs. Among HIV-negative IDUs, the CMRs were
3.25 per 100py for cocaine + heroin IDUs, and 3.45 per 100py


for cocaine-only IDUs (Erin Ricketts, personal communication,
November 2008).
One French study reported on a national cohort of 2122 cocaine
users who had been arrested for supply and/or possession of
cocaine (OFDT, 2004). This was the only study that recruited cocaine
users in this way and the only national study in this review. The
average age of the cohort was 27 years at baseline. Over 7 years
of follow up, the overall CMR was 0.69/100PY (95% CI: 0.55–0.87;
Eric Janssen and Abdalla Toufik, personal communication, October
2008).
One Italian study of 347 cocaine dependent users, mostly
intranasal users, was located (Pavarin, 2008). The CMR over the follow up period was 0.50/100PY (95% CI: 0.22–0.91); all seven deaths
occurred among males (CMR among males 0.54/100PY). Mortality
risk was higher among those who were older at first treatment
contact, had concomitant alcohol use problems, with less socioeconomic stability and a history of imprisonment (Pavarin, 2008).
Two cohort studies did not provide sufficient data to allow
analysis of mortality among cocaine users in their cohorts (see
Table 1). The first was a cohort of “experienced non-deviant”
cocaine users from the Netherlands (Cohen and Sas, 1993). It was
excluded because the high loss to follow up (61 subjects from a
total sample of 160) and little reporting of other study details.
The second study was conducted in the United Kingdom, and followed a cohort of 1075 drug users in treatment, of whom 247
were dependent cocaine users (Gossop et al., 2002). This study did
not report deaths, person years or mortality rates among cocaine
users.
Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated in four
studies: the Brazilian study (Dias et al., 2008; Ribeiro et al., 2004,
2006) reported an SMR of 7.6 at 5-year follow up; the French study
reported an SMR of 4.36 among males and 7.70 among females
(Eric Janssen, personal communication, October 2008); the Canadian VIDUS cohort of cocaine injectors estimated an SMR of 4.74
(95% CI 4.19, 5.29) among daily cocaine injectors (Thomas Kerry and
Kathy Li, personal communication, November 2008); and the Italian study reported an SMR of 4.75 among males (95% CI 2.26–9.96)
(Pavarin, 2008).

3.2. Cause-specific mortality

Four studies examined specific causes of death among cocaine
users. Ribeiro et al. (2004, 2006) reported that among dependent
crack cocaine users in Brazil the most common causes of death were
fatal gunshot (44% – 10 deaths) and AIDS-related illnesses (26% – 6
deaths).


-----

**Fig. 2. Comparison of the distribution of causes of death among cocaine users in the**
VIDUS and ALIVE cohorts.

The study of Italian cocaine dependent treatment entrants
examined causes of deaths among the 309 males in the cohort
(Pavarin, 2008). The highest SMRs were for vascular diseases (SMR
14.85; CI 4.79–46.04), suicide (SMR 7.07; CI 1–50.16) and overdose
(SMR 9.95; CI 1.40–70.61).
The third study was the much larger ALIVE cohort in Baltimore,
United States (Wang et al., 2005). Table 4 summarises data on the
major causes of death, among cocaine only injectors, and those
who injected both cocaine and heroin (Erin Ricketts, personal communication, September 2008). AIDS was the most common cause
of death during the follow up period, with a higher proportion
among cocaine-only IDU (35%) than among cocaine and heroin
IDU (26%). Fatal overdoses were marginally more common among
those cocaine IDUs who also injected heroin (17% vs. 11% cocaine
only). Infections related to injecting were the next most common
cause of mortality in both groups, with traumatic death and suicide
accounting for smaller proportions.
Data on specific causes of death were also available from the
Vancouver-based VIDUS cohort (Table 2: Kathy Li and Thomas Kerr,
personal communication, October 2008). Overdose (35%), HIV and
AIDS (20%) and traumatic deaths (15%) were the most common
causes of death. Fig. 2 and Table 2 compare the distribution of causes
of death in the Baltimore and Vancouver cohorts.

**4. Discussion**

This systematic review found a limited number of prospective
studies of cocaine users that examined all-cause mortality, and
even fewer reporting cause-specific mortality. Most studies examined those who used cocaine via injection, or cocaine use among
people who inject drugs; two studies examined dependent “crack”
cocaine smokers (Brazil) or cocaine snorters (Italy).
The crude mortality rates in the studies identified were high,
but varied between cohorts and countries (with CMRs ranging from
0.48 to 6.16 per 100 person years). These differences in CMRs may
reflect very large differences between cohorts in general health,
routes of administration, the prevalence of HIV infection, access to
general and specialist medical care and possibly social disadvan

tage. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know which and/or how
many of these factors contributed to these differences in CMR.
Prospective studies of large samples of cocaine dependent users
are needed to provide the statistical power to evaluate the role of
these potential influences.
Despite the many differences in sampling frames and the way in
which cocaine use was operationalised, SMRs were relatively similar in those studies that reported them: the French study estimated
an SMR of 4.36 for males and 7.7 for females; the Italian study,
4.6 among males (Pavarin, 2008); the Canadian study estimated
an SMR of 4.74, and among Brazilian dependent crack smokers,
7.60 (Ribeiro et al., 2004, 2006). These figures – extremely crudely
summarised – suggest that deaths among dependent cocaine users
occur between four and eight times more often than in the general
population of the same age and sex.

4.1. Limitations

A major limitation of many of the studies is that they recruited
and followed-up injecting or treatment-seeking dependent cocaine
users, many of who were at higher risk of premature death. There
are good reasons to be cautious when generalising this mortality risk to all dependent cocaine users, and especially so to all
cocaine users. First, the groups studied largely comprised people
who injected cocaine daily, or who were dependent crack cocaine
users. No study followed users who only snorted cocaine. It is likely
that intranasal cocaine users have much lower mortality and morbidity risks than those who smoke or inject the drug (Kaye and
Darke, 2004).
Second, in several of the cohorts, HIV infection was either highly
prevalent at baseline and there were high rates of AIDS-related
mortality during follow up. HIV prevalence varies greatly across
different populations of illicit and injecting drug users (Mathers et
al., 2008). HIV infection increased the mortality rates from AIDS
in the cohort studies, as seen in the ALIVE and VIDUS studies.
In these cohorts, overdose mortality was also significantly higher
among people who were HIV-positive compared than those who
were HIV-negative, even after adjusting for differences in cocaine
and other drug use. A substantial proportion of the increased overdose mortality appeared to be related to liver and other systemic
disease among those who were HIV-positive (Wang et al., 2005).
Future studies will need to disentangle the impact of HIV serostatus
and disease progression on mortality among cocaine users. Furthermore, it was not possible to examine the impact of HAART
upon mortality among HIV-positive cocaine users in these cohorts,
since no study reported estimates disaggregated by calendar year,
nor reported mortality among HIV-positive cocaine users receiving HAART compared to those who were not. Future cohorts need
to examine this question, since it is highly likely that access to
HAART would have a very substantial and beneficial impact upon
AIDS-related mortality.
Third, with the exceptions of one study in Brazil, and three in
Western Europe (Italy, France and the Netherlands) these studies
were conducted in North America. Countries further from cocaine
source countries, with more limited supplies of poorer quality
cocaine may have a lower mortality risk. This possibility should
be the subject of future research.
Fourth, and very importantly, the cocaine users in most of
these studies came from socially disadvantaged settings. It is
known that in some developed countries cocaine use is common among very high socio-economic groups, who primarily use
cocaine intra-nasally and have a lower pre-existing mortality risks
(Chivite-Matthews et al., 2005; Prinzleve et al., 2004; Shearer et
al., 2007). Shearer et al. (2007), for example, found socio-economic
status differences between better off intranasal users and the
lower SES users who were more likely to inject both cocaine and


-----

heroin. Cocaine users from socially disadvantaged settings may
also have poorer access to healthcare than cocaine users from
higher SES backgrounds. Other systematic differences between
these groups that may affect mortality rates include exposure to
adverse environmental factors (e.g. violence) and an increased likelihood of engaging in other high risk behaviours. For example, in
the Brazilian cohort, the most common cause of death was fatal
gunshot injury (Ribeiro et al., 2004, 2006). Shearer et al. (2007)
also found that the lower SES Australian cocaine users were more
likely to be involved in crime, and had higher risks of bloodborne virus infection than the cocaine users from the higher SES
group.
Finally, some studies defined drug use on the basis of the
drugs people primarily injected at baseline. Users may switch
between injection of different drug types; alter the frequency
or route of administration of their drug of choice, or cease
drug use altogether. These changes might affect mortality risk
in ways that cannot be estimated from the available cohort
studies.

4.2. Implications for future research

This review has documented the paucity of research examining
mortality among users of cocaine, one of the four most commonly
used illicit drug types (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,
2010). The lack of studies carefully assessing and following up this
group is not unique to cocaine: a similar review focusing upon
amphetamines found even fewer studies (Singleton et al., 2009).
Many more studies have focused upon regular or dependent opioid users – a recent systematic review located 58 studies in total
for that drug type (Degenhardt et al., in press). Although it might be
argued that opioids present a greater public health challenge, such
a statement is not based on strong data.
We need to increase routine data collections that include
cocaine users. These might include data on: arrestees, hospital
entrants, harm reduction service attendees, or drug treatment
entrants. Identifying cohorts of cocaine users in this way could
permit the conduct of large-scale but comparatively low-cost
prospective studies of mortality in cocaine, using data linkage with
mortality registers. Such study designs (as indicated by the French
study cite) have the advantage that they capture a large treated
population, rather than a small and possibly unrepresentative subsample of clients from one service.
An additional implication of the review is the necessity to
improve reporting of basic epidemiological data such as: person
years of follow up, mortality rates, SMRs, and disaggregated mortality, by age and sex. The reporting of simple but irregularly reported
information could be improved by following published guidelines
on data collection and reporting (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007; von
Elm et al., 2007). Furthermore, the precise causes of death need to
be classified in line with definitions agreed by experts in the area
(see (Randall et al., 2009) for a suggested approach).

**5. Conclusions**

Despite the relatively widespread use of cocaine and the range
of harms that have been documented among problematic users of
the drug, there has been surprisingly little prospective research
examining mortality risk among cocaine users. The limited extant
research has reported extremely high rates of mortality among
this group but considerable uncertainties remain. Existing studies
have focused on socially disadvantaged, daily or dependent cocaine
injectors or crack smokers, who may have a higher mortality risk
than regular or dependent cocaine users who snort the drug. Future
prospective research on cocaine users should include users from


more varied socioeconomic backgrounds to provide more representative estimates of mortality among people who use this drug.
