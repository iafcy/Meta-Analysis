_Aims: To report the results of a comprehensive literature search of studies of mortality among people who_
use amphetamines.
_Design and setting: Three electronic databases were searched (EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO) and “grey”_
literature was located. Shortlists of papers were circulated to experts to ascertain whether any important
papers had been missed. Papers were hand-searched to retrieve any additional relevant articles.
_Measurements: Studies meeting inclusion criteria were prospective cohort studies examining mortality_
risk among dependent and problematic amphetamine users. Crude mortality rates (CMR/100PY) and
standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were the primary outcome measures considered. Data on overall
mortality, and rates for specific causes of death, were of interest.
_Findings: 2187 articles and 9 grey literature sources were obtained. After thorough review, 72 articles were_
identified as reporting on amphetamine-related mortality, 7 provided data from cohort studies of users.
An additional study of Swedish military conscripts was identified by the authors during correspondence
with other researchers. The geographic spread of cohorts was restricted to high income countries with
the exception of one Thai study; reporting of standard parameters in mortality studies was often sparse.
The estimated CMRs ranged from 0 in Australia to 2.95 (1.46–4.59) in Thailand. The Czech cohort reported
the only SMR: 6.22 overall, males: 5.87, females: 7.84.
_Conclusions: Given the widespread use of amphetamines, the known non-fatal adverse effects of use and_
the mortality rates reported here, cohort studies investigating the morbidity and mortality associated
with such drug use should be a research priority.

**1. Introduction**

The global prevalence of the use of amphetamines is thought
to have increased rapidly during the 1990s. Globally, the market
for amphetamines is second only to cannabis (UNODC, 2007) and
in several East Asian countries, methamphetamine is the most
commonly used illicit drug (Kozel et al., 2007), with recent data suggesting expanding markets in South Africa, Iraq and the Middle East
(UNODC, 2008). Amphetamines are currently the dominant drug of
concern in the Pacific and in several countries in East Asia (Kozel
et al., 2007). In Czech Republic and Slovakia, methamphetamine is
the most commonly injected drug (Griffiths et al., 2008), and recent
data from research studies and treatment centres strongly suggest
an increase in (injecting) use of methamphetamine and methcathinone in Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and the Russian Federation
(Grund et al., 2009).
The term “amphetamines” refers to a range of drugs
related to amphetamine which share stimulant properties that
increase the concentration of dopamine in the terminals of
neurons, and the desired effects may include euphoria, perception of increased energy, increased concentration and mental
alertness and feelings of greater power and self-confidence.
Amphetamines can include amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or “ecstasy”), methcathinone, and ephedrine. They may also include pharmaceutical
drugs such as phentermine. Methamphetamine and amphetamine
are now the major illicit amphetamines available worldwide
(UNODC, 2008).
A review by Darke et al. (2008) highlighted the adverse
physical and psychological consequences of amphetamine use.
Amphetamine has a number of adverse side effects that include
physical manifestations such as sweating, heart palpitations,
headaches, tremors, and increases in body temperature (Dean,
2004; Degenhardt and Topp, 2003). Adverse psychological side
effects include restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, irritation, confusion
and aggression (Dean, 2004; Degenhardt and Topp, 2003). Cardiovascular toxicity includes arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction
and cardiomyopathy (Dean, 2004; Yu et al., 2003). Cerebrovascular toxicity includes stroke, aneurysm, and cerebral haemorrhage
(Dean, 2004; Lee, 2004).
Given the number of people potentially at risk, and the suggestive evidence that dependent amphetamine use is increasing in
some countries, there is a need to better understand the mortality
risk among this group. To our knowledge there has to date not been
a systematic review of mortality among problematic or dependent
amphetamine users. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of mortality in problematic or dependent amphetamine
users.
Mortality related to the use of “ecstasy” (MDMA) was not
included in this review. There have been case reports of deaths
following the use of MDMA but the number of such deaths, considering the prevalence of use, is very low (Gowing et al., 2002).
Polydrug use and the variability of the ingredients of pills sold as
ecstasy make it difficult to determine the role of MDMA in fatalities
(Silins, in press). The case reports of MDMA-related deaths indicate
that other licit and illicit substances were also present, complicating the determination of cause of death. Gore et al attempted to


quantify the mortality risk to MDMA users but deficiencies in the
data resulted in wide uncertainty intervals (Gore, 1999). In addition,
the context of use and nature and extent of adverse side effects
are likely to differ significantly from amphetamines (Degenhardt
and Hall, in press). The existence of an MDMA dependence syndrome, although studied in several papers, remains the subject of
some debate and is likely to be qualitatively different to that for
amphetamines (Degenhardt and Hall, in press). Finally, very few
prospective studies of ecstasy users have been conducted (e.g. Alati
et al., 2008) and we could not find any analysis of mortality risk
among these cohorts.
This review was undertaken by members of the Mental Disorders and Illicit Drug Use Expert Group as part of the update
of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project. The data reported
in this review have been submitted to the Global Burden of Disease project and will be used to contribute to the calculation of
the morbidity and mortality associated with dependent use of
[amphetamines (see www.gbd.unsw.edu.au for more information](http://www.gbd.unsw.edu.au/)
about the work of the Expert Group and of the GBD project as a
whole).

**2. Method**

_2.1. Identifying studies_

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles
and other sources of data on amphetamine-related mortality. The search strategy was consistent with the methodology recommended by the Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group (Stroup et al., 2000). After
consultation with qualified librarians, tailored search strings were devised and used
to search three electronic databases: EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO. There is significant overlap in the articles catalogued on electronic databases, and the above
combination was designed to give the largest number of unique relevant articles
(Betrán et al., 2005). Search strings contained keywords and database-specific terms
(MeSH headings, EMTREE terms and explode terms). Search strings were developed
for four themes: amphetamines, drug use, mortality epidemiology and cohort studies
(see Table S1 for details). Multiple variations of the four search themes were combined to produce a set of results (see Table S2 for details). All results were limited
to human subjects and publication years between 1990 and 2007. Any cohort studies published between 1980 and 1989 were also included. The references of review
articles were hand-searched to locate additional sources. Prominent researchers in
the field were also contacted by email and asked to indicate if any relevant data had
been missed. As per MOOSE guidelines this process is key to obtaining a comprehensive collection of the data given electronic databases are by no means exhaustive
(Stroup et al., 2000). Expert review is deemed particularly important for locating
data from less developed regions which are unlikely to be indexed in the main
databases (Betrán et al., 2005). Grey literature reporting on amphetamine-related
mortality was identified using online grey literature databases, library databases
and general online searches (the complete list of websites reviewed can be found
in Calabria et al. (2008)). When relevant publications were identified on websites the organisations were contacted directly and asked to provide the complete
texts.
Two researchers (JS and LD) independently reviewed the available literature and
each formed a shortlist of relevant articles and reports. The shortlists were compared
and any differences in the inclusion or exclusion of data were discussed and resolved
by consensus.

_2.2. Included studies_

Studies were included if they reported raw data on mortality related to dependent or problematic use of amphetamines. The final list of relevant articles was
distributed to experts in drug research who identified whether any data sources had
been missed.


-----

_2.3. Excluded studies_

Several criteria were grounds for data exclusion: not reporting on mortality associated with dependent or problematic use of amphetamines, not reporting primary
research data, or case studies. Data from years outside 1980–2007 were excluded.

_2.4. Data extraction_

The data extraction process followed the recommendations outlined in the
Strengthening the Reporting if Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
guidelines (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007; von Elm et al., 2007), which are parallel
to the CONSORT guidelines for reporting on randomized trials (Mohler et al., 2001).
Data were extracted by two researchers into an Excel spreadsheet. Bibliographic
information was recorded in addition to the study specific details. Study details
extracted included the location and sample characteristics such as age structure and
sex breakdown. Mortality estimates (e.g. crude mortality rate, odds ratios, hazard
ratios) and causes of death were recorded as well as methodological aspects of the
research (e.g. diagnostic criteria and sampling method).
After data extraction was complete the results of the two researchers were compared for consistency. Any differences were discussed and a finalised set of results
was compiled once consensus was reached.

_2.5. Obtaining additional data_

When the reported data were incomplete we contacted the authors by email
and requested additional information.

_2.6. Quality score_

The quality index devised by McGrath et al. (2004) was adapted to suit the
reporting of illicit drug data. It was derived via the ‘Delphi method’ with discussion, final agreement and approval from the 11 members of the Mental Disorders
and Illicit Drug Use Expert Group (see Acknowledgements) as well as the leaders of
the cluster that the expert group belongs to as part of the GBD study (see Table S3
for details). Study information pertaining to the quality criteria was extracted into
an Excel spreadsheet. Each criterion included a rating scale and the individual scores
were tallied to provide an overall quality score, with higher scores indicating a higher
methodological quality.

_2.7. Calculation of crude mortality rates_

Person years of follow up were not always reported for amphetamine users.
In some studies even the overall years of follow up could not be discerned. In the
face of the inconsistencies in the format of the reported data we have attempted to
calculate comparable summary estimates. Any reported crude mortality rates have
been converted to per 100 person years.
When person years of follow up were not reported or subsequently provided
by the authors, approximate person years of follow up have been calculated. The
assumption made for these calculations is that all deaths occurred exactly half way
through the follow up period, so that each case contributed half the person years
follow up of the survivors. This figure has then been used to estimate an approximate
crude mortality rate.

**3. Results**

The database search set was reviewed and the combination of
_amphetamines + mortality was selected. This search was the most_
comprehensive of the combinations, and the total number of citations (2178 once duplicates from each of the databases were
removed) was a reasonable number to review.
The list of citations from the database search was reviewed and
a final shortlist of relevant articles was created. Those articles not
included in the final list were categorised according to the criteria
by which they were excluded. The number of articles in each of the
categories is displayed in Fig. S1.
The amphetamines + mortality search combination resulted in
2178 citations, to which 9 grey literature references were added.
The review of reference lists and the input from the expert group
did not produce any additional relevant articles. After the original
list of 2187 articles had been reviewed, 1576 (72%) did not focus on
amphetamines, 347 (16%) did not report on amphetamine-related
mortality, 141 (6%) were case studies, 42 (2%) did not report raw
data, 3 did not contain data for the required time period and 2
contained duplicate data. There were eight articles in languages


other than English. Online translation software was used to translate the abstract and full text where possible. None of the articles in
languages other than English met the inclusion criteria. 72 studies remained which provided primary research data relevant to
amphetamine-related mortality. Of these, seven articles reported
on cohort studies which examined the mortality of amphetamine
users. An additional cohort (of Swedish military conscripts) was
identified by a member of the Mental Disorders and Illicit Drug Use
Expert Group. The paper reporting on this cohort is still in progress
and the authors have provided the data directly.
Additional data were provided by authors to supplement the
information for the following studies: Bartu et al. (2004), Fugelstad
et al. (1997) and Quan et al. (2007).
In addition to cohort studies, numerous articles have investigated medical examiner records and other mortality focussed
databases to identify fatalities positive for amphetamines. It has
not been possible to incorporate the data from these studies into
the estimates for amphetamine-related mortality because the presence of a drug at the time of death does not necessarily indicate
dependence on the substance.

_3.1. All-cause mortality_

Since 1980, six prospective cohort studies have been conducted
which report on the mortality of amphetamine dependent drug
users. Two retrospective data linkage cohorts have been conducted,
one in Perth, Australia (Bartu et al., 2004) and the other in the Czech
Republic (Bartu et al., 2004; Lejckova and Mravcik, 2007) (for details
of studies see Tables 1 and 2).
As expected, the studies were heterogeneous with respect to
population, study design and measurement methods (Stroup et al.,
2000). In addition to this the reporting of mortality estimates was
poor. These cohort studies reported mortality estimates in a variety
of forms that included odds ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios and
crude mortality rates.
There were insufficient data reported to calculate comparable standardised mortality estimates, and consequently only crude
mortality rates (CMRs) and approximate crude mortality rates are
reported in this paper. Neither measure is adjusted for confounding
variables such as age, sex, HIV status, length of drug use, or the use
of other drugs such as opioids. None of the studies reported confidence intervals for crude mortality rates. Confidence intervals have
subsequently been calculated and are reported in Table 1.
Three cohort studies of drug users have been conducted in Sweden, one followed a large group (n = 48,024) of military conscripts
and two involved populations of drug users in treatment. Davstad
et al. tracked a cohort of 48,024 Swedish military conscripts from
1970 until 2004 (Davstad et al., in preparation). At baseline a history
of drug-related criminal convictions was used to infer problematic
drug use. During the follow up, admission to hospital with diagnosed drug dependence was used to update the participants’ drug
use behaviour. At baseline there were 221 stimulant users. 42 (19%)
of these users died during the study period. The CMR for the stimulant users was 0.59/100PY (0.42–0.76). The paper on the military
conscripts was still in progress at time of publication of this review
and no further details are available.
Fugelstad et al. reported on a cohort of 1640 drug users who
had been admitted for treatment at a large hospital in Stockholm
between January 1981 and December 1988 (Fugelstad et al., 1997).
Information from hospital records was used to classify 578 subjects
as amphetamine dependent at baseline. The authors did not indicate the frequency or length of drug use. Deaths were identified
from December 1985 until late 2005 using the Swedish population register. This register has been reported to contain 99% of
the deaths of Swedish nationals. The CMR for amphetamine users
was 1.03/100PY (0.73–1.35). Fridell and Hesse (2006) published the

results of a much smaller Swedish cohort (125 subjects of whom
48 were dependent on amphetamines). The participants had been
admitted for detoxification treatment or short term rehabilitation
between 1988 and 1989 in the city of Lund. All subjects in Fridell
and Hesse’s study had been diagnosed as substance dependent or
substance abusers according to DSM-III-R criteria, and had experienced “severe” drug problems for at least 3 years. 39% of the subjects
used amphetamine as their “predominant drug”. The authors identified deaths using the Swedish Central Person Register at 5 and 15
years follow up, the approximate CMR for amphetamine users was
2.47/100PY (1.38–3.67).
Stark differences in mortality estimates can also be seen in
the remaining studies. Between 1985 and 1992 drug users in
the Netherlands who were in contact with treatment services
and sexually transmitted infections clinics were recruited to the
study and were invited to attend follow up visits every 4 months
(Van Haastrecht et al., 1996). Amphetamine use was recorded
at baseline, and from 1989 history of regular amphetamine use
was also recorded. Participants whose primary drug of injection
was amphetamine had a CMR of 4.55/100PY (1.64–7.84). For the
deaths which occurred after 1989 crude mortality rates were
reported separately according to length of regular amphetamine
use; for injection drug users with a history of at least 1 year regular amphetamine use, the CMR was 4.55/100PY (2.64–6.63) (Van
Haastrecht et al., 1996); for those who had used for between 1 and 4
years the CMR was 2.03/100PY (0.53–3.73) and for those using regularly for 5 years or longer it was 7.34/100PY (3.89–11.16). Updated
data for amphetamine injectors and non-injectors (regardless of
length of use) were received; for the period 1985–2005, the overall CMR for amphetamine users was 2.89/100PY (1.88–3.97), for
amphetamine injectors the CMR was 3.01/100PY (1.81–4.33).
A cohort of drug experimenting school-children in Finland was
followed up 20 years after they were interviewed by the narcotics police; they were first questioned in 1971 and then followed
up in 1992. Thirty-five of the 88 participants reported adolescent injecting of amphetamines; by 1992 seven subjects had died
(approximate CMR 1.11/100PY (0.44–1.87)) (Turpeinen, 2001).
Recently Quan et al. reported a CMR of 2.95/100PY (1.46–4.59)
from a cohort of amphetamine users in Thailand (Quan et al., 2007).
The sample was made up of drug users over 13 years of age who
were dependent on opiates or amphetamines and who had been
admitted to a treatment centre for detoxification. The cohort was
followed for 2 years, from 1999 to 2002. 320 participants had used
amphetamines at least once in the 3 months prior to being screened
for enrolment in the study. The deaths (all in males) were identified
during home visits by researchers (conducted when a scheduled
appointment had been missed) or when family members informed
the study staff.
A cohort of drug users was studied in Perth, Australia (Bartu et
al., 2004). The participants were drug users who had been admitted
to hospitals or psychiatric institutions for opiate or amphetaminerelated conditions. This study classified amphetamine users as


those who used amphetamines as their “primary drug”. ICD 9
was used to diagnose drug use. Although dependence was not
diagnosed, the admission to hospital for a drug related condition
provides strong evidence that these users can be classified as “problematic” users (data such as these are sometimes used in indirect
prevalence estimates of the number of “problem drug users” in
multiple countries such as those included in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) (European
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, 2009). At 4 years
follow up there had been no deaths among those who had been
amphetamine users at baseline (n = 1393). There were 13 deaths
with an unspecified combination of drugs present; amphetamines
may have been present but none of these individuals had been
classified as amphetamine users at baseline.
The largest cohort of amphetamine users reporting on mortality
to date was conducted in the Czech Republic (Lejckova and Mravcik,
2007). This retrospective data linkage study involved 3093 persons
admitted to hospital in 1997 for amphetamine dependence diagnosed according to ICD 10. Vital status in 2002 was determined
using the general mortality register. A total of 48 amphetamine
dependent persons died during the follow up period, with crude
mortality rates of 0.49/100 person years (0.36–0.63)—0.61 for males
and 0.30 for females. The Czech study was the only one to report
standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). In this study the SMRs for
stimulant users were 6.22 overall (4.59–8.25), 7.84 for female users
(3.92–14.02) and 5.87 for male users (4.13–8.09).
Only three studies reported on cause of death. In Sweden, Fridell
and Hesse (2006) reported 15 deaths of amphetamine users, 10
of which were caused by “acute drug use”. There were also three
violent deaths and 1 suicide. Fugelstad’s Swedish cohort was dominated by heroin overdose deaths (15 of 39 deaths), followed by
accidental deaths (Fugelstad et al., 1997). In the Czech Republic 41
of the 48 deaths were injury-related (Lejckova and Mravcik, 2007).
The data from the National Treatment Outcome Research Study
conducted in the United Kingdom could not be included in the
present analysis as they did not report mortality separately for users
of specific drug types (Gossop et al., 2002).
Simple regression was performed and a significant correlation
existed between increased person years follow up and a lower CMR
(correlation coefficient: 0.78, p = 0.02). There was no significant
correlation between sample size and CMR (correlation coefficient:
0.55, p = 0.16) or between quality index score and CMR (correlation
coefficient: 0.22, p = 0.60).
Crude mortality rates from the included cohorts ranged from
0 in Australia to 2.95 (1.46–4.59) in Thailand. A summary of the
calculated crude mortality rates can be seen in Table 3. A pooled
crude mortality rate was not calculated.

problematic or dependent users of amphetamines. Despite the
known risks of amphetamines use, few studies could be located
that had studied mortality risk: only eight in the past three
decades.
The crude mortality rates observed among amphetamine users
varied from 0 in Australia to 2.95/100PY (1.46–4.59) in Thailand
(Bartu et al., 2004; Quan et al., 2007). The variation in mortality rates
indicates the high likelihood that mortality among amphetamine
users varies geographically in important ways. The low mortality rates seen in the Czech cohort (0.49/100PY (0.36–0.63)) may
be explained by the absence of AIDS-related deaths—the authors
reported that no AIDS-related deaths of drug users have been
identified in the Czech Republic to date (Lejckova and Mravcik,
2007). The authors of the Thai cohort felt the higher background
mortality rate in the general population of Thailand would inflate
the drug user mortality rate above those observed in “developed” countries (Quan et al., 2007). The reduced access to health
care and lack of specialised drug treatment services in the study
area might also have led to an increased mortality rate. It was
therefore unexpected that the Thai amphetamine user mortality rate (2.95/100PY (1.46–4.59)) would be only slightly greater
than that observed in the regular amphetamine users in the
Netherlands (2.89/100PY (1.88–3.97)—data for 1985–2005). The
high mortality rates seen in the Dutch cohort are not consistent with other data which suggest that access to both harm
reduction (needle and syringe programmes) and treatment services for general health care were high during the period, but
no simple explanation could be provided (Van Haastrecht et al.,
1996).
There was suggestive evidence that injection of amphetamines
was associated with higher mortality than other primary routes of
administration. In Thailand, the CMR for injectors was 4.65/100PY
(0.88–8.89), compared 2.60/100PY (1.11–4.27) for non-injecting
users (Quan et al., 2007). In the Netherlands the mortality rate
among those who injected amphetamines was remarkably similar, with a CMR of 4.55/100PY (1.64–7.84) (data for 1985–1992)
(Van Haastrecht et al., 1996). This makes sense given the welldocumented elevated risks of blood-borne viral infections that
people who inject drugs face, particularly hepatitis C and HIV, both
of which cause substantial morbidity and mortality (Degenhardt et
al., 2006).
Only the Van Haastrecht et al. study recorded length of
amphetamine use at baseline (data available for 1985–1992). It
found an extremely high mortality rate in those who had used for 5
years or longer (CMR: 7.34/100PY (3.89–11.16)) (Van Haastrecht et
al., 1996). This was more than three times the rate among those who
had used for between 1 and 4 years (CMR: 2.03/100PY (0.53–3.73)).
Although this study had a small sample size (just 48 users at baseline), the elevation in mortality for longer term users suggests that
future studies should measure drug career length at baseline.


The absence of a significant association between either quality
index score or cohort size and crude mortality rate suggests there
was no systematic effect of study design upon the mortality rates
observed.
Given the paucity of data and the heterogeneity of the available estimates of mortality, a pooled crude mortality rate was not
calculated. Any pooled estimate using the available data would be
unreliable and may not be representative of the global level of mortality associated with dependent amphetamine use.
This review has clearly demonstrated a large gap in our understanding of the mortality risks for dependent and problematic
amphetamine users and there is a clear imperative to improve upon
any estimate that attempts to summarise existing data on the mortality levels among users of these drugs.
There is also a need to ensure that future studies make greater
efforts to estimate SMRs since it is the excess mortality risk among
drug users that is of particular interest. Without SMRs there is no
accurate way to consider background mortality among the general
population.

_4.1. Limitations_

There are obvious limitations in the methods and statistics
reported here, particularly because of the limited precision of the
approximated crude mortality rates. The differences in reporting in
addition to the variations in sample characteristics and duration of
follow up, need to be considered when interpreting the estimates
presented here. Comparisons between the mortality rates of the
individual cohorts should be made with caution.
It is difficult to accurately quantify the level of mortality associated with the dependent use of amphetamines. Firstly, there
are very few cohort studies which investigate the mortality of
amphetamine users. Those cohorts that have been conducted (eight
are discussed here) are concentrated in higher income countries.
Regarding the cohort studies included in this analysis, the methods of identifying people as being dependent on amphetamines
are inconsistent and often the authors have not provided sufficient information to assess whether the diagnosis is indeed reliable.
Only two studies used ICD (versions 9 and 10) to diagnose dependence (Bartu et al., 2004; Lejckova and Mravcik, 2007). Fridell and
Hesse used DSM-III-R in conjunction with urine testing and some
self-report (Fridell and Hesse, 2006). Drug use for the cohorts in
Thailand and the Netherlands was determined in a questionnaire
administered by trained interviewers. The authors provide no other
details with relation to diagnostic methods (Quan et al., 2007; Van
Haastrecht et al., 1996). Fugelstad et al. relied on the accuracy of hospital records for diagnosis of amphetamine dependence. There is no
indication whether the hospital records were informed by blood or
urine samples, self-reported drug use or some other mechanism.
In this study drug use behaviour was only measured at baseline.


-----

The authors report that several of the participants who were classified as amphetamine users at baseline died from heroin-related
causes. This suggests that drug use patterns changed during follow
up, and that some deaths attributed to amphetamine users should
in fact be counted with the deaths of heroin users (Fugelstad et al.,
1997).
A similar situation was seen in the Australian study, where
13 deaths had an unspecified combination of drugs present.
Amphetamines may have been present, but none of these individuals had been classified as amphetamine users at baseline—drug
use behaviour may have changed during the time period and
some of those users may have switched to using amphetamines.
It is important to consider whether drug use behaviour prior
to death was known, as some deaths may have been misclassified. The variability in the methods used for diagnosis is
cause for concern, particularly as some of the subjects may
have been taking multiple drug types that likely affected health
outcomes.
Even in regions where cohort studies have been conducted, estimation of mortality directly associated with amphetamine use is
complicated by polydrug use (i.e: possible concurrent use of heroin
and/or cocaine or other drugs). Reporting to date and the limited
number of studies undertaken prevents any robust assessment of
this issue.
The deaths of the Thai cohort were largely identified during
home visits which were conducted when a participant had failed to
attend a follow up visit (Quan et al., 2007). The remainder was identified after family members informed the researchers. It is unclear
whether it was possible to verify these deaths and/or check for any
that may have been missed. Fridell and Hesse used the Swedish
Central Person Register to identify deaths; however they provide
no indication of the completeness of this record (Fridell and Hesse,
2006). It is possible that the deaths observed were an underestimation for each of these cohorts. Several databases were consulted
for the results of the Finnish cohort but the authors did not indicate
how exhaustive they felt their methods were (Turpeinen, 2001). For
the Dutch cohort the vital status was obtained from the population
registrar in the home town of each participant and such information was available for 94% of the cohort (Van Haastrecht et al., 1996).
The Australian data linkage study consulted three data sets and the
researchers conducted a performance check to verify the validity
of the results (Bartu et al., 2004). Fugelstad et al. report that 99%
of deaths are recorded in the Swedish population and therefore
observed deaths in this cohort should be accurate (Fugelstad et al.,
1997).
Quan et al. reported an association between duration of injection drug use and increased hazard of death (Quan et al., 2007).
This relationship suggests that increasing numbers of deaths should
be observed the longer the period of follow up. The Thai cohort
was only followed for 2 years which may explain the lower than
expected mortality rate of this cohort. Longer follow up periods
are needed to accurately determine the impact of amphetamine
dependence upon drug user mortality.
The samples reported on here may not be representative of
the broader population of amphetamine-dependent users in the
countries in which the studies were conducted. For example, the
Finnish sample included only children who had been interrogated by the “narcotics police” (Turpeinen, 2001). It is unclear how
valid it is to apply these results to older drug users, and to drug
users who were not known to the police. Similarly, other studies largely involved drug users in treatment, or in contact with
health services. Sub-populations of users may be at much higher
risk of premature death than dependent amphetamine users who
never come into contact with treatment services. Fugelstad et al.
note that the sample followed in their study includes injecting
drug users with “severe” dependence, and they warn that the


mortality figures reported should not be applied to other populations of drug users (Fugelstad et al., 1997). Further work with
more representative samples of amphetamine users would provide
some indication of whether the mortality levels among those not
engaged in treatment differs compared to those who are in such
contact.
The age of the cohorts must also be considered. The Australian
cohort was restricted to 18–50 year olds, the Dutch cohort was
primarily 25–40 years olds (the exact age range is not reported),
the Swedish cohort reported on by Fridell were all 18 years and
over, while Fugelstad’s cohort were all at least 20 years (the age
range of the Swedish military conscripts cohort was not available)
(Bartu et al., 2004; Fridell and Hesse, 2006; Fugelstad et al., 1997;
Van Haastrecht et al., 1996). It is unclear how mortality among
amphetamine users may change across age; such work might be
undertaken in future studies.
To better understand the relationship between illicit drug use
and mortality, data quality must be improved. Person years of follow
up (reported separately for each drug type), detailed cause of death
should be routinely reported. Increased detail on methods will also
assist in determining the accuracy of results. Standardised mortality
ratios should be calculated when possible to enable comparison of
results across different countries and regions. Confidence intervals
should be reported with any mortality estimates. The lower levels
of certainty around estimates from smaller reported here indicates
the need to study larger samples.
Dependence could be better be assessed using a recognised,
standardised diagnostic tools tool such as the World Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
(World Health Organization, 1997). Length and frequency of drug
use at baseline is an important variable to measure and analyse in
cohort studies.

_4.2. Conclusions_

It is estimated that amphetamine is one of the most commonly
used illicit drugs globally. Although amphetamine use has been
associated with significant morbidity, comparatively little is known
of the mortality risk of dependent use of this drug. In order to better
understand the impact that amphetamine dependence has on mortality, longitudinal cohort studies with long term follow up periods
need to be conducted. This is particularly important for countries
where dependent amphetamine use is prevalent and increasing.
The use of multiple methods such as data linkage as well as in person follow up may facilitate more data collection across countries
and regions.
