1. Introduction


Background: Published studies indicate that primary cocaine users (PCUs) have a mortality rate 4–8 times
higher than their age–sex peers in the general population. Most PCUs are primary intranasal cocaine users,
never-injectors and never-opioid users (PICUNINOs) and are usually underrepresented in cohort mortality
studies. The aim is to estimate excess mortality in all PCUs and in the subgroups of never-opioid users and
PICUNINOs in Spain.
Methods: 714 PCUs aged 18–30 were street-recruited in 2004–2006 in Spain and followed until 2010 to
ascertain vital status. Drug use was self-reported at baseline and 1–2 years later. Mortality was compared
with that of the general population using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).
Results: SMRs were 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4–9.0), 2.5 (95%CI: 0.8–7.8) and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.0–9.6), respectively, among
all participants, never-opioid users and PICUNINOS when using only baseline data on drug use, and 1.2
(95% CI: 0.2–8.5) and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.2–9.9) among the latter two subgroups, when using baseline plus
follow-up data.
Conclusion: Short-term mortality in young Spanish PCUs is 5 times higher than in the general population. This
excess mortality may largely be explained by a history of opioid use or the risk of starting such use.

Santos et al., 2012; Schnitzer et al., 2010). Therefore, primary cocaine
users (PCUs) can be expected to have excess mortality compared
to the general population, a risk estimated as 4–8 times greater
(Degenhardt et al., 2011b). These estimates come from cohorts of
PCUs who are either in drug treatment or which include a high or unknown proportion of participants with very risky drug use behaviors,
such as heroin use, injecting drugs or smoking crack/cocaine (Kaye &
Darke, 2004a, 2004b). However, most PCUs in developed countries
had never used illicit opioids or injected drugs or smoked cocaine —

hereinafter called “primary intranasal cocaine users never-injectors and
never-opioid users” (PICUNINOs) (EMCDDA, 2007; EMCDDA, 2011;
UNODC, 2011). As with non-fatal acute problems related to cocaine
(Kaye & Darke, 2004a, 2004b), excess mortality is probably lower in
PICUNINOs than in the previously studied PCU cohorts, so the available
estimates cannot be generalized to PICUNINOs or all cocaine users.
The aim is to estimate excess mortality in a Spanish cohort of young
PCUs, partially controlling the effect of the riskiest drug-use patterns,
such as heroin use, drug injection and crack/cocaine smoking.

2. Methods

A cohort of 714 cocaine users was recruited in 2004–2006 from
drug scenes and non-treatment settings using incentive-driven
chain-referral methods in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville, Spain
(Heckathorn, 1997; Heckathorn, 2011). Recruitment criteria were:
regular cocaine use (≥52 days/last year), age 18–30, and no regular
heroin use (≤ 12 days/last year). Two personal interviews were
conducted, at baseline and 1–2 years later. Questions were included
on socio-demographic variables, history and patterns of drug use,
and other subjects. Most questions concerned the last year or the
time between the two interviews. Determination of HIV and HCV
(hepatitis C virus) antibodies in a dried blood spot was made by
enzyme immunoanalysis (Pulido et al., 2009).
Both vital status and cause of death were obtained through record
linkage with the National Mortality Register. Follow-up ended on July
2010. In the analysis, several subgroups of PCUs were considered
according to risky drug-use patterns. PCUs were classified first using
only drug use patterns from the baseline interview, and again after
incorporating such patterns from the follow-up interview. Crude
mortality rates (CMRs) per thousand person-years of follow-up (py)
were determined for age–sex groups, using the dynamic method of
allocation of person-years and deaths to the age group (Cleves,
Gould, Gutiérrez, & Marchenko, 2010). Excess mortality compared
to their age–sex peers in the general population was estimated with
standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), using mortality rates of the
Spanish population in 2008 (INE, 2011). Stratification methods were
used to partially control the possible confounding effect of opioid
use, drug injection or smoking cocaine. It was not possible to control
for other variables. Causes of death were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Statistical analyses were
conducted with STATA (Cleves et al., 2010).

3. Results

At baseline PCUs were young (mean age: 23.0), mostly men and had
used cocaine for 6.2 years on average. In the year before baseline they
had used cocaine 135 days on average, mainly by sniffing (91.6%).
Some 62.5% (446) had never used illicit opioids, 94.3% had never
injected drugs, 64.4% had never smoked cocaine, and 50.7% (362)
were PICUNINOs. Lifetime opioid users were older, with higher probability of unemployment, imprisonment, arrests, or accommodation in
precarious housing or institutions than never-opioid users. Moreover,
they had used cocaine for longer, currently used it more often, were
more likely to be drug injectors, cocaine smokers or polydrug users,
and had a higher prevalence of HCV infection (Table 1).
The vast majority of lifetime opioid users had used these drugs very
sporadically in the year before baseline. Only 1.1%, 0.7% and 4.3% of total
participants, respectively, had used heroin, street methadone or other
opioids monthly or more frequently, and only 1% had been treated for
opioid abuse or dependence in that year.
PICUNINOs were very similar in their characteristics to never-opioid
users, since they comprise a large percentage of the latter subgroup
(Table 1).
Average follow-up time was 5.07 years per participant (SD: 0.86).
Among all baseline PCUs there were 9 deaths in 3922 py, giving a


CMR of 2.3/1000 py and a SMR of 4.7 (Table 2). The causes of death
were: acute drug intoxication (3), HIV infection (2), suicide (1),
pulmonary embolism (1), unspecified respiratory failure (1), and illdefined and unspecified cause (1). The SMR tended to be higher in
lifetime opioid users than never-opioid users (8.1 vs. 2.5), although
the confidence intervals overlapped. Among PICUNINOs, the CMR
(1.5/1000 py) and the SMR (3.1) were similar to never-opioid users.
No relevant changes in CMR and SMR between the first and the
second half of the follow-up period were found.
Of the baseline participants, 503 PCUs (70.4%), 333 (73.7%)
never-opioid users, and 278 PICUNINOs (76.2%) could be interviewed
1–2 years after baseline. About 2.6% (95% CI: 1.1–4.1) of all PCUs, 3.6%
(95% CI: 1.5–5.6) of never-opioid users, and 1.8% (95% CI: 0.5–4.6)
of PICUNINOs ceased cocaine use, and among those who continued
using cocaine the annual mean number of days of use decreased,
respectively, from 131.0 days (95% CI: 125.4–136.6) to 69.3 (95% CI:
62.6–76.5), from 119.5 days (95% CI: 113.2–125.7) to 61.1 (95% CI:
53.8–68.3), and from 115.4 days (95% CI: 108.4–122.5) to 58.7
(50.8–66.5). The proportion of never-opioid users who started opioid
use (9.0%; 95% CI: 5.8–12.2) was much lower than the proportion
of last-year opioid users who ceased such use (31.3%; 21.7–41.0).
Similarly, the proportion of “initiators” of any risky behaviors (opioid
use, drug injection or cocaine smoking) (6.8%; 95% CI: 3.7–10.0) was
much lower than the proportion of those who ceased all such
behaviors (46.2%; 39.3–53.0). When including follow-up data on
patterns of drug use, the SMRs were 1.2 among never-opioid users
and 1.4 among PICUNINOs. However, the SMRs were 7.2 and 6.6,
respectively, among lifetime opioid users and participants with opioid
use or drug injection or cocaine smoking (Table 2).

4. Discussion

In this study we have explored the excess mortality compared to the
general population in a Spanish street-recruited cohort of young primary cocaine users who at baseline had never used illicit opioids (62.5%)
or did so only sporadically (≤12 days in the year before baseline).
Participants had a mortality rate 4.7 times (95% CI: 2.4–9.0) higher
than their age–sex peers in the general population during the 5 years
following baseline (short term).
From this study it is very difficult to clearly identify explanatory factors for this excess mortality. However, mortality seems to be lower
among never-opioid users at baseline than among lifetime opioid
users (SMR=2.5 vs. 8.1) and among those who at baseline neither
used opioids nor injected drugs nor smoked cocaine (PICUNINOs)
than among those with any of these risky behaviors (SMR=3.1 vs. 6.2),
although neither of the two differences reached statistical significance.
The differences appear to be even larger after excluding those who
started opioid use or other risky behaviors during follow-up. It might
therefore be hypothesized that in Spain the excess mortality of young
PCUs in the short term may largely be explained by a history of opioid
use (or some strongly associated factor) or the risk of starting opioid
use during follow-up, which was not negligible.
This study is perhaps the first to estimate excess mortality in
young PCUs, controlling simultaneously for the effect of heroin use,
drug injection and crack/cocaine smoking. This control is essential
to obtain valid estimates because the mentioned behaviors are associated with a high risk of mortality (Degenhardt et al., 2011a; Dias et al.,
2011; Muhuri & Gfroerer, 2011). To control the effect of opioid use,
we excluded from the cohort those participants who had used such
drugs more than 12 days in the year before baseline. Thus, during
that year all participants had used cocaine much more frequently
than heroin (≥52 days vs. ≤12 days), and it could be assumed that
they were not primary opioid users. Moreover, stratification methods
were also used to control the confounding, focusing on those subgroups that had never used opioids or other risky behaviors at baseline or follow-up interview. The results show that controlling for

opioid use also controls fairly well for drug injection and cocaine
smoking, because in Spain the latter two behaviors were still highly
concentrated among opioid users; it was extremely rare, for example,
to find drug injectors who had never used opioids. Another strength is
that, since participants were recruited outside legal or care services
they are probably more representative of all cocaine users than
cohorts recruited into or through such services.
However, the study also has some limitations. The number of
deaths and years of follow-up is rather small, leading to relatively
imprecise estimates. There may be some misclassification by drug
use patterns because of recall biases or socially desirable responses.
Patterns of drug use were assessed only at baseline and 1–2 years
later. However, they may change over time, affecting the risk of

dying. Therefore, we cannot know for certain that those who were
non-opioid users or PICUNINOS at first follow-up interview remained
so at the time of death or end of follow-up. Finally, the excess mortality cannot be automatically attributed to cocaine use, because the participants and the reference population may differ in other factors that
could partly explain the excess mortality.
As hypothesized, the estimate of excess mortality among young
Spanish PCUs is in the lower range of published studies (SMRs=4–8),
in which the effect of opiates and other risky behaviors was barely
controlled (Degenhardt, Singleton, et al., 2011b). Our results are closer
to those of an Italian cohort of cocaine users attending a drug addiction
center, which controlled for opioid use at baseline, but not drug injection or cocaine smoking (SMR=4.9) (Pavarin, 2008).

-----

The results suggest that short-term excess mortality in young
Spanish PCUs could be partially explained by a history of opioid use
or the risk of starting such use. Although regular cocaine use has
been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and other
health problems (EMCDDA, 2007; Kaye & Darke, 2004a; Kuhns
et al., 2009; Macdonald et al., 2003; Maraj et al., 2010; Marzuk
et al., 1995; Qureshi et al., 2001; Ryb et al., 2009; Santos et al.,
2012; Schnitzer et al., 2010), it is unlikely that the amount of
cocaine-related damage to the body accumulated at such a young
age would be enough to cause death.
Despite the limitations, our findings among young Spanish PCUs
could perhaps be generalized to young PCUs from other developed
countries with socio-economic conditions, drug use patterns and
health care coverage similar to Spain, for example, most Western
European countries.
These estimates allow a better approximation to the populationattributable risk of death from cocaine use. Given the difficulty of
estimating excess mortality in cohorts that are representative of all cocaine users in the general population, valid estimates of this populationattributable risk could be obtained by previously obtaining SMRs and
population prevalence for major patterns of cocaine use, and adding
the partial contributions of these subgroups. It may be that regular
cocaine sniffing contributes much more to the population-attributable
risk than other patterns of cocaine use due to the much higher prevalence of cocaine sniffing in the general population.
New studies incorporating changes in drug use patterns during
follow-up are needed in different geographical areas with sufficiently
large sample sizes to allow estimation of excess mortality in different
subgroups of cocaine users, especially those like PICUNINOs that are
more frequently represented in the general population.
