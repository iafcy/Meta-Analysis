**ABSTRACT**

**Aims** Hepatitis C (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among injection drug users (IDUs) and likely to cause significant
mortality over time, but little research attention has focused upon the magnitude of this risk, particularly among
ageing users.This study examined trends over time in mortality attributed to liver disease, and in particular contrasting
this with other more commonly studied causes of death [acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), suicide and
overdose] among an ageing cohort of heroin-dependent people in Australia. Design Data linkage study of methadone
treatment entrants with the National Deaths Index. Setting A cohort entering methadone treatment for heroin
dependence in New South Wales, Australia, 1980–85. Participants A total of 2489 people entering methadone
treatment for heroin dependence and 54 847 person-years (PY) of follow-up. Measurements Linkage of data on all
methadone entrants between 1980 and 1985 with data from the Australian National Deaths Index, linked using
probabilistic record linkage software. Findings There were 8.2 deaths per 1000 PY [95% confidence interval (CI)
7.5–9.0], with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of 4.6 (95% CI 4.2–5.0). Almost one in five (17%) of deaths were
from underlying liver-related causes, most commonly viral hepatitis. The overall mortality rate for any liver cause was
1.4 deaths per 1000 PY (95% CI 1.1–1.7), 17 times higher than to the general population (95% CI 13.4–21.3), with
relative elevations more marked for females (SMR 27.9; 95% CI 17.7–41.9) than males (SMR 14.5; 95% CI 10.8–
19.0). Liver mortality increased over time, becoming the most common cause of death by the end of follow-up.
**Conclusions** Liver disease has become the most common cause of mortality among ageing opioid-dependent people
in an ageing Australian cohort. There is an imperative to reduce the long-term risks of HCV and other risks to the liver,
including alcohol consumption, which are typically not the major clinical focus for this group.

**INTRODUCTION**

Opioid dependence is associated with highly elevated
mortality [1]. Reviews of cohort studies conducted to
date suggest that most deaths are accounted for by drug
overdose, suicide, acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and traumatic deaths [1,2]. The importance of
these causes of death varies: mortality in general, and
from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in particular,
is lower in cohorts with low HIV prevalence [1]; HIV
varies markedly across countries [3]. If HIV prevalence
is reduced or prevented other causes of death, such as
liver disease, may become more prominent, particularly
as cohorts age.


Opioid-dependent people have a number of risk
factors for liver disease, including highly elevated levels
of alcohol dependence [4], and even higher levels of
hepatitis C (HCV) infection [5,6]. HCV prevalence among
Australian injecting drug users (IDUs) ranges between
50 and 75% [7]. Among those who contract HCV,
75–85% develop chronic HCV infection [8–10], leading
potentially to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular
carcinoma [11]. The proportion of HCV-infected people
developing cirrhosis is 7% at 20 years, and 20% by 40
years [12]. Additional liver stresses such as heavy
alcohol intake, liver fibrosis and HIV or hepatitis B
coinfection increase the speed of progression to complications [12].


-----

Few studies have followed opioid-dependent people
later in life, despite recognition that liver-related mortality will become a prominent cause of morbidity and
mortality among ageing IDUs. We followed a cohort of
Australian opioid-dependent people entering methadone
in New South Wales (NSW), Australia from entrance
in 1980–1985 until 2008. Here, HIV prevalence among
IDUs has remained low (around 1.5% [3]) and HCV is
highly prevalent (currently, over 50% [6,7]). Chronic
hepatitis B infection is considerably lower [as hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg)], around 2.7–5% [6]).

**METHODS**

This was a retrospective cohort study using data linkage
with mortality data from the National Death Index (NDI)
held by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
(AIHW), conducted in a manner consistent with the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for reporting [13].
The cohort included all people approved to receive methadone syrup for the treatment of opioid dependence by
the Medical Committee of Pharmaceutical Services,
NSW Health between 1980 and 1985; the Committee
met quarterly, with the cohort identified through manual
searches of their minutes. Identifiers were confirmed
through searches of NSW Health electronic records.
These data were forwarded to AIHW for data linkage
with the NDI. The NDI contains all death records in
Australia since 1980, compiled from the Registers of
Births, Deaths and Marriages in each jurisdiction.
Records contain identifying information and causes of
death classified by International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) versions 9 (1980–96) or 10 (1997–present). Data
linkage was performed by probabilistic record linkage
software by AIHW staff. Variables used for matching
included full name, date of birth, sex, date and State
of last known contact. Matching was performed in a
number of passes, and the matched records were
weighted according to the quality of the match. Clerical
review to select the best match from each pass was
conducted by A.G.; decisions were made using selection
criteria provided by AIHW, and alias identities from
NSW Health.
De-identified mortality data was forwarded on
completion of linkage. Underlying causes were provided
for deaths prior to 1997 (ICD-9), and both underlying
and contributing for deaths 1997 or later (ICD-10). An
underlying cause of death is the disease or injury initiating the train of events leading to death, or the
circumstances which produced the fatal injury [14]. Contributing causes of death include all additional morbid
conditions, diseases and injuries entered on the death
certificate [15]. Only limited methadone/buprenorphine


treatment data were available for this cohort, so treatment exposure data was not used.

**Statistical analyses**

Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1, SPSS
version 15.0 and Excel 2003. PY of follow-up contributed by each cohort member to different age groups
and time-periods were calculated using macros written
in SAS. Mortality rates (general and age-specific) were
expressed as deaths per 1000 PY. Kaplan–Meier survival
analysis was performed to show stratified survival rates.
Unit record data were obtained on all deaths and their
causes in NSW, 1980–2006. Standardized mortality
ratios (SMRs) were calculated from the ratio of agespecific death rates in the cohort, compared to the NSW
population.
Causes of death were grouped into categories of
related conditions, based on groupings published previously [16–18]; details of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in these
categories are available elsewhere [19]. SMRs for particular causes of death were calculated relative to the NSW
population.

**Ethics**

Ethics approval was received from University of NSW
Human Research Ethics Committee, NSW Health Ethics
Committee and the AIHW Ethics Committee.

**RESULTS**

There were 2654 individuals approved for methadone
treatment, 1980–85. Alternate name spellings and
names were recorded as ‘aliases’: 350 participants (14%)
had one alias, 73 participants (3%) had two aliases and
four (0.2%) had three aliases. A total of 2496 people with
full name and date of birth had sufficient information for
linkage (including aliases, a total of 3009 names were
submitted), completed on 28 August 2008. Seven people
were excluded, as the date of death preceded commencement of treatment. The final cohort comprised 2489 participants and 54 847 PY; 1420 were male (57%), 1058
were female (43%) and 11 were listed as both male and
female in different aliases (‘other’, 0.4%). The cohort
formation process is shown in Fig. 1.

**Mortality rates**

A total of 478 participants were deceased at 28 August
2008, with a mortality rate of 8.2 deaths per 1000 PY
(Table 1); sex had a significant impact on survival (c[2] =
17.99, 2 d.f., P = 0.0001). Participants died at 4.6 times
the rate of the general NSW population [95% confidence
interval (CI): 4.2–5.0); SMRs were 4.0 for males (95%

causes recorded, n = 432); CI: confidence interval


**DISCUSSION**

We examined causes of death among 2480 opioiddependent people close to 30 years after they entered
treatment. The CMR was 8.2 deaths per 1000 PY (95%
CI: 7.5–9.0), lower than pooled estimates of 20.9 per
1000 PY (95% CI: 19.0–22.0) [1], similar to other
Australian cohorts [20,21]. Mortality was 4.6 times
higher than the general NSW population, with this excess
particularly pronounced in younger and female participants: females in their 20s were 13.4 times more likely to
die as the NSW female population of the same age.
Although much attention is understandably focused
on acute forms of harm such as opioid overdose, opioiddependent people can and do survive long enough to
experience harms from slowly developing conditions
such as liver disease, especially in populations where HIV
infection is low. We found that almost 30 years postcohort entry, causes of death due to chronic illness such
as liver death and cancer became more prevalent, surpassing drug overdose deaths. We have examined and
discussed in greater detail elsewhere changes in overdose
mortality [20,22] and increasing cancer in a more recent
NSW cohort [23], which consider the reasons for elevations and changes in mortality attributable to these
causes.
Here, we focus on liver-related mortality. Liver deaths
comprised 17% of all underlying causes of death, and
26% of those occurring from 1997 to 2006; 45% of
these later deaths had either a contributing or underlying
cause of death that was a liver code. The major sources of
this liver mortality are to be chronic HCV, chronic liver
disease and concurrent heavy alcohol use.


A recent Scottish study suggested that among a
cohort of comparatively younger IDUs (median age 31
years), problematic alcohol use may have played a larger
role in liver-related hospitalizations and mortality than
HCV infection [24]. The current study suggests that
this may shift as IDUs age, given the larger number of
hepatitis-related deaths compared to alcohol-related liver
disease. The majority of the cases of chronic HCV-related
advanced liver disease occur after the second decade of
HCV infection [12], with the mean period between infection and mortality 20 years for cirrhosis and 29 years
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [10]. Our results
demonstrate the slow and increasing onset of fatal liver
disease; studies with even longer follow-up would show
HCC increases.
AIDS deaths were not elevated significantly in this
cohort (SMR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.4–2.6). Although low prevalence of HIV in Australia IDUs is known [25], a later
cohort of NSW oral substitution therapy (OST) entrants
between 1985 and 2006 did have slightly elevated AIDS
mortality [20]. The reasons for this difference could be
multiple: this cohort entered treatment when HIV awareness campaigns were commencing in the media and
when the first needle exchanges began in Sydney, NSW

[26]. It is possible that such HIV prevention interventions
may have had a stronger impact in this cohort (they are
likely to have greater impact when both risk behaviours
and HIV prevalence are less common [27]).

**Clinical implications**

This study has clear clinical implications. Ageing, HIVnegative, opioid-dependent people die at higher rates


-----

from liver disease than drug overdose, yet many causes of
liver disease are both preventable and treatable. Efforts
to prevent, treatment and reduce harms related to liver
disease are essential, particularly in situations where HIV
has been prevented or managed successfully. Although
evidence regarding the impact of needle and syringe programmes [28] and other injecting paraphernalia [29]
upon prevention of HCV infection is extremely limited,
reduction of risk is important, particularly during the
period of initiation to injecting, when HCV incidence is
highest [11]. Mathematical modelling suggests that HCV
treatment remains an under-utilized, yet a potentially
effective, strategy for reducing HCV prevalence among
IDU populations [30,31] in addition to improving the
health of individual patients. Greater attention also needs
to be paid to the likely impact of continued heavy drinking among HCV-positive people in this population, and to
encouraging development of and participation in HBV
inoculation programmes to reduce rates of HCV/HBV
coinfection.

**Study limitations**

Data linkage relies on clerical review; although this can
be subjective, it was minimized by using consistent and
documented selection criteria, with the same individual
(A.G.) conducting all reviews. The first stage of data
linkage clerical review was blinded to the subject’s vital
status; this was not possible for NDI linkage, as the NDI
only holds records of deceased individuals. However, we
are confident of a good match, given the similarity in
mortality rates with a later NSW cohort [20].
The accuracy of data linkage also relies upon the
accuracy of identified personal information, which may
be poorly recorded; this was reduced with additional
linkage to electronic records. Alias identities may lead
to inaccuracies in linkage; prisoners often use small
changes in personal information to obtain bail [32]; 17%
of this cohort had at least one known alias. None the less,
linkage accuracy for NSW prisoners and the NDI has a
sensitivity of 88.4% and specificity of 99.7% [32],
showing it is still accurate even when aliases are very
common.
Finally, given the study design, which relied on routinely collected data, we were not able to specify specific
exposures that may have accounted for the increased
mortality (for example, patterns of alcohol use, chronic
HCV or HBV infection). To that end, we cannot specify
the magnitude of risks that these exposures pose.
Similarly, we were unable to measure desistance from
injecting and/or drug and alcohol use in a time-dynamic
way, which meant we were unable to consider potential changes in mortality when such changes occurred,
as have been demonstrated in other studies [33].


Prospective cohorts with rich data on behavioural risks
are better served to answer such questions.

**CONCLUSIONS**

This long-term follow-up study permitted the observation
of the dramatic impact of advanced liver disease. Liverrelated deaths were 17 times elevated, and attributable
primarily to viral hepatitis, chronic liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Prevention and treatment of HCV
infection and other risks to liver function is vital to avoid
marked long-term impact on the mortality of opioiddependent people.
