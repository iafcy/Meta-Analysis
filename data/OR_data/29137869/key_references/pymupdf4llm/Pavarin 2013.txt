# Mortality Risk for Cocaine Abusers in Relation to Heroin Use: A Follow-Up Study

## Raimondo Maria Pavarin


In Europe, the number of patients treated for primary cocaine abuse at a public treatment center for drug addiction
(SERT) increased of 83.3% from 2004–2009, a fact that
can be explained both by problems caused by elevated or
prolonged consumption as by those arising from injecting cocaine or its use in combination with other drugs
(Gfroerer & Brodsky, 1993). Cocaine was cited as the
main reason for entering treatment by 15% of all reported
drug users entering treatment in 2010, the proportion of
primary cocaine users (CUs) was higher (21%) (European
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction

[EMCDDA], 2012).

It should be recognized that although many CUs tend to
be reluctant to seek treatment at public treatment centers
(considered indicative of socially marginal subjects and
heroin addicts) unless afflicted by serious disturbances, in
recent years the types of cocaine addicts seeking treatment
have changed, so in addition to subjects who inject cocaine and heroin (Davoli, Pasqualini, Belleudi, Bargagli,


& Perucci, 2007; Siliquini, Morra, Versino, & Renga,
2005), we also see CUs who do not use heroin (Gossop,
Griffiths, Powis, & Strang, 1994; Pavarin, 2008; Prinzleve
et al., 2004).

Cohort studies of problematic cocaine use suggest that this drug increases the risk of premature
death, morbidity, and disability. Regular cocaine use
is associated with a range of adverse consequences
that potentially increase mortality (Chen & Anthony,
2004; Chen, Storr, & Anthony, 2009; Degenhardt,
Singleton, et al., 2011; Devlin & Henry, 2008; Ferri &
Gossop, 1999; Gossop et al., 1994; O’Brien & Anthony,
2005; Riezzo et al., 2012; Wagner & Anthony, 2002;
Wagner & Anthony, 2007).

Cocaine-related health consequences are difficult to
observe, especially in use trajectories that include heroin
and the literature divides CUs into two different groups:
socially integrated users who use powdered cocaine
(most often snorted) but do not use heroin, and socially
marginalized users who use cocaine (often injected) or
crack cocaine in conjunction with opiates. The latter also
includes heroin addicts in treatment, making it difficult
to identify the primary substance of abuse and to identify which problems are specifically related to cocaine
use (Decorte, 2001; Gossop et al., 1994; Leri, Bruneau,
& Stewart, 2001; Pavarin et al., 2011; Prinzleve et al.,
2004; Van der Poel, Rodenburg, Dijkstra, Stoele, & van
de Mheen, 2009).

Socially integrated drug users mainly use cocaine in
recreational contexts; they also use cannabis, while nearly
one-third have never used cocaine regularly (Decorte,
2001; Gossop et al., 1994; Leri et al., 2001; Prinzleve
et al., 2004; Van der Poel et al., 2009), they have paid
less for cocaine, have medium-high financial resources
(at least for the Italian context) and have a greater understanding of the market (Boys, Marsden, Griffiths, &
Strang, 2000; Brunt, van Laar, Niesink, & van den Brink,
2010; Pavarin, Berardi, & Consonni, 2012). The objective
of this study, which targeted residents of the metropolitan

area of Bologna who were treated at a public treatment
center following problems due to cocaine use, was to
study mortality risk in relation to heroin abuse.
The metropolitan area of Bologna is a densely populated territory in the region called Emilia Romagna, in
north-eastern Italy. It is made up of 50 municipalities over
an area of around 3,000 km[2], with a population of more
than 850,000 inhabitants. The consumption of cocaine,
above all snorted, is slowly replacing that of heroin, which
is dropping sharply. This has occurred in relation to an
increased availability and a fall in the prices on the local market, akin to what has been observed in the national territory (Dipartimento Politiche Antidroga [DPA],
2012; EMCDDA, 2012; United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime [UNODC], 2012). The local sales network is
characterized by the presence of dealers who sell any kind
of substance (multidealers) and by occasional nonprofessional dealers who invest in this sector for the high profit
margins.
The prevalence of cocaine consumption, higher in the
wealthier areas of northern Italy, after an initial period
characterized by strong consumption, is declining, both
as a result of the economic crisis and the higher number
of confiscations.
The local SERTs are national health system facilities
dealing with providing care and treatment for people with
addictions involving illegal drugs and alcohol and are
mostly oriented to the needs of opioid users.
In recent years, in collaboration with social and
therapeutic communities, new services have been offered
addressed to people with cocaine addiction, which ensure
a more flexible organization of the locations and timing
to better meet the needs of the patient and guarantee
discretion.

**METHODS**


The subjects who were lost to follow up were included
in calculating person-years until the date they moved from
their last known residence. Information was collected until July 2012.
Regarding the abuse substance, in view of the fact that
in a few cases both heroin and cocaine were indicated;
and it was not possible to identify which was the primary
substance of abuse, two user typologies were created: CUs
(no heroin), heroin and cocaine users (HCU).
Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed
with the Student t and chi-squared tests, respectively.
Crude mortality rates (CMRs) per thousand person
years were calculated for gender, injecting, and substance
of abuse.
To compare the mortality rates of drug users with those
of the general population, we calculated the standardized
mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative confidence intervals
(CI) at 95% specifically for cause and gender (Standard:
Bologna Province). The SMR, adjusted for age and calendar year, was calculated overall and for all specific causes
represented.
To evaluate the association between the variables and
general mortality risk, we performed a regression analysis
using the Poisson method (Clayton & Hills, 1993; Selvin,
2003).
Data analyses were performed using the statistical software program STATA 10.0.

**RESULTS**


We selected subjects resident in the metropolitan area of
Bologna, who had visited a public treatment center for
problems due to the use/abuse of cocaine in the period
from January 1, 1988 to December 31, 2009.
Patients were selected from the SERT’s computerized
archives (10 centers) treated for primary cocaine abuse
during the period considered.
Only voluntary admissions were considered; we excluded subjects who were involuntarily admitted and body
packers.
Variables were used related to date of birth, gender,
birth nation, city of residence, other substances of abuse,
hepatitis C status, HIV status, modality of use, level of education, professional condition, date of first and last contact with the SERTs. Only the information from the first
contact was used. Information about the setting of the injection was not collected.
Life status was verified at the municipality of the subject’s last place of residence. The mortality archives at the
local health authority of residence verified the cause of


The cohort was made up of 471 subjects, 15.3% female,
5.1% nonnative, with an average age of 30.8 years.
Follow-up continued until December 31, 2009 for
95.3% of the subjects or until the date of death (22 subjects were lost to follow up); there were 3,188 at-risk person years (459 female, 2729 male), 35 deaths, the first of
which occurred in 1996.
A 27.4% subjects had a high school degree (the level of
education degree is known in 98% of cases), 70.1% were
employed, 11.3% were hepatitis C positive, and 3% were
HIV positive.
Modalities of cocaine use were known for 82% of the
subjects (24.4% injected, 8.7% smoked, 56.5% snorted).
The average follow-up period was 6.8 years, the average period of contact with SERT was 3.6 years, and the
average time spent since the last contact with the SERT at
the end of the follow-up was 3.2 years. The average period
of contact with SERT was 7.3 years for HCUs and 2 years
for CUs (p < .0001).
Three hundred thirty subjects were only cocaine
abusers (follow-up completed for 95.8%, 1,747 person
years, 6 deaths), 141 were cocaine and heroin abusers
(follow-up completed for 94.4%, 1,441 person years, 29
deaths).
Modalities of cocaine or heroin use were known for
90.6% of the subjects, and 82 subjects (17.4%) were injecting (DJ follow-up completed for 93%, 842 person
years, 14 deaths) and 340 were not injecting (NDJ follow

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the subjects included in the study separately for heroin use, injecting,
males and females. Half of the CU entered treatment after
2004, 75% of the HCU before 2000.

By the end of the follow-up, 46% of the HCUs had
a therapeutic program in progress, 28% had previously
completed the treatment, 26% had previously given up;
18% of the CUs had a therapeutic program in progress,
50% had previously completed the treatment, 32% had
previously given up


All SERT clients had been submitted to medical health
checkups and benefited from socioeducational support
services, 52% of the HCUs had been undergoing treatment
with protracted integrated methadone, 48% had been submitted to psychological interviews/assessment, and 33%
had been admitted to residential structures, 13% were undertaking psychotherapy; 48% of the CUs had been submitted to psychological assessment, 19% had been treated
with pharmacological therapies, 15% had been admitted
to residential structures, and 10% were undertaking psychotherapy.
Twenty-nine deaths were observed during the followup period, 23 among men and 6 among women. Among
the men, 17% of the deaths were due to AIDS, and 14%
from opiate overdose, 14% from circulatory disease, 10%
from cirrhosis, 7% from viral hepatitis, 7% from traffic
accidents, 3% from all cancers, and 3% from homicide.
Of the deaths reported among women, 33% were due to
opiate overdose, 17% to diseases of the cardiocirculatory
system, 17% to cirrhosis, 17% to homicide.
Twenty-nine deaths were observed among HCUs, 6
among CUs (all males), 14 among DJs, 18 among NDJs.
Table 2 reports deaths by substance abused, injecting, and
by gender.
Regarding mortality rate per thousand person years,
CMRs were higher among females (13.07; 95% CI,
5.87–29.09) than males (10.63; 95% CI, 7.38–15.29),
among HCUs (20.12; 95% CI, 13.98–28.95) than CUs
(3.43; 95% CI, 1.54–7.65), and among DJs (16.62;
95% CI, 9.84–28.06) than NDJs (8.95; 95% CI, 5.84–
13.73).
Table 3, broken down according to substance abused,
injecting, and gender, reports SMRs and 95% CIs. Excess
of mortality was observed for all causes in both genders in
the cohort compared with the general population where

the SMR was at least 9 times higher among males and
25 times higher among females.
The highest and most statistically significant SMRs for
males were from cirrhosis, opiate overdose, parasitic infectious diseases, AIDS, diseases of the cardiocirculatory
system diseases, and road accidents; for females they were
from cirrhosis, opiate overdose, homicide, and circulatory
system diseases.
Cocaine (no heroin)—among CUs, where all deaths
were among males, 50% of the deaths were from road accidents (Table 2).
As regards the mortality rate per thousand person years,
CMRs among males were 3.91 (95% CI, 1.76–8.70).
As regards comparisons with the general population,
among males, there is a statistically significant excess for
all causes; the highest and most statistically significant
SMRs were from AIDS (only 1 case) and road accidents
(Table 3).
Cocaine and heroin—of the deaths reported among
HCUs, 21% were due to opiate overdose, 17% to diseases
of the cardiocirculatory system, 14% to AIDS, and 14%
to cirrhosis (Table 2).
Among the females, 33% of the deaths were from opiate overdose; among the males, 17% from opiate overdose, 17% from AIDS, and 17% from cardiocirculatory
system.
Regarding the mortality rate per thousand person years,
CMRs were higher among females (24.29; 95% CI,
10.91–54.07) than males (19.26; 95% CI, 12.80–28.98).
In addition, elevated and statistically significant SMRs
were found in both genders (Table 3). The highest and
most statistically significant SMRs for males were from
parasitic infectious diseases, opiate overdose, AIDS, cirrhosis, diseases of the cardiocirculatory system, and violent causes; for females, they were from cirrhosis, opiate
overdose, homicide, and circulatory system diseases.
Those not injecting — among female NDJs, two-thirds
of the deaths were from opiate overdose; among males,
27% were from cardiocirculatory system, 27% from violent causes, 13% from opiate overdose (Table 2).
Regarding the mortality rate per thousand person years,
CMRs were higher among females (10.67; 95% CI,
3.44–33.09) than males (8.72; 95% CI, 5.49–13.84).
As regards comparisons with the general population,
elevated and statistically significant SMRs were found in
both genders (Table 3). Among males, the highest and
most statistically significant SMRs were from cirrhosis
(just 1 case), parasitic infectious diseases (1 case), opiate overdose, AIDS (1e case), cardiocirculatory system,
and violent causes; for females, they were from cirrhosis
(1 case) and from homicide (1 case).
Injecting-–among females DJs, two-thirds of the deaths
were from opiate overdose; among the males, 27% were
from AIDS, 18% from opiate overdose, and 18% from cirrhosis (Table 2).
As regards the mortality rate per thousand person years,
CMRs were similar in both sexes: females (16.85; 95% CI,
5.44–52.25), males (16.56; 95% CI, 9.17–29.90).

most statistically significant SMRs for males were from
cirrhosis, AIDS, parasitic infectious diseases (1 case)
and opiate overdose; for females, they were from opiate
overdose and as a result of the cardiocirculatory system
(1 case).
To evaluate the association between sociodemographic
variables and general mortality risk, a regression analysis
was performed using the Poisson method. The variables
inserted in the model were gender, country of birth (native, nonnative), year (<2000, > 2000), age at first visit
=
(<35 years, > 35 years), duration of follow-up (>
= =
5 years,<5 years), professional condition (employed, not
employed), level of education (university/high school
diploma, primary/secondary school), cocaine injected (no,
yes), and substance abuse (cocaine-no heroin, cocaine and
heroin).
The multivariate analysis showed a higher mortality
risk, statistically significant at 95%, within 5 years of first
contact for females, a low level of education, and subjects
who inject cocaine (Table 4).
Mortality risk for people who took both heroin and cocaine was at least four times that found in cocaine-only
users.

**DISCUSSION**


The study results confirm what has been reported in the
literature concerning the greater mortality risk connected

regression model

to heroin and cocaine abuse and show a higher mortality
risk for subjects who took both heroin and cocaine, who
seem to have different characteristics than their counterparts who do not use heroin (cocaine-only users). Furthermore, a higher risk emerged for those injecting.
This study presents some limits that reduce the generalizability of the results and require additional research with
specifically targeted studies.
The data used are those available from the files available at the SERTs of the metropolitan area of Bologna.
It has not been possible to consider data concerning the
age at the first use, average consumption variations over
time, and the use of other substances, because they were
not retrieved in a uniform manner by the operators.
Despite these limits, several interesting aspects have
emerged in identifying the vital statistics and mortality
risks relating to different substances abused, heroin in
particular, and the identification of the specific causes of
death.
Staring from 2000, as reported by other studies (Davoli
et al., 2007; EMCDDA, 2012; Pavarin, 2008; Pavarin
et al., 2012; Siliquini et al., 2005), the type of cocaine
addict requiring treatment at a public health center has
changed, where the subjects with concomitant heroin
abuse have decreased and those who use cocaine, snorted
or smoked, have increased. These are people born in Italy,
mainly males, with stable employment, where there is a
very low percentage of hepatitis C and HIV positives.
On the contrary, the characteristics of the subjects with
concomitant heroine abuse tend to be substantially similar to those of other heroin addicts undergoing treatment:
injecting drug users, unemployed people, low education
level, with a high proportion of people positive to hepatitis C and HIV.
The characteristics of the two types are reflected in the
different mortality rates, where CMRs were higher among
HCUs than CUs.
Regarding comparisons with the general population,
the SMR was at least four times higher among male
CUs, 24 times higher among male HCUs, and 43 times
higher among female HCUs, akin to what is reported
in mortality studies on cohorts of cocaine (Arendt,
Munk-Jørgensen, Sher, & Jensen, 2011; Barrio et al.,
2013; Merrall, Bird, & Hutchinson, 2012; Pavarin, 2008;
Ribeiro, Dunn, Laranjeira, & Sesso, 2004; Ribeiro, Dunn,
Sesso, Dias, & Laranjeira, 2006) and heroin abusers
(Clausen, Anchersen, & Waal, 2008; Degenhardt et al.,
2009; Degenhardt, Bucello, et al., 2011; Evans et al. 2012;
Fugelstad, Agren, & Romelsj¨o, 1998; Merrall et al., 2012;
Risser et al., 2001).
A review of mortality rates from cohort studies of CUs
found that CMRs ranged from 5.3 to 61.6 per 1000 person years (Degenhardt, Singleton, et al., 2011). SMRs reported in various studies suggested that mortality was four
to eight times higher among CUs than in their same age
and sex peers in the general population.
The different mortality between the two types is also
reflected in the single causes of death, where among male


**Risque de mortalit´e aupr`es les coca¨ınomanes en ce qui**
**concerne la consommation d’h´ero¨ıne: ´etude de suivi**
´Etude de cohorte sur 471 consommateurs de coca¨ıne


eases, opiate overdose, AIDS, cirrhosis, diseases of the
cardiocirculatory system, and violent causes; for female
HCUs from cirrhosis, opiate overdose, homicide, and diseases of the circulatory system.
The multivariate analysis, where the mortality risk for
people who took both heroin and cocaine was at least four
times that found in only-CUs, confirms these results and
showed a higher mortality risk for females, a low educational level and subjects who inject cocaine.
Regarding the use of heroin by cocaine abusers, mortality studies on cohorts of cocaine abusers that separate
results based on heroin use reported different rates in the
two groups, higher among HIV positive intravenous drug
users (Degenhardt, Singleton, et al., 2011).
As regards the injecting drug use, the studies reported
in the literature confirm a higher risk of death for these
subjects, also in relation to the low age at the start of
drug taking, high dosages, consumption intensity, duration of the addiction, high age of initial contact with the
health care services and for the subjects with a history of
incarceration, low education levels, jobless, use of alcohol and other drugs, high levels of ill-health, risk behavior, social exclusion, and marginalization (Arendt, 2011;
Gossop, Griffiths, Powis, Williamson, & Strang, 1996;
Hickman et al., 2003; Kertesz et al 2012).
Variability in cocaine abusers seeking treatment
has been a long-recognized feature of this population
(Carroll, Nich, & Rounsaville, 1997), and the results of
the study, on the grounds of the concomitant use of heroin,
show two distinct populations with differing socioeconomic, age characteristics, consumption styles, health status, death risks, and death causes.
While the mortality of cocaine and heroin abusers is
similar to that of heroin addicts, with the reasonable doubt
that it is the same population, that of the cocaine-only
abusers instead seems to stem from particular styles of
life connected to risky and reckless behaviors, oriented
to obtaining immediate gratifications, with no concern for
the future consequences (Levin, 2007; Vergara-Moragues
et al., 2011).
It is important to clarify these important aspects by
means of future studies that distinguish the population
of cocaine addicts on the grounds of the possible use of
heroin, also taking into consideration the abuse of other
substances.

_Follow-up: In the majority of longitudinal studies, individ-_
uals are followed for different length of time. An individual’s period of observation (follow-up time) starts
when they join the study and stops when they experience the outcome (death), is lost to follow up, or the
follow-up period ends. This period is also called period
at risk, often measured in years (person years at risk).
_Socially integrated drug users: Socially integrated drug_
users mainly use in recreational contexts, they also
use cannabis, and they have medium-high financial
