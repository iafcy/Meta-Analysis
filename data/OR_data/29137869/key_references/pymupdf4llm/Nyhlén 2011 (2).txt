#### a b s t r a c t

Aims: To evaluate premature mortality and causes of death from young adulthood to middle age in
a cohort of drug users followed during almost four decades
Design: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of patients with drug abuse/dependence.
Methods: A cohort of 561 drug abusers, admitted to a detoxification and short-term rehabilitation unit
1970e1978 was followed to December 31st, 2006. Standardized interviews and hospital records with
toxicological analyses were used for demographic data, substance use and psychiatric diagnoses at
admission. For Follow-up analyses, autopsy protocols including toxicology tests and death certificates
were obtained for assessment of causes of death which were coded according to ICD-10. Age-group
standardized mortality ratios were calculated independently for both sexes.
Results: 204 persons (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. SMR was 5.94 for the cohort. Compared to an ageand gender-matched population, the risk of premature death was about eighteen times higher between
the ages of 20e44 and about five times higher from 45 up to the age of 69. Of 120 (59%) drug-related
deaths, 43 were opiate overdoses, and 3 were overdose from amphetamine. A total of 53 (26%) persons
died violent deaths: 39 suicides, of which 25 were drug-related, 3 homicides and 12 accidents. The
Swedish national causes of death register underestimated drug-related death by 37% and suicide by 85%
compared to the results from this study.
Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature often drug-related and
violent death well into middle age, and to a great extent the drug addicts died from the same drug they
had abused when they were first admitted for treatment. The underestimation of drug-related death and
suicide in some national death cause registers could be reduced if the doctor routinely records ICD codes
when issuing death certificates and autopsy protocols.

Drug abusers have an increased risk of premature mortality,
which is influenced by a number of factors, including types of drugs
used, patterns of administration, risk behavior, contracted infectious diseases, gender, age and social situation. Premature death is
defined as death occurring before the average age of death within
a given population.

The present study investigates causes of premature death in
a cohort of drug abusers from January 1970 to December 31st, 2006.
During the 1970s drug use patterns in Sweden changed from
a predominance of amphetamine abuse to amphetamine as well as
opiate abuse.[1,2] Regional differences in the availability of substances
have remained to the present.[3] In Copenhagen in Denmark, very
close to the studied county in the southern part of Sweden,
morphine base and, from 1975, heroin, have dominated the drug
scene.[4] The cohort is, according to data from a national case-finding
study from the 1970s, representative of the pattern of heavy drug
use in the population of substance abusers at that time. Most of the
local intravenous drug abusers were included in this cohort as
patients.[3]

Modes of administration vary between drug-dependent populations. Intravenous drug use in particular is vital to evaluate, since
some contagious blood-borne infections cause chronic infections
and even death. Contagious blood-borne infections related to
intravenous drug use are hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.[5][e][10] In
USA, the first HIV infections appeared among drug addicts in New
York in the mid 1970s,[11] while in Sweden the first HIV-infected
drug addict was detected as late as 1984.[12]

Most studies report higher mortality for opiate users than for
other substance users[13][e][17] but most substance dependent patients
use more than one substance throughout life. A follow-up study of
a consecutive sample of 125 drug-dependent Swedish patients
with mixed drug abuse demonstrated an annual mortality rate of
1%,[18] a figure which increased to 2% over the next ten year followup period of the same sample.[19]

1.1. The drug scene

Around 16.5 million persons use opiates per year worldwide.[20]

In a meta-analysis of mortality death rates among opiate abusers
were about 13 times the norm for their age.[21] The standardized
mortality ratio (SMR) in more recent studies is still higher in groups
that do not receive opiate agonist treatment such as methadone,
buprenorphine or other opiates.[7,17,22][e][25] In general, mortality is
suppressed during opiate agonist maintenance treatment or heroin
maintenance.[25]

Overdose is a major cause of death among opiate-dependent
patients. In Australia it is assumed that 1/140 opiate users (0.7%) die
from an overdose in a given year.[26] Overdose is here defined as
death caused by illicit drugs.[27] Several studies of opiate users have
reported that 35e40% of all deaths are overdoses.[6,14,28][e][31] Lifestyle
is a major influence factor. Overdoses, for instance, seldom occur
among subjects who have become opiate-dependent in connection
with pain treatment[32] or among abusers not injecting.[33]

Although amphetamine is considered to be the most prevalent
synthetic drug of abuse in the world used by 25 million individuals
per year, few studies have focused on the impact of stimulant use on
cause specific mortality.[20,34] Unlike opiates, cocaine and amphetamine seldom cause death.[26] Instead, stimulant use has been associated with increased mortality due to lifestyle factors indirectly
associated with stimulant use such as violent behavior, violent
deaths ordiseases acquired through intravenous administration.[12,35]

Despite the fact that cannabis in its various forms is the most
common substance worldwide, used by as many as 166 million
people per year, few studies have to our knowledge assessed
mortality associated with cannabis or reported an increased association between mortality and cannabis. One study of marijuana
smokers reported that cannabis was associated with increased
AIDS-related mortality,[36] an association explained by an increased
prevalence of marijuana use among homosexual males.

1.2. Influence of psychiatric disorders

The relation between premature mortality and psychiatric
disorders in drug abusers has to our knowledge never previously
been studied in a cohort over several decades. The suicide rate in
epidemiological studies of drug abusers is high and suicide
attempts often reflect a co-morbid depressive disorder.[37] The rate
of suicide attempts in a five-year follow-up of a representative
sample from the present material demonstrated that 45% of all
patients had attempted suicide at least once.[18] Another Swedish
study observing patients with co-morbid substance abuse and
psychiatric disorders found a rate of 59% attempted suicides.[38]


1.3. Aims of the study

I. To compare the mortality in the cohort of drug-dependent
patients with the mortality in a gender- and age-corrected
local population in the southern region of Sweden.
II. To identify causes of death in the cohort: (1) Drug-related: (a)
drug as primary, underlying death cause, including overdosing and drug-related suicides (b) drug as contributing
cause of death, including violent death, (2) To identify non
drug-related deaths: (a) diseases, (b) violent death including
accidental death and suicide/homicide.
III. To identify to what extent substances found post mortem
were already present at the first admission to treatment.

2. Method

2.1. Setting

The setting was an inpatient detoxification and short-term
rehabilitation unit in the southern part of Sweden, Scania County, at
the St. Lars psychiatric hospital in the city of Lund. The catchment
area for the unit was the entire county with a population of 977,783
people in 1970. The unit was a typical low threshold treatment
facility of this period accepting all drug abusers seeking treatment.

2.2. Subjects

The data were collected over a period of nearly four decades
prior to the follow-up conducted in 2006. Comparisons were made
between those who were alive in December 2006 and those who
had died during the study period 1970e2006. Causes of death were
analyzed for all individuals who died during the follow-up.

2.3. Assessment at baseline

Drug use and somatic symptoms were evaluated in the regular
medical intake assessment carried out by a physician. Drug
screening, including alcohol, was based on intake urine samples
analyzed by thin layer chromatography or gas chromatography at
the laboratory unit of the hospital. Standardized forms were used
for collecting baseline demographic data, types of drugs used and
psychiatric disorders. Clinical interviews, standardized questionnaires (SWEDATE) and hospital records contained mandatory
information on length, intensity of substance abuse and psychiatric
diagnoses.[39,40] Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were issued at
discharge by the senior consulting psychiatrist. For this presentation, three broad groups according to ICD-8 nomenclature were
used: psychosis, neurotic disorder (depression and/or anxiety
disorders) and personality disorder.

2.4. Coding and identifying causes of death

In this long-term follow-up of mortality, the patients’ national
identification numbers were linked to the Swedish Central Personal
Register and the Cause of Death Register at the National Department of Health (EPC) in which all deaths are consistently recorded
by the Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB). The coding in
Sweden is performed by SCB, based upon death certificates, issued
but not coded by physicians and/or forensic doctors. The coverage
of deaths in Sweden is close to 100% because reporting is mandatory. The ICD-10 codes permit classification of death causes
according to the rules specified in the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, published
by the WHO.[41] ICD-10 provides improved coding possibilities for
many different drugs compared to previous versions of ICD.

Diagnoses in hospital records from the first admission based on
ICD-8 and ICD-9 (303, 304) were re-coded into ICD-10 diagnoses of
substance abuse and dependence (F10eF19).
Death certificates and autopsy protocols from forensic clinics in
Sweden and Denmark were obtained, and causes of death were
coded according to ICD-10 by a senior consultant physician (A.N.)
and an associate professor of forensic medicine (P.K.). Causes of
death were finally classified as drug-related or non drug-related.
The two raters classified the first 100 causes of death diagnoses
independently of each other. All cases (n ¼ 204) were then filed
after mutual agreement. Only three out of 100 differed slightly (3%).
A reliability check of 70 protocols classifying drug-related vs non
drug-related deaths showed a good agreement (k ¼ 0.98).
Swedish forensic autopsy always includes drug analyses when
the deceased persons are drug abusers, and/or persons who have
suffered an accidental, unclear or violent death. These toxicological
data were studied in detail in every case of suspected or confirmed
drug-related death.
Violent death includes accidental deaths and suicides/homicides and can be both drug-related and non drug-related. Accidental death includes, for example, motor vehicles and drowning
accidents. Overdoses were classified separately by type of drug.
Overdose is defined as an acute death, occurring shortly after the
intake of an illegal drug, and directly related to the intake of the
drug.[27] Overdoses are often presumed to be accidental but can be
suicidal with a lethal intoxication with illicit drugs. Suicidal overdoses were classified as suicides by the pathologist on the basis of
forensic autopsy protocols. Police reports supplied important
additional information to confirm diagnoses.

2.4.1. Drug-related death
2.4.1.1. Drug as underlying cause of death. The underlying cause of
death is the primary reason for dying, while contributing causes of
death contribute to death without being the primary cause.[27] The
definition of drug-related death used is the one adopted by several
other authors.[5,27] The outline of classification of drug-related death
presented by Degenhardt[26] is close to the one used in this study with
additional ICD-10 codes to include alcohol, as well as self-inflicted
and unclear intoxication by any drug. Drug-related death, “druginduced death” refers to those cases where the underlying cause of
death is directly associated to drug use according to death certificates
or autopsy protocols. The primary cause of drug-related death is
defined according to the substances involved and the context.

i) an acute condition caused by drug use where the deceased
person was identified as having a drug use disorder (F10eF16,
F19), usually with a history of drug dependence (F10.2eF16.2,
F19.2) and ii) an acute intoxication, caused by drugs
(X40eX45, X60eX65, or/and codes from T36eT50 for specific
drug identification, or/and X85 þ Y10eY15).
ii) A primary drug-related death includes the codes F10.0eF16.0,
F19.0 alone orX40eX45/X60eX65 cross-classified withalcohol
(F10.0), cocaine (T40.5, F14.0), other stimulants as amphetamine (T43.6, F15.0), or opiates (T40.0eT40.4, T40.6 and F11.0).

2.4.1.2. Drug as contributing factor in deaths due to other causes. Cases where drugs play only a contributory role (indirectly
related to death, e.g. motor vehicle accidents, drowning) or the
underlying cause of death is a medical condition caused by long-term
useof drugs,the useof drugsisnot classifiedas primarycauseof death.

2.4.2. Non drug-related death
Non drug-related death was classified as such if death was
caused by somatic diseases as well as accidents, suicide or other
violent deaths without laboratory indications of drug involvement.


3. Statistical analysis

First, the observed mortality rates of the subjects in the sample
were compared with the mortality in the general population in the
area, Scania County, Sweden in the 1970s, by calculating the SMR
for both genders combined in 5-year age groups. The general
population mortality was adjusted to match the gender and age
distribution of the drug-user population. SMR was calculated as the
ratio, observed/expected for men and women separately. Subjects
were censored by December 31, 2006.
Within each 5-year age group, the number of subjects at risk
was calculated as the number of subjects who 1) entered the cohort
before they reached that age-group interval, 2) had not died or
migrated before that age-group interval, and 3) had not passed that
age-group interval to December 2006. Since the ethnic diversity of
Sweden was small in the 1970s, adjusting for race or ethnicity was
not considered necessary.

4. Results

4.1. Characteristics of the cohort

The cohort was predominately young males, 23e25 years old at
first admission to detoxification (Table 1). A family history of
substance use problems was reported for about 40%, and psychiatric illness in the family was present in about 20% of the cohort.
More than a third of the patients never completed grammar school
and 40% had a history of imprisonment. The incidence in the cohort

was about 50% for hepatitis B at baseline. Testing for hepatitis B
commenced about 1975, for HIV in 1988, and for hepatitis C in 1999.
The substances most frequently used at first admission were
opiates (35%), stimulants (36%), cannabis (45%) and barbiturates
(13%). A majority of the patients had an intense substance use
lasting for more than one year corresponding to a diagnosis of
substance dependence. Regular intravenous drug use was reported
by around 80% of the patients in the cohort. Almost all opiate users
and amphetamine users were intravenous users. There were no
gender differences in substance use and only opiates (p < 0.02) and
cannabis (p < 0.009) were significantly more common among
males. Deceased patients used more opiates and barbiturates than
those alive in 2006.
About 50% of the individuals suffered from at least one psychiatric disorder (Table 1). Psychiatric disorders categorized into
psychosis, neurotic disorder and personality disorder had no
significant influence on premature mortality when comparing
deceased vs alive (c[2] ¼ 1.86, n.s.). Of the suicide cases, 32% were
diagnosed with psychosis at baseline.
A national case-finding study estimated that the number of heavy
drug abusers in the Southern region, having a daily intake of illegal
drugs was around 1300 in 1978, 50% being injection drug users.[3] The
proportions of males, age and dominating drug pattern in the cohort
were reasonably similar to those in the case-finding study. A majority
of the intravenous abusers in the region were patients in the cohort,
excluding persons below the age of 17. The intravenous drug abusers
in the cohort can be regarded as representative of intravenous
abusers in the local population of substance abusers.

4.2. Mortality rates

By the end of 2006, 204 of 561 patients in the cohort (36.4%) had
died. Two percent had either immigrated or could not be located.
The standard mortality ratio (SMR) in the entire sample is
summarized in Table 2. The crude annual mortality was 1.3%, the
expected number of deaths was 34.4 and the SMR was 5.94 (95%
CI ¼ 5.5e6.81), compared to the local gender- and age-matched
population.
Premature mortality in the cohort was highest among the
patients in their early twenties, and remained at a high level well
into middle age. As is evident from Table 2, the crude annual
mortality in the group remained stable until middle age.
The gender-specific mortality is shown in Table 3. For men, the
observed number of deaths was 158 based on 10,420 observation
years, while the expected number of deaths was 28.3. SMR was 5.6

(95% CI ¼ 4.8e6.5), and the crude mortality ratio was 1.5%. For
women the observed number of deaths was 46 based on 5265
observation years, while the expected number of deaths was 11.
SMR was 4.2 (95% CI ¼ 2.99e5.41), and the crude annual
mortality was 0.9%. The difference between the genders was not
significant, but for certain age groups SMR varied considerably.

4.3. Causes of death

The causes of death were coded by ICD-10 diagnoses for all
deceased persons in the cohort (n ¼ 204). The coding was based on
death certificates and autopsy reports from departments of
Forensic Medicine (85%) or, to a minor extent, on autopsy reports
from general hospitals (5%). Medical records and police reports
provided additional information. Causes of death were divided into
drug-related or non drug-related death, and sub-grouped according to the labels in Fig. 1.

4.3.1. Drug-related death
Drug-related death was the primary cause of death in 120 cases
(59%). Toxicological analyses were provided for all these cases.

Autopsy protocols with toxicological analyses provided data which
would otherwise have been obscured. In this group 46 deaths were
caused by overdoses of illegal drugs, of which 43 (93%) involved
opiates and 3 (7%) stimulants (amphetamine mostly). Seventy of
the remaining 74 deaths were intoxications by one or several legal
drugs, sometimes in combination with illegal drugs. Mixed intoxication was diagnosed in 54% of all the cases of fatal intoxication.
Drug-related death due to suicide was diagnosed in 25/120 deaths
(21%). In all, 25% died a violent drug-related death from suicide,
homicide or accidents.
The group with primary alcohol dependence was only 3%, but
still was overrepresented in violent death (p ¼ 0.002). Drug-related
death was underestimated by 37% (76 vs 120 cases) and suicide by
85%, (6 vs 39 suicides) when comparing the ICD-codes from the
study with the codes from the Swedish national death cause
register. In the first case drug diagnoses were missing and in the
second, X-codes for self-inflicted causes of death were missing in
the death certificates from SCB.
Post mortem drug analyses were compared to drug dependence
diagnoses at baseline (Table 4).
One third of the cohort had an opiate dependence at baseline
and 40% (70/174) of them were dead by the end of 2006. Of the
opiate abusers, 43 died from opiate overdoses and the remaining
died from mixed intoxications with opiates. Sedative and hypnotic
drugs exclusively were found post mortem in 56 persons of which
16 was barbiturate intoxications. Of these deaths 10/16 barbiturate
intoxications were mixed with other drugs, mostly alcohol and
opiates. Alcohol was present post mortem in 23%, mostly detected
in combination with other drugs.

4.3.2. Non drug-related death
Somatic diseases were the primary cause of death in 29% of all
deaths of the cohort. Somatic death causes were cardiovascular
diseases (n ¼ 24), liver cancer (n ¼ 5), and other forms of cancer
(n ¼ 8). Three died from terminal AIDS. The remaining 19 individuals died mainly from other infections such as pneumonia,
hepatitis and septicemia. The time from first treatment contact to
death was longer for subjects who died from somatic diseases than
for those who died from accidental intoxication or violent death as

5. Discussion

This prospective study of substance abusers followed over four
decades confirms the long-lasting increased risk for premature
death from drug addiction. In the years from age 20 to the midthirties, drug users in the cohort showed a ten-fold or higher risk of
dying compared to the general population in the area. An earlier
studied smaller cohort of mostly heroin abusers had a crude annual
mortality rate of 2.5%.[16] The present cohort with a mixed group of
substance abusers had a mean crude annual mortality rate of 1.31%.
Premature mortality of the drug abusers remained significantly
increased up to the age of 65. These findings are consistent with
a Danish cohort study of opiate addicts still being at higher risk of
premature death after many years of stable abstinence.[24]

Around 60% of the cohort individuals in the present study used
more than one drug at baseline, and many remained mixed abusers
throughout life. One third of the opiate-related deaths in the
present study were mixed intoxications with alcohol and sedatives.
When analyzing causes of death by specific drug intoxications as
well as intoxications by combinations of drugs, we found a pattern
of post mortem substances very similar to a study by Gossop
et al.[29]: opiates was the most prevalent group of substances found
at death, followed by all types of sedative and hypnotic drugs, such
as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. Substances found
post mortem reflected fairly stable patterns of drug use over time.
About 50% of the patients died from the same substance they
abused already at first admission.
Two earlier Swedish studies[2,16] showed that regular opiate use
was related to premature mortality and male gender. The generally
lower level of premature mortality in women as previously reported in other studies of Scandinavian drug abusers[13,16,44] was not
confirmed. Rather, the SMRs for women were higher in certain
young age groups compared to SMRs in men. Thus the mixed
picture of elevated premature mortality rates for male drug users in
some studies,[14,33] lower rates of male premature mortality[32] in
others, or no gender differences[5,19,28,45] might reflect specific
subgroup patterns rather than general gender differences.
In this cohort 45 of 70 opiate-related deaths were overdoses.
Overdose is the major cause of death among opiate-dependent
patients, and accounts for 35e40% of deaths,[28] sometimes at dosage
levels that are not higher than their regular doses.[42] One reason is
that non lethal doses of heroin can become lethal in the presence of
alcohol and sedatives such as benzodiazepines.[42] Barbiturates mixed
with opiates have an additive depressive effect on respiration.
In a study from Australia,[14] the risk of drug-related death for
opiate addicts was 2.4 times higher than for amphetamine users.
The mortality rate related to stimulants was low, consistent with
earlier findings.[26] Only 3 of 46 overdoses were due to amphetamine
in our study while 11/70 fatal intoxications involved amphetamine
as one of several mixed substances.
The association between cannabis use and mortality was negative in the earlier study from the same cohort.[16] This finding remains
in the present larger cohort also after controlling for the use of other
drugs. Cannabis was rarely found post mortem despite the fact that
half of the patients were introduced to the drug scene with cannabis
and 15% of the cohort used cannabis at the first admission. Our
conclusions are consistent with other studies stating that cannabis is
not associated with increased premature mortality.[36,46]

Premature death was elevated in patients in this cohort who
were abstinent from heavy drug abuse when followed-up after
fifteen years, but 10e15% lower compared to those in active drug

use.[19] These findings are consistent with other long-term cohort
studies.[31,47] Although mortality decreases with continued abstinence it remains higher than in the general population[15,24]

Although the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the cohort
was around 50% and some researchers have suggested a causative
impact of psychopathology on premature mortality[14,43,44] this
immediate association was not confirmed in this study. This is in
agreement with Sørensen, Jepsen, Haastrup et al.[24] Nevertheless
a substantial finding was that 32% of the suicide cases in the cohort
had been diagnosed with psychosis at baseline. The proportion of
suicide in this cohort was about 10 times higher than in the general
population in Sweden.[8]

Another third of the deceased died from somatic diseases
associated with drug addiction, mostly liver failure, liver cancer and
infections such as pneumonia and blood-borne infections: HIV,
hepatitis B/C, and septicemia. The low incidence of HIV/AIDS
reflects the low prevalence of HIV in Sweden.
Among the assets of this study are the long observation period
and the completeness of individual data, which allowed us to
describe the cohort in detail from their first admission and follow
the patients over time with data seldom available when register
data are the only available tool. The characteristics of the cohort
also showed a fair agreement with corresponding characteristics in
the population of heavy drug abusers in Southern Sweden as
assessed in repeated case-finding studies.[3]

Finally, the procedure where two medical experts coded death
causes, eliminated some inconsistencies found in data from
national registers. In line with Gossop’s observation, the use of
autopsy protocols identified a larger and more correct proportion of
drug-related deaths than did register data alone.[29] This validity
problem could be reduced if the same medical doctor issuing the
death certificates and the autopsy protocols also make the final
coding using modern ICD-10 standard.
A drawback is that the cohort design by necessity provides
a more limited number of subjects for analysis, thus restricting
power more than is the case in large epidemiological samples.

5.1. Conclusions

When drug abuse is serious enough to warrant detoxification, it
is associated with premature mortality well into middle age. The
drugs found post mortem were to a high degree the same drugs
abused at baseline, implicating that many of the drug addicts had
a consistent heavy substance abuse of the same drugs throughout
life. The underestimation of drug-related death and suicide in some
national causes of death registers could be reduced if the same
doctor issue and code ICD-diagnoses on the death certificates and
autopsy protocols.
