Abstract
Background: To study mortality rate and causes of death among all hospitalized opioid addicts
treated for self-poisoning or admitted for voluntary detoxification in Oslo between 1980 and 1981,
and to compare their mortality to that of the general population.
Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 185 opioid addicts from all medical
departments in Oslo who were treated for either self-poisoning (n = 93, 1980), voluntary
detoxification (n = 75, 1980/1981) or both (n = 17). Their median age was 24 years; with a range
from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified
from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for
different causes of death.
Results: During a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality
ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7–29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period,
ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no
significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily
detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer
(4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths (2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among
the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category "drug dependence" was listed in the vast
majority of cases (37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death,
with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9–86.9). The SMR was 5.4
(95% CI, 1.3–21.5) for cardiovascular diseases, and 4.3 (95% CI, 1.4–13.5) for cancer. The SMR was
13.2 (95% CI, 6.6–26.4) for accidents, 10.7 (95% CI, 4.5–25.8) for suicides, and 28.6 (95% CI, 7.1–
114.4) for other violent deaths.
Conclusion: The risk of death among opioid addicts was significantly higher for all causes of death
compared with the general population, implying a poor prognosis over a 20-year period for this
young patient group.
