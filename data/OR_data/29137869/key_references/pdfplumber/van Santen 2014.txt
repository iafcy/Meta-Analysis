Objectives: We aimed to identify temporal trends in all-cause and cause-specific
mortality rates among people who use drugs (PWUD) compared with the general
Dutch population and to determine whether mortality trends differed by hepatitis C
virus (HCV)/HIV (co) infection status.
Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Methods: UsingdatafromtheAmsterdamCohortStudiesamong1254PWUD(1985–
2012), all-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calcu-
lated; SMRs were stratified by serological group (HCV/HIV-uninfected, HCV-mono-
infected, and HCV/HIV-coinfected) and calendar period. Temporal trends were
estimated using Poisson regression.
Results: Theoverallall-causeSMRwas13.9(95%confidenceinterval12.6–15.3).The
SMR significantly declined after 1996, especially due to a decline among women
(P<0.001). The highest SMR was observed among HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals
during 1990–1996 (SMR 61.9, 95% confidence interval 50.4–76.0), which signifi-
cantlydeclinedafterthisperiodamongwomen(P¼0.001).Incontrast,SMRforHCV-
monoinfected,andHCV/HIV-uninfectedPWUDdidnotsignificantlychangeovertime.
TheSMRfornon-naturaldeathssignificantlydeclined(P¼0.007),whereastheSMRfor
HIV-related deaths was the highest during all calendar periods.
Conclusions: We found evidence for declining all-cause mortality among PWUD
comparedwiththegeneralpopulationrates.ThosewithHCV/HIV-coinfectionshowed
the highest SMR. The decline in the SMR seems to be attributable to the decline in
mortalityamongwomen.Mortalityratesduetonon-naturaldeathscameclosertothose
ofthegeneralpopulationovertime.However,HIV-relateddeathsremainanimportant
causeofmortalityamongPWUDwhencomparedwiththegeneralDutchpopulation.
This study reinforces the importance of harm-reduction interventions and HCV/HIV
treatment to reduce mortality among PWUD.
