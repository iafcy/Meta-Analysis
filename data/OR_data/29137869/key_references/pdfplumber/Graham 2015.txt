Background: Both media use and cancer knowledge have been identified as important predictors of a healthy
lifestyle. However, little is known about the interplay between these two variables, and about differences
betweencancerdiagnosedandnon-diagnosedconsumersofmediaandknowledge.Thisstudyinvestigatedthe
relationship between media use (television and internet exposure) and lifestyle choices of cancer diagnosed
andnon-diagnosedindividuals,andlookedattheinfluenceofcancerknowledgeonthisrelationship.Methods:
A cross-sectional, quantitative survey (the Leuven Cancer Information Survey) was administered to 621 cancer
diagnosed and 1387 non-diagnosed individuals, aged 16–88 years old in Flanders (Belgium). Bivariate analyses,
hierarchicallinearregressionanalysesandadvancedmoderationandmediationanalyseswereconducted.Results:
