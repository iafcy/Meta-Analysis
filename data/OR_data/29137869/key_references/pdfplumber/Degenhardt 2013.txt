ABSTRACT
Aims Toexaminechangesincausesofdeathinacohorttreatedforopioiddependence,acrosstimeandage;quantify
yearsof potentiallifelost(YPLL);andidentifyavoidablecausesof death.Design PeopleinNewSouthWales(NSW)
whoregisteredforopioidsubstitutiontherapy(OST),1985–2005,werelinkedtoaregisterof alldeathsinAustralia.
Setting NSW, Australia. Measurements Crude mortality rates (CMRs), age–sex-standardized mortality rates
(ASSRs)andstandardizedmortalityratios(SMRs)acrosstime,sexandage.Yearsof potentiallifelost(YPLL)were
calculated with reference to Australian life tables and by calculating years lost before the age of 65 years.
Findings There were 43789 people in the cohort, with 412216 person-years of follow-up. The proportion of
thecohortaged40+yearsincreasedfrom1%in1985to39%in2005.Accidentalopioidoverdoses,suicides,transport
accidents and violent deaths declined with age; deaths from cardiovascular disease, liver disease and cancer
increased. Among men, 89% of deaths were potentially avoidable; among women, 86% of deaths were avoidable.
There were an estimated 160555 YPLL in the cohort, an average of 44 YPLL per decedent and an average of
29 YPLL before age 65 years. Conclusions Among a cohort of opioid-dependent people in New South Wales,
1985–2005,almostninein10deathsinthecohortwereavoidable.Thereishugescopetoimprovemortalityamong
opioid-dependent people.
