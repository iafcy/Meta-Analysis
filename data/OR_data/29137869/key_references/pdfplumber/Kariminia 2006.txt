Objectives: Describethestandardizedmortalityratio(SMR)anditstrendinadultswhohave
served time in prison.
Design: A retrospective cohort study of 85203 adults imprisoned in New South Wales
(NSW), Australia, between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2002.
Methods: We obtained information on deaths by record linkage with the Australian
National Death Index (NDI). Mortality rates were estimated using the
person-timemethod.SMRswerecalculatedusingsex,age,andcalendar-specific
deathratesfromtheNSWpopulation.TimetrendsinSMRswereassessedusing
the test for linear trends.
Results: The median overall follow-up of the cohort was 7.7 years. We identified
5137 deaths (4714 men, 423 women) among the cohort of which the vast
majority (4834, 94%) occurred following release from custody. All-cause SMR
was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.6–3.8) in men and 7.8 (95% CI: 7.1–8.5) in women. SMRs
were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders
(men: 13.2, 95% CI: 12.3–14.0; women: 62.8, 95% CI: 52.7–74.9) and
drug-related deaths (men: 12.8, 95% CI: 12.2–13.5; women: 50.3, 95% CI:
43.7–57.8).TheSMRfordeathbyhomicidewas10.2(95%CI:8.9–11.7)inmen
and 26.3 (95% CI: 17.8–39.0) in women. Aboriginal men were 4.8 times, and
Aboriginal women 12.6 times, more likely to die than the general NSW
population. Over the study period on average all-cause SMR decreased
significantly in men (p 5 0.003) and women (p 5 0.05) largely due to the
decline in SMRs for drug-related deaths and suicide.
Conclusion: In the largest study so far reported, mortality of male and female offenders was
far greater than expected for all major causes, especially deaths caused by drug
overdose. Despite some indication of a reduction in excess mortality in recent
years, there remains an overwhelming need for enhanced responses to mental
health and drug problems for people who have been in prison.
