Abstract
Background: Amajorgoalofheroin-assistedtreatmentinSwitzerlandhasbeentoreducethedrug-relatedmortalityofheroinusers.Therefore,
acontinuousmonitoringofdeathsundertreatmentisessential.
Aims: Toassessmortalityofparticipantsinheroin-assistedtreatmentinSwitzerlandovera7-yearperiodfrom1994to2000,andtocompare
thismortalitytothegeneralpopulationandtootherpopulationsofopioidusers,asreportedintheliterature.
Method: Estimationofpersonyearsunderheroin-assistedtreatmentfromthecompletecaseregistryofheroin-assistedtreatmentinSwitzer-
land.EstimationofstandardizedmortalityratioscomparingthepopulationintreatmenttotheSwisspopulation(standardizedtotheyear
2000).
Results: Overthe7-yearperiod,thecrudedeathrateofpatientsinheroin-assistedtreatment,andincludingonemonthafterdischargefrom
treatment,was1%peryear.Thestandardizedmortalityratiofortheentireobservationperiodwas9.7(95%C.I.7.3–12.8),withfemales
havinghigherstandardizedmortalityratios(SMR17.2)thanmales(SMR8.4).Therewasnocleartimetrend.
Conclusion: Mortalityinheroin-assistedtreatmentwaslowcomparedtothemortalityrateofSwissopioidusers1990s(estimatedtobe
between 2.5 and 3%). It was also low compared to mortality rates of opioid users in other maintenance treatments in other countries as
