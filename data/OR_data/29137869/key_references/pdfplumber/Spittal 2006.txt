Abstract
The health and social conditions of women living in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside has recently been the focus of
substantialinternationalattention.Sincefewstudieshaveexaminedratesandcorrelatesofdeathamongaddictedwomenin
Canada, we have characterized patterns of mortality among female injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver. The
