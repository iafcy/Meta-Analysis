The Challenge of Understanding Mortality Changes
among Street Youth

Pascale Leclerc, and Jean-François Boivin
ABSTRACT According to a cohort study conducted in Montréal, Québec from 1995 to
2000, the mortality rate among street youth was 921/100,000 person-years. Several
newcommunityinitiativesaimingtoincreaseaccesstohousingandtosocialandhealth
services for the homeless were implemented in the city between 2000 and 2003. This
study aims to update the mortality rate estimate for the period 2001–2006 and to
examine factors that could explain a difference between rates, if any. A second cohort
study was conducted between 2001 and 2006. The Cohort 2 mortality rate was
computedandcomparedwiththeCohort1rate.Severalanalyseswerethencarriedout:
(1) mortality rates in the general population were compared with street youth rates
using standardized mortality ratios (SMR); (2) Cohorts 1 and 2 distributions of risk
factors for mortality were examined, and theireffects were assessed using multivariate
proportional hazards regression analyses carried out on a combined Cohorts 1 and 2
dataset.Mortalityrateamongstreetyouthdecreasedby79%whileitdeclinedbyonly
19% in the general population; the SMR for Cohort 1 was higher than for Cohort 2
(11.6 versus 3.0). Multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses yielded
estimates that were close to the model's estimates based on Cohort 1 data only, and
participation in Cohort 1was an independent predictorof mortality, with anadjusted
hazardratioof9.0.Themortalitydeclinecannotbecompletelyexplainedbyasimilar

25 years old or below, and approximately one third of them are girls. Despite some
heterogeneity,mostlybasedonlocalsubculturaldifferences,theseyouthsharemany
characteristics that jeopardize their development and health: they are highly
entrenched in the streets and live in unstable residential conditions with frequent
episodes of homelessness; many of them engage in high-risk behaviors such as
prostitution and substance abuse, which seriously compromise their health.1 The
ultimate consequence of these precarious living conditions (death of street youth) is
poorly documented. Several studies addressed mortality among homeless individu-
als, but only a few presented data for youth less than 25
years.2–5
Although the
mortality ratio varied greatly from one study site to another, ranging between 2.7
and28.5,allthesestudiesclearlyshowedthathomelessyouthexperiencedmortality
rates much higher than their counterparts in the general population.
Preliminary findings on mortality risk factors among street youth in Montréal,
Canada, were first reported in 1998,6 and final results were published in 2004.7
Briefly, a prospective cohort study on risk factors for HIV and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infections wasconductedfrom1995 to2000amongstreetyouthaged14to
25 years at recruitment. Secondary analyses showed that 26 of the 1,013
participants died during follow-up for a mortality rate of 921 per 100,000 person-
years (95% confidence interval (CI), 602–1350). This represented a standardized
mortality ratio of 11. Causes of death were suicide (13), overdose (8), accident (2),
fulminant hepatitis A (1), heart disease (1), and 1 unknown. A multivariate pro-
portional hazards regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for
mortality were as follows: HIV infection (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR=8.1)), daily
alcoholuseinthelastmonth(AHR=3.7),homelessnessanddruginjectioninthelast
6months(AHR=3.9and3.7,respectively),andmalesex(AHR=2.6).
Theanalysespresentedinthispaperwerebasedondatacollectedbetween2001
and 2006 in a second prospective cohort study, the aim of which was to determine

METHODS
Criteria for entry into the study cohorts as well as recruitment strategies (fully
detailedinpreviouspapers8,9)werethesameforbothcohorts,exceptforage(14to
25 years in Cohort 1 and 14 to 23 years inCohort 2). Briefly,youth were eligible if
they were street-active, English or French speaking, able to provide informed
consent, and able to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire. In the
second cohort, a slightly younger sample was targeted because of the psychosocial
component related to initiation into injection, the youngest among street youth
beingatgreatest risk ofinitiation.8Studyinterviewers enrolled participants through
regular visits to all major street youth agencies in Montréal. Semiannual follow-up
interviews included completion of a questionnaire on sociodemographics, drug and
alcoholuse,andsexualbehaviors.MortalitydatawereobtainedfromtheCoroner’s
OfficeandtheInstitutdelastatistiqueduQuébec.Ethicalapprovalwasprovidedby
the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, McGill University.
Asinthefirstcohortanalyses,mortalityrateinthesecondcohortwasestimated
using the person-time method, and the 95% CI was calculated using the Poisson
distribution.10 Follow-up started at recruitment and ended either at death or

6 months after completion of the last questionnaire, which was mid-2006 for the
second cohort. Mortality rates in Cohorts 1 and 2 were compared using a test
developed by Oleinick and Mantel.11
To examine factors that could explain a possible difference between Cohorts 1
and 2 mortality rates, the following analyses were carried out. First, we examined
mortality rates in Québec’s general population for the same time periods. We then
compared rates in the general population to Cohorts 1 and 2 mortality rates by
computing standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). The indirect method of stand-
ardization by sex and age group was applied. The two SMRs were compared using
confidence intervals calculated via Byar’s approximation.10, 12Secondly,we tried to
determine if a different distribution of risk factors for mortality (identified in
Cohort1) in the cohorts could explain changes in mortality rates. Proportions of
youth presenting risk factors at baseline were calculated for each cohort. Then, a
multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis with time-varying covariates
was carried out on a dataset combining data from both cohorts. We examined the
independent effect of participation in Cohort 1 on mortality, controlling for the
predictors of mortality. Analyses were carried out with SPSS 13.0.13
RESULTS
Atotalof1,687subjectsparticipatedinthetwocohorts:829inCohort1only,674
in Cohort 2 only, and 184 in both cohorts. Sex distribution and mean age at
recruitment into Cohort 2 (68.9% boys; 20.4 years) were similar to those reported
for Cohort 1 (67.4% boys; 19.9 years).
Five of the 858 participants in Cohort 2 died during follow-up, for a mortality
rateof191/100,000person-years(95%CI,62–447).Causesofdeathwereoverdose
(2), suicide (1), unintentional injury (1), and 1 unknown. This mortality rate
represents a decrease of 79% (from 921/100,000 person-years to 191/100,000
person-years), and the difference between the rates was statistically different
(pG0.001). The corresponding decline in the general population was only 19%
andtheSMRsinCohorts1and2were11.6(95%CI,7.6–17.0)and3.0(95%CI,
1.0–6.9),respectively.Thisstatistically significant difference between SMRsshows
that the decline in mortality was greater among street youth than in the general
population.
Baseline proportions of street youth with risk factors for mortality were similar

differences in distribution of mortality risk factors between the two samples did not
appear to be involved. According to the final multivariate model, Cohort 1
participants were nine times more likely to die during follow-up than Cohort 2
participants when controlling for other independent predictors.
In April 2008, while presenting these results to community groups and
institutionsworkingwithstreetyouthinMontréal,wesuggestedthatthesignificant
drop in mortality among street youth could be at least partially explained by the
implementationofnewservicesforhomelesspeopleduringtheperiod2000to2003.
In fact, soon after publication of our preliminary results in 1998, the Montréal
Public Health Department set up a working group in response to this mortality
epidemic. The working group was asked to make recommendations to the regional
and provincial health authorities to take actions to decrease mortality among street
youth.14Withinseveralmonths ofreceiving theworkinggroup’sreport,aroundthe
endof2000,Québec’sMinisterofHealthandSocialServicesallocatednewfundsto
community organizations working with street youth to improve services, both
medical and social. At the same time, a federal-provincial agreement on home-
lessness provided new funding for special projects to increase access to housing and
tosocial andhealth services forthehomelessinMontréal.With thesefunds,several
community initiatives were implemented between 2000 and 2003. These included

increased hours for outreach community interventions, training of outreach and
community workers regarding mental health issues and suicide prevention, opening
of a new hassle-free primary care clinic for street youth, and improved access to
social housing with community support. Consequently, our hypothesis that newly
implemented services helped reduce mortality seemed plausible, especially since
these services specifically targeted suicide prevention. However, while the organ-
izations participating in the meeting did not reject this hypothesis, some workers
proposed that the decrease in mortality could also be partly due to a change in the
youth’s drug consumption habits. Workers said they had observed a decline in
heroin consumption in the streets; this could mean a decrease in the number of
heroin users and injection drug users and, thus, a reduced risk of deadly overdoses
due to heroin consumption or injection.
To further examine this question, we looked at the temporal variation in the
proportion of heroin users during the period covered by the two cohort studies. We
had previously shown that the annual prevalence of current injection among street
youthwasstablebetween1995and2005.15Thenewanalysisdemonstratedthatthe
odds of being a current heroin user (last month), controlling for sex and age, had
declined significantly since 1995, with an odds ratio of 0.94/year (95% CI, 0.92–
0.97; pG0.0001). Given this result, we carried out additional proportional hazards
regression analyses, assessing the effect of current heroin use on mortality. The
univariateanalysisshowedamarginalassociationbetweenheroinuseandmortality
(hazard ratio of 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9–4.3; p=0.07). Once included in the multivariate
model (shown in model B, last column of Table 2), the association between heroin
use and mortality was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–
2.3; p=0.90). There was no confounding effect of heroin use on other parameter
estimates(changesinestimateswerelessthan4%).Thus,heroinusedidnotseemto
be an independent predictor of mortality among street youth. It is, therefore,
unlikely that the reduction in heroin use among the youth explains the decrease in
mortality.
We come to the conclusion that various factors could have contributed to the
declineinmortalityratesamongstreetyouth.Acertaindecreasehavingbeenobserved
among the general population, it is possible that the steep drop among street youth
can be explained in part by this population trend. Another plausible factor is the
implementation of new services for the homeless. However, we cannot state this
conclusively,giventhat ourstudyisaposthocanalysis.Anevaluative studydesign,
for instance a quasi-experimental design, would undoubtedly have been better to
assesstheeffectsandimpactofservicesimplementedtocountertheissueofmortality.
Some limitations of our study could have been detrimental to our capacity to
identify all factors that could have contributed to the drop in mortality. One is the
limited power of the study due to the relatively small number of observed deaths. It
is possible that this prevented us from detecting other significant predictors,
including a significant effect of the decline of heroin consumption among youth.
Finally,anotherareaofconcernmaybethegeneralizabilityoftheresults.However,
cohort participants should be representative of the larger Montréal street youth
population, given that recruitment was conducted in all major street youth
organizations and that refusals were infrequent.8 Moreover, according to a survey
carried out in the late 1990s, most of the homeless population in Montréal (over
90%) attend community organizations offering services to homeless people.16

marginalized populations, such as street-involved people and drug users. Immediate

causesofdeathreportedinofficialdatabasesare,ofcourse,veryuseful,buttheyare
only part of the explanation. Factors that are precursors to these causes, such as
substance use or suicidal behaviors and psychological distress, are rarely well
documented among these individuals, who are generally overlooked in population
surveys. Behavioral epidemiological surveillance of vulnerable populations is an
effective way to monitor risky behaviors that can shed light on morbidity and
mortality data among these populations. In our study, one possible explanation for
the decrease in mortality was the decline in heroin use among youth. Our
longitudinal research data enabled us to study the effect of these changes and, thus,
to conclude that a reduction in heroin use was not a major cause of mortality
decline. However, data collected from both users and informers in the field have
their limitations. Additional information, particularly concerning the drug market,
including price, purity, and availability of a drug, is also necessary to better
understand users’ behaviors. Indeed, studies have shown that the drug market
influences the types of drugs consumed and methods used among drug-using
populations.17–19
In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of
collectingsystematicdatathroughhighlyperformingintegratedsurveillancesystems
tounderstandmorbidityandmortalitytrendsamongmarginalizedpopulationsand,
thus, to better inform health policies addressing their needs. It is crucial that these
systems rely on a variety of sources. In this regard, examples from Europe and
Australia that include multiple data collection strategies such as behavioral surveys,
consultations with key informants, and analyses of drug seizures are inspiring.17,20
Finally, despite a striking decrease in mortality rates among street youth
between1995–2001and2001–2006,itisnoteworthythatmortalityinthisgroupis
still higher than in the general population. It is, thus, essential to maintain public
funding to strengthen the preventive work that has been started in Montréal and to
continuedevelopinginnovativeservicesthatwillimprovethelivesofstreetyouthas

with the high rates of mortality among homeless people documented elsewhere in
