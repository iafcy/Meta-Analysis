This study examined associations between mortality and demographic and risk characteristics among young 
injection drug users in San Francisco, California, and compared the mortality rate with that of the population. A total 
of 644 young (<30 years) injection drug users completed a baseline interview and were enrolled in a prospective 
cohort study, known as the UFO (‘‘U Find Out’’) Study, from November 1997 to December 2007. Using the National 
Death Index, the authors identiﬁed 38 deaths over 4,167 person-years of follow-up, yielding a mortality rate 
of 9.1 (95% conﬁdence interval: 6.6, 12.5) per 1,000 person-years. This mortality rate was 10 times that of 
the general population. The leading causes of death were overdose (57.9%), self-inﬂicted injury (13.2%), 
trauma/accidents (10.5%), and injection drug user-related medical conditions (13.1%). Mortality incidence was 
signiﬁcantly higher among those who reported injecting heroin most days in the past month (adjusted hazard 
ratio ¼ 5.8, 95% conﬁdence interval: 1.4, 24.3). The leading cause of death in this group was overdose, and 
primary use of heroin was the only signiﬁcant risk factor for death observed in the study. These ﬁndings highlight 
the continued need for public health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this population in order to 
reduce premature deaths.

Injection drug use has been associated with excess mor- 
bidity and mortality (1, 2). A number of studies have 
reported incidence that greatly exceeds that of the general 
population (3–5). Risk factors that have been associated with 
mortality among injection drug users (IDUs) from prior studies 
include infectious diseases, such as human immunodeﬁciency 
virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (3, 6–8). Given 
improvements in medical care for HIV and HCV as well as 
more widespread implementation of public health interven- 
tions for IDUs (needle exchange, overdose prevention, opiate 
substitution treatment, and so on), current studies are needed 
to assess whether the incidence and causes of mortality have 
shifted over time. Additionally, studies of unique subpopula- 
tions such as young IDUs are needed to understand the patterns 
and risk factors for mortality in order to inform future tailored 
interventions. 
The current study was undertaken to assess the incidence 
of mortality and risk factors for mortality among young in- 
jection drug users in San Francisco, California. Given that 
the UFO (‘‘U Find Out’’) Study has been collecting detailed 
information on young IDUs since the late 1990s, it provides 
a unique opportunity to study mortality trends and risk factors 
for mortality in this population. The speciﬁc aims of the 
study were as follows: 1) to investigate trends in mortality 
incidence overall and overdose-speciﬁc mortality, 2) to 
calculate standardized mortality ratios, and 3) to identify 
risk factors for mortality in young injectors in San Francisco 
between 1997 and 2007. 



Beginning in 1997, young (<30 years) IDUs in San 
Francisco have been offered participation in multiple pro- 
spective studies under variations of the shared title known 
as the UFO Study and described previously (9–11). In brief, 
young IDUs were recruited by peer outreach workers fa- 
miliar with neighborhoods in San Francisco where young 
IDUs congregate, using study invitation cards and ﬂyers, 
contacts with youth friendly neighborhood groups and com- 
munity providers, and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria for 
screening were the following: 1) less than 30 years of age; 
2) self reported use of injection drugs in the past 30 days, 
3) ability to provide informed consent, 4) understanding 
spoken English and, after 2005, 5) self-reported HCV-negative 
or unknown status. The UFO Study had 3 waves of data 
collection between November 1997 and December 2007. In 
the ﬁrst wave from 1997 to 1999, subjects completed a baseline 
screening interview and underwent counseling and serologic 
testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C virus. Subjects 
without evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection or immunization to HBV were eligible for enrollment 
in a prospective study of HBV vaccination (UFO-2 Study). 
Starting in 2000, subjects who were HCV negative at the base- 
line screening were eligible for enrollment into the UFO-3 
Study. The UFO-3 Study had 2 waves of recruitment, from 
2000 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2007. Participants were in- 
cluded in this analysis only if they were enrolled prior to 
December 31, 2007, the end date for searching for death 
records. All research protocols and informed consent were 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University 
of California, San Francisco. 

Eligible consenting participants were interviewed, coun- 
seled, and tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 
presence of viremia (HCV RNA) at baseline. Follow-up in- 
cluded monthly ‘‘check-ins’’ and quarterly study visits that 
included structured interviews to assess risk (principally drug- 
related and sexual) exposures, HCV status (including anti- 
HCV and HCV RNA testing), and risk reduction counseling 
and referrals. In the ﬁrst and second study waves, testing for 
antibodies to HIV and HBV was performed at baseline and 
follow-up visits. Deaths were ascertained though the National 
Death Index (NDI) through the end of 2007. Methods for 
establishing a match are described in detail on the NDI Web 
site (http://www.csc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm). In brief, records are 
matched by ﬁrst and last name, date of birth, sex, and state of 
birth. Causes of death were obtained from the NDI-Plus. The 
underlying cause of death was based on the International 
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision. The primary 
outcome for this analysis was date of death as identiﬁed by 
an NDI match. Causes of death were reviewed, and overdose 
death was deﬁned as ICD, Tenth Revision, codes X42, X44, 
X62, and Y14. Sociodemographic variables included in the 
analyses were age, gender, race/ethnicity (Caucasian vs. non- 
Caucasian), educational level (less than high school vs. high 
school or greater), recent (past 3 months) homelessness, and 
incarceration. Starting in wave 2, participants were asked about 


participation in drug treatment programs in the past 3 months 
and in the past week in wave 3. Recent drug treatment pro- 
grams included drug detoxiﬁcation, residential treatment, 
methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, and 12-step pro- 
grams. Risk-related exposures included duration of injection 
drug use; frequency of injection; injection of heroin, cocaine, 
methamphetamine, crack, or heroin mixed with methamphet- 
amine or cocaine; noninjection crack use; and nonfatal heroin 
overdose. Overdose was deﬁned as a loss of consciousness 
where at least one intervention was attempted by a third party. 

We calculated mortality incidence overall and by demo- 
graphic and risk characteristics reported at the baseline 
interview. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated in 
3-year intervals adjusting for age, sex, and race by using na- 
tional mortality statistics from the National Center for Health 
Statistics. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated over- 
all, separately for males and females, and for overdose- 
related deaths only; 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated 
by assuming that the observed deaths followed a Poisson dis- 
tribution. Cox regression models with time-varying covariates 
were used to identify predictors of mortality. Survival time 
was deﬁned as the time from initiation of injection (self- 
reported as age at ﬁrst injected drugs) to death. Given that 
subjects were current injectors at the start of the study, data 
were left truncated. Subjects entered into the analysis at the 
baseline visit, and they remained until the date of death or were 
censored at December 31, 2007, or the last interview date if 
the last interview was after December 31, 2007. Covariates 
were included in the multivariate model if the incidence rate 
ratio for mortality reached statistical signiﬁcance at a level 
of P < 0.10 in the bivariate analysis or were potential con- 
founders (study wave, age, gender, HCV status, and duration 
of injection drug use). Baseline characteristics including age, 
gender, duration of injection, and study wave were entered 
into the model as ﬁxed covariates. Drug use and injection- 
risk behaviors, overdose, and HCV status were entered as 
time-varying covariates. All analyses were conducted with the 
Stata statistical software package (release 11.2; StataCorp LP, 
College Station, Texas). 

A total of 644 participants completed a baseline interview 
and were enrolled in the prospective cohort from November 
1997 to December 2007. The median age was 22.0 years 
(interquartile range (IQR): 19.8–25.0), and participants had 
injected for a median of 4.0 years (IQR: 1.7–6.7) at the base- 
line interview. Sixty-eight percent of participants were male, 
and 78% were Caucasian (Table 1); 47% had less than a high 
school education, and 68% reported being homeless or 
marginally housed. At the most recent interview, the drug 
most often injected in the past 30 days was heroin (63%) 
followed by methamphetamine (27%); 31% reported injecting 
every day in the past month, 68% used a syringe exchange in 
the past month, and 32% were anti-HCV positive. 
We identiﬁed 38 deaths over the follow-up period through 
2007 using the NDI. The overall mortality rate over 4,167

person-years of follow-up was 9.12 (95% conﬁdence inter- 
val (CI): 6.63, 12.53) per 1,000 person-years of observation. 
In females, the mortality rate was 6.51/1,000 person-years 
of observation and, in males, 10.42/1,000 person-years of ob- 
servation. The median age at death was 26 years (IQR: 23–30), 
and the median time from initiation of injecting until death 
was 7.7 years (IQR: 4.9–11.3). 
Increased mortality was observed among those who identi- 
ﬁed heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs as the drug in- 
jected most days in the 30 days prior to the most recent 
interview, relative to those who injected methamphetamine 
(incidence rate ratio (IRR) ¼ 3.03, 95% CI: 1.47, 6.23)

higher in those who reported having an overdose in the 
past 3 months compared with those who did not (IRR ¼ 2.71, 
95% CI: 1.35, 5.47). Mortality rates were elevated among 
HCV-seropositive individuals compared with negatives 
but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (IRR ¼ 1.66,

95% CI: 0.88, 3.15) at P < 0.05. Mortality incidence did not 
differ by age, race/ethnicity, ever having overdosed, duration 
of injection, or incarceration in the past 3 months. 
By use of national mortality as the reference, the over- 
all adjusted standardized mortality ratio for 1999–2001 
was 15.3 (95% CI: 7.6, 27.3), which decreased to 10.6 
(95% CI: 5.8, 17.8) in 2002–2004 and 8.3 (95% CI: 4.4, 14.3) 
in 2005–2007 (Table 2). When data were stratiﬁed by wave 
of recruitment, temporal declines in mortality persisted (data 
not shown). In females, the adjusted standardized mortality 
ratios were higher than in males across all time bands. Further- 
more, there did not appear to be a trend toward a decreasing 
standardized mortality ratio over time among women, as there 
appeared to be for men. Incidence of overdose mortality also 
declined between 2000 and 2007 (Table 3). However, women 
had lower rates of overdose mortality compared with men, 
and their rates did not appear to decline. The principal cause 
of death for the overall cohort was overdose (57.9%), fol- 
lowed by self-inﬂicted injuries (13.2%), other drug-related 
medical conditions (13.2%), trauma or accidents (10.5%), 
and other causes (5.3%). 
In Cox regression with time-varying covariates adjusting 
for age and duration injecting, participants who used heroin 
or heroin mix most days or who had a recent overdose had 
elevated mortality (Table 4). Of these factors, heroin/heroin 
mix as the drug used most days in the past month was the 
only one independently associated with mortality (adjusted 
hazard ratio ¼ 5.76, 95% CI: 1.37, 24.30) (P < 0.05). Having 
a recent nonfatal overdose was associated with higher relative 
hazards of death, although this did not quite meet statistical 
signiﬁcance. After adjustment for other covariates, being 
HCV infected was not signiﬁcantly associated with increased 
relative hazards of death. 

This study of young IDUs in San Francisco between 1997 
and 2007 found overall mortality rates 10 times higher than 
those in the general population. Mortality appeared to decline 
over the 10-year period; however, stratiﬁed results suggested 
that declines were restricted to males. The leading cause of 
death in this cohort was overdose, and primary use of heroin 
was the only signiﬁcant independent risk factor for death that 
was observed in the study. Together, these ﬁndings highlight 
the substantial mortality risk associated with injecting drugs 
for young persons and point to a continued need for public 
health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this 
population in order to reduce premature deaths. 
The overall mortality rate observed in this study of IDUs 
in San Francisco was 9.12 per 1,000 person-years of obser- 
vation. Another study of young and recent-onset injectors

found a similar mortality rate (3). That study found an initial 
increase of mortality in the 2 years of the cohort study, fol- 
lowed by a decrease, which led the authors to hypothesize 
that the immediate years following initiation of drug use might 
be a period of higher risk. In contrast, our study found only 
a continuous decline in mortality over calendar periods. The 
prior study by Vlahov et al. enrolled only recently initiated 
IDUs (<5 years) and therefore did not include a range of age 
and duration of drug use to clarify period effects. Our study 
included participants with a wide range of injecting exposure 
time (median ¼ 4 years, IQR: 1.7–6.7), and we performed 
multivariate Cox models to analyze the independent effects 
of age and duration of use. The results did not support an 
association between duration of use and mortality. 
There are several potential explanations for the observed 
decline in mortality in our cohort of young injectors. First, 
it is possible that public health interventions could have 
led to fewer deaths over the years. In the past decade, several 
overdose prevention programs have been implemented in the 
United States including the distribution of the overdose- 
reversal drug, opiate antagonist naloxone (NARCAN; Endo 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania), to IDUs 
(12–16). One of the longest running naloxone prescription 
programs in the United States was implemented in San 
Francisco in 2003 and has provided overdose prevention train- 
ing and prescribed naloxone to nearly 2,000 individuals as 
of December 2009 (16). Furthermore, improved access to 
treatment for opioid dependence may be a factor, as opioid 
substitution treatment in IDUs has been shown to be a sig- 
niﬁcant factor in reducing the risk of mortality (17). There 
could have been a change in the purity of heroin over the 
years (18). Finally, because there was ongoing enrollment of 
our cohort, differences in mortality over time may be associ- 
ated with unmeasured differences in the UFO Study population 
over time, such that subjects with lower risk were recruited 
during later phases of the study. To test this hypothesis, we 
included a variable for period of study recruitment in our 
Cox models. Although we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences 
in the hazard ratios for death by enrollment wave, the hazard 
ratios were less than 1.0 comparing the later with earlier 
years, suggesting that this could be an underlying factor. 
Furthermore, when we investigated changes in the UFO Study 
population across the 3 waves of data collection, we found 
that participants in the ﬁrst wave were more likely to inject 
heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs in the past month and 
were signiﬁcantly less likely to inject methamphetamine 
in the past month at baseline (data not shown). Since pri- 
mary use of heroin as the drug of injection was strongly 
predictive of death in our Cox models (hazard ratio ¼ 5.76, 
95% CI: 1.37, 24.30), this observed decline in heroin injection 
in later waves of study recruitment is a likely contributor to 
the decline in overdose mortality over time. 
Our study of young injection drug users found the most 
common causes of death to be overdose and trauma, which 
is consistent with prior studies (3, 6, 7, 19). This supports 
a continued focus on overdose prevention in this age group. 
Of the risk factors examined in this study, only use of heroin 
as the main injecting drug was independently predictive of 
death. This contrasts with 2 prior studies of young IDUs 
that found HIV infection to be signiﬁcantly associated with 


mortality (3, 6). This difference can likely be explained by 
the relatively small absolute number of participants included 
in our sample and the small number of persons with HIV. 
Also, HIV as a cause of death has been shown to have peaked 
in the 1990s (20, 21), before the advent of highly active anti- 
retroviral therapy, and is less likely to impact mortality in 
young versus older injectors (7). 
Our study showed differences in death rates between men 
and women. Although the incidence of death was higher 
among men compared with women, standardized mortality 
ratios were higher for women. Female injectors were 12 times 
more likely to die compared with females in the general 
US population; in contrast, male injectors were 8 times more 
likely to die compared with the male US population. A similar 
difference in sex-stratiﬁed standardized mortality ratios has 
been reported in a cohort of young IDUs in Canada (6). In 
addition, although rates of death appeared to decline over 
time among men, rates appeared relatively stable for women 
over the 10-year period. Sex-stratiﬁed results should be 
interpreted with caution however, as the sample size was 
relatively small and resulted in wide conﬁdence intervals for 
period-speciﬁc mortality rates. 
There were a number of important limitations to this study. 
Mortality rates may be underestimates because of deaths that 
were not captured by the NDI search criteria. A number of 
study participants were believed to have given pseudonyms 
rather than birth names, which would not allow matching, and 
incorrect birth dates may have been given. Causes of death 
were based on ICD codes on death certiﬁcates that may be 
inaccurate (22). Analyses used baseline predictor data, and 
some covariates measured constructs that could change over 
time (HIV and HCV infections, injecting behaviors, incarcer- 
ation, and so on). Therefore, analyses of certain predictors 
should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the relatively 
modest sample size and small absolute number of deaths are 
limitations, particularly with regard to sex-stratiﬁed results. 
In conclusion, this study of young IDUs in San Francisco 
demonstrated that injection drug use is associated with sub- 
stantially increased risk for death, and that most of the excess 
risk is due to overdose and trauma. Results also suggest that, 
among young adult injectors in San Francisco, mortality 
rates are decreasing over time but are generally restricted 
to males. Research is needed to conﬁrm these results and 
explore reasons for sex-speciﬁc differences in mortality in 
young IDUs.
