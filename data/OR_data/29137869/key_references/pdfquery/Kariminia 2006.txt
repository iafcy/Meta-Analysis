A retrospective cohort study of 85 203 adults imprisoned in New South Wales 
(NSW), Australia, between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2002. 
We obtained information on deaths by record linkage with the Australian 
National Death Index (NDI). Mortality rates were estimated using the 
person-time method. SMRs were calculated using sex, age, and calendar-specific 
death rates from the NSW population. Time trends in SMRs were assessed using 
the test for linear trends. 
The median overall 
follow-up of the cohort was 7.7 years. We identified 
5137 deaths (4714 men, 423 women) among the cohort of which the vast 
majority (4834, 94%) occurred following release from custody. All-cause SMR 
was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.6–3.8) in men and 7.8 (95% CI: 7.1–8.5) in women. SMRs 
were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders 
(men: 13.2, 95% CI: 12.3–14.0; women: 62.8, 95% CI: 52.7–74.9) and 
drug-related deaths (men: 12.8, 95% CI: 12.2–13.5; women: 50.3, 95% CI: 
43.7–57.8). The SMR for death by homicide was 10.2 (95% CI: 8.9–11.7) in men 
and 26.3 (95% CI: 17.8–39.0) in women. Aboriginal men were 4.8 times, and 
Aboriginal women 12.6 times, more likely to die than the general NSW 
the study period on average all-cause SMR decreased 
population. Over 
significantly in men (p 5 0.003) and women (p 5 0.05) largely due to the 
decline in SMRs for drug-related deaths and suicide. 

In the largest study so far reported, mortality of male and female offenders was 
far greater than expected for all major causes, especially deaths caused by drug 
overdose. Despite some indication of a reduction in excess mortality in recent 
years, there remains an overwhelming need for enhanced responses to mental 
health and drug problems for people who have been in prison.

Introduction 
Prison inmates are recognized as a population with a high 
burden of disease from a wide range of physical and mental 
health problems. Studies have examined risky sexual and 
substance misuse behaviours among people who have served 
time in prisons, demonstrating their extreme vulnerability to 
sexually transmissible infections,1 viral hepatitis,2 drug depen- 
dence,3 and mental ill health.4 

A number of studies have addressed death as the ultimate 
consequence of 
these health problems. Most mortality 
studies have focused on deaths occurring while in custody 
and showed that prisoners are more likely to die prematurely 
especially of suicide, 
than people who have not been in 
custody.5–8 
Several studies have assessed post-release death and provided 
an indication that 
those released from custody are at an 
increased risk of death.9–12 These studies, however, have not 
reported on all major causes of death, mainly because of the 
small sample size or limited follow-up period. The present study 
is a comprehensive assessment of mortality among individuals 
who have been exposed to the prison environment. It aims to 
describe the relative importance of the main causes of death in 
people sentenced to full-time custody in New South Wales 
(NSW), Australia, to compare inmate mortality with that of the 
general NSW population, and to examine time trends in 
mortality during the 15 year study period. 
Methods 
Study population 
We conducted a retrospective study using data linkage to 
examine the mortality risk and causes of death among a cohort 
of prisoners. The study cohort included all adults who had 
experienced full-time custody in NSW between 1 January 1988 
and 31 December 2002. The prisoner cohort was identified by 
the NSW Department of Corrective Services (DCS) from their 
operational computer system, Offender Integrated Manage- 
ment System (OIMS). OIMS is used to manage information on 
the State’s offender population throughout 
their sentence. 
Prisoners are assigned a unique identification number, which 
is also used for all subsequent imprisonments. The extracted 
list contained the unique identification number, full name, 
gender, date of birth, and country of birth. Importantly, it also 
contained information on any known aliases or pseudonyms 
used by prisoners. The list was used for the data linkage to the 
Australian National Death Index (NDI) and consisted of 
145 979 records comprising 85 203 unique records. 
We also received secondary information on the commence- 
ment and release dates (to community, parole, or home 
detention) of all episodes of incarceration (both sentenced and 
remand). This dataset was used to calculate the time spent in 
custody or in the community during the study period. Those 
imprisoned during the study period who first entered prison 
prior to 1 January 1988 were considered to be at risk from 
1 January 1988. 

Deaths in our study cohort were identified by record linkage 
with the NDI, a database managed by the Australian Institute 
of Health and Welfare (AIHW) containing information on all 
deaths reported in Australia since 1980. Source documentation 
for the NDI consists of death certificate information provided by 
the Registrar of Births Deaths and Marriages in each State and 
Territory. At the time of the linkage, the NDI was expected 
to contain information on all reported deaths up to 31 
December 2002. 
Information, 
including aliases, on 85 203 inmates was 
forwarded to the AIHW for linkage to the NDI records for 


the calendar years 1988–2002. Matching was performed using 
the integrity probabilistic record linkage software package.13 
Linkage was based on the common identifiers: 
full name, 
sex, date of birth, and date of last contact with the prison 
system. The NDI search algorithm generated many potential 
matches, which were reviewed by a blinded reviewer to 
decide if a match was a true one. Only highest level matches 
(matches on gender, 
first name, middle name 
and date of birth) were accepted. Based on 311 deaths in 
prison, and 7558 offenders known to be alive in prison, the 
matching process was found to be 88.4% sensitive and 99.7% 
specific.14 
For 
returned information on 


death registration number, date of death, State or Territory 
in which death occurred, and the underlying cause of death. 
Deaths were coded using the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM), 
for deaths in 1997 or later, and using the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) for deaths prior to 1997. 
We analysed deaths from all major ‘disease-related’ and 
‘external’ causes categories and subcategories. 
In addition, 
we examined death from smoking-related cancers (ICD-9 140, 
141, 143–150, 157, 160–163, 188, 189; ICD-10 C00–C06, C09– 
C15, C25, C30–C34, C38, C64–C68), hepatitis C liver-related 
cancer (ICD-9 155.0; ICD-10 C22.0); hepatitis C liver-related 
diseases (ICD-9 571–573; ICD-10 K70, K73–K74); transport 
accidents (ICD-9 E800–E848; ICD-10 V01–V99); and accidental 
ICD-10 X40–X44). We also 
poisoning (ICD-9 E850–E858; 
established a separate category ‘drug-related death’ by 
combining those cases where the underlying cause of death 
was inferred to be directly related to drug use. These included 
deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders (ICD-9 304, 
305.2–305.9; 
suicide (ICD-9 
E950.0–E950.5; ICD-10 X60–X64); homicide (ICD-9 E962.0; 
ICD-10 X85); accidental (ICD-9 E850–E858; ICD-10 X40–X44); 
and undetermined intent 
ICD-10 
Y10–Y14). For deaths due to alcohol-related mental and 
behavioural disorder, we 
included (ICD-9 303, 305.0; 
ICD-10 F10). 



The follow-up period was from the date of first imprisonment 
after 1 January 1988 until the date of death or the end date of 
the study (31 December 2002). Mortality rates were estimated 
using the person-time method (number of deaths divided by 
person-years of follow-up). We calculated standardized mor- 
tality ratios (SMRs) by comparing the observed and expected 
number of deaths. Expected mortality was calculated based on 
age, sex, and calendar-specific death rates for the entire NSW 
population for the years 1988–2002. The expected rate from 
the general NSW population was also used to calculate SMRs 
for the Aboriginal group, as accurate information on this 
population and their mortality was not available for the period 
of the study. Ninety five per cent confidence intervals for SMRs 
were based on the Poisson distribution. Time trends 
in 
mortality rates were assessed using the test for linear trends.15 
We used STATA Statistical Software, Release 8.016 for all 
statistical analyses. 

Results 
Cohort characteristics 

The offender 
consisted of 85 203 (76 383 men, 
8820 women) individuals (Table 1). The median age at the 
study entry for men was 27.2 years (range 5 18–86) and for 
women 27.3 years (range 5 18–83). The majority (68%) were 
Australian born. Of 97% (82 807) of prisoners who reported 
Aboriginal status, 11% (9353) self-identified as Australian 
Aboriginal. The median overall follow-up period was 7.7 years 
for men and women (range 5 1 day to 15 years). The average 
number of 
incarcerations during the study period was 
2.5 (range 5 1–78) for men and 2.5 (range 5 1–38) for women. 
death was 36.6 years for men and 32.7 years for women. Of 
the 5137 deaths, 303 (295 men, eight women) occurred in 
custody. 
The crude mortality rate was 797 per 100 000 person-years 
for men and 685 per 100 000 person-years 
for women. 
Compared with the NSW population, overall mortality was 
significantly higher in male (SMR 5 3.7, 95% CI: 3.6–3.8) and 
female (SMR 5 7.8, 95% CI: 7.1–8.5) prisoners (Table 2). SMRs 
were highest in the younger age groups (18–44 years), with 
greater SMRs among women than men. Mortality excess was 
higher for Aboriginals (men: SMR 5 4.8, 95% CI: 4.4–5.3; 
women: SMR 5 12.6, 95% CI: 10.0–15.8). 


In total, during the follow-up period we identified 5137 deaths 
(4714 men, 423 women). The median age at the time of

Overall, the two leading causes of death were accidental and 
mental and behavioural disorders (Table 3). The main cause of 
death in men was accidental (1028, 22%) and in women was 
mental and behavioural disorders 
(124, 29%). The high 
mortality from mental and behavioural disorders was princi- 
pally due to a large number of deaths associated with drug 
overdose (971, 91%). Aggregating deaths due to drugs, we 
identified 1477 (31%) deaths in men and 197 (47%) deaths in 
women. Heroin was the major contributor to most drug-related 
deaths. Prisoner drug-related deaths accounted for 26% of 
all drug-related deaths in NSW. About 14% of deaths in 
men and 7% in women were due to a cardiovascular disease. 
HIV infection was the underlying cause of death for 24 men 
from HIV among 
in the cohort. There were no deaths 
women.

SMRs were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and 
behavioural disorders in men (13.2, 95% CI: 12.3– 14.0) and in 
women (62.8, 95% CI: 52.7–74.9). SMRs were also substan- 
tially raised for homicide in men (10.2, 95% CI: 8.9–11.7) and

in women (26.3, 95% CI: 17.8–39.0). Mortality from Hepatitis 
C liver-related diseases was considerably higher among the 
cohort (men: SMR 5 4.8, 95% CI: 4.1–5.7; women: SMR 5 
12.0, 95% CI: 6.6–21.6). 

the mortality 
among offenders. The crude mortality rate for suicide was 
135 per 100 000 person-years for men (SMR 5 4.8) and 79 per 
100 000 person-years for women (SMR 5 12.1). Hanging was 
the most common method, implicated in 56% of suicides. 
The overall SMR was substantially raised following release 
from prison into the community in both men (4.0, 95% CI: 
3.9–4.2 vs. 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5–1.9) and women (8.2, 95% CI: 
7.4–9.0 vs. 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0–4.2). The excess all-cause mortality 
increased with increasing number of imprisonments (Table 4). 
Our 
estimated all-cause SMR was not dependent on 
the total length of previous imprisonments. In men the SMR 
for drug-related mortality was 14.5 (95% CI: 13.8–15.3) 
after release and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.0–3.6) while in custody. In 
women, all drug-related deaths except one occurred in the 
community. In men the risk of suicide was the same for 
released prisoners (SMR: 4.8, 95% CI: 4.4–5.2) and those 
in custody (SMR: 4.6, 95% CI: 3.8–5.5). The risk of 
still 
homicide was slightly higher after release (SMR: 10.4, 95% 
CI: 9.0–12.1 vs. 8.8, 95% CI: 6.1–12.9). The majority of deaths 
in men and women from all the other causes occurred after 
release from prison. 

SMRs over time for all-cause mortality, drug-related deaths, 
suicide and all disease-related deaths excluding mental and 
behavioural are shown separately for men and women in 
Figure 1. In both men and women there was a large decrease 
in the overall SMR and SMR for drug-related deaths 
between 1989 and 1990, possibly related to changes in the 
prison population in NSW at this time. Over the entire period 
all-cause SMR, on average, decreased significantly in men 
(p 5 0.003; Figure 1a) and women (p 5 0.05; Figure 1b). In 
men this decrease was largely due to a decrease in both 
drug-related SMR (Figure 1c) and SMR for suicide (Figure 1e) 
and in women due to a decrease in the drug-related SMR 
(Figure 1d). The disease-related SMR increased over the study 
period in both men and women (Figure 1g and 1h). This 
increase was only significant in men (p 5 0.003). 
Discussion 
This study is, by far the largest investigation ever conducted 
of mortality in people who have been imprisoned. We found 
elevated cause-specific SMRs among adults who had been 
in full-time custody in NSW, particularly in those aged 
18–44 years. There was a decreasing trend over time in the 
overall SMR almost entirely due to decreases in drug-related

and suicide deaths. By contrast, the SMRs for disease-related 
deaths excluding those related to mental disorders increased 
between 1988 and 2002. 
We found particularly high and significant SMRs for deaths 
suicide and 
due to mental and behavioural disorders, 
drug-related deaths, which suggest high levels of co-morbid 
psychiatric illnesses and drug use among this population. The 
homicide rate for men and women in our cohort was many 
times higher than that for the general population which is an 
indication of the risky lives lead by this group. Significantly 
elevated risk for disease-related causes is consistent with greater 
exposure among this population to risk behaviours such as 
drug-injection, excess alcohol use, smoking and poor diet.17 
The excess mortality was higher among ex-prisoners com- 
pared with prisoners; drug-overdose was responsible for much 
of this excess. It has been suggested that reduced tolerance 
to certain drugs following periods of abstinence or reduced 
intake during incarceration may be the reason for the higher 
risk of drug-related deaths following release.10,18,19 A possible 
explanation for 
the higher disease-related deaths among 
ex-prisoners is that these deaths most often occur later in 
life when offenders have reached the end of their criminal 
career and thus are more likely to be living in the community. 
The finding that male and female Aborigines had a higher 
overall SMR than the cohort as a whole is of significant public 
health importance. Aboriginal people are hugely over repre- 
sented in the Australian prisoner population20 (11% of this 
cohort), but constitute around 2% of the NSW population.21 
Detailed analysis on these data is needed to make meaningful 
conclusions about the findings. 
Several studies have reported on significant excess mortality 
among people with a history of imprisonment.6,9–12 Although 
differences exist in the methods used to define study cohorts 
and the follow-up of individuals to determine vital status, the 
results were broadly similar to those from our study. The 
higher SMRs found for our study population are in line with 
socially disadvantaged 
the findings of 
illness,22 
populations such as those with a severe mental 
homeless people,23 and a cohort of women prostitutes.24 

Mortality declined in both men and women between 1988 
and 2002 relative to the trend in the NSW population, largely 
due to a decline in drug-related deaths and suicide. It is unclear 
whether this trend represents improved provision and access to 
treatments programmes for drug addicts and mentally ill 
prisoners over the study period. Specific projects addressing 
actual services received by prisoners are necessary before any 
conclusion regarding this finding is possible. 

We observed a sharp decrease in drug-related mortality 
between 1989 and 1990. This may be related to the 
in NSW in 1989.25

Following this legislative change, 
days in custody increased for most offences, resulting in a 
decrease in the number of prisoners released from custody. We 
also observed a continuing decline in drug-related mortality 
between 2001 and 2002. This may be due to the well- 
documented reduction in heroin availability in Australia—the 
so-called ‘heroin drought’.26,27

follow-up to enable investigation of 
mortality in a period in which intervention programmes, 
such as the methadone maintenance treatment, started in 
prisons and in communities.28,29 It is likely that we under- 
estimated SMRs among our study cohort. Based on applying 
our linkage procedure to prisoners with known vital status, we 
were able to estimate the sensitivity of the linkage procedure to 
be 88.4% and the specificity to be 99.7%.15 Assuming that any 
misclassification was not differential in this study, these rates of 
sensitivity and specificity would lead to underestimation of the 
SMRs by around 7%.30 Sensitivity and specificity were also 
calculated for drug-related deaths (92.3% and 99.6% respec- 
tively); suicide (93.8% and 98.1%); homicide (100.0% and 
100.0%); cardiovascular (98.2% and 100.0%) and cancer 
(100% and 100%). These figures would probably lead to the 
slight underestimatation of the SMRs. The only exception is 
suicide for which we would have probably overestimated 
the SMR by 4%. Further overestimation of suicide was 
including ‘undermined intent deaths’ 
prevented by not 
among suicide deaths. 
It is highly unlikely that misclassification in the linkage 
procedure could have caused the decreasing trend in SMR for 
drug-related deaths. This could only have been caused by a

procedure over time. We were unable to assess time trends in 
sensitivity and specificity empirically, but improvements to the 
NDI over this time period would suggest 
increasing 
that 
sensitivity and specificity would seem more likely. 
In summary, this is the largest study to date on mortality 
among offenders and is based on data linkage with the 
Australian National Death Index. We have shown that people 
with a history of imprisonment, particularly at younger ages, 
are at a considerably greater than expected risk of death. The 












































high mortality was attributable primarily to mental health 
problems and drug use. We observed a decreasing trend in 
all-cause mortality, drug-related and suicide between 1988 and 
2002. The underlying reason for this decline remains to be 
established. It is important that programmes and support in the 
post-release period are available to assist this disadvantaged and 
marginalized group to obtain a quality life. Problems of 
particular concern to this group are mental health and those 
related to drug abuse.
