Background: A major goal of heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland has been to reduce the drug-related mortality of heroin users. Therefore, 
a continuous monitoring of deaths under treatment is essential. 
Aims: To assess mortality of participants in heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland over a 7-year period from 1994 to 2000, and to compare 
this mortality to the general population and to other populations of opioid users, as reported in the literature. 
Method: Estimation of person years under heroin-assisted treatment from the complete case registry of heroin-assisted treatment in Switzer- 
land. Estimation of standardized mortality ratios comparing the population in treatment to the Swiss population (standardized to the year 
2000). 
Results: Over the 7-year period, the crude death rate of patients in heroin-assisted treatment, and including one month after discharge from 
treatment, was 1% per year. The standardized mortality ratio for the entire observation period was 9.7 (95% C.I. 7.3–12.8), with females 
having higher standardized mortality ratios (SMR 17.2) than males (SMR 8.4). There was no clear time trend. 
Conclusion: Mortality in heroin-assisted treatment was low compared to the mortality rate of Swiss opioid users 1990s (estimated to be 
between 2.5 and 3%). It was also low compared to mortality rates of opioid users in other maintenance treatments in other countries as 
reported in the literature. The SMR was also lower than that reported in the only meta-analysis in the literature: 13.2 (95% C.I. 12.3–14.1). 
The low mortality rate is all the more noteworthy as heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland included only refractory opioid addicts with 
existing severe somatic and/or mental problems.

The problems associated with illicit heroin use increased 
dramatically in Switzerland from the 1980s to the early 
1990s. These problems were partially related to open drug 
scenes and public perception (Klingemann, 1996); and partly 
due to the spread of HIV and its associated costs (Zeltner, 
1996). The reaction by public health authorities was to im-

prove the situation of heroin addicts by implementing dif- 
ferent measures, and integrating and combining these into 
successive national programs (Swiss Federal Health Ofﬁce, 
1991). The goats of these programs can be summarized into 
four broad categories (Cattaneo et al., 1993): 
(1) Reduce the number of new drug consumers/addicts. 
(2) Increase the number of addicts who become abstinent. 
(3) Reduce opiate-associated health consequences and the 
social discrimination and stigmatization of consumers 
and/or addicts. 




Reducing drug-related mortality was a major part of the 
third category. This goal has been achieved, with drug-related 
overdose deaths dropping from a 3-year moving average of 
390.3 deaths in 1994 to 194.3 deaths in 2001 (calculated from 
data given by the Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Police, 2004). The 
overall number of opioid dependent people in Switzerland 
during this time was assumed to be stable at 30,000 (Rehm, 
1995). 
The overall framework of drug policy in Switzerland has 
since been based on four pillars (Schweizer Bundesrat, 1992): 
repression, prevention, therapy, and risk reduction measures. 
Within this framework, heroin-assisted treatment evolved 
as one measure touching the pillars of both therapy and 
risk reduction. Heroin-assisted treatment has been geared 
towards patients who could not be reached or sufﬁciently 
treated with the traditional means of abstinence-oriented 
and methadone maintenance treatment (Uchtenhagen et al., 
1999). 
in 
Heroin-assisted treatment has proven successful 
improving physical and mental health, reducing criminal 
behaviour and illicit drug use, and facilitating social integra- 
tion (Rehm et al., 2001). As a result, this treatment was re- 
afﬁrmed on a non-experimental basis in the decree of March 
8, 1999 (BAG, 2002). The following goals were formu- 
lated: 
(1) Sustained therapeutic integration of opioid addicts. 
(2) Improvement of physical and mental health. 
(3) Improvement of social integration. 
(4) Sustained abstinence of any illegal opioid consumption 
(decree on the medical prescription of heroin March 8, 
1999). 
Reduction of mortality is one of the indicators for goal 
2, and was consequently installed in the monitoring sys- 
tem of heroin-assisted treatment established following the 
decree. 
This paper will give an overview of mortality in the Swiss 
heroin-assisted treatment since its inception in 1994. Crude 
rates and causes of death will be presented as well as a com- 
parison of the rates to standardized mortality rates in the gen- 
eral population (for SMR see Rothman and Greenland, 1998, 
pp. 234). 
Before presenting the results, we will give a general 
overview of mortality in addicts of non-prescribed opioids 
(most of the results described had been based on heroin ad- 
dicts but, especially for younger cohorts, other opioids have 
gained increased importance). The greatest risk for opioid 
dependent people is death from overdose or from health con- 
sequences due to the circumstances of consumption (Single 
et al., 1996). During the 1970s, before the HIV/AIDS epi- 
demic, annual mortality rates for opioid dependent people 
documented in the USA, England, Scandinavia, Germany 
and Switzerland varied from 1.0 to 2.1% (see overview by 
Rehm, 1995). There are indications that mortality risks have 
since increased, at least in some jurisdictions. For instance, 
a ﬁve-fold increase in mortality rates from 1990 to 1998 
was documented in Victoria, Australia (Gerostamoulos et al., 
2001). 
Speciﬁcally in Switzerland, for the 1990s, mortality rates 
for illegal drug users irrespective of treatment status were 
estimated to be 2.5–3% per year (Rehm, 1995; Estermann, 
1996). 
A range of variables inﬂuences mortality rates for opioid 
addicts: the methods used to assess these deaths (i.e., de- 
termining that it is the death of a drug user); estimation of 
the denominator (i.e., the number of opioid users in a given 
jurisdiction); prevalence rates of HIV and hepatitis infec- 
tions; and dominant routes of administration. Additionally, 
the availability of emergency interventions and therapeutic 
services can also inﬂuence mortality rates. However, a de- 
tailed analysis of drug-related deaths for a very small group 
(n = 28,1984) in Zurich found no speciﬁc predictors (Voser, 
1990). 
The substitution of street heroin and other opioids by 
opioid agonists, in particular methadone, seems to meet the 
therapeutic objectives of reducing mortality risks. In the 
framework of comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic pro- 
grams, methadone maintenance treatment intends to mini- 
mize the risks of overdose, injection-related infections and 
suicide (Lepere et al., 2001; JAMA, 1998; BAG, 2002). 
Studies have found evidence of reduced mortality rates 
during methadone maintenance treatment (Gr¨onbladh et al., 
1990; Caplehorn et al., 1996; Ward et al., 1999; Bell and 
Zador, 2000; Joseph et al., 2000). A review of studies in the 
USA concluded that the mortality risk (especially the risk 
of overdose) for those in methadone treatment is reduced by 
70% compared to untreated addicts (Desmond and Maddux, 
2000). Comparative cohort studies of dependent heroin users 
in methadone maintenance and out of treatment found an 
annual mortality rate of 2.2% in the HlV-seronegative users 
out of treatment group, and no cases of death in the HlV- 
seronegative methadone patients over 8 years. The fatalities 
in the HIV-seropositive persons were mostly due to infection 
(Fuglstad et al., 1997, 1998). A reduction of mortality was 
also documented in a methadone maintenance program where 
illegal substance use had been tolerated (Langendam et al., 
2001). 
Some Australian studies found an increased mortality risk 
in the initial phases of methadone maintenance which had 
been linked to dosing changes (Caplehorn, 1998; Caplehorn 
and Drummer, 1999; Bell and Zador, 2000; Zador and Sunjic, 
2000). There is therefore reason to stress the importance of 
careful assessment and dosage when initiating methadone 
maintenance treatment. 
After the onset of the HIV epidemic, infection-related 
death ranged high in the mortality ﬁgures regarding patients 
in methadone maintenance (Appel et al., 2000). 
Another major contributing factor to mortality is the 
pharmaceutical interaction between methadone and other 


psychoactive substances; the prevalence of such effects has 
increased over the years (Kohler et al., 1998). A system- 
atic analysis of fatalities where postmortem examinations 
found traces of methadone also found evidence of other 
substances including alcohol; methadone alone was rarely 
found to be the main cause of death (Barrett et al., 1996). 
Fatalities in a clinic group of New York methadone pa- 
tients aged 30 and up were mostly caused by a combina- 
tion of different illegal substances and alcohol (Appel et 
al., 2000). Similar results were found in other New York 
methadone clinics (Kipnis et al., 2001). Other substances fre- 
quently identiﬁed in combined intoxications deaths are ben- 
zodiazepines (Sunjic and Zador, 1999; Oliver et al., 2001). 
Thus, ﬁnding traces of methadone during a postmortem ex- 
amination cannot be interpreted as proof of a methadone- 
related death (Merrill and Garvey, 1996; Karch and Stephens, 
2000). 
Other agonists or partial agonists used in substitution treat- 
ment have been found to create a similar risk situation. Mor- 
tality rates for maintenance treatment using dihydrocodeine 
are comparable to rates found in methadone maintenance 
(MacLeod et al., 1998). Prescription of buprenorphine, a 
partial agonist, largely used in France and estimated to 
be safer than other agonists because of antagonist prop- 
erties, has also led to fatal intoxications when used in 
combination with other substances, especially benzodi- 
azepines and alcohol (Tracqui et al., 1998a,b; Reynaud et 
al., 1998a,b; Ibrahim et al., 2000). To what extent this 
is due to intravenous application remains unclear (Byrne, 
2001). 
While mortality risks are reduced during methadone main- 
tenance treatment, they may increase again if the user stops 
treatment and resumes illegal opioid use. In fact, some stud- 
ies have found evidence of increased mortality rates after 
being discharged from methadone programs (Gr¨onbladh et 
al., 1990; Zanis and Woody, 1998; Magura and Rosenblum, 
2001). In one study in New York, the risk of mortality was 
higher for female patients than for male patients (Appel et 
al., 2000). In another US study, the mortality rate during the 
ﬁrst year after discharge was found to be 8.2%, compared 
to the annual rate of 1% during treatment Zanis and Woody, 
1998). When patients were removed from the program, the 
ensuing mortality risks were especially high (Gr¨onbladh et 
al., 1990). The route of administration is also an important 
factor: returning to injecting illegal heroin results in higher 
mortality compared to snifﬁng or smoking (Langendam et 
al., 2001). 
In sum, users of non-prescribed opioids have an increased 
risk of mortality compared to the general population. In 
Switzerland, for the 1990s, the mortality risk was estimated 
to be between 2.5 and 3% per year for the combined popula- 
tion of opioid users in and outside of treatment. This number 
corresponds well to reported mortality rates in other jurisdic- 
tions in established market economies. Overall, the mortality 
risks of opioid users in treatment are lower than outside of 
treatment. 


Heroin-assisted treatment had been initiated in Switzer- 
land in 1994 and this contribution examines all cases of deaths 
during treatment from this time period until the end of 2000. 
Heroin is prescribed for opioid addiction in specialized 
centres 7 days a week, and taken under direct observation 
with limits to dose increases (see Gschwend et al., 2004, for 
details on dosage). No take home doses are allowed. Patients 
attend daily and inject 2–3 times under medical supervision. 
Methadone can be co-prescribed, often in the evening ses- 
sions or for periods, when the patients plan to be away from 
the centre (e.g. for a weekend travel or vacation). 
Given the high frequency of treatment interactions, the 
costs of heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland is relatively 
high. In 1995, costs have been estimated at about 50 CHF 
per patient per day (corresponds to about 32 Euros), i.e., the 
yearly average costs of one patient are between 10,000 and 
11,000 Euros (Frei et al., 2000). However, the same analysis 
revealed that the cost savings incurred by lower criminality, 
lower health care and housing costs, more than offset these 
costs, resulting in a net beneﬁt of about 45 CHF (about 29 
Euros). 

Two main sources were used to analyze death in heroin- 
assisted patients between 1994 and 2000. The ﬁrst source was 
two doctoral dissertations (Gacond, 2004; Ryser, 1999). The 
second source was records monitoring the efforts of heroin- 
assisted treatment. As this article examined mortality in treat- 
ment, deaths were included that occurred during the entire 
time being in treatment, i.e., from admission to discharge, 
plus including a timeframe of 30 days post heroin-assisted 
treatment. The 30-day-time period after treatment was in- 
cluded to be sure, that these patients had indeed left treat- 
ment. For people, who left treatment against medical advice 
and without informing the staff, the formal discharge was 
set at the day when they last received medication. The 30- 
days-time period after treatment was also added to include 
deaths which might be treatment-related but occurred in close 
temporal proximity after discharge from treatment. Finally, 
the procedures and guidelines of heroin-assisted treatment 
in Switzerland at that time were deﬁned in a way that the 
treatment agencies and the Federal Health Ofﬁce had to be 
informed of all deaths within the 30-day period. It should be 
noted, that this deﬁnition including 30 days post treatment 
makes the comparison between rates of different treatment 
unfavourable for heroin-assisted treatment, as most other ar- 
ticles with reported death rates in treatment included only the 
time between admission and discharge. 
This deﬁnition yielded a total of 49 deaths in more 
than 4600 person-years over the period between 1994 and 
2000. 



Two mortality rates were calculated: crude rates, which 
denote the number of deaths per year, and the standardized 
mortality ratio, which compares the likelihood of dying in 
the cohort of opioid patients with the general population. For 
both kinds of rates, the denominator of the analyses had to 
be determined, i.e., person years in treatment. We undertook 
sex-speciﬁc analyses, based on the yearly records of heroin- 
assisted treatment from the monitoring projects funded by the 
Swiss Federal Health Ofﬁce. Any patient who had received 
heroin-assisted treatment in a given year was included in the 
denominator based on his/her exact time at risk (in treatment 
as deﬁned) during the respective year. 
To calculate the standardized mortality ratio each annual 
cohort of heroin-assisted patients was divided by sex and 
age; 10-year age categories were used. Conﬁdence intervals 
for SMRs were estimated assuming death to represent a Pois- 
son distributed event (Rothman and Greenland, 1998). The 
comparator was the general population living in Switzerland 
as assessed by the Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Statistics (2004). 
Results were standardized to the year 2000. 

The following categories of death were used based on 
death certiﬁcates and coded according to ICD-10 (WHO, 
1989): 
• Infections 
• Chronic disease 
• Intentional injury 
• Unintentional injury 
For each death only one category was used. Ratings were 
undertaken by the two doctoral students and validated by 
the speciﬁc commission (Safety Assurance Group of the 
HegeBe) which was established to examine all deaths within 
heroin-assisted treatment. 

The number of patients in heroin-assisted treatment in 
Switzerland has increased between 1994 and 2000 (see 
Table 1). The increase was continuous with the exception 
of 1997 when there was an admission stop between the ex- 
perimental prescription and the new decree. After 1998, treat- 
ment centres were allowed to admit new patients, and in 1999 
and 2000, new centres were opened and others have been 
authorized to admit more patients. Overall, all admissions 
require the approval of the Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Public 
Health. 
Table 2 gives an overview on the causes of death. The 
distribution of deaths reﬂects the causes of death cited in the 
literature: infections and injuries dominate.

The crude rates per person-years are given in the next Ta- 
ble (Table 3). Overall, these numbers are relatively low in 
comparison to the mortality rates of opioid users; including 
opioid users in treatment (see literature review above). There 
is no clear time trend, but the years 1998–2000 show lower 
mortality rates compared to the rates of the preceding years. 
At this point, it should be noted that the mean treatment co- 
hort age has continuously increased between 1994 and 2000 
(Gschwend et al., 2003) and therefore, increasing crude mor- 
tality rates would be expected. 
Finally, Table 4 depicts the annual SMRs separated by sex. 
As expected, the mortality of patients in heroin-assisted treat- 
ment is much higher than the general population. Again, no

clear time trend can be seen in our data. However, it should 
be noted that the numbers of deaths are quite small result- 
ing in large conﬁdence intervals for SMRs (particularly for 
females). 

With a crude rate of 1.1%, mortality in heroin-assisted 
treatment was low compared to the mortality rate of Swiss 
opioid users in the1990s which was estimated to be between 
2.5 and 3%. It was also low compared to mortality rates of 
opioid users in other maintenance treatments from different 
countries as reported in the literature (see above). 
The SMR in heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland be- 
tween 1994 and 2000 (SMR: 9.7; C.I. 7.3–12.8) was also 
lower than the SMR reported in the only meta-analysis re- 
ported in the literature (English et al., 1995: SMR: 13.2; 95% 
C.I. 12.3–14.1). The low mortality rate is all the more note- 
worthy, as heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland included 
only refractory opioid addicts with existing severe somatic 
and/or mental problems. 
There is no clear time trend in mortality of heroin-assisted 
patients in Switzerland between 1994 and 2000. The highest 
rates were between 1995 and 1997, and since then, rates have 
been substantially lower. The high rates between 1995 and 
1997 may be related to the admission policy in the early 
years of heroin-assisted treatment. This policy was driven by 
the admission of many HIV-infected users, some of whom 
were already infected with fullblown AIDS. Fifteen of the 
30 deaths between 1995 and 1997 were attributed to HIV or 
AIDS. The majority of HIV/AIDS related deaths occurred 
in the ﬁrst few years. Non-systematic assessment of cause of 
death for ex-patients in heroin-assisted treatments also shows 
that HIV/AIDS had its peak for this group between 1995 
and 1997 (Ryser, 1999). The gender ratio among all deaths 
resulting from HIV/AIDS was 11 to 6 (males to females). 
Overall, HIV/AIDS was the most prevalent cause of death 
for patients in heroin-assisted treatment. It should be noted 
that for all of the deaths, the HIV infection occurred before the 
treatment admission, i.e., all patients were already infected 
at the time of the treatment examination. The drop after 1997 
may also be connected with more effective therapies for HIV 
introduced in 1996. 
The second most important cause of death was uninten- 
tional injury (n = 9 or 18%). The majority of deaths had some 
relation to the consumption of illicit drugs (ﬁve out of nine). 
The exact role of heroin intake in these cases is not clear, 
nor is the role of illicit heroin versus prescribed heroin. In 
general, drug-related deaths are ill deﬁned and hard to distin- 
guish (Raschke et al., 2000). The usual deﬁnition of “opioid- 
related overdose” entails a respiratory insufﬁciency following 
the consumption of opioids (Davidson et al., 2003). However, 
to determine this as the cause of death requires detailed bi- 
ological analyses, which have not been routinely conducted. 
An expert evaluation of all cases by at least three renowned 
Swiss specialists (“Safety Assurance Group, subcommission 
on mortality”)1 came to the conclusion that, based on the 
available data, the prescribed heroin was not causally impli- 
cated in any of these deaths. For the most part, the time be- 
tween the last intake of prescribed heroin and the occurrence 
of death was longer than 24 h. 
The distinction between suicide and unintentional deaths 
is not always clear. To give but two real examples: a chron- 
ically paranoid person drowned while under the inﬂuence 
of alcohol in a lake with a water temperature of 16 ◦C. The 
patient had often spoken about suicide in the days before 
the incident. Another patient stole medication from an emer- 
gency room. Based on reports of another patient, the theft 
was undertaken with the intention of suicide. A mix of intox- 
icating substances caused the death in the hours following the 
theft (these stories are confusing and fragmented). Both cases 
could be classiﬁed as intentional or unintentional. The actual 
classiﬁcation on the death certiﬁcate for the ﬁrst case was 
suicide and for the second case, unintentional accident due 
to overdose from multiple intoxications. Other suicides were 
clearer; for example, a patient received help from a Swiss 
support organization aiding in the planning of suicides. Two 
of the suicides were undertaken by willingly taking a “hot 
shot”, i.e., consciously injecting an amount which essentially 
guarantees overdose. Both these overdoses were completely 



unrelated to prescribed heroin. Finally, two individuals diag- 
nosed with HIV/AIDS committed suicide and the illness was 
one of the reasons given for their suicide. 
The overall mortality rates of patients in heroin-assisted 
treatment were low compared to mortality rates of other opi- 
oid users, both in and out of treatment. Even the liberal in- 
clusion criteria of including the full treatment period plus 
30 days post treatment did not change this fact. Overall, this 
result conﬁrms the fact that heroin-assisted treatment is as- 
sociated with considerable treatment success, even in com- 
parison to methadone treatment (see Rehm et al., 2001; van 
den Brink et al., 2003). 
With respect to the SMRs, three results are particularly 
interesting. First, even though heroin-assisted treatment can 
be labelled as an overall success, the mortality rates of pa- 
tients are still markedly higher when compared to the general 
population. However, as indicated, the Swiss rates are sub- 
stantially lower than rates for other opioid user populations 
reported in the literature (English et al., 1995; Frischer et 
al., 1997; Quaglio et al., 2001; Hickman et al., 2003). This is 
noteworthy as the Swiss trial intended to and succeeded in re- 
cruiting refractory opioid addicts with existing severe somatic 
and/or mental problems (Uchtenhagen et al., 1999). Finally, 
women displayed a higher standardized mortality rate com- 
pared to men, which is also consistent with the literature. This 
does not mean that opioid using women have higher mortality 
risks compared to men. In fact, the female crude rate (0.97) is 
even slightly lower than the respective rate for males (1.10), 
although this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant. How- 
ever, the mortality risk for women compared to men in the 
general population is lower, and thus the SMRs for women 
are higher. 
Overall, the mortality for patients in heroin-assisted treat- 
ment in Switzerland is low in comparison to other treatment 
studies and opioid user cohorts. This corroborates other pos- 
itive ﬁndings from the Swiss treatment trial and for high dose 
heroin-assisted treatment in general (Rehm et al., 2001; van 
den Brink et al., 2003).
