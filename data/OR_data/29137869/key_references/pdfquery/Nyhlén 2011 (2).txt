Aims: To evaluate premature mortality and causes of death from young adulthood to middle age in 
a cohort of drug users followed during almost four decades 
Design: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of patients with drug abuse/dependence. 
Methods: A cohort of 561 drug abusers, admitted to a detoxiﬁcation and short-term rehabilitation unit 
1970e1978 was followed to December 31st, 2006. Standardized interviews and hospital records with 
toxicological analyses were used for demographic data, substance use and psychiatric diagnoses at 
admission. For Follow-up analyses, autopsy protocols including toxicology tests and death certiﬁcates 
were obtained for assessment of causes of death which were coded according to ICD-10. Age-group 
standardized mortality ratios were calculated independently for both sexes. 
Results: 204 persons (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. SMR was 5.94 for the cohort. Compared to an age- 
and gender-matched population, the risk of premature death was about eighteen times higher between 
the ages of 20e44 and about ﬁve times higher from 45 up to the age of 69. Of 120 (59%) drug-related 
deaths, 43 were opiate overdoses, and 3 were overdose from amphetamine. A total of 53 (26%) persons 
died violent deaths: 39 suicides, of which 25 were drug-related, 3 homicides and 12 accidents. The 
Swedish national causes of death register underestimated drug-related death by 37% and suicide by 85% 
compared to the results from this study. 
Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature often drug-related and 
violent death well into middle age, and to a great extent the drug addicts died from the same drug they 
had abused when they were ﬁrst admitted for treatment. The underestimation of drug-related death and 
suicide in some national death cause registers could be reduced if the doctor routinely records ICD codes 
when issuing death certiﬁcates and autopsy protocols. 


Drug abusers have an increased risk of premature mortality, 
which is inﬂuenced by a number of factors, including types of drugs 
used, patterns of administration, risk behavior, contracted infec- 
tious diseases, gender, age and social situation. Premature death is 
deﬁned as death occurring before the average age of death within 
a given population.

The present study investigates causes of premature death in 
a cohort of drug abusers from January 1970 to December 31st, 2006. 
During the 1970s drug use patterns in Sweden changed from 
a predominance of amphetamine abuse to amphetamine as well as 
opiate abuse.1,2 Regional differences in the availability of substances 
have remained to the present.3 In Copenhagen in Denmark, very 
close to the studied county in the southern part of Sweden, 
morphine base and, from 1975, heroin, have dominated the drug 
scene.4 The cohort is, according to data from a national case-ﬁnding 
study from the 1970s, representative of the pattern of heavy drug 
use in the population of substance abusers at that time. Most of the 
local intravenous drug abusers were included in this cohort as 
patients.3

Modes of administration vary between drug-dependent pop- 
ulations. Intravenous drug use in particular is vital to evaluate, since 
some contagious blood-borne infections cause chronic infections 
and even death. Contagious blood-borne infections related to 
intravenous drug use are hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.5e10 In 
USA, the ﬁrst HIV infections appeared among drug addicts in New 
York in the mid 1970s,11 while in Sweden the ﬁrst HIV-infected 
drug addict was detected as late as 1984.12 
Most studies report higher mortality for opiate users than for 
other substance users13e17 but most substance dependent patients 
use more than one substance throughout life. A follow-up study of 
a consecutive sample of 125 drug-dependent Swedish patients 
with mixed drug abuse demonstrated an annual mortality rate of 
1%,18 a ﬁgure which increased to 2% over the next ten year follow- 
up period of the same sample.19 

Around 16.5 million persons use opiates per year worldwide.20 
In a meta-analysis of mortality death rates among opiate abusers 
were about 13 times the norm for their age.21 The standardized 
mortality ratio (SMR) in more recent studies is still higher in groups 
that do not receive opiate agonist treatment such as methadone, 
buprenorphine or other opiates.7,17,22e25 In general, mortality is 
suppressed during opiate agonist maintenance treatment or heroin 
maintenance.25 
Overdose is a major cause of death among opiate-dependent 
patients. In Australia it is assumed that 1/140 opiate users (0.7%) die 
from an overdose in a given year.26 Overdose is here deﬁned as 
death caused by illicit drugs.27 Several studies of opiate users have 
reported that 35e40% of all deaths are overdoses.6,14,28e31 Lifestyle 
is a major inﬂuence factor. Overdoses, for instance, seldom occur 
among subjects who have become opiate-dependent in connection 
with pain treatment32 or among abusers not injecting.33 
Although amphetamine is considered to be the most prevalent 
synthetic drug of abuse in the world used by 25 million individuals 
per year, few studies have focused on the impact of stimulant use on 
cause speciﬁc mortality.20,34 Unlike opiates, cocaine and amphet- 
amine seldom cause death.26 Instead, stimulant use has been asso- 
ciated with increased mortality due to lifestyle factors indirectly 
associated with stimulant use such as violent behavior, violent 
deaths or diseases acquired through intravenous administration.12,35 
Despite the fact that cannabis in its various forms is the most 
common substance worldwide, used by as many as 166 million 
people per year, few studies have to our knowledge assessed 
mortality associated with cannabis or reported an increased asso- 
ciation between mortality and cannabis. One study of marijuana 
smokers reported that cannabis was associated with increased 
AIDS-related mortality,36 an association explained by an increased 
prevalence of marijuana use among homosexual males. 


The relation between premature mortality and psychiatric 
disorders in drug abusers has to our knowledge never previously 
been studied in a cohort over several decades. The suicide rate in 
epidemiological studies of drug abusers is high and suicide 
attempts often reﬂect a co-morbid depressive disorder.37 The rate 
of suicide attempts in a ﬁve-year follow-up of a representative 
sample from the present material demonstrated that 45% of all 
patients had attempted suicide at least once.18 Another Swedish 
study observing patients with co-morbid substance abuse and 
psychiatric disorders found a rate of 59% attempted suicides.38 

I. To compare the mortality in the cohort of drug-dependent 
patients with the mortality in a gender- and age-corrected 
local population in the southern region of Sweden. 
II. To identify causes of death in the cohort: (1) Drug-related: (a) 
drug as primary, underlying death cause, including over- 
dosing and drug-related suicides (b) drug as contributing 
cause of death, including violent death, (2) To identify non 
drug-related deaths: (a) diseases, (b) violent death including 
accidental death and suicide/homicide. 
III. To identify to what extent substances found post mortem 
were already present at the ﬁrst admission to treatment. 


The setting was an inpatient detoxiﬁcation and short-term 
rehabilitation unit in the southern part of Sweden, Scania County, at 
the St. Lars psychiatric hospital in the city of Lund. The catchment 
area for the unit was the entire county with a population of 977,783 
people in 1970. The unit was a typical low threshold treatment 
facility of this period accepting all drug abusers seeking treatment. 

The data were collected over a period of nearly four decades 
prior to the follow-up conducted in 2006. Comparisons were made 
between those who were alive in December 2006 and those who 
had died during the study period 1970e2006. Causes of death were 
analyzed for all individuals who died during the follow-up. 

Drug use and somatic symptoms were evaluated in the regular 
medical 
intake assessment carried out by a physician. Drug 
screening, including alcohol, was based on intake urine samples 
analyzed by thin layer chromatography or gas chromatography at 
the laboratory unit of the hospital. Standardized forms were used 
for collecting baseline demographic data, types of drugs used and 
psychiatric disorders. Clinical interviews, standardized question- 
naires (SWEDATE) and hospital records contained mandatory 
information on length, intensity of substance abuse and psychiatric 
diagnoses.39,40 Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were issued at 
discharge by the senior consulting psychiatrist. For this presenta- 
tion, three broad groups according to ICD-8 nomenclature were 
used: psychosis, neurotic disorder (depression and/or anxiety 
disorders) and personality disorder. 

In this long-term follow-up of mortality, the patients’ national 
identiﬁcation numbers were linked to the Swedish Central Personal 
Register and the Cause of Death Register at the National Depart- 
ment of Health (EPC) in which all deaths are consistently recorded 
by the Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB). The coding in 
Sweden is performed by SCB, based upon death certiﬁcates, issued 
but not coded by physicians and/or forensic doctors. The coverage 
of deaths in Sweden is close to 100% because reporting is manda- 
tory. The ICD-10 codes permit classiﬁcation of death causes 
according to the rules speciﬁed in the International Statistical 
Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, published 
by the WHO.41 ICD-10 provides improved coding possibilities for 
ICD. 
many different drugs compared to previous versions of 


Diagnoses in hospital records from the ﬁrst admission based on 
ICD-8 and ICD-9 (303, 304) were re-coded into ICD-10 diagnoses of 
substance abuse and dependence (F10eF19). 
Death certiﬁcates and autopsy protocols from forensic clinics in 
Sweden and Denmark were obtained, and causes of death were 
coded according to ICD-10 by a senior consultant physician (A.N.) 
and an associate professor of forensic medicine (P.K.). Causes of 
death were ﬁnally classiﬁed as drug-related or non drug-related. 
The two raters classiﬁed the ﬁrst 100 causes of death diagnoses 
independently of each other. All cases (n ¼ 204) were then ﬁled 
after mutual agreement. Only three out of 100 differed slightly (3%). 
A reliability check of 70 protocols classifying drug-related vs non 
drug-related deaths showed a good agreement (k ¼ 0.98). 
Swedish forensic autopsy always includes drug analyses when 
the deceased persons are drug abusers, and/or persons who have 
suffered an accidental, unclear or violent death. These toxicological 
data were studied in detail in every case of suspected or conﬁrmed 
drug-related death. 
Violent death includes accidental deaths and suicides/homi- 
cides and can be both drug-related and non drug-related. Acci- 
dental death includes, for example, motor vehicles and drowning 
accidents. Overdoses were classiﬁed separately by type of drug. 
Overdose is deﬁned as an acute death, occurring shortly after the 
intake of an illegal drug, and directly related to the intake of the 
drug.27 Overdoses are often presumed to be accidental but can be 
suicidal with a lethal intoxication with illicit drugs. Suicidal over- 
doses were classiﬁed as suicides by the pathologist on the basis of 
forensic autopsy protocols. Police reports supplied important 
additional information to conﬁrm diagnoses. 
2.4.1. Drug-related death 
2.4.1.1. Drug as underlying cause of death. The underlying cause of 
death is the primary reason for dying, while contributing causes of 
death contribute to death without being the primary cause.27 The 
deﬁnition of drug-related death used is the one adopted by several 
other authors.5,27 The outline of classiﬁcation of drug-related death 
presented by Degenhardt26 is close to the one used in this study with 
additional ICD-10 codes to include alcohol, as well as self-inﬂicted 
and unclear intoxication by any drug. Drug-related death, “drug- 
induced death” refers to those cases where the underlying cause of 
death is directly associated to drug use according to death certiﬁcates 
or autopsy protocols. The primary cause of drug-related death is 
deﬁned according to the substances involved and the context. 
i) an acute condition caused by drug use where the deceased 
person was identiﬁed as having a drug use disorder (F10eF16, 
F19), usually with a history of drug dependence (F10.2eF16.2, 
F19.2) and ii) an acute intoxication, caused by drugs 
(X40eX45, X60eX65, or/and codes from T36eT50 for speciﬁc 
drug identiﬁcation, or/and X85 þ Y10eY15). 
ii) A primary drug-related death includes the codes F10.0eF16.0, 
F19.0 alone or X40eX45/X60eX65 cross-classiﬁed with alcohol 
(F10.0), cocaine (T40.5, F14.0), other stimulants as amphet- 
amine (T43.6, F15.0), or opiates (T40.0eT40.4, T40.6 and F11.0). 
2.4.1.2. Drug as contributing factor in deaths due to other cau- 
ses. Cases where drugs play only a contributory role (indirectly 
related to death, e.g. motor vehicle accidents, drowning) or the 
underlying cause of death is a medical condition caused by long-term 
use of drugs, the use of drugs is not classiﬁed as primary cause of death. 

Non drug-related death was classiﬁed as such if death was 
caused by somatic diseases as well as accidents, suicide or other 
violent deaths without laboratory indications of drug involvement. 

First, the observed mortality rates of the subjects in the sample 
were compared with the mortality in the general population in the 
area, Scania County, Sweden in the 1970s, by calculating the SMR 
for both genders combined in 5-year age groups. The general 
population mortality was adjusted to match the gender and age 
distribution of the drug-user population. SMR was calculated as the 
ratio, observed/expected for men and women separately. Subjects 
were censored by December 31, 2006. 
Within each 5-year age group, the number of subjects at risk 
was calculated as the number of subjects who 1) entered the cohort 
before they reached that age-group interval, 2) had not died or 
migrated before that age-group interval, and 3) had not passed that 
age-group interval to December 2006. Since the ethnic diversity of 
Sweden was small in the 1970s, adjusting for race or ethnicity was 
not considered necessary. 


The cohort was predominately young males, 23e25 years old at 
ﬁrst admission to detoxiﬁcation (Table 1). A family history of 
substance use problems was reported for about 40%, and psychi- 
atric illness in the family was present in about 20% of the cohort. 
More than a third of the patients never completed grammar school 
and 40% had a history of imprisonment. The incidence in the cohort

(95% CI ¼ 4.8e6.5), and the crude mortality ratio was 1.5%. For 
women the observed number of deaths was 46 based on 5265 
observation years, while the expected number of deaths was 11. 
SMR was 4.2 (95% CI ¼ 2.99e5.41), and the crude annual 
mortality was 0.9%. The difference between the genders was not 
signiﬁcant, but for certain age groups SMR varied considerably. 

The causes of death were coded by ICD-10 diagnoses for all 
deceased persons in the cohort (n ¼ 204). The coding was based on 
death certiﬁcates and autopsy reports from departments of 
Forensic Medicine (85%) or, to a minor extent, on autopsy reports 
from general hospitals (5%). Medical records and police reports 
provided additional information. Causes of death were divided into 
drug-related or non drug-related death, and sub-grouped accord- 
ing to the labels in Fig. 1. 

Drug-related death was the primary cause of death in 120 cases 
(59%). Toxicological analyses were provided for all these cases. 
was about 50% for hepatitis B at baseline. Testing for hepatitis B 
commenced about 1975, for HIV in 1988, and for hepatitis C in 1999. 
The substances most frequently used at ﬁrst admission were 
opiates (35%), stimulants (36%), cannabis (45%) and barbiturates 
(13%). A majority of the patients had an intense substance use 
lasting for more than one year corresponding to a diagnosis of 
substance dependence. Regular intravenous drug use was reported 
by around 80% of the patients in the cohort. Almost all opiate users 
and amphetamine users were intravenous users. There were no 
gender differences in substance use and only opiates (p < 0.02) and 
cannabis (p < 0.009) were signiﬁcantly more common among 
males. Deceased patients used more opiates and barbiturates than 
those alive in 2006. 
About 50% of the individuals suffered from at least one psychi- 
atric disorder (Table 1). Psychiatric disorders categorized into 
psychosis, neurotic disorder and personality disorder had no 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on premature mortality when comparing 
deceased vs alive (c2 ¼ 1.86, n.s.). Of the suicide cases, 32% were 
diagnosed with psychosis at baseline. 
A national case-ﬁnding study estimated that the number of heavy 
drug abusers in the Southern region, having a daily intake of illegal 
drugs was around 1300 in 1978, 50% being injection drug users.3 The 
proportions of males, age and dominating drug pattern in the cohort 
were reasonably similar to those in the case-ﬁnding study. A majority 
of the intravenous abusers in the region were patients in the cohort, 
excluding persons below the age of 17. The intravenous drug abusers 
in the cohort can be regarded as representative of intravenous 
abusers in the local population of substance abusers. 

By the end of 2006, 204 of 561 patients in the cohort (36.4%) had 
died. Two percent had either immigrated or could not be located. 
The standard mortality ratio (SMR) in the entire sample is 
summarized in Table 2. The crude annual mortality was 1.3%, the 
expected number of deaths was 34.4 and the SMR was 5.94 (95% 
CI ¼ 5.5e6.81), compared to the local gender- and age-matched 
population. 
Premature mortality in the cohort was highest among the 
patients in their early twenties, and remained at a high level well 
into middle age. As is evident from Table 2, the crude annual 
mortality in the group remained stable until middle age. 
The gender-speciﬁc mortality is shown in Table 3. For men, the 
observed number of deaths was 158 based on 10,420 observation 
years, while the expected number of deaths was 28.3. SMR was 5.6

Autopsy protocols with toxicological analyses provided data which 
would otherwise have been obscured. In this group 46 deaths were 
caused by overdoses of illegal drugs, of which 43 (93%) involved 
opiates and 3 (7%) stimulants (amphetamine mostly). Seventy of 
the remaining 74 deaths were intoxications by one or several legal 
drugs, sometimes in combination with illegal drugs. Mixed intox- 
ication was diagnosed in 54% of all the cases of fatal intoxication. 
Drug-related death due to suicide was diagnosed in 25/120 deaths 
(21%). In all, 25% died a violent drug-related death from suicide, 
homicide or accidents. 
The group with primary alcohol dependence was only 3%, but 
still was overrepresented in violent death (p ¼ 0.002). Drug-related 
death was underestimated by 37% (76 vs 120 cases) and suicide by 
85%, (6 vs 39 suicides) when comparing the ICD-codes from the 
study with the codes from the Swedish national death cause 
register. In the ﬁrst case drug diagnoses were missing and in the 
second, X-codes for self-inﬂicted causes of death were missing in 
the death certiﬁcates from SCB. 


One third of the cohort had an opiate dependence at baseline 
and 40% (70/174) of them were dead by the end of 2006. Of the 
opiate abusers, 43 died from opiate overdoses and the remaining 
died from mixed intoxications with opiates. Sedative and hypnotic 
drugs exclusively were found post mortem in 56 persons of which 
16 was barbiturate intoxications. Of these deaths 10/16 barbiturate 
intoxications were mixed with other drugs, mostly alcohol and 
opiates. Alcohol was present post mortem in 23%, mostly detected 
in combination with other drugs. 

Somatic diseases were the primary cause of death in 29% of all 
deaths of the cohort. Somatic death causes were cardiovascular 
diseases (n ¼ 24), liver cancer (n ¼ 5), and other forms of cancer 
(n ¼ 8). Three died from terminal AIDS. The remaining 19 indi- 
viduals died mainly from other infections such as pneumonia, 
hepatitis and septicemia. The time from ﬁrst treatment contact to 
death was longer for subjects who died from somatic diseases than 
for those who died from accidental intoxication or violent death as

This prospective study of substance abusers followed over four 
decades conﬁrms the long-lasting increased risk for premature 
death from drug addiction. In the years from age 20 to the mid- 
thirties, drug users in the cohort showed a ten-fold or higher risk of 
dying compared to the general population in the area. An earlier 
studied smaller cohort of mostly heroin abusers had a crude annual 
mortality rate of 2.5%.16 The present cohort with a mixed group of 
substance abusers had a mean crude annual mortality rate of 1.31%. 
Premature mortality of the drug abusers remained signiﬁcantly 
increased up to the age of 65. These ﬁndings are consistent with 
a Danish cohort study of opiate addicts still being at higher risk of 
premature death after many years of stable abstinence.24 
Around 60% of the cohort individuals in the present study used 
more than one drug at baseline, and many remained mixed abusers 
throughout life. One third of the opiate-related deaths in the 
present study were mixed intoxications with alcohol and sedatives. 
When analyzing causes of death by speciﬁc drug intoxications as 
well as intoxications by combinations of drugs, we found a pattern 
of post mortem substances very similar to a study by Gossop 
et al.29: opiates was the most prevalent group of substances found 
at death, followed by all types of sedative and hypnotic drugs, such 
as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. Substances found 
post mortem reﬂected fairly stable patterns of drug use over time. 
About 50% of the patients died from the same substance they 
abused already at ﬁrst admission. 
Two earlier Swedish studies2,16 showed that regular opiate use 
was related to premature mortality and male gender. The generally 
lower level of premature mortality in women as previously repor- 
ted in other studies of Scandinavian drug abusers13,16,44 was not 
conﬁrmed. Rather, the SMRs for women were higher in certain 
young age groups compared to SMRs in men. Thus the mixed 
picture of elevated premature mortality rates for male drug users in 
some studies,14,33 lower rates of male premature mortality32 in 
others, or no gender differences5,19,28,45 might reﬂect speciﬁc 
subgroup patterns rather than general gender differences. 
In this cohort 45 of 70 opiate-related deaths were overdoses. 
Overdose is the major cause of death among opiate-dependent 
patients, and accounts for 35e40% of deaths,28 sometimes at dosage 
levels that are not higher than their regular doses.42 One reason is 
that non lethal doses of heroin can become lethal in the presence of 
alcohol and sedatives such as benzodiazepines.42 Barbiturates mixed 
with opiates have an additive depressive effect on respiration. 
In a study from Australia,14 the risk of drug-related death for 
opiate addicts was 2.4 times higher than for amphetamine users. 
The mortality rate related to stimulants was low, consistent with 
earlier ﬁndings.26 Only 3 of 46 overdoses were due to amphetamine 
in our study while 11/70 fatal intoxications involved amphetamine 
as one of several mixed substances. 
The association between cannabis use and mortality was nega- 
tive in the earlier study from the same cohort.16 This ﬁnding remains 
in the present larger cohort also after controlling for the use of other 
drugs. Cannabis was rarely found post mortem despite the fact that 
half of the patients were introduced to the drug scene with cannabis 
and 15% of the cohort used cannabis at the ﬁrst admission. Our 
conclusions are consistent with other studies stating that cannabis is 
not associated with increased premature mortality.36,46 
Premature death was elevated in patients in this cohort who 
were abstinent from heavy drug abuse when followed-up after 
ﬁfteen years, but 10e15% lower compared to those in active drug 


use.19 These ﬁndings are consistent with other long-term cohort 
studies.31,47 Although mortality decreases with continued absti- 
nence it remains higher than in the general population15,24 
Although the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the cohort 
was around 50% and some researchers have suggested a causative 
impact of psychopathology on premature mortality14,43,44 this 
immediate association was not conﬁrmed in this study. This is in 
agreement with Sørensen, Jepsen, Haastrup et al.24 Nevertheless 
a substantial ﬁnding was that 32% of the suicide cases in the cohort 
had been diagnosed with psychosis at baseline. The proportion of 
suicide in this cohort was about 10 times higher than in the general 
population in Sweden.8 
Another third of the deceased died from somatic diseases 
associated with drug addiction, mostly liver failure, liver cancer and 
infections such as pneumonia and blood-borne infections: HIV, 
hepatitis B/C, and septicemia. The low incidence of HIV/AIDS 
reﬂects the low prevalence of HIV in Sweden. 
Among the assets of this study are the long observation period 
and the completeness of individual data, which allowed us to 
describe the cohort in detail from their ﬁrst admission and follow 
the patients over time with data seldom available when register 
data are the only available tool. The characteristics of the cohort 
also showed a fair agreement with corresponding characteristics in 
the population of heavy drug abusers in Southern Sweden as 
assessed in repeated case-ﬁnding studies.3 
Finally, the procedure where two medical experts coded death 
causes, eliminated some inconsistencies found in data from 
national registers. In line with Gossop’s observation, the use of 
autopsy protocols identiﬁed a larger and more correct proportion of 
drug-related deaths than did register data alone.29 This validity 
problem could be reduced if the same medical doctor issuing the 
death certiﬁcates and the autopsy protocols also make the ﬁnal 
coding using modern ICD-10 standard. 
A drawback is that the cohort design by necessity provides 
a more limited number of subjects for analysis, thus restricting 
power more than is the case in large epidemiological samples. 

When drug abuse is serious enough to warrant detoxiﬁcation, it 
is associated with premature mortality well into middle age. The 
drugs found post mortem were to a high degree the same drugs 
abused at baseline, implicating that many of the drug addicts had 
a consistent heavy substance abuse of the same drugs throughout 
life. The underestimation of drug-related death and suicide in some 
national causes of death registers could be reduced if the same 
doctor issue and code ICD-diagnoses on the death certiﬁcates and 
autopsy protocols.
