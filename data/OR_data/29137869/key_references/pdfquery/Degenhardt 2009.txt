Background: The small size of previous studies of mortality in opioid dependent people has prevented 
an assessment of the extent to which elevated mortality risks are consistent across time, clinical and/or 
patient groups. The current study examines reductions in mortality related to treatment in an entire 
treatment population. 
Methods: Data from the New South Wales (NSW) Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, recording 
every “authority to dispense” methadone or buprenorphine as opioid replacement therapy, 1985–2006, 
was linked with data from the National Deaths Index, a record of all deaths in Australia. Crude mortality 
rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated according to age, sex, calendar year, period in- or 
out-of-treatment, medication type, previous treatment exposure and cause of death. 
Results: Mortality among 42,676 people entering opioid pharmacotherapy was elevated compared to 
age and sex peers. Drug overdose and trauma were the major contributors. Mortality was higher out of 
treatment, particularly during the ﬁrst weeks, and it was elevated during induction onto methadone but 
not buprenorphine. Mortality during these risky periods changed across time and treatment episodes. 
Overall, mortality was similarly reduced (compared to out-of-treatment) whether patients were receiving 
methadone or buprenorphine. It was estimated that the program produced a 29% reduction in mortality 
across the entire cohort. 
Conclusions: Mortality among treatment-seeking opioid-dependent persons is dynamic across time, 
patient and treatment variables. The comparative reduction in mortality during buprenorphine induction 
may be offset by the increased risk of longer out-of-treatment time periods. Despite periods of elevated 
risk, this large-scale provision of pharmacotherapy is estimated to have resulted in signiﬁcant reductions 
in mortality. 


Illicit opioid use, especially heroin injection, has caused sig- 
niﬁcant personal and public health problems in many countries 
across the globe (United Nations Ofﬁce on Drugs and Crime, 2008). 
Apart from the burden to users, their families and the broader 
community, opioid dependence increases the risk of premature 
mortality (Darke et al., 2006). This elevated risk is concentrated 
across several causes of death: accidental drug overdose, suicide, 
trauma (e.g. motor vehicle accidents, homicide or other injuries), 
and HIV (in countries where HIV is prevalent among people

who inject drugs) (Degenhardt et al., 2004, 2006; Darke et al., 
2006). 
The mainstays of treatment for opioid dependence are pharma- 
cological maintenance on methadone and buprenorphine, both of 
which are listed on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Model 
List of Essential Medicines (World Health Organization, 2005) for 
this indication. Methadone is an orally administered opioid ago- 
nist with a half-life of 24–36 h. Multiple randomized controlled 
trials have found that methadone treatment decreases illicit opi- 
oid use, improves social functioning, decreases offending behaviors 
and improves health (Ward et al., 1998; Mattick et al., 2003). 
The need for supervised daily dosing of methadone in a deﬁned 
treatment setting, and evidence of increase overdose death on 
induction into treatment prompted the search for alternative phar- 
macological treatment options (Mattick et al., 2001). As a partial 
agonist, buprenorphine produces less depression of respiration and 
consciousness than methadone, thereby reducing the overdose risk. 


Buprenorphine is longer acting than methadone, allowing for less 
than daily dosing. 
Opioid pharmacotherapy is not without its own risks (Ward 
et al., 1998), nor does it completely remove the excess mortal- 
ity risks that opioid dependent persons are known to face (Darke 
et al., 2006). Work has shown, for example, high mortality dur- 
ing the period of induction onto methadone (Caplehorn, 1998; 
Buster et al., 2002). More recent work has found that induc- 
tion onto methadone, and cessation, carry elevated mortality risks 
(Caplehorn and Drummer, 1999; Buster et al., 2002; Brugal et al., 
2005). 
The small sample size of these studies has prevented an assess- 
ment of the extent to which these elevated risks are consistent 
across time and/or patient groups. Few existing examinations have 
had sufﬁcient power to examine differences in risk across time and 
patient level variables. Further, these studies have typically focused 
on treatment groups rather than across entire treatment programs. 
No estimates exist of the size of reductions in mortality related to 
treatment for an entire treatment population while also consider- 
ing other important predictors of mortality risk. 
New South Wales (NSW) is the most populous State of Australia, 
with approximately six million residents. It has had an expand- 
ing and expansive opioid replacement program in place for almost 
thirty years. Over 40,000 people have entered treatment since 1985 
(Burns et al., 2009). The size of this entire treatment population 
allows for an examination of important questions of clinical and 
population health interest. The aims of this study were to: 
(i) Estimate overall mortality for all persons entering opioid phar- 
macotherapy between 1985 and 2006, by demographic and 
treatment variables; 
(ii) Examine whether demographic or treatment variables were 
related to mortality levels during and following cessation of 
treatment; 
(iii) Estimate mortality risk, according to speciﬁc causes of death, 
during time within treatment and following cessation of treat- 
ment; 
(iv) Estimate the number of lives that may have been saved by the 
provision of methadone and buprenorphine in NSW over this 
period; 




The NSW Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System (PHDAS) is a database that 
records when an authority to dispense methadone or buprenorphine in NSW as an 
opioid replacement therapy to a particular person has been approved by the NSW 
Health Department. This study examined unit record data from the PHDAS database 
on all persons entering pharmacotherapy treatment between 1985 and 2006. 
Exclusions from the analysis included: those who did not commence treatment; 
those in temporary programs, such interstate clients; and buprenorphine clinical 
trial participants, as they were not necessarily given buprenorphine during the trial. 
There were multiple treatment episodes for many individuals and these were 
sometimes continuous. Previous research using the PHDAS data deﬁned a new 
treatment episode as one coming 7 or more days after a previous episode had ﬁn- 
ished. We adopted this deﬁnition following consultation with experts in clinical 
research and practice (Degenhardt et al., 2005). A change in the medication pre- 
scribed (methadone or buprenorphine) was considered a continuous episode if there 
was less than 7 days between one episode end and the next episode start. 
We adopted the same deﬁnitions – treating the 6 days following a treatment 
program as part of that program – when allocating deaths to in-treatment or out- 
of-treatment time periods. There is a potential bias in this methodology to allocate 
deaths to the treatment period that actually occurred after leaving treatment, but 
any such errors bias in-treatment mortality upwards and out-of-treatment mortal- 
ity downwards, resulting in conservative estimates of mortality reduction during 
treatment. 
All deaths in Australia are coded by expert clinical coders at the Australian Bureau 
of Statistics (ABS) on the basis of information contained in the death certiﬁcate and 
in some cases from coronial ﬁles. For deaths occurring between 1985 and 1996, 
causes of death were coded according to ICD-9 (World Health Organization, 1977). 
For deaths occurring between 1997 and 2006, causes of death were coded using ICD- 
10 codes (World Health Organization, 1993). Only underlying causes were coded in 
the 1985–1996 period, deﬁned as the “disease or injury which initiated the train 
of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or 
violence which produced the fatal injury” (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007); 
but up to 19 contributing causes of death were coded from 1997 onwards. Only 
underlying causes were examined in this study (apart from opioid deaths from 1997 
onwards that were cross-classiﬁed with particular substance codes). These were 
grouped into related conditions according to ICD codes based on published expert 
consensus statements or health department protocols (see Web Appendix 1 and also 
(Randall et al., 2009) for groupings and sources for deﬁnitions). 

Linkage with mortality data from the National Deaths Index was performed by 
staff at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) using an in-house 
probabilistic record linkage program. Variables used for matching purposes included 
full name, date of birth, sex, date and state of last known contact. A linked data set 
was forwarded to the investigators on completion of linkage. 

The crude mortality rates (CMRs) were calculated by summing the person- 
years contributed by each participant, by age, sex, calendar year and treatment 
time period, summing the numbers of deaths by the same groups, and calculat- 
ing a rate per 1000 person-years. Crude rate ratios (RRs) were calculated by dividing 
one mortality rate by another. 
Indirect standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated by dividing the 
observed deaths in the cohort by the expected deaths based on the NSW population 
mortality rates by year, sex and age group. 
In this paper, we have used stratiﬁed analyses of SMRs, which allowed us to 
compare groups, while simultaneously comparing mortality rates against the gen- 
eral population of the same age and sex. We also used Poisson regression to examine 
predictors of mortality during two time periods: 1985–2000 (methadone only used); 
and 2001–2006 (methadone and buprenorphine). The results of these regressions 
have not been included in this paper; the ﬁndings were consistent with the results 
presented in the body of this paper (interested readers can ﬁnd details of the mod- 
els at Web Appendix 2). The observed out-of-treatment CMR was applied to the 
total person-years in the cohort, to provide an estimate of the reductions in mortal- 
ity resulting from the pharmacotherapy program. This assumes that the mortality 
reductions were due to treatment. It is nonetheless a conservative estimate because 
it includes persons who did not die during their ﬁrst (or subsequent) treatment 
episode, hence underestimates the mortality rate among untreated opioid depen- 
dent persons. Estimated numbers of deaths that might have been averted if the 
elevated mortality during induction did not exist were made by applying the CMR 
for the remainder of the treatment period to the total person-years during induc- 
tion (separately for methadone and buprenorphine). Analyses were conducted in 
SAS V9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Stata V9.2 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX, USA). 





Over the study period 42,676 clients entered treatment for a total 
of 425,998 person-years of follow-up (PY; median 9.2 years). The 
median episode length was 198 days, and participants entered into 
an average of 2.5 treatment episodes. Further details of treatment 
retention and re-entry are presented elsewhere (Burns et al., 2009) 
(see also Web Appendix 3). 
During the follow-up period there were 3803 deaths, with an 
overall CMR of 8.9 deaths per 1000 PY (95% CI: 8.6–9.2; Table 1). 
CMRs were higher in males than females, and among older clients. 
The pattern of SMRs was reversed, with a greater excess mortal- 
ity among females, and a greater excess mortality among younger 
clients. Mortality rates (both CMRs and SMRs) increased over time 
until 1995–2000, and fell in 2001–2006 (Table 1, Fig. 1). 
The overall in-treatment SMR was 4.5 (95% CI 4.3, 4.8), com- 
pared with an out-of-treatment SMR of 8.0 (95% CI 7.7, 8.3). The

rate ratio for the out-of-treatment CMR over the in-treatment CMR 
showed signiﬁcantly increased mortality out-of-treatment (RR 1.9, 
95% CI 1.8–2.0, p < .001). Analysis of mortality by time in treatment 
revealed that the highest mortality risk was during the ﬁrst week, 
with 39.5 deaths per 1000 years of follow up (95% CI 31.6, 48.8), 35.4 
times those expected in the general population of the same age and 
sex (95% CI 28.3, 43.7). Mortality dropped sharply during the second 
treatment week, and was signiﬁcantly lower for the remainder of 
the treatment period compared with the second week (5.6 deaths 
per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 5.2, 5.9; rate ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 
0.23–0.47, p < .001). The latter rate was still four times higher than 
that in the general population (SMR 4.1, 95% CI 3.9, 4.4). Compar- 
ison of in-treatment mortality levels among clients entering the 
program from 2001 onwards prescribed methadone and buprenor- 
phine in the 2001–2006 period revealed no signiﬁcant differences 
between the two (RR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.50–1.42, p = .552), and there was 
no difference in the overall SMR for those ﬁrst given methadone (7.3, 
95% CI, 6.2–8.6) in comparison with those ﬁrst give buprenorphine 
(7.3, 95% CI, 5.8–9.0) from 2001 to 2006 (Table 1). 

A number of interactions existed between treatment variables 
and mortality risk. The analysis comparing induction on buprenor- 
phine and methadone was restricted to those who entered the 
program from 2001 onwards. Only one death was estimated to

have occurred during induction onto buprenorphine (CMR 2.5; 
95% CI: 0.1–13.7); whereas the CMR for those being inducted onto 
methadone during 2001–2006 was 26.3 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 
13.6–45.9) (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.002–0.63, p = .004). The majority of 
induction deaths occurred in the ﬁrst two episodes (one out of one 
for buprenorphine and six out of seven for methadone). No signif- 
icant differences in mortality risk existed immediately following 
cessation of buprenorphine versus methadone (RR 5.60, 95% CI: 
0.63–264.75, p = .096) (Web Appendix 4). 
The excess mortality seen in the ﬁrst two weeks of treatment 
from 1985 to 2006 was strongly related to prior treatment expo- 
sure: during the ﬁrst treatment episode, the SMR during the two 
week induction period was 36.5 (95% CI 27.9, 46.9), but it decreased 
with successive episodes to 10.0 (95% CI: 3.7, 21.7; Fig. 2; see also 
Web Web Appendix 4) for a client entering their sixth (or later) 
treatment episode. This was a signiﬁcant trend in the SMRs (RR 
0.73, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.84, p < .001). Mortality during treatment over- 
all, however, was unrelated to prior treatment exposure (RR 1.00, 
95% CI: 0.96, 1.04, p = .971; Fig. 2a). Mortality in the two weeks fol- 
lowing cessation of treatment was no different depending on the 
number of prior treatment episodes (RR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.12, 
p = 0.450; Fig. 2b). 
Mortality risk during treatment induction was associated with 
calendar year (Fig. 3a) with the highest risk in the 1990–1994 
period, where the SMR was 52.9 (95% CI: 37.6, 72.3). The excess mor- 
tality decreased over time, to 16.5 (95% CI: 10.9, 24.0) in 2001–2006. 
Mortality immediately following treatment cessation was con- 
sistently elevated across time compared to the general population. 
Overall, the excess mortality was highest for those out of treatment 
during the 1995–2000 period (Fig. 3b). 

The lower average mortality observed during treatment was 
found in a limited number of causes of death (Fig. 4a). The in- 
treatment period was associated with lower mortality from opioid 
and other drug overdoses, and deaths due to unintentional injury 
and suicide (Fig. 4a; see also Web Appendix 5). HIV was an uncom- 
mon cause of death among the cohort, whether in or out of 
treatment. 
The interaction between treatment period and mortality 
reﬂected the effects of speciﬁc causes of death. During the ﬁrst two 
weeks in treatment, mortality due to opioids and other drugs and 
unintentional injury and suicide, were all at much higher levels than 
those seen for any other period (in or out of treatment) (Fig. 4b). The 
mortality risk for these same causes was markedly elevated in the 
ﬁrst two weeks out of treatment. 


Applying the overall out-of-treatment mortality rate (11.5/1000 
PYs) to the total person-years (425,998), it was estimated that 1111 
additional deaths would have occurred during the study period if 
the treatment programme, as implemented, had not existed, an 
increase in 29% in overall mortality among this group. 
Estimates were also made of the number of deaths that might 
have been averted if the risk during induction (28.6/1000 PYs) was

the same as that during the remainder of treatment (5.6/1000 PYs). 
With no elevated risk during induction, then 121 deaths observed 
during induction might have been reduced to 24, 97 fewer deaths 
across the entire study period. 

This is one of the largest and longest follow up studies of 
persons receiving opioid pharmacotherapy for illicit opioid depen- 
dence. Data were examined on over 40,000 treatment entrants 
across a large State-based program for whom patterns of entry 
and departure from treatment were tracked. Time in treatment was 
associated with lower mortality than time out of treatment, with 
an overall in-treatment SMR of 4.5 (95% CI 4.3, 4.8), compared to an 
out-of-treatment SMR of 8.0 (95% CI 7.7, 8.3) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.8–2.0, 
p < .001). 
The large sample size provided the necessary statistical power 
to conﬁrm previous observations that induction onto methadone 
and the ﬁrst fortnight following cessation of buprenorphine or 
methadone treatment are particularly risky periods. These eleva- 
tions in risk varied over time and treatment exposures. Increased 
prior treatment episodes were associated with reduced risk dur- 
ing induction. The calendar period with the highest mortality risk 
during induction was 1990–1994 consistent with previous ﬁnd- 
ings (Caplehorn, 1998), with later reductions reﬂecting changes 
in methadone dosing policies. Post-treatment mortality was high- 
est between 1995 and 2000 when heroin availability and purity 
were at their historically highest levels in NSW (Degenhardt 
and Day, 2004; Day et al., 2006). The decline in SMRs during 
methadone induction with increasing treatment episodes may 
reﬂect selection effects, with those at highest risking dying ear- 
lier. 
The continued elevated mortality risk during induction onto 
methadone to the end of the study period suggests that despite the 
adoption of dosing policies to reduce risk, more concerted efforts 
are needed to minimise these risks. 
There are more complex issues for buprenorphine clients. Previ- 
ous analyses ﬁnding they are less likely to be retained in treatment 
than methadone clients, and more likely to cycle in and out of treat- 
ment and switch between medications (Burns et al., 2009). This is of 
concern given that the period after cessation was equally risky for 
buprenorphine and methadone clients. The consequence is that any 
reduction in mortality risk during induction to buprenorphine may 
be offset by an increased mortality due to longer post-treatment 
periods. There is a clear need to investigate options to increase 
retention in buprenorphine treatment, which may include review 
of dosing levels since inadequate levels have been associated with 
poorer retention in treatment. 
The causes of premature mortality were related to treatment 
stage. The reductions in risk during treatment were greatest for 
drug-induced deaths, suicide and traumatic deaths. These are the 
most common causes of mortality among opioid dependent per- 
sons (Darke et al., 2006); they are also fairly directly related to 
patterns of drug use, poor mental health, and high risk behaviors 
among those with illicit drug dependence. The fact that HIV mortal- 
ity was low among this cohort reﬂects the sustained low prevalence 
of HIV among people who inject drugs in Australia (National Centre 
in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 2007). This, in turn, is 
linked to the early introduction of Needle and Syringe Programs 
(NSPs) and the expansion of the methadone program during the 
mid 1980s when HIV was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Australia. The ﬂuctu- 
ations in mortality rate in and out of treatment could also reﬂect 
changes in the heroin market in NSW during the period: mortal- 
ity increased when heroin availability increased during the 1990s, 
and decreased when supply contracted after 2001 (Degenhardt and 
Day, 2004; Day et al., 2006). 

The observed reductions in mortality during treatment, if they 
can be entirely attributed to treatment, were clinically important 
and of population health signiﬁcance. At the population level, the 
treatment program averted an additional 1111 deaths during the 
study period. This would have represented a 29% increase in the 
observed mortality rate. 
Despite reductions in the mortality risk in the induction period 
for methadone from the peak in 1990–1994, the ﬁrst two weeks of 
treatment still has an unacceptably elevated mortality risk. Preven- 
tive interventions are needed during induction onto methadone, 
particularly for ﬁrst-time entrants to treatment. These need to 
address mental health problems, polydrug use, methadone dose, 
and lifestyle more generally. 
Although buprenorphine did not have the elevated risk in the 
induction period, the overall treatment mortality levels were not 
signiﬁcantly different for those in buprenorphine and methadone 
treatment. In addition, those who entered buprenorphine were 
retained for shorter periods, and more likely to cycle in and out 
of treatment (Burns et al., 2009), leading to more time spent in 
periods with a higher mortality risk. Overall, those who started in 
buprenorphine had exactly the same standardized mortality ratio 
as those who started in methadone, from 2001 onwards. Interven- 
tions to increase retention in buprenorphine are also important 
given the mortality risks faced by those who leave treatment prior 
to completion. 
Interventions are needed to reduce the risks of relapse to drug 
use and suicide risk at treatment cessation. This is particularly 


true among those who have cycled repeatedly in and out of treat- 
ment. 


In this study, we have compared mortality in- and out-of- 
treatment. It could be argued that mortality in treatment is lower 
because the people who stay in treatment are more stable than 
those who drop out. We doubt that this explains the difference, 
for three reasons. First, our ﬁndings are consistent with evidence 
from randomised controlled trials ﬁnding that opioid substitution 
treatment reduces mortality (Mattick et al., 2003). Second, in our 
study all comparisons involve people who chose to enter treatment 
at some point; we did not compare mortality with dependent users 
who choose not to seek treatment. We have made no assumptions 
about mortality reductions compared to opioid-dependent persons 
who never seek treatment. Third, the elevated causes of mortality 
during induction and following cessation, were those that opioid 
maintenance treatment is most likely to affect i.e. those reﬂecting 
the risks of a generally more chaotic and dependent illicit drug using 
lifestyle, such as drug overdose, accidents and suicides. 
It is possible that the out of treatment mortality levels we doc- 
umented are lower than the rates seen prior to treatment entry, or 
among those who never enter treatment. If this is true, this would 
reduce the observed difference between in- and out-of-treatment 
mortality, making our assessment of the mortality reduction in 
treatment conservative. 

Mortality among opioid dependent people entering opioid phar- 
macotherapy is elevated compared to age and sex peers, with 
overdose, external causes and suicide the major contributors. This 
elevated mortality is higher when out of treatment (i.e. treatment 
reduces mortality), and it is particularly elevated during the ﬁrst 
weeks out of treatment. The elevation in mortality varied in ways 
that probably reﬂect heroin availability and use. Mortality was 
highest during induction onto methadone. This varied over time, 
most likely reﬂecting changing policies on dosing during induc- 
tion. Finally, this study found that mortality was equivalent whether 
patients were receiving methadone or buprenorphine. This ﬁnding 
suggests that the comparatively lower mortality during induction 
for buprenorphine may be offset by the increased risk of mortality 
during more frequent episodes of treatment entry and cessation 
that characterise buprenorphine clients.
