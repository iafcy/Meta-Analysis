Aims—To examine mortality rates and causes of death among a cohort of substance-using 
mothers and to identify risk factors that predict mortality. 
Design, setting, participants—This is a prospective study of a cohort of 4,447 substance- 
using mothers (pregnant or parenting) who were enrolled during 2000 to 2002 in 40 drug abuse 
treatment programs across California. 
Methods—All mothers were assessed at baseline using the Addiction Severity Index. Mortality 
data were obtained from the National Death Index and causes of death were coded using ICD-10. 
Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated relative to women in the general population 
adjusted for age. Proportional hazard (Cox) regression was used to identify risk factors predicting 
death. 
Results—By the end of 2010, 194 deaths were confirmed, corresponding to a crude mortality 
rate of 4.47 per 1000 person-years and SMR of 8.4 (95% CI=7.2–9.6). Drug overdose (28.8%), 
cardiovascular disease (10%), and alcohol or drug disorders (8.9%) were the leading causes of 
death. Baseline factors associated with higher mortality included older age, being white (relative 
to African American or Hispanic), heroin, alcohol, cocaine, or marijuana (relative to 
methamphetamine) as the primary drug problem, drug injection, and greater severity of 
employment, medical/health, and psychiatric problems. 
Conclusions—Substance-using mothers have 8.4 times the mortality than that observed among 
US women of similar age. Greater severity of employment, medical/health, and psychiatric 
problems contributed to the elevated mortality. 



Women account for more than 30% of substance abuse treatment admissions nationwide [1]. 
Research in the past 20 years has revealed considerable gender differences in substance 
abuse behaviors and treatment needs. Compared with substance-dependent men, substance- 
dependent women are more likely to have coexisting psychiatric problems, lower self- 
esteem, and extensive histories of traumatic life events and experiences, including sexual 
and physical abuse [2–6]. Most substance-dependent women have limited education, are

unemployed, and rely on public assistance. Drug use by these women is often initiated by 
their male partners [7–9] and the women frequently continue to use drugs to cope with 
abusive relationships and other life stressors [9–11]. Most women in substance abuse 
treatment are of childbearing age. Many women have children and are typically the primary 
childcare provider [12–15]. Thus, pregnant or parenting women face additional challenges 
associated with child rearing and parenting. Few studies, however, have examined long-term 
outcomes among these women. Based on a large cohort of substance-using mothers 
prospectively followed for 10 years, this article focuses on long-term mortality, the most 
severe potential consequence of drug and alcohol use. 

It is well known that substance abusers suffer from high mortality, generally 3 to 14 times 
higher than in the general population of the same age [16–18]. Many studies have assessed 
short-term (less than 12 months) survival outcomes following treatment and these studies 
have shown that drug-users are at greatest risk of fatal overdose in the 4 weeks after 
discharge from treatment or imprisonment [19, 22]. The elevated risk during this immediate 
period following release is largely explained by a decline in drug tolerance, poly-substance 
abuse, and the failure to properly identify those at risk. 
Longer term mortality studies of drug abusers have been conducted in many countries, 
mostly based on registry records [20]. Most of these studies, focusing on opiate users, 
reported that overdose is the most prevalent cause of death (Australia, Italy, Sweden, U.S.), 
followed by AIDS (Italy, Sweden). A recent article [21] reported the results of a systematic 
review of mortality among cocaine abusers. The article reported crude mortality rates ranged 
from 0.53 to 6.16 per 100 person-year and standard mortality ratios (SMRs) of 4 to 8 times 
higher than age and gender peers in the general population. Few studies have included users 
of other drug types, but there is some evidence that the risk is lower for amphetamine- 
related mortality than for opiate-related mortality among drug users in Australia [17]. In 
contrast, a study [18] conducted in Stockholm found that the SMR was quite similar for 
opiate and amphetamine abusers (3.0 and 3.5, respectively). 
The majority of these existing studies are based on registries of poisonings, overdose, or 
post mortem toxicology, a practice that is likely to underestimate drug-related mortality 
rates. For example, many causes of death among drug users are not due to acute 
intoxication, but are often directly or indirectly related to drug use [22]. These studies 
usually have limited data on risk factors for mortality [22–24]. Few prospective long-term 
follow-up studies on mortality are available and even fewer include women, or report 
mortality separately for women. The few exceptions include the Stockholm study [18] that 
used registry records to track 1,705 illicit drug users over 37 years. A higher proportion of 
male than female drug abusers died, but the age- and gender-specific mortality rates were 
higher in women, mainly due to lower mortality of women than men in the general 
population [22]. A recent study conducted in Australia followed a cohort of 615 heroin users 
over the period 2001–2009, reporting a crude mortality rate of 6.43 per 1000 person years, 
with no gender difference, and the SMR was 4.56 (males=2.95, females=18.57) [25]. There 
are few studies of mortality among female drug users despite higher SMRs, few cohort 
studies have directly compared mortality rates across drug classes, and studies to date have 
included limited measures of risk factors. The present study takes advantage of a large 
cohort of substance-abusing mothers followed for 8 to 10 years since their admission to drug 
treatment programs in California, and describes their pattern of mortality and related risk 
factors. 
This article presents findings from a study including approximately 4,500 pregnant or 
parenting women assessed at treatment admission between 2000 and 2002, and analyzes 



their mortality data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 
2010 to identify the major causes of mortality and the risk factors at baseline that are 
predictive of death. Given the scarcity of data assessing drug-related mortality among 
women with histories of substance abuse, and the limitation of short-term observations, the 
study findings add vital information to the knowledge base regarding survival measures for 
women with substance abuse problems. 



The study sample includes 4,447 women who were admitted to 40 drug-treatment programs 
through the California Treatment Outcome Project (CalTOP) as part of the national 
Treatment Outcomes and Performance Pilot Studies [26–27]. CalTOP was conducted in 43 
programs (3 programs were men-only) in 13 counties of California, covering wide 
geographic locations (e.g., the northern, central, and southern regions of California) and 
including both urban and rural areas. The 40 programs that served women were classified as 
mixed-gender and women-only based on a program survey completed for each program 
[28]. This cohort consisted of pregnant or parenting women (i.e., women parenting 
dependent children or children under age 18) who were assessed at treatment program 
admission between 2000 and 2002. The State of California and UCLA Institutional Review 
Boards reviewed and approved all study procedures. 
Death and Causes of Death—Death certificates were obtained from the National Death 
Index, which contains records of death in the United States from 1979 through 2008, 
maintained by the CDC. Causes of death were coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD, 10th revision). Deaths were grouped into the following 
categories: drug overdose (both unintentional and intentional), cancer, liver disease, 
cardiovascular disease, alcohol/drug disorder, respiratory disease, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, 
other infectious disease, suicide, homicide, motor vehicle accident, and all other causes. 
Suicide deaths due to drug overdose were included in the drug overdose category, an 
approach that has been applied in the applicable literature. 
Recent deaths (after 2008) were searched on the web-based National Death Register, which 
provides the date of death but not the cause of death. Thus, for all-cause mortality the date of 
death was available for all 194 deaths by the end of 2010, and for cause-specific mortality, 
cause of death was available for 180 deaths which occurred before the end of 2008. 
Addiction Severity Index (ASI) [29]—The ASI is a structured interview that assesses 
problem severity in seven areas: alcohol use, drug use, employment, family and social 
relationships, legal, medical status, and mental health. A composite score was computed for 
each of the scales to indicate severity in that area; the range of scores is 0 to 1 with higher 
scores indicating greater problem severity. Also examined were individual ASI items on 
demographic characteristics, primary drug problem, and background histories of drug use 
and treatment, physical and sexual abuse, criminal involvement, and psychiatric symptoms. 
The ASI is the most commonly used instrument in the substance abuse field with 
demonstrated psychometric validity and reliability for assessing problem severity in diverse 
populations. ASI was administered at baseline. 
Mental Health Diagnoses—Information regarding mental health diagnoses was obtained 
from the California Department of Mental Health (DMH). DMH maintains the Client and 
Service Information (CSI), a database with psychiatric diagnoses and 3 years of service 



records for clients treated in mental health facilities that received DMH funds. DMH records 
for all CalTOP clients were requested, and therefore psychiatric diagnoses were available for 
those clients who had DMH records. 

The crude death rate was expressed as the number of deaths per 1000 person-years. These 
rates were determined using time of death or follow-up (the end of 2010), whichever came 
first. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
used to compare the overall mortality of substance-using mothers with women of the same 
age in the general US population. Proportional hazard (Cox) regression was used to 
investigate predictors of time to death since baseline (i.e., intake into the CalTOP study and 
index treatment). Selection of variables for inclusion in the model was informed by the 
extant literature and also by descriptive analyses of demographic and background 
characteristics. Several items measured similar constructs and were also highly correlated 
and thus to minimize potential problems due to multicollinearity, only one item was chosen 
for model inclusion. Chi-square or t-tests were used to compare characteristics at baseline 
between alive and deceased women. 


There were 194 confirmed deaths (4.39% of the total sample of 4,447) over the 8- to 10-year 
follow-up period, which corresponds to a crude mortality rate of 4.47 per 1,000 person- 
years. The SMR was 8.4 (95% CI 7.2–9.6), representing a more than eightfold increase of 
morality risk compared to women of a similar age in the general population. The mean age 
of these women at death was 41.6 (SD=7.4). 
Of the 180 with death certificates, the most common cause of death was drug overdose (52 
cases, or 28.8%), followed by cardiovascular disease (10.0%), alcohol/drug disorders 
(8.9%), cancer (8.3%), liver disease and motor vehicle accidents (6.1% each), and homicide 
(4.4%). Additionally, there were 2 deaths due to hepatitis and 4 deaths due to HIV/AIDS. 
Included in the 52 deaths attributed to drug overdose were 42 casualties due to accidental 
poisoning and drug exposure, as well as 5 intentional drug-related suicides and 5 deaths due 
to undetermined intent. In contrast, deaths caused by alcohol/drug disorders were mostly 
related to mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol or psychoactive substance use. 

We compared baseline characteristics between alive and deceased women (Table 1). The 
mean age at baseline for the deceased women was significantly older than that of the 
surviving women (37.2±7.1 versus 32.8±7.5, p<0.01). Compared to those still living, more 
white and fewer Hispanic women were deceased. Those who died were more likely to have 
some college education, less likely to have been married, and more likely to have fewer 
children and to have been receiving public assistance. 
Relative to the group of surviving women, women in the deceased group were more likely to 
have reported primary drug problem to be alcohol (35.8% vs. 20.7%), heroin (27.5% vs. 
13.1%), and cocaine (14.0% vs. 11.4%), and less likely to be methamphetamine (14.5% vs. 
42.5%) or marijuana (6.7% vs. 10.0%). Deceased women also had used the reported primary 
drug significantly longer (18.5±9.0 years) than those still living (14.7±8.0). More deceased 
women had used drugs by injection (36.6% vs. 20.7%), and deceased women also had 
reported significantly more prior treatments for alcohol (1.76 vs. 0.77) and for drugs (3.32 



vs. 1.73) than surviving women. There was no difference between the two groups of women 
with regard to the program type (i.e., mixed-gender or women-only) of the initial treatment 
under the CalTOP project. 
At baseline, women in the deceased group had statistically higher ASI severity scores with 
respect to alcohol, employment, family, medical, and psychiatric problems (See Table 2). 
Despite comparable rates of criminality and legal system involvement, the deceased sample 
had a greater rate of psychiatric medication use in the past 30 days (23.7 versus 17.7, 
p<0.01) with clinically apparent symptoms including depression, anxiety, and 
hallucinations. Prior history of psychiatric treatment consisting of both inpatient and 
outpatient services was also significantly higher in the deceased group. Based on the DMH 
records concerning psychiatric diagnoses, relative to the alive, the deceased sample 
demonstrated a significantly higher percent of depressive disorder (14.3% vs. 19.6%, p< 
0.05) and bipolar disorder (6.0% vs. 9.8%, p< 0.05). 

In addition to demographics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and martial status), we considered 
drug-related factors (e.g., primary drug type, drug injection) and ASI problem severity in 
seven domains, and simultaneously tested the predicting values for mortality using a Cox 
proportional hazard model. The results (see Table 3) showed that older age, drug type (i.e., 
heroin, alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, relative to methamphetamine), drug injection, and 
greater severity of employment, medical, and psychiatric problems were all related to high 
risk of mortality. On the other hand, racial/ethnic minorities, including African American 
and Hispanic women, had a lower mortality risk (Hazard Ratios of 0.59 and 0.66, 
respectively) relative to white women. 

The study demonstrates that risk of death increased eightfold among the substance-using 
sample of women compared with those in the general population. Even though the crude 
mortality of 4.47 per 1000 person-years appears to be at the low end of mortality rates 
reported in the literature, the SMR observed in this study indicates an increase of 8.4 times 
the mortality observed among US women of similar ages. These women died at a relatively 
young age (mean of 41.6), and many of these deaths (e.g., overdose, drug and alcohol 
disorder) may have been preventable. 
The limited number of suicides, a major cause of death for drug users, among this sample is 
surprising (although 5 drug-related suicide deaths and 5 with undetermined intent were 
classified under overdose category). In general, men are at 3 times the hazard of drug-caused 
death compared to women [30]. Also, while women attempt suicide more often than men, 
men are more likely to succeed [31]. In addition, pregnant women are at a significantly 
lower suicide risk than women of childbearing age who are not pregnant [32]. Although 
postpartum depression is associated with a higher than normal suicide rate, motherhood may 
protect against suicide [33]. 
An important and unique contribution of the present study is the examination of a 
comprehensive set of potential risk factors. In addition to demographics, the study identified 
baseline predictors of mortality in key areas of life domains (e.g., primary drug, 
employment, medical problems, psychiatric problems) that have not been simultaneously 
examined in previous research. Baseline predictors are of potentially great clinical 
importance as they can be taken into consideration in treatment delivery [25]. 



Compared to surviving women, deceased women were generally older, of ethnic majority 
(white), and had higher educational levels. Adverse health outcomes are generally associated 
with a lower socio-economic status and racial/ethnic minority status [34–37]. It is unclear 
why this general pattern was not apparent in the present sample, which should be examined 
in future studies. 
More deceased women reported their primary drug type being heroin, alcohol, or cocaine 
(but less methamphetamine), and used drugs by injection. These women also used the 
primary drug for more years, and had greater numbers of prior alcohol or drug treatments. 
The finding of elevated risks for mortality associated with heroin use (HR=3.62) and 
injection behavior (HR=1.55), relative to methamphetamine use is consistent with the 
literature. Notably, however, a similar elevated mortality risk was also observed with 
alcohol (HR=3.76), cocaine (HR=3.56), and even marijuana (HR=2.45). Yet prevailing 
perceptions among the general public have been that alcohol and marijuana are relatively 
“harmless” drugs compared to other drug types. A cautionary note regarding causal 
attributions to particular drug classes is warranted given that polydrug use is common 
among such samples. Nevertheless, few studies have examined cause-specific mortality 
across drug classes. Among the few that compared across drugs, none included illegal drugs 
and alcohol, nor provided specific findings on women. Thus, while this last finding is 
somewhat surprising, future research is needed to confirm or replicate. 
A novel study finding is that the elevated mortality risk associated with employment and 
psychiatric problems among these women is of consequence. Only 18.6% to 22.5% of these 
substance-using women were employed at treatment admission, and the group of deceased 
women further reported significantly greater employment problem severity than the group of 
surviving women. Research indicates that employment not only contributes to the 
accumulation of social capital [38–41] and perceived quality of life [42–43], but it can also 
enhance physical and mental well-being and overall quality of life [44–50]. The absence of 
employment, and its attendant benefits, in the lives of these women may be a significant 
underlying determinant of premature mortality. 
More deceased women reported various psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, or 
hallucinations), and also received more inpatient psychiatric treatment previously. The 
DHM records also showed that the deceased sample demonstrated a significantly higher 
percent of depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (although these disorders were not 
significant when they were considered in the multivariate analyses). These women could 
have used drugs and alcohol to cope with their problems and stress, which either led to 
overdose (including intentional drug-related suicides) or compromised health leading to 
eventual death. Differential exposure to chronic and acute stressors over the life course may 
contribute to “stress proliferation” [51], a process that places those exposed to serious 
adversity at risk for later exposure to additional adversities. Such stress proliferation is 
thought to contribute to inequalities in health outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that 
stressful life experiences and exposures result in “biological signatures” and that add up and 
“get under the skin” [52], resulting in increased morbidity and mortality [53]. The group of 
deceased women had been served by treatment systems several times yet still encountered 
premature death. Providers who serve substance-using women should pay special attention 
to the unique needs of women in order to help them avoid premature death. 
Our sample of deceased women died at young ages. There are adverse collateral 
consequences of their premature death related to welfare of the minor children they left 
behind. Studies have shown that children remaining from sudden death of a parent are at risk 
for psychological problems and future problem behaviors [54–55]. They are also likely to be 



left in the care of family or foster system – where a multitude of problems exist within those 
systems compounding their grief and loss [56]. 
Strengths of this study include the large, ethnically diverse sample size, and the use of 
community-based treatment seekers. The inclusion of numerous treatment programs across 
California also increases the ability to generalize of our findings. It is important to note that 
the counties and treatment programs that participated in CalTOP were not randomly 
selected. However, we do not believe this has any significant bearing on our findings as our 
sample characteristics resemble those of the statewide treatment population in terms of 
ethnicity, age, employment status, primary drug type, and legal status [26]. 
In conclusion, the present study provides vital information regarding mortality risk factors 
for women substance-users. Despite increasing awareness, mortality rates from unintentional 
poisoning (due to both prescription and illegal drugs) continue to rise in the U.S. Between 
1999 and 2006, death due to accidental poisoning increased 108.5% while intentional and 
undetermined death rates remained stable [57]. Data from CDC projects report that accidents 
(unintentional injury) and suicide (intentional self-harm) are the 5th and 11th overall leading 
causes of death, respectively [58]. Poisoning, or drug overdose, contributes largely to these 
statistics, representing the greatest number of non-transport accidents and is positively 
associated with rates of suicides [58–59]. Although the quick rise in deaths due to 
unintentional poisonings was higher in men, the increase in overall rate was greater amongst 
women [60]. Consistent with these reports, the present study findings demonstrate that 
mortality is an especially troublesome problem for pregnant and parenting mothers who 
have substance use problems. Furthermore, the study reveals the importance of addressing 
the multiple problems faced by substance-using mothers. Addressing these women’s 
problems and risks, particularly in terms of employment, health, and psychiatric health, 
could prevent many premature deaths.
