Substance abuse and psychiatric co-morbidity as 
predictors of premature mortality in Swedish 
drug abusers a prospective longitudinal study 
1970 - 2006 
Anna Nyhlén1, Mats Fridell2*, Martin Bäckström3, Morten Hesse4 and Peter Krantz5 

Background: Few longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric 
disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug 
related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/ 
hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades. 
Methods: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit 
January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, 
substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death 
were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the 
incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing 
risks Cox regression analysis. 
Results: Of 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 
patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 
years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, 
male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an 
increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a 
decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while 
chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of 
non drug related death. 
Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related 
premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety 
disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in 
opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any 
impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death.

Background 
Drug abusers have an increased risk of premature mor- 
tality which is influenced by a number of factors, includ- 
ing types of substances used, patterns of administration, 
risk behavior, contracted infectious diseases, gender, age 
and life style. 
During the period when the studied cohort entered 
treatment amphetamine was the single most common 
substance of abuse in Sweden nationally as well as in 
the local area, where 35-45% of the drug abusers had 
amphetamine as the most prevalent substance of abuse 
[1,2]. However, in the 1970s substance use patterns in 
Sweden changed from a predominance of amphetamine 
abuse to include the abuse of opiates as well as other 
substances [2]. Most studies report higher mortality for 
opiate users than for other substance users [3-7], but a 
few studies have found lower mortality rates among the 
former [8]. The standardized mortality ratio [SMR] in 
more recent studies is still higher in groups that do not 
receive opiate agonist treatment such as methadone, 
buprenorphine or other opioids [7,9-12]. 
Overdose is a major cause of death among opiate- 
dependent patients. About 0.7% of opiate dependent 
users die every year from an overdose [13]. Several stu- 
dies of clinical samples have reported that 35-40% of all 
deaths in opiate users are overdoses [3,14-18]. Unlike 
opiates, cocaine and amphetamine are seldom direct 
causes of death [13]. Still, stimulant use has been asso- 
ciated with increased mortality, either due to lifestyle 
factors indirectly associated with stimulant use, such as 
violent behavior or violent deaths, or with diseases 
acquired through intravenous administration [19]. A 
recent epidemiological study of a cohort of 100,000 sub- 
stance users of amphetamine/methamphetamine and 
ecstasy in England and Wales 1997-2007 identified an 
increasing number of amphetamine deaths from 30 to 
70 over this period of ten years [20]. 
Cannabis, on the other hand, is the most common 
substance worldwide, used by as many as 166 million 
people per year, but few studies have to our knowledge 
evaluated mortality associated with cannabis [21]. We 
know of no studies that have examined the particular 
long-term risks of death associated with cannabis use in 
clinical samples of substance dependent patients. 
Influence of psychiatric disorders 
The impact of psychiatric disorders on premature mor- 
tality in substance abusers has only recently been recog- 
nized as an important issue. A few prospective studies 
have suggested that some psychiatric disorders may con- 
tribute to premature death in drug abusers (15). In a 
Swedish cohort study of drug abusers, low levels of psy- 
cho-social functioning measured by Global Assessment 
of Functioning (GAF) and a high level of psychiatric 
symptoms assessed by Symptom Checklist 90 (GSI) at 
the 5-year follow-up, predicted mortality at the 15-year 
follow-up, whereas abstinence did not [22]. The most 
prevalent personality disorder in drug abusers; anti- 
social personality disorder, was not associated with a 
higher level of premature death [19,22]. 
Aims of the study 
To identify predictors of increased risk of drug related 
death and non drug related death within a cohort based 
on broadly defined psychiatric groups and substance use 
of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hal- 
lucinogens and alcohol over several decades. 
Methods 
Setting and subjects 
The setting was an inpatient detoxification and short- 
term rehabilitation unit. The ward was a typical low 
threshold unit of the period, accepting all drug abusing 
patients seeking treatment but only to a minor extent 
patients with alcohol dependence. The catchment area 
for the unit was the entire county of Scania in southern 
Sweden with a population of 977,783 people in 1970, 
and of 1,126,606 in 2000. Southern Sweden is an urban 
area which in the early 1970s had a low rate of unem- 
ployment (5%) which increased to 11% during the obser- 
vation period. 
A national case-finding study estimated that the num- 
ber of heavy drug abusers in the southern region having 
a daily intake of illegal drugs was around 1500 - 2000 
persons in 1978, of which 1500 (75%) were injection 
drug users [23]. 
All patients admitted to the detoxification unit January 
1970 to February 1978 were included in the cohort. The 
admission was completed only after the patient had had 
a formal somatic and psychiatric screening and had 
completed the intake procedures with laboratory speci- 
mens. The cohort was followed up through the Swedish 
Central Person Register, death certificates and autopsy 
reports were obtained for all subjects who died before 
2007, and causes of death were analyzed. For this study 
all causes of death were coded according to ICD-10, 
based on autopsy reports or, in a few cases, death certi- 
ficates in addition to hospital records. The study was 
approved by the Ethical Committee of Lund University 
(LU 22/1983 and Dnr 587/2005). 
Assessment at first admission and at follow up 
Substance type and other drugs including alcohol were 
identified with interviews and validated by mandatory 
urine samples. Demographic data, types of substances 
used and psychiatric diagnoses were collected in a stan- 
dardized manner. Standardized clinical interviews (SWE- 
DATE) and hospital records contained background data 
Nyhlén et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:122 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/122 

and mandatory information on length and intensity of 
substance abuse by mode of administration [24]. At 
intake all patients received an identification number and 
gave verbal consent for participating in the study upon 
completing the admission routines. All patients were 
evaluated by the senior consultant of psychiatry at the 
detoxification ward. A clinical psychologist provided 
additional psychological assessment. Patients with psy- 
chosis were evaluated both at the detoxification unit 
and independently by an external consultant in psychia- 
try at a special psychosis unit in the same hospital. A 
formal diagnosis of psychosis demanded two or more 
treatment admissions or a longer observation period in 
the unit before a final diagnosis was issued. 
The ICD-8 diagnoses were filed at discharge: The psy- 
chiatric disorders are in this presentation categorized 
into three broad groups represented as dummy vari- 
ables: psychosis, neurosis and personality disorder. The 
neurosis category included depression (minor and major 
without psychotic symptoms), and anxiety disorders and 
a few cases of phobias. The personality disorders were 
anti-social, hysterical and infantile. For the present ana- 
lysis drug use was re-coded into dichotomous variables, 
with 0 representing no use and 1 representing regular 
use for each drug on a daily basis, or a minimum of 
three days a week, for at least 12 months. 
Coding and identifying causes of death 
In the follow-up study the patients’ national identifica- 
tion numbers were linked to the Swedish Central Per- 
son Register and the Causes of Death Register. The 
coverage of deaths in the Swedish Central Bureau of 
Statistics (SCB) registers is close to 100%. SCB codes 
causes of death are based upon death certificates, 
which are issued but not coded by physicians and/or 
coroners. All causes of death in the cohort were coded 
(ICD-10) by a senior consultant physician (A.N.) and 
an associate professor of forensic medicine (P.K.). The 
causes of death diagnoses issued by the coroner were 
never changed by the researchers. The diagnoses from 
the forensic autopsy protocols, including toxicology 
tests, as well as the death certificates were coded 
according to ICD-10. ICD codes permit classification 
of death causes according to the rules specified in the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, published by WHO [25]. 
ICD-10 provides improved coding possibilities for 
many drugs compared to previous versions of ICD. 
The first one hundred causes of death were coded 
independently (by A.N and P.K). For this study, deaths 
were classified as either drug related or non drug 
related as defined below. The reliability was good ((cid:1) = 
.98). Only 12 out of 204 ratings differed. The final cod- 
ing used in the analysis was always based on a mutual 
agreement between the two raters. 
1. Drug related death 
Our definition of drug related death used is the one 
adopted by Bargagli [26] and Degenhardt [13]. Drug 
related death both refers to those cases where the 
underlying cause of death is directly associated with illi- 
cit substance use, sometimes in combination with licit 
drugs according to death certificates and/or autopsy 
protocols, and those cases when substance use disorder 
was listed as a contributingcause of death. Preset rules 
(a manual of coding) determined if death was drug 
related. The decision was based on the total amount of 
data present: hospital records, police reports and cor- 
oners’ evaluation including toxicology reports, which 
always took precedence over other documents. 
2. Non drug-related death 
Non drug related death was classified as such if death 
was caused by somatic diseases or by accidents, suicide 
or other violent deaths without illicit or/and licit drugs 
or alcohol being involved in the death. 
Statistical analysis 
The data were subjected to a competing risks Cox 
regression to analyze the incidence of drug related pre- 
mature deaths and non drug related deaths with impor- 
tant covariates. Competing risks procedures make it 
possible to estimate the likelihood of an incidence when 
other incidences take place that alter the probability of 
the event of interest. The significance of the covariates 
is reported, as well as their coefficients (B) and the pre- 
dicted change in the hazard for a unit increase of the 
predictor, Exp (B) = Odds Ratios (OR). The competing 
risks program, developed by Robert Gray for the R sta- 
tistical package, was used to estimate the coefficients. 
The text of the program published by Pintilie [27] 
guided our analysis. 
The hypotheses in this study stated that a) different 
types of diagnostic classes: psychosis, neurosis and per- 
sonality disorder, as well as b) patterns of substance use 
at first admission predicted premature death many years 
later. Two patterns of causes of death were studied: 
drug related death versus non drug related death. The 
cumulative incidence of premature death was modeled 
with these predictors under a competing risk situation. 
Models for drug related death were compared with 
models of non drug related causes of death. Next, the 
subject’s gender and age served as covariates in the 
models. To test the hypothesis, a hierarchical procedure 
was used starting with age and gender, followed by the 
three psychiatric diagnostic classes and finally by the 
substance pattern at first admission. 
The predictor variables were selected a priori, and 
time to death was calculated from the first admission. 
Since the ethnic diversity of Sweden today is low, (by 
2006, 13% were born in another country, most of them

in Finland [28] and was even lower in the 1970s, adjust- 
ing for race or ethnicity was not considered necessary. 
Results 
Characteristics of the cohort 
All patients admitted to the detoxification unit between 
January 1970 and February 1978 were included (n = 
561). The cohort was characterized by a low degree of 
selection, thus resembling drug patterns prevalent 
among persons with heavy drug use during the period. 
Twenty patients who did not complete the intake exam- 
ination, did not have a correct identification number, 
nor gave verbal consent were excluded from the cohort. 
Of the patients included, 31% discontinued the detoxifi- 
cation treatment prematurely, 20% within the first week. 
However, these individuals went through the same 
admission procedure as the rest of the cohort, and their 
data were included in the analyses. There was no asso- 
ciation between dropout rate and dominant substance 
abuse at the first admission. At follow-up 11 of the 561 
individuals were not included, due to clerical errors, 
emigration or by failing to locate them by 2006. The 
mean observation time was 27.1 years with a range of 
one to 37 years. 
The sample was predominately male, 70%, and almost 
90% were young (m = 24.3 years) at first admission to 
detoxification (Table 1). Regular intravenous illegal sub- 
stance use was reported in 79% of the patients, and of 
these were 97% opiate users and 91% amphetamine 
users. The patients’ age at first use of drugs was 15.5 
years (MD = 15.0, SD = 3.3) for men and 16.2 (MD = 
15.0, SD = 4.7) for women. 
The drugs most regularly used at first admission, 
according to urine testing, were opiates (34%), stimu- 
lants (42%), cannabis (51%) and barbiturates (15%). 
About 3% of the patients had chronic alcoholism. Abus- 
ing two or more substances regularly (poly drug use) 
was reported for 59% of the cohort. All substances were 
proportionally more common among males than among 
females, but only opiates (p < .02) and cannabis (p < 
.009) were significant. The deceased individuals were 
more likely to have used opiates (c2 
= 10,8, p < .002), 
barbiturates (c2 
= 4,52, 
p < .03) at first admission compared to those alive in 
2006. Patients who were alive at follow-up used amphe- 
= 4,52, p < .03) and cannabis (c2 
tamine (c2 
= 13,01, p 
< .001) to a greater extent. 

In a comparison of the cohort characteristics with the 
case-finding study [23], the age in 1978:was 26 vs 27 
years and the dominant pattern of substance abuse: opi- 
ates 37% vs 28%, and amphetamine 31% vs 32%. The 
incidence of injection use was 79% v s 75%. In other 
words, the profile was reasonably similar. The major dif- 
ference was that substance abusers admitted to the 
treatment unit had a higher proportion of persons using 
cannabis regularly, with 23% vs 8% and more women in 
the cohort (31%) compared to the case-finding study 
(23%).

The reliability of the original diagnoses (ICD-8) in the 
hospital records was good when rated by two indepen- 
dent psychiatrist ((cid:1) = .97). The most frequent diagnoses 
in the group of psychoses (14.4%) were schizophrenia 
(4.5%) and substance-induced (toxic) psychosis (6.5%). 
The group of patients diagnosed with neurosis (14.8%) 
according to ICD-8 mainly included patients with neu- 
rotic depression (12%, ICD-8 code; 300.40) and/or anxi- 
ety (8%, ICD-8 code; 300.00) and a few patients with 
diagnoses of hysteria, phobias, or obsessive-compulsive 
neurosis. Affective disorders (ICD-8 codes: 296.00, 
298.00) were filed separately. Diagnoses of personality 
disorder, mainly anti-social personality disorder, were 
issued for 20% of the cohort (ICD-8 codes 301.00 - 
301.99). 
drugs, of which 43 (94%) involved opiates and 3 (6%) 
stimulants. Twenty-nine of 120 deaths (24.2%) were vio- 
lent ones like suicide, homicide, and accidents. Of the 
four patients who died within three month after dis- 
charge none died from an overdose. About 40% of sub- 
stances detected at postmortem examinations were illicit 
and about 60% were licit. Alcohol was found postmor- 
tem in 23%. 
Non drug related death 
Somatic diseases (cardiovascular diseases 42%, infections 
36%, and cancer 22%) were the primary cause of death 
in 59 of 84 non drug related deaths (70%) and the pri- 
mary cause of 30% of all deaths in the cohort (59/204). 
Other causes of death included suicide, accidents, and 
homicides. 
Mortality rates 
By 2006, 204 of the 561 patients in the cohort were 
deceased (36.4%). The age at the time of death for men 
was 39.9 years (MD = 39.9, SD = 11.9) and 42.9 (MD = 
43.9, SD = 14.6) for women. The age of death for the 
youngest man was 17.9 years compared to the youngest 
woman (20.9 years). The average age of substance 
related death was 35.7 years (MD = 34.9, SD = 10.1) 
and for non substance related deaths 47.6 years (MD = 
48.5, SD = 12.7). 
The crude annual mortality was 1.3%. The SMR was 
5.94 (95% CI = 5.5-6.8), compared to the local gender- 
and age matched population computed from data issued 
by the Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics [28]. 
Causes of death 
Information of date and place of death was available for 
204 dead persons in the cohort. Information of the causes 
of death was missing in two cases. The coding of the 204 
deceased individuals was based on forensic autopsy 
reports (85%) or, to a minor extent, on autopsy reports 
from general hospitals (5%). Toxicology reports were 
available for 87%. In 10% of the cases no autopsy report 
could be retrieved, and the subjects were classified on the 
basis of death certificates. In addition, data were also 
obtained from hospital records and police reports. The 
causes of death for 4 persons who died outside Europe 
remained inconclusive. The reliability of drug related ver- 
sus non drug related causes of death was good when 
rated by the two independent experts (AN) and (PK) ((cid:1) = 
.98). The minor inconsistencies between the ratings were 
considered non-substantial, as they were related to con- 
tributing and not underlying causes of death, and the 
final coding was based on a mutual agreement. 
Drug related death 
Death was drug related in 120 of 204 deaths (59%). Tox- 
icological analyses were available for all of them. In this 
group 46 deaths were caused by overdoses of illegal 
Risk factors 
Gender and age 
The cumulative incidence of the two competing risks, 
drug related vs. not drug related, is displayed in Figure 
1. The incidence of drug related death increased some- 
what more steeply in the beginning of the period, but in 
the later part of the evaluation period the incidence of 
non drug related causes of death was similar to that of 
drug related deaths. As can be discerned in the figure, 
there was a slight curvilinear association between time 
and risk of drug related death. The cumulative risk 
increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out at 
later points of time. The covariates controlled for in this 
study were the subjects’ gender and age. 
Female gender was significantly related to lower risk 
of drug related death (B = -.50; OR = .61; p = .021), as 
Figure 1 Patterns of incidence for drug related causes of death 
versus non drug related causes of death. 
Nyhlén et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:122 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/122 

was the age of the subjects (B = -.03; OR = .97; p > .05). 
Age was related to non drug related deaths, with an 
increasing risk with a higher age (B = .09; OR = 1.09; p 
< .001), with older patients being represented to a 
higher extent than younger ones. 
Psychiatric disorders 
When psychiatric disorders, here neurosis, psychosis and 
personality disorder were included together with the 
subjects’ gender and age in the model, only psychosis 
remained related to drug related death. The incidence of 
such death was lower in the psychosis group (B = -1.02; 
OR = .36; p = .009). Personality disorders were not 
related to drug related causes of death and were conse- 
quently dropped in the forthcoming analyses. 
Drug type/Drug abuse 
Next, the drug pattern at first admission was added to 
the model. Three out of five different drug types were 
significant. The coefficients from the competing risk 
analyses are displayed in Table 2. Male gender, higher 
age and neurosis now became significant predictors of 
drug related death, while psychosis was only marginally 
significant (p = .10). 
Barbiturates and opiates were related to a higher risk 
of drug related death, while cannabis was related to a 
lower risk. The risk of death related to drugs was about 
1.55 times higher if opiates was abused at first admis- 
sion and about 1.39 times higher risk if barbiturates 
were abused. The risk was 0.87 if cannabis was the main 
drug abused. 
As regards non drug related death, higher age and 
alcohol were associated with increased risk; the risk of 
premature death from non drug-related causes was 
about 1.83 times higher if chronic alcohol problems 
were present at first admission. 
Figure 2 displays the distribution of risk of drug 
related death for four drug types over a period of 37 
years. The most prevalent groups of drugs are shown. 
Opiates and barbiturates had a significant impact on 
drug related death, while cannabis showed a negative

association. The use of stimulants had no impact on 
premature mortality. 
Discussion 
The results of the study confirm the long-lasting 
increased risk for premature death in drug dependent 
patients. Although the largest risk of drug related 
death occurred during the first 15 years, the level of 
such causes of death continued to be high throughout 
and above the 37-year follow-up period, and premature 
mortality remained significantly increased up to the 
age of 69. This stresses the chronic nature of drug 
abuse and dependence. The age at drug related death 
in the cohort was 35.7 years, which is close to the 
mean age of drug induced deaths in some recent Eur- 
opean studies [29]. 
Male gender, opiate and barbiturate use at first admis- 
sion, as well as neurosis were risk factors for premature 
drug related death and alcohol use for non-drug related 
death. Premature mortality was lower in women over 
time, an observation previously reported in other Scan- 
dinavian studies of drug users [4,6,30]. Earlier studies 
reflecting differences between sexes are not conclusive 
[3,8,16,19,22]. However, mortality in women in this 
study was higher in the younger age groups than for 
men, even though, with regard to the proportion of sub- 
stances, the age at first use of drugs and age at first 
admission showed a similar pattern regardless of sex. 
The relatively lower body weight in women in combina- 
tion with a propensity to use doses similar to those used 
by men, might be one explanation for the greater risk of 
fatal accidental intoxication.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/122 

In the European population aged 15 to 49 years, 
between 10% and 23% of the mortality is attributed to 
opioid use [26]. Not surprisingly, opiate use predicted 
drug related death in the studied cohort. In a meta-ana- 
lysis of mortality the death rates among opiate abusers 
were about 13 times the norm for their age [31] and 2.4 
times higher compared to those of amphetamine users 
[3]. Fifty-nine percent of the cohort was poly drug users. 
Mixing several drugs poses a real danger, since non 
lethal doses of heroin can become lethal in combination 
with alcohol and sedatives such as benzodiazepines[32]. 
This study started when barbiturate abuse was common. 
Barbiturates caused several drug related deaths, mostly 
in combination with opiates. Both barbiturates and opi- 
ates cause respiratory depression which is the major 
mechanism of opiate death [33]. The use of stimulants 
had no impact on premature mortality in this cohort. 
Stimulants do not have the same lethal effects as opi- 
ates, but, according to a study of Gossop et al [15], the 
use of amphetamine in combination with opiates 
increased the risk of mortality. 
Despite the fact that cannabis use in this study did not 
reflect “recreational use” but a chronic abuse persisting 
over several years, the association between cannabis use 
and drug related death was negative. This finding 
remains in the present cohort even after controlling for 
the use of other drugs, and support the results of other 
studies indicating that cannabis is not associated with 
increased premature mortality [34,35]. It is possible that 
a passive lifestyle associated with cannabis use in heavy 
drug abusers exposed these persons to a lesser risk of 
violent deaths as suicide, homicide and traffic accidents. 
In support of this suggestion, cannabis abusers from a 
later cohort from the same hospital showed less risk of 
committing property and violent crime compared with 
other types of drug addicts [19]. In contrast, opiate/her- 
oin abuse requires many activities related to pursuing 
drugs and money by stealing, prostitution or, in some 
cases, violent offences and, as Hser et al stated in their 
follow-up study: “heroin addicts also have extensive 
involvement in criminal activities even into older age” 
[[36], Pp 308]. However speculative, future research will 
need to address if cannabis use is also generally asso- 
ciated with lowered risk for overdoses among poly drug 
abusers. 
To our knowledge, no other cohort study of patients 
with different types of abuse (opiates, amphetamine/sti- 
mulants, cannabis, barbiturates, sedative/hypnotics and 
hallucinogens) has tracked causes of death over almost 
four decades. Cohort studies of mortality in opiate 
addicts showed a higher percentage of deceased persons, 
58% in a Danish study [9] and 49% in the Californian 
study by Hser et al [36] compared to the findings of 
36% deceased in the present cohort, which included 
opiates as well as other drugs. Despite variations in time 
to follow-up, we conclude that the drug use pattern has 
the strongest impact on drug related deaths. 
Half the cohort was diagnosed with psychiatric disor- 
ders at first admission. The prevalence of co-morbidity 
in substance abusers has been reported to increase over 
the last two decades or longer [37]. The rate of psy- 
choses was however, similar between the present cohort 
and a later cohort of patients treated from March 1978 
to June 1995, while depressions, anxiety and personality 
disorders became more prevalent [38]. In our cohorts of 
drug abusers the increase of co-morbidity reflected the 
more systematic application of diagnostics rather than a 
general increase in prevalence rates [38]. 
Two patterns remained in the analysis; neurosis pre- 
dicted drug related premature death and chronic psy- 
choses did not. The explanation is that only a few 
patients with chronic psychoses in this study used opi- 
ates or amphetamine intravenously. Still, the prevalence 
of psychotic disorder in this cohort was much higher 
than in the Lundby population study [39] conducted in 
the same region. The prevalence of psychoses was at 
that time 4.2% in the local suburban general population 
compared to 14.4% in this cohort. The neurosis group 
included mainly patients with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, constituting 15% of the cohort compared to 
a prevalence of neurosis of 0.4% in the general popula- 
tion [40]. This group of patients could be expected to 
use more alcohol and sedatives/hypnotics, prescribed or 
not, for alleviating psychological suffering as a kind of 
“self-medication”, which in combination with opiates 
increases the risk of premature death. High levels of 
anxiety have been shown to increase the risk of prema- 
ture mortality, and regular use of benzodiazepines pre- 
dicted overdoses in a prospective study of substance 
abusers in the UK [15]. It is possible that intoxication 
among suicides may have contributed to the association 
between neurosis and drug-related premature death. 
However, given the sample size, having more than two 
risk outcomes for the competing risks model was not 
feasible. Future research should investigate this question 
using larger cohorts. 
Some researchers found no association between mor- 
tality and psychiatric conditions [9], while others suggest 
that psychopathology causes increased premature mor- 
tality [3,15,22]. Instead of discussing the general impact 
of the co-morbidity of psychiatric disorders on mortality 
in drug dependent persons, the case might be that var- 
ious psychiatric disorders have a differential influence 
on causes of premature death. 
Somatic diseases constituted 70% of the non drug 
related deaths, and violent death the remaining 30% 
[41]. In this study alcohol use predicted non drug 
related deaths. Alcohol dependence is known to

contribute to a wide range of somatic diseases, such as 
liver failure, cancer, coronary diseases, stroke and dia- 
betes. A J-shaped relationship between alcohol and total 
mortality was confirmed in both men and women in a 
meta-analysis from 2006 [42]. While moderate con- 
sumption of alcohol was inversely associated with total 
mortality, higher consumption was associated with 
increased mortality. Illicit drugs contributed to death for 
those who died from liver failure associated with viral 
hepatitis and/or chronic alcoholism and for those who 
died from HIV or HIV-induced opportunistic infections 
and cancers (AIDS). 
Among the strengths of this study are the long obser- 
vation period and the fact that the cohort was reason- 
ably representative for drug abuse patterns in the 
southern region of Sweden at the time. According to 
data from the national case finding study from the end 
of the 1970s, the cohort was reasonably similar in drug 
use, age and incidence of intravenous abuse to the 
population of substance abusers at the time [23]. The 
slight overrepresentation of women in the clinical 
cohort was typical for a more pronounced treatment- 
seeking behavior in women substance abusers compared 
to substance abusing men [2,6]. In the substance abus- 
ing population in Sweden at the time some 25% were 
women, while in clinical settings women constituted 
33% [24]. This was the case also in this cohort. 
Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 clas- 
sification by a senior consultant physician and an associ- 
ate professor of forensic medicine, a procedure which 
eliminated inconsistencies in recording drug related 
deaths, which are often found when data from national 
cause of death registers are used as only source. This 
procedure increased the rate of drug related death by 
35% compared to register data only. 
There are however some limitations. The first is that 
the cohort design by necessity provides a more limited 
number of subjects for analysis, thus restricting its sta- 
tistical power more than is the case in large epidemiolo- 
gical samples. Secondly, we have not been able to 
include important aspects of the patients life-situation. 
Premature death may be predicted by life events like 
traumas, separation and loss of close friends and rela- 
tives, data known to be associated with suicide. Such 
data were however seldom registered in the patient 
records in a systematic fashion and have not been 
included in the analysis. 
Thirdly, patients’ behavior during treatment as well as 
their discharge status may be potential indicators of 
long term risk of premature death. Dropout from treat- 
ment is known to increase the risk of death by overdose 
in opiate abusers [15]. In this study however no over- 
dose was diagnosed in the few patients who died within 
three months after premature termination of treatment 
and no association was found between dropout and 
dominant substance of abuse. Based on the available 
data, we cannot determine if discharge status at first 
admission is a predictor of premature death many years 
later. 
Finally, the categorization of co-morbid psychiatric 
disorders into three broad groups is another limitation. 
The psychiatric nomenclature used at the time when the 
patients entered the cohort (ICD-8) might be considered 
somewhat dated by today’s standards. Neurosis, for 
example, is today replaced by more refined and specific 
diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders. Personal- 
ity disorders had lower prevalence in the cohort than is 
the case in more recent clinical materials of substance 
dependent persons [19,22,38]. It is likely that the low 
prevalence reflected the critical stance of the 1970s drug 
addiction treatment towards personality assessment in 
general and psychiatric diagnostics in particular, as 
articulated by, for example, Thomas Szasz [43]. 
Conclusions 
About two thirds of all deaths in this cohort of sub- 
stance dependent persons were drug related. Male gen- 
der, abuse of opiates and barbiturates as well as a 
diagnosis of neurosis, mainly neurotic depression and 
anxiety at first admission, predicted premature drug 
related mortality while chronic psychoses and person- 
ality disorders did not. The risk of drug related death 
was about 1.6 times higher if opiates were abused at 
first admission and about 1.4 times higher risk if barbi- 
turates were abused. The predicted cumulative inci- 
dence of drug related death was significantly higher in 
opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed time 
period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have 
any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related 
death.
