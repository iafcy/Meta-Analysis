Abstract 
Background: To study mortality rate and causes of death among all hospitalized opioid addicts 
treated for self-poisoning or admitted for voluntary detoxification in Oslo between 1980 and 1981, 
and to compare their mortality to that of the general population. 
Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 185 opioid addicts from all medical 
departments in Oslo who were treated for either self-poisoning (n = 93, 1980), voluntary 
detoxification (n = 75, 1980/1981) or both (n = 17). Their median age was 24 years; with a range 
from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified 
from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway. 
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for 
different causes of death. 
Results: During a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality 
ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7–29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period, 
ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no 
significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily 
detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer 
(4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths (2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among 
the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category "drug dependence" was listed in the vast 
majority of cases (37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death, 
with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9–86.9). The SMR was 5.4 
(95% CI, 1.3–21.5) for cardiovascular diseases, and 4.3 (95% CI, 1.4–13.5) for cancer. The SMR was 
13.2 (95% CI, 6.6–26.4) for accidents, 10.7 (95% CI, 4.5–25.8) for suicides, and 28.6 (95% CI, 7.1– 
114.4) for other violent deaths. 
Conclusion: The risk of death among opioid addicts was significantly higher for all causes of death 
compared with the general population, implying a poor prognosis over a 20-year period for this 
young patient group.

Background 
Mortality rates among opioid addicts are higher than for 
the general population, although there are differences 
between countries and regions [1]. Standardized mortality 
ratios (SMRs) vary between 15 and 28 in different studies 
[2-4]. In spite of the increased mortality, and hence the 
need for intervention, Cook et al. found that 67% of 
patients who attended an emergency department because 
of acute opioid overdose were not referred to any thera- 
peutic programme for drug addiction [5]. During the last 
few decades, studies have focused on abstinence versus 
continued drug use following participation in various 
treatment programmes, as an outcome measure [6], even 
though there is still some doubt about whether such pro- 
grammes have a long-term effect on mortality. In a 15- 
year follow-up study, Sorensen et al. found that people 
who had achieved stable abstinence from injectable nar- 
cotics use were at lower risk of premature death when 
compared with those who continued using drugs [7]. 
However, even in the presumed abstinence group, there 
was a sevenfold increase in SMR. This raises the question 
whether referral to a detoxification programme has a sat- 
isfactory effect on long-term mortality. 
Although the majority of deaths among opioid addicts are 
from accidental poisonings [8], deaths from other unnat- 
ural causes, such as suicide, have also increased [9,10]. 
The co-morbidity between drug dependence and suicide 
has been described both as an association between drug 
dependence and mental illness [11], and between known 
risk factors for both drug dependence and suicide, such as 
gender, living alone and unemployment [12]. In an 
empirical review, Wilcox et al. estimated the SMR for sui- 
cide associated with opioid dependence, but did not esti- 
mate SMRs for other diseases [10]. In another empirical 
review, Harris and Barraclough calculated SMRs for both 
natural and unnatural causes of death associated with opi- 
oid dependence [13]. 
Review studies, which have proven useful in pointing out 
the increased mortality in this patient group, have used 
expected number of deaths based on WHO data, rather 
than patient data. The analyses in Harris and Barra- 
clough's review were based on 10 papers with a follow-up 
period ranging from 1 to 28 years, and the SMRs for natu- 
ral causes of death were based on only one study. Longer 
prospective follow-up studies of opioid addicts show how 
the overall mortality rate changes over time [14], it being 
expected that cause-specific mortality would also differ 
between long-term and short-term follow-up studies. 
Although cause-specific mortality rates were measured in 
one four-year prospective cohort study, no SMRs were 
obtained [15]. Prospective cohort studies in the field are 
relatively uncommon [15], and even rarer is the opportu- 
nity to compare the cohort with a well-defined back- 
ground population that includes a whole city. However, 
long-term prospective studies of excess mortality among 
opioid addicts, in particular, would be useful for obtain- 
ing more specific information about opioid addictions as 
a subgroup of substance use disorders. 
During recent decades, the AIDS epidemic has had a 
major effect on this group of patients [16]. Although mor- 
tality among opioid addicts increased from 1980 to 1988 
[17], this increase can only be partly explained by the 
emergence of AIDS [18]. Cause-specific SMRs during 
recent decades would be helpful in studying mortality in 
this group of patients. 
The aims of this study were to study the mortality rate and 
causes of death among opioid addicts who had been 
treated for self-poisoning or admitted to voluntary detoxi- 
fication in 1980 and 1981 during a 20-year follow-up 
investigation. The study compared this cohort with the 
general population. The study's design allowed an investi- 
gation of whether participation in a detoxification pro- 
gramme can be protective. 
Methods 
Participants 
The study included all opioid addicts hospitalized due to 
self-poisoning in Oslo in 1980, as well as all opioid 
addicts admitted for voluntary detoxification in 1980 and 
1981 (Table 1). All patients who were discharged follow- 
ing treatment for self-poisoning and classified as opioid 
abusers in 1980 in Oslo (454,000 inhabitants) medical 
departments, were included. This subgroup was obtained 
from a larger prospective cohort study that included all 
patients treated for self-poisoning in Oslo medical depart- 
ments in 1980 [19,20]. Patients leaving directly from the 
emergency room after treatment were also included in the 
study. The first, or the most serious, admission (i.e.,

according to the toxic agent used and the amount taken) 
was chosen as the index episode. 
All opioid addicts admitted to Ullevaal University Hospi- 
tal for voluntary detoxification during 1980 and 1981 
were included in the study. During the late 1970s, the 
number of opioid addicts increased rapidly in Oslo, par- 
ticularly among young people. The treatment facilities 
were rather poor. Therefore, from 1980, the Department 
of Acute Medicine (previously Medical Department 7) 
accepted the responsibility for treating up to three opioid 
addicts simultaneously. These people were in need of 
detoxification, either before further treatment in drug 
addiction units, or due to their poor overall health, Ulle- 
vaal University Hospital serving this function for the 
whole city [21]. Before admittance, volunteer patients 
were interviewed to obtain their agreement regarding the 
ward's rules, and they were informed that no opioids or 
benzodiazepines would be prescribed. They were offered 
neuroleptics and medication, such as alimemazin, which 
served as hypnotics. Their health contact person was usu- 
ally present on admission. They had daily meetings with a 
social worker or a psychiatrist for support and planning 
further treatment. The staff at the units received regular 
supervision. About 75% of those patients who were 
detoxified were transferred for further planned treatment 
programmes. About 50% of those in a bad physical con- 
dition, left the unit before they were advised to do so. The 
average length of stay for the total group was 3.5 days. 
Although patients who had experienced an opioid drug 
overdose were offered interviews with a social worker or a 
psychiatrist, most of them were not interested in further 
treatment and left the hospital when they were able to do 
so. 
The present cohort contained 185 opioid addicts treated 
for either self-poisoning (n = 93), voluntary detoxification 
(n = 75), or both (n = 17). Those who were admitted ini- 
tially for self-poisoning and later for detoxification were 
classified in further analyses as voluntarily detoxifica- 
tions, to indicate their willingness to undergo further 
treatment and rehabilitation. Some patients were hospi- 
talized several times (Table 2). Since information about

the status of the patients at discharge was only available 
for groups and not individuals, the statistical significance 
of this variable was not investigated. There were 99 
(53.5%) males and 86 (46.5%) females. Their median age 
was 24 years (range 16–41), 72% of patients being in the 
20–29 year age group (n = 133). 
Design 
Classification of abuse was based on patient interviews 
and records. The basic criteria were information about 
daily, or regular, use of the respective compounds, includ- 
ing withdrawal symptoms if the compounds were not 
administered. 
The causes of death were classified according to the death 
certificates provided by Statistics Norway and grouped 
according to the appropriate standards. Thus, the same 
classification was used for both the study population and 
the general population. Death certificates were based on 
forensic autopsy records for all cases that did not involve 
natural causes [22]. Appropriate categories from the Inter- 
national Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used for 
deaths occurring before 1987 (ICD-8), for deaths from 
1987 to 1996 (ICD-9), and for deaths from 1996 to 2000 
(ICD-10). All deaths were categorized according to their 
major cause: cardiovascular disease, cancer, other dis- 
eases, suicide, accidents, and other violent deaths. The cat- 
egory, other diseases, consisted of all diseases except for 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Other violent deaths 
consisted of all external causes of injury, except for sui- 
cides and accidents. There was no specific cause of death 
for four patients, three deaths being recorded as 799 
unknown (ICD-9), and one being recorded as R999 
unknown (ICD-10). These cases were all classified as 
other diseases. 
Mortality in the cohort was compared with that of the gen- 
eral population of Norway. Reference rates were com- 
puted in terms of five-year calendar periods and five-year 
age groups (15–19, 20–24, etc.) for each gender. Patients 
were followed to emigration, death or the end of 2000, 
whichever occurred first. Dates of emigration and death 
were obtained from the Central Population Registry. Per- 
son-time under observation, categorized by five-year cal- 
endar periods and five-year age groups (15–19, 20–24, 
etc.), was obtained for each gender. Mortality rates in the 
general population for the same cross-classification served 
as reference rates. The expected number of deaths was 
computed by multiplying the observed person-time in the 
cohort by the reference rates for each cell in the cross-clas- 
sification, and appropriately adding the results. SMRs 
were computed by taking the ratio of observed to expected 
deaths (i.e., the ratio of the number of deaths observed in 
the study group to the number of deaths that would be

rates as the standard population). 
Data analyses 
The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was computed for 
each SMR, based on the assumption that observed deaths 
follow a Poisson distribution. Stata release 8.0 pro- 
grammes were used for survival analysis (Stata Corpora- 
tion). For other data analyses, SPSS version 14.0 was used 
(SPSS Inc.). Comparisons between groups were per- 
formed using chi-squared tests, P < 0.05 being considered 
statistically significant. 
Ethics 
Permission for both the original cohort study and the fol- 
low-up study was obtained from the National Data 
Inspectorate and the Regional Ethics Committee, both of 
which agreeing that informed consent was not necessary. 
Asking the patients' permission in advance to check 
whether they had committed suicide or had died from 
other causes during a 20-year follow-up period was con- 
sidered unethical. All data were stored anonymously by 
substituting a number code for each patient's name, and 
placing the data in the locked office of the head physician. 
Results 
Mortality rates 
During the 20-year follow-up period, 70 of the patients 
died (37.8%), including 23 females (31.4%) and 47 
males (48.5%). Five patients (2.7%) had emigrated, and 
110 patients (59.5%) were still alive. The overall SMR was 
23.6 (95% CI, 18.7–29.6). The SMR was 23.4 (95% CI, 
17.6–31.1) for males, and 24.2 (95% CI, 16.1–36.4) for 
females, this difference between males and females being 
non-significant. SMR was increased in each successive 
five-year period following the initial self-poisoning (Table 
3), the highest SMR occurring in the first five years, 32.4 
(95% CI, 21.3–49.1). The median age at death was 34 
years, with a range from 20 to 58. 
Differences between patients treated for self-poisoning 
and those treated voluntarily for detoxification 
Forty patients (43.0%) died among those solely dis- 
charged after self-poisonings, and 30 patients (48.4%) 
died among those treated voluntarily for detoxification 
(Table 3). The SMR was 23.5 (95% CI, 17.2–32.0) for 
those discharged after an episode of self-poisoning, 
whereas the SMR was 23.8 (95% CI, 16.6–34.0) for those 
who were admitted voluntarily for detoxification. The dif- 
ference in SMR between groups was not statistically signif- 
icant, nor were there any significant gender differences. 
For both groups, mortality was highest during the first five 
years after admittance, and remained high during the 
whole period thereafter. 
Causes of death 
The main causes of death were categorized as accidents (n 
= 8, 11.4%), suicide (n = 5, 7.1%), cancer (n = 3, 4.3%), 
other violent deaths (n = 2, 2.9%), cardiovascular disease 
(n = 2, 2.9%), and other diseases (n = 50, 71.4%). The 
other diseases category compromised the vast majority of 
deaths. In 37 cases (52.9% of the total), the cause of death 
was classified in ICD-8 and ICD-9 as category 304, Drug 
dependence (Table 4), and listed according to ICD-9 as a 
natural cause of death. 
SMRs were significantly increased for all causes of death 
(Table 5). The other diseases category had the highest 
SMR, 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9–86.9). Accidental poisonings, 
that is overdoses, were included in the accidents category, 
with an SMR equal to 13.2 (95% CI, 6.6–26.4). There 
were five suicides among the deaths, the SMR for suicide 
being 10.7 (95% CI, 4.5–25.8). 
HIV/AIDS caused one death among the patients in this 
study (Table 4), and three deaths that occurred in 1990, 
1992 and 1994 were classified as immune system disor- 
ders. Additional causes of death were bronchopneumo- 
nia, Hodgkin's disease and unspecified infectious or 
parasitic disease.

For the 37 deaths classified as drug dependence, an addi- 
tional cause of death was mainly category 965, poisoning 
by analgesics, antipyretics and antirheumatics (ICD-9) 
accounting for 28 of the cases. For the rest of the group, 
acute or subacute endocarditis, unspecified bronchopneu- 
monia, accidental poisoning by alcohol, accidental poi- 
soning by barbiturates, and poisoning by other 
unspecified drugs or medicinal substances were listed. 
Discussion 
This prospective study followed all hospital-treated opi- 
oid addicts from the same large city, up to as long as 20 
years. All patients were traced during this period, thus 
minimizing selection bias. Causes of death were obtained 
for all patients, enabling cause-specific mortality ratios to 
be determined so that they could be compared with those 
of the general population. 
In ICD-10, the drug dependence category per se does not 
exist. However, one death was classified as F11.0, psychi- 
atric diseases and behavioural diseases caused by opiate 
dependence, and Hepatitis C and HIV were stated as addi- 
tional causes of death. One death was classified as F19.0, 
psychiatric diseases and behavioural diseases caused by 
multiple drug dependence, with no additional cause of 
death listed. One death was classified as F12.0, mental 
and behavioural disorders due to use of cannabinoids, 
whereas chronic viral hepatitis B was an additional cause 
of death. 
The numbers of deaths in each five-year period were too 
small to obtain cause-specific SMRs. However, causes of 
death were distributed evenly throughout the study 
period. 
This study's main finding was the high mortality rate of 
37.8%. One-third of females and almost half of males 
died. This high mortality rate was observed in a young 
patient group, for which the median age during 1980 and 
1981 was 24 years. When corrected for the expected 
number versus the observed number of deaths, SMRs 
showed no statistically significant gender differences. 
Although in absolute numbers males had a higher mortal- 
ity ratio than females, the expected number of deaths 
among males was higher as well. Therefore, the SMRs for 
males and females were almost identical, there being a 23- 
fold increase in mortality. In this study, the effect of opi- 
oid addiction seemed to overrule the effects of age and 
gender on mortality. 
The SMR of 23.6, found for this cohort, is similar to SMRs 
obtained in other long-term European studies [1], 
although there were differences in the inclusion criteria 
for these studies. SMRs were 15 times higher for male drug

users in Rome compared with the general population [2], 
22 times higher for drug injectors in Glasgow [3], and 
28.5 times higher for heroin addicts in Catalonia, Spain 
[4]. 
The lack of gender differences has also been observed in 
other studies, such as those conducted with homeless peo- 
ple who had a drug addiction [23]. However, other studies 
have found higher SMRs for either males [8,15] or females 
[2,13]. This diversity of findings may be due to different 
inclusion criteria. Gender differences have been observed 
when notified addicts or drug users, who were recruited 
from drug treatment centres, were included whereas the 
present study included hospital-treated opioid addicts. 
Therefore, this subject sample may have been more prone 
to accidental poisoning, such incidents being less corre- 
lated to gender perhaps than to behavioural traits, such as 
the pattern of drug use. Irrespective of toxic compound, 
the SMR for hospital-treated opioid addicts was much 
higher than that for hospital-treated self-poisonings. In a 
20-year follow-up study of all self-poisonings treated in 
Oslo hospitals in 1980, the SMR was 4.6 (95% CI, 4.1– 
5.1), compared with 23.6 in the present cohort [24]. Opi- 
oid addicts are therefore at special risk. There were a 
higher number of deaths in the first five-year period of the 
study, and a decrease in SMR from 32.4 in the first five- 
year period to 13.4 in the last five-year period. It is sug- 
gested that those who take the highest risks will probably 
die early, leading to a decrease in mortality for the cohort 
as a whole. It has been shown that the number of active 
drug addicts declines mainly from death, rather than from 
long-term abstinence [25]. The decrease in SMR may also 
be due partly to increased mortality in the general popu- 
lation over time, leading to a relative reduction in the 
ratio. 
There was an increased mortality for all causes of death 
among opioid addicts when compared with the general 
population, including both natural and unnatural causes 
of death. This was consistent with what is known about 
substance abusers in general [13]. The causes of death 
were mainly drug-related, as has been observed in other 
studies [3,15]. Five suicides occurred in the cohort. The 
increased risk of suicide among opioid addicts accords 
with other studies [9,10]. There has been controversy 
about the possible existence of a substantial number of 
hidden suicides among accidental poisonings. So far, the 
results support the hypothesis that most deliberate poi- 
sonings are accidental [26,27]. In the present study, the 
causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway, and 
our group reported on the validity of these data in 1985 
[28]. Since then, autopsy rates have been declining in Nor- 
way, and the reliability of death certificates has been ques- 
tioned [29]. Therefore, the suicide numbers may well be 
too low. Mortality in the study population was compared 
with mortality rates from the whole country. Although the 
expected lifespan is lower in Oslo than the average for the 
country as a whole, it is less than one year below the aver- 
age. Although SMR values found in the current study may 
be somewhat high, this will not change the study's major 
findings. 
Only five deaths were registered as specific natural causes 
of death, three being cancer and two being cardiovascular 
diseases. The SMRs increased significantly, possibly due to 
confounding factors such as lower socio-economic status 
or tobacco use. Nevertheless, opioid addicts represent a 
group that is at high risk for excess mortality, not only 
from drug-related deaths, but also because of their 
increased risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular dis- 
eases. The increased risk of death, even from natural 
causes, is consistent with the increased mortality associ- 
ated with other mental disorders [13]. 
Only one death could be classified as being caused by 
AIDS, although three deaths were stated as "disorders 
involving the immune mechanism". In other studies, 
AIDS has accounted for a majority of the deaths among 
opioid addicts [4]. A study of HIV-positive opioid addicts 
in Oslo found that drug overdose was a major cause of 
death, thus overriding the effect of AIDS on mortality 
[30]. 
The major cause of death was drug dependence, as regis- 
tered in the other diseases category. In order to compare 
this cohort with the general population, we used the same 
categories as Statistics Norway. Although the SMR for this 
single cause of death was not calculated, this value would 
have provided minimal additional information. If drug 
dependence is a chronic disease, a symptom of which is 
opioid addiction, one would expect that only those suffer- 
ing from the disease would die from it; that is, there would 
be a low number of deaths in the background population. 
Even when all other diseases were considered in the gen- 
eral population, death from drug dependence outnum- 
bers the total number of deaths from all other diseases. As 
the classification of drug-related deaths is problematic in 
the ICD system, the term "drug-related deaths", used in 
mortality statistics, is currently being developed by the 
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addic- 
tion. 
The category, drug dependence, is not equivalent literally 
to any category in ICD-10. Chapter X4 can be used for 
accidental poisonings, whereas F10 to F19 cover psychiat- 
ric and behavioural disorders caused by drug dependence. 
The incongruence of these classification systems makes it 
difficult to know if the categories cover the same spectrum 
of patients.

In this study, mortality did not change from referral to 
voluntarily detoxification. Our hypothesis was that those 
treated solely for self-poisonings would have a poorer 
prognosis, since such people were not sent to drug addic- 
tion units on a regular basis. Sorensen et al. found a sig- 
nificant decrease in mortality for those who achieved 
abstinence [7], but in the present study, it was not known 
whether patients completed or discontinued the detoxifi- 
cation programme. Those who joined the programme vol- 
untarily may have also been in a poorer physical 
condition, since this was one of the criteria for admit- 
tance. Some of the patients admitted for detoxification 
were transferred to other units specialising in the treat- 
ment of addicts, whereas others were admitted for a few 
days of detoxification in the medical department because 
of their extremely poor medical and physical state. Gener- 
ally, these patients were not motivated to partake in treat- 
ment required to achieve abstinence, and were among 
those with the most serious drug addiction problems. In 
addition, we did not have information about the comple- 
tion rate for those transferred for further treatment. 
Unfortunately, in retrospect, we were unable to trace the 
status of each patient at discharge, but could only do so 
for the group as a whole. However, the high level of mor- 
tality in both subgroups supports the hypothesis that 
referral to a detoxification programme alone is not suffi- 
ciently effective to prevent the excess mortality for this 
group. Patients probably need a longer and more closely 
supervised follow-up, both to improve their physical 
health and to achieve abstinence. 
Since the relatively small numbers of deaths in each cate- 
gory did not make it meaningful to obtain cause-specific 
SMRs for each time period, it was not possible to investi- 
gate how cause-specific mortality ratios change over time. 
Subgroups might have been used in the statistical analyses 
to evaluate the effect of repeated treatments on mortality. 
However, the resulting groups would be too small to 
reveal any statistically significant differences. It might be 
worthwhile investigating in larger studies whether there 
could still be a difference between patients seeking 
repeated treatments and other patients. 
The fact that mortality in this group was quite high when 
compared with the general population is a great challenge 
to our society. It is worth emphasizing that not all drug 
addicts die early. More research is needed to discover what 
makes those patients who survive different from those 
who die. This information would be helpful both for 
choosing therapy and for identifying those at special risk. 
Conclusion 
The mortality rate was much higher among opioid addicts 
than in the general population, and most deaths were 
related to drug dependence. The risk of death was highest 
in the first five-year period, but the risk of death remained 
high throughout the whole 20-year follow-up period. 
There were no differences between those admitted for vol- 
untary detoxification and those admitted solely for self- 
poisonings. Opioid addiction also seemed to override the 
effects of age and gender on mortality.
