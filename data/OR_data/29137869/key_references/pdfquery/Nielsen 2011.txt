Psychiatric disorders and mortality among people in 
homeless shelters in Denmark: a nationwide register-based 
cohort study 

Summary 
Background The increased mortality of homeless people compared with non-homeless people might be linked to 
psychiatric disorders. However, homeless people are, because of their insuﬃ cient accommodation, diﬃ cult to sample 
and monitor, which has limited previous studies. We aimed to assess registered psychiatric disorders, mortality, and 
predictors of mortality in the homeless shelter population in Denmark. 
Methods We did a nationwide, prospective, register-based cohort study of homeless people aged 16 years and older 
who were registered in the Danish Homeless Register between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2009. We calculated the 
proportion of registered psychiatric disorders, overall and cause-speciﬁ c standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and life 
expectancy. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to assess predictors of death. 
Findings 32 711 homeless people (23 040 men and 9671 women) were included in the study population. 14 381 men 
(62·4%) and 5632 women (58·2%) had registered psychiatric disorders, and 11 286 men (49·0%) and 3564 women 
(36·9%) had a substance abuse diagnosis. During the study period, 3839 men (16·7%) and 951 women (9·8%) died. 
The overall SMR for men was 5∙6 (95% CI 5∙4–5∙8) and for women was 6∙7 (6∙2–7∙1), and external causes accounted 
for 1161 (27·9%) of 4161 deaths for which information on the cause was available. Remaining life expectancy at age 
15–24 years was 21∙6 years (95% CI 21·2–22·1) and 17∙4 years (16·4–18·5) lower for homeless men and women, 
respectively, than the general population. Registered substance abuse disorder was associated with the highest 
mortality risk compared with no psychiatric contact registered (adjusted HR 1∙4, 95% CI 1∙3–1∙5 for men; 
1∙7, 1∙4–2∙1 for women). 
Interpretation Health problems are extensive in the homeless shelter population and there is an urgent need for more 
sustained eﬀ orts to reduce the high morbidity and mortality, especially from external causes. Register data is an 
important resource to supplement existing knowledge on homeless people with more valid and detailed information.

Introduction 
An increased mortality among homeless people compared 
with the general population in developed countries has 
been described.1–17 Additionally, psychiatric morbidity in 
the homeless population is higher than in the general 
population in developed countries.18–20 Previous studies 
have linked mental illness, such as psychosis and schizo- 
phrenia, to lower mortality in homeless people.1,3,9,11,16 
Although these ﬁ ndings only showed weak evidence of a 
diﬀ erence in mortality, they do contrast with ﬁ ndings in 
the general population.21 Diﬀ erent types of substance 
abuse and dual diagnosis (a schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder and a substance abuse disorder) were identiﬁ ed 
as predictors of excess mortality among homeless 
people.1,3–5,12,14,16 The need for more prospective studies that 
investigate the factors associated with the excess mortality 
has been emphasised.9,11,12 
Homeless people are a transient population and, 
because of their insuﬃ cient accommodation, are 
diﬃ cult to sample and monitor. As such, studies on 
this population have generally had small and selected 
sample sizes, which do not ensure representative 
ﬁ 
 ndings. In Denmark, information on every contact 
with homeless shelters is contained in the Danish 
Homeless Register, which provides a new and unique 
opportunity to undertake detailed research of an 
unselected homeless population. 
We aimed to estimate the proportion of registered 
psychiatric disorders among men and women in home- 
less shelters in Denmark, to calculate the overall and 
cause-speciﬁ c standardised mortality ratio (SMR; the 
ratio between observed mortality in the studied popu- 
lation and the expected mortality) and life expectancy, 
and to identify predictors for mortality. We hypothe sised 
that psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse, 
are highly prevalent among homeless people.20 
Additionally, we expected that homeless people would 
have an increased SMR and a reduced life expectancy 
compared with the general population.1,15 We also 
expected that substance abuse would be a strong 
predictor of death, and more harmful to health than both 
no psychiatric disorders and schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders.1,3,11 Finally, we hypothesised that the number 
of contacts with homeless shelters within the ﬁ rst year 



of contact would be a predictor of death, with increased 
risk associated with an increasing number of contacts.1 
Methods 
Study population 
We included people aged 16 years and older who had a 
valid Civil Registration System (CRS) number (a personal 
identiﬁ cation number that is assigned to all Danish 
residents) and who had had at least one contact with a 
homeless shelter in Denmark between Jan 1, 1999, and 
Dec 31, 2009. Children under 16 years of age were 
excluded because we did not judge their homelessness 
situation to be comparable to that of adults (eg, in 
Denmark they would usually only be admitted to shelters 
in the company of an adult). A person was deﬁ ned as 
homeless from the date when they ﬁ rst stayed in a 
homeless shelter onwards—ie, the homeless deﬁ nition 
covers people who either are living in or have a history of 
staying in a homeless shelter during the study period. 
Permission to use the data was obtained from the 
Danish Data Protection Agency. Also, we obtained 
permission from the National Social Appeals Board to 
use information about homeless shelter contacts and 
from the National Board of Health to use information 
about psychiatric contacts and deaths. 
Procedures 
We did a register-based follow-up cohort study using 
information from the Danish Homeless Register,22 the 
Danish Civil Registration System,23 the Danish Psychiatric 
Central Register,24 and the Danish Cause of Death 
Register.25 The CRS number enables accurate linkage 
between the registers.23 
In Denmark, the municipal council has the duty to 
oﬀ er a temporary stay for a small fee per night to people 
who do not have a home or cannot live in their own 
home. As an administrative procedure, all residents in 
homeless shelters are registered with their CRS number 
in the Danish Homeless Register, which is maintained 
by the National Social Appeals Board.22 The register 
contains data on, for example, dates of admission and 
discharge, nationality, and income. The Danish Civil 
Registration System contains basic information on, for 
example, birthday and vital status, and is updated to 
2009.23 Information about total number of deaths was 
obtained from this register. Information about psychiatric 
disorders was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric 
Central Register, which contains information on all 
admissions to psychiatric hospitals since 1969 as well as 
outpatient contacts from 1995.24 
Until Dec 31, 1993, psychiatric disorders were registered 
according to the Danish modiﬁ cation of the International 
Classiﬁ cation of Diseases, 8th Revision (ICD-8)26 and 
since 1994 with the ICD-10.27 People in the register are 
separated 
into the following groups of disorders: 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ICD-8: 295, 297, 
298.29, 298.39, 298.89, 298.99, 299.05, 299.09, 301.09, 
and 301.29, and ICD-10: F20–F29), substance abuse 
disorders (ICD-8: 291, 303, and 304, and ICD-10: F10–F19), 
aﬀ ective disorders (ICD-8: 296, 298.09, 298.19, 300.49, 
301.19, and ICD-10: F30–F39), and personality disorders 
(ICD-8: 300.19, 301.49, 301.59, 301.69, 301.79–301.84, and 
ICD-10: F60–F69). 
We obtained information about causes of death 
according to the ICD-10 classiﬁ cation from the Danish 
Cause of Death Register, which was updated on 
Dec 31, 2008. Thus, causes of death were only available 
for 1999–2008. Causes of death were classed as suicide 
(X60–X84 and Y87.0), unintentional injury (V01–V89, 
V90–V99, W00–X59, Y40–Y86, Y87.1–Y87.2, and Y88–Y89), 
other external causes (X85–Y36), and diseases and

medical conditions (all other causes).25 To compare the 
mortality of the homeless people with the general 
population, we obtained data on deaths in the Danish 
general population from Statbank Denmark.28–32 
Statistical analysis 
Sex-speciﬁ c life expectancy for people aged 15–24 years was 
calculated by constructing abridged period life tables with 
10-year age groups and data on the homeless and general 
populations from 1999 to 2009.33 SMR was calculated by 
sex and age with 5-year age groups for the period 1999–2009 
and by cause with 10-year age groups for 1999–2008 by 
comparing the reported mortality in the study population 
with the expected mortality in the age-standardised and 
sex-standardised Danish general population. For the SMR 
and life expectancy calculations, we decided to include 
15-year olds to make results comparable with standard age 
intervals (ie, 15–19 years). The number of contacts with 
homelesss shelters for adolescents were few: whereas ﬁ ve, 
two, and six contacts were recorded for young men aged 
15, 16, and 17 years, respectively, no contacts were recorded 
for women of these ages. 
Predictors of mortality were identiﬁ ed by age-adjusted 
univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses. All analyses were calculated for 
men and women separately. By using Cox regression for 
the analyses we were able to include people with 
diﬀ erent lengths of follow-up and therefore we did not 
need to exclude data. Overall, all individuals had the 
same risk of dying, which was 1, but we assessed only 
the mortality risk from age 16 years and within a period 
of 11 years (Jan 1, 1999, to Dec 31, 2009). Thus, people 
were deemed at risk of death from their ﬁ rst contact in 
the Danish Homeless Register and until the ﬁ rst of the 
following events: death, loss to follow-up, emigration, or 
end of the study. 
A priori, we chose which variables to include in the 
survival analysis, and we constructed Cox proportional 
hazards models. To adjust for age we used the square 
eﬀ ect of age at ﬁ rst contact in the Danish Homeless 
Register. The ﬁ rst multivariable Cox model included four 
independent variables: age at ﬁ rst contact in the Danish 
Homeless Register, country of origin, income (deﬁ ned as 
income at last contact in the Danish Homeless Register), 
and a binary variable of registered psychiatric disorder. 
In the second model, a more detailed variable was 
included: registered psychiatric disorder, which listed 
ﬁ 
 ve hierarchical, mutually exclusive categories with the 
following priority: (1) no psychiatric contact since 1969, 
(2) dual diagnosis, (3) schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 
(4) substance abuse disorder, and (5) other psychiatric 
disorders. Also, we examined the eﬀ ect of registered 
psychiatric disorders on mortality with age-adjusted 
cumulative mortality curves. 
To investigate whether the number of contacts with 
homeless shelters within the ﬁ rst year of contact was 
associated with mortality, we did a multivariable analysis

Results 
From Jan 1, 1999, to Dec 31, 2009, 34 755 people were 
registered in the Danish Homeless Register; 2044 were 
excluded from this study, 1896 because they could not be 
matched in the CRS and 148 because they were below 
16 years of age, leaving 32 711 people in the study cohort. 
189 (0∙6%) of people were lost to follow-up and 
811 (2∙5%) emigrated during the study period. Mean age 
at ﬁ rst contact in the Danish Homeless Register was 
39∙7 years (SD 11∙9) for men and 36∙6 years (12∙0) for 
women. The mean age at death among the 4790 deaths 
was 49∙9 years (SD 11∙7) for men and 49∙6 years (10∙8) 
for women. Table 1 lists demographics and clinical 
characteristics of the study population. The proportion of 
registered psychiatric disorders among homeless people 
in Denmark was high; over 60% of homeless men and 
just under 60% of homeless women had a registered 
psychiatric diagnosis. Substance abuse was the most 
frequently recorded diagnosis for both sexes. We noted 
sex diﬀ erences in the number of contacts in the Danish 
Homeless Register and in the Danish Psychiatric Central 
Register. Compared with men, women seemed to be

younger at their ﬁ rst contact with homeless shelters and 
had fewer contacts in both the Danish Homeless Register 
and in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. Homeless 
men had a higher risk of dying than homeless women 
(reference group; age-adjusted HR 1∙4, 95% CI 1∙3–1∙5; 
data not shown). 
Figure 1 shows SMR by sex and age group. The overall 
SMR for all causes of death was higher for women (6∙7, 
95% CI 6∙2–7∙1) than for men (5∙6, CI 5∙4–5∙8). For men 
and women, respectively, the SMR for diseases and medi- 
cal conditions was 4∙0 (95% CI 3∙8–4∙1) and 4∙2 (3∙9–4∙5), 
for suicide was 7∙3 (6∙3–8∙3) and 14∙8 (10∙9–18∙8), 
for unintentional 
(11∙3–13∙4) 
injuries was 
and 19∙0 (15∙6–22∙5), and for other external causes 
was 19∙7 (16∙9–22∙6) and 32∙1 (23∙4–40∙8). External 
causes accounted for 1161 (27∙9%) of the 4161 deaths for 
which information on cause was available. 

The remaining life expectancy for homeless men aged 
15–24 years was 38∙7 years (95% CI 38∙3–39∙2) and for 
the women it was 47∙4 years (46∙4–48∙5). During the 
same period, the general population of men and women 
in Denmark aged 15–24 years had a remaining life 
expectancy of 60∙3 years (95% CI 60·3–60·4) and 
64∙8 years (64·7–64·8), respectively. Compared with the 
general population, life expectancy at age 15–24 years was 
21∙6 years (95% CI 21·2–22·1) lower for homeless men 
and 17∙4 years (16·4–18·5) lower for homeless women. 
We did Cox analyses on 32 646 people: 22 991 men and 
9655 women; data from 65 people could not be included 
in this anaylsis because of negative follow-up time (eg, if 
a person was registered as dead before they were 
registered in some of the other registries). The mean 
follow-up was 2172∙5 days (SD 1164·2; range 1–4018). 
Table 2 and table 3 show predictors associated with all- 
cause mortality for men and women, respectively. People 
with a registered psychiatric disorder had a higher risk 
of mortality than those without any psychiatric contact 
registered (reference group; data not shown). In a 
multivariable analysis, compared with people with no 
record of psychiatric contact, registered substance abuse 
disorder was associated with a 1∙4-times (95% CI 
1∙3–1∙5) higher risk of dying for men and a 1∙7-times

(1∙7, 1∙4–2∙1) higher risk for women. Registered dual 
diagnosis was also associated with an increased risk of 
death in both men and women. 
The number of contacts to homeless shelters within 
the ﬁ rst year of contact was associated with mortality, 
with higher numbers of contacts associated with 
increased risk of dying (table 2 and table 3). Duration of 
inpatient hospital stays during the last 5 years before the 
ﬁ 
 rst registered shelter contact was not associated with 
risk of dying (data not shown), and there was no 
signiﬁ cant diﬀ erence in mortality between inpatient 
contact and emergency room contact only (data not 
shown). However, these two types of contact were 
associated with signiﬁ cantly increased risk of dying 
compared with both no contact registered and outpatient 
contact (data not shown). 
Table 4 shows the eﬀ ect of diﬀ erent types of registered 
substance abuse diagnoses on the risk of mortality. Abuse 
of opioids was associated with the highest risk of dying 
in men and women compared with no record of substance 
abuse diagnosis. Additionally, abuse of alcohol, sedatives, 
cocaine, cannabis, and other drugs predicted increased 
risk of mortality compared with no record of substance 
abuse diagnosis. 
Figure 2 shows age-adjusted cumulative mortality rates. 
People with substance abuse disorders and those with dual 
diagnosis had the highest probability of dying, whereas the 
probability of dying for people with schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders was equivalent to (women) or lower 
than (men) those without psychiatric contact registered 
and people with other psychiatric disorders. 
Discussion 
Our results show the high proportion of psychiatric 
disorders registered among homeless people. Registered 
substance abuse disorder predicted a higher risk of dying 
in both men and women who had contact with homeless 
shelters in Denmark than individuals without any 
registered psychiatric contact. There was a high excess 
mortality for all causes of death in the homeless shelter 
population, especially for external causes—ie, suicide and 
unintentional injuries (panel). The high proportion of 
psychiatric disorders registered in the Danish homeless 
population, with substance abuse as the most frequent 
diagnosis, is consistent with the results from a meta- 
analysis by Fazel and colleagues.20 However, these 
prevalence estimates were based primarily on men. Little 
data has been reported speciﬁ cally on psychiatric disorders 
in homeless women. 
Using individual, nationwide register data, we were able 
to address some of the limitations of previous studies, 
such as small sample sizes, problems with linking of 
information, and loss to follow-up. We were able to 
provide complete information on hospital contacts and 
cause-speciﬁ c SMR for both sexes for a homeless shelter 
population. We were able to calculate valid estimates with 
greater power than previously,1,16,17 while taking into 
account loss to follow-up and emigration. This study also 
presents a useful cohort database on the Danish homeless 
shelter population, which will continue to provide useful 
information and new possibilities for research on the 
mental health and mortality of homeless people. 
Our overall SMR estimates were high compared with 
estimates from other studies, in which SMRs ranged 
from 2∙8 to 7∙6 for men and from 3∙8 to 6∙5 for 
women.1,11,14 Because of the study design, whether 
homelessness itself is a risk factor for higher mortality or 
whether it is a marker for the already increased mortality 
risk among people with psychiatric disorders is not clear. 



Systematic review 
We searched PubMed, with no date restrictions set, for articles with the following terms: 
“homeless” or “homelessness” in combination with “mortality”, “death”, “risk factors”, 
“predictors”, “psychiatric disorders”, or “mental illness”. We also searched the MeSH 
database, with no date restrictions set, with the following MeSH terms in combination: 
“homeless persons”, and “mental disorders”, and/or “mortality”. All articles that were 
deemed not relevant on the basis of their titles alone were excluded. Abstracts of the 
remaining articles were reviewed to identify potentially relevant articles, and, on the basis 
of this selection, full-text articles were read. Additionally, we scanned reference lists of 
relevant articles. The main criteria for the selection of relevant articles were inclusion of 
homeless people living in homeless shelters, hostels, or rooming houses, or homeless 
people living on the streets; studies from developed countries to delimit the research ﬁ eld 
to countries that oﬀ er comparable living circumstances for homeless; studies written in 
English or Danish; and studies having homelessness and mortality or psychiatric 
disorders, or both, as the major topic. We identiﬁ ed 32 relevant articles published 
between 1975 and 2011. A meta-regression analysis noted high prevalence of psychiatric 
disorders among homeless people.20 However, substantial heterogeneity was reported in 
the prevalence estimates for mental disorders and the results were based on small 
samples of homeless people. Few studies have investigated psychiatric disorders in 
homeless women. The evidence of mortality among homeless people is limited, and 
methodological problems with small sample sizes, loss to follow-up, uncertain linkage of 
data, and few numbers of deaths have been prevalent. However, the mortality ﬁ gures 
were high in all the studies. Substance abuse has been linked to the higher 
mortality.1,3,5,12,14,16 However, the results for mental disorders were not clear.1,3,5,9,11,14,16 
No previous studies provided complete information on psychiatric hospital contact and 
death and optimum linkage of data in a nationwide homeless shelter population. 
Interpretation 
This study is the ﬁ rst to be based on an established nationwide homeless register that 
represents a complete homeless shelter population. 62·4% of men and 58·2% of women 
were registered with at least one psychiatric disorder. Men and women in the homeless 
shelter population had 5·6-times and 6·7-times higher mortality, respectively, than the 
general population. There was a larger disparity in life expectancy between the homeless 
shelter population and the general population than previous studies have found.15 
Cause-speciﬁ c standardised mortality ratios for both sexes showed high excess mortality 
by suicide and unintentional injuries. With complete record linkage and up to 11 years 
follow-up, we were able to calculate cumulative mortality curves for men and women by 
registered psychiatric disorder and we found substance abuse to be the diagnosis 
associated with the highest mortality risk. This study suggests that homeless people living 
in shelters constitute a high-risk population in a public health perspective. This study 
underlines that this marginalised population needs more attention on the health agenda. 

The SMR reported in this study was about twice as high 
as reported for Denmark in a study on mortality among 
people with severe mental disorders,34 which suggests 
that individuals with psychiatric disorders who also are 
homeless have a higher mortality rate than the general 
psychiatric population. Also, a study that compared the 
mortality risk of homeless people with non-homeless 
people reported 
itself confers 
additional risk after adjusting for morbidity.13 

Few studies have previously examined cause-speciﬁ c 
SMR among homeless people. A Swedish study reported 
that excess mortality among homeless men was highest 
from accidents, with 12-times higher mortality compared 
with the general Swedish population.17 However, no 
95% CIs were presented and these results were based 
on only 65 accidental deaths among the homeless. 
Compared with a previous Danish study, which 
presented data for both men and women together,1 our 
SMR for suicide was higher for both sexes, especially 
for women, and for unintentional injury our estimate 
was higher for women. 
Few previous studies have assessed life expectancy 
among homeless people. In a study in Canada,15 life 
expectancy was 13 years shorter for men and 8 years 
shorter for women than a representative sample of the 
population. We noted an even higher discrepancy in life 
expectancy. The 
identiﬁ cation of substance abuse 
and dual diagnosis as predictors of death in this 
Danish homeless sample are consistent with previous 
 ndings.1,3–5,12,14,16 
ﬁ 
People with a record of schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder had a lower risk of dying than those with a 
substance abuse disorder. However, this ﬁ nding does 
not imply that schizophrenia spectrum disorders are not 
associated with an increased risk of dying. Had these 
results been compared with the general population, we 
would probably have found an excess mortality among 
persons with schizophrenia in the homeless shelter 
population, because people with schizophrenia are 
known to have increased mortality levels and the 
precarious social conditions of homeless people might 
further complicate their situation. Our results suggest 
that the health consequences associated with substance 
abuse were more hazardous than those of schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders in this Danish homeless shelter 
population. Previous studies document that a substance 
use disorder reduces the rates of treatment adherence in 
patients with schizophrenia.35 People with schizophrenia 
but no substance abuse might comply better with 
treatment than those who also have substance abuse 
(ie, dual diagnosis). People with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder without contact to the mental health system 
might have an even higher mortality risk than those who 
do have contact. The probability of dying for people with 
no psychiatric contact registered was comparable to or 
higher than those who had been registered with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychiatric 
disorders. This ﬁ nding was not as expected, and might 
suggest that many homeless people have untreated 
psychiatric disorders1 or other problems, such as physical 
diseases.36 Additionally, 
association between 
increased number of contacts to homeless shelters 
within the ﬁ rst year of contact and higher mortality could 
suggest that the transient homeless population is the 
most vulnerable.1 

Our ﬁ ndings that people from low-income and middle- 
income countries had a lower mortality risk than those 
with Danish origin were in line with our expectations. 
The threshold to become homeless in Denmark for 
people with Danish origin might be higher than those 
not of Danish origin because they have better access to 
cash beneﬁ t and widespread knowledge about how to 
access health care and social services. People from low- 
income and middle-income countries do probably, to a 
greater extent than those of Danish origin, become 
homeless for reasons other than psychiatric disorders, 
such as housing problems and unemployment. In other 
words, we would expect that homeless individuals of 
Danish origin might to a greater extent have treated or 
untreated psychiatric disorders than homeless people 
from low-income or middle-income countries. Findings 
from a Canadian study are consistent with this 
hypothesis.37 Our results suggest that people in homeless 
shelters who are from low-income or middle-income 
countries might have other service needs than the people 
from Denmark and other high-income countries. 
Our study has several strengths. First, our results are 
based on a large homeless sample, which is representative 
of the homeless shelter population in Denmark. We have 
no reason to expect that the Danish homeless shelter 
population diﬀ er markedly from those in other welfare 
states that have well-developed social safety nets. Second, 
the use of registers ensures prospective, uniformly and 
neutrally collected data, which restrict the methodological 
problems of loss to follow-up and selection bias. 
Additionally, we were able to take loss to follow-up and 
emigration into account. Third, the information on 
psychiatric hospital contact and death is complete. 
Finally, the CRS number ensures optimum conditions 
for 
linking data on homeless shelter status with 
psychiatric hospital contacts and deaths. 
However, our study has some limitations. First, 
homeless people who do not choose to stay in homeless 
shelters but instead sleep rough on the street were not 
included in this study. We cannot be sure that the results 
are representative of this subgroup. In previous studies, 
non-sheltered homeless people had a higher morbidity 
and mortality rate and were less likely to use health 
services than the sheltered homeless.2,38 We would expect 
our estimates to be conservative, but we cannot know if 
homeless people who do not visit homeless shelters are 
healthier than those who do. Thus, the potential biases 
could go in either direction. Additionally, 5∙5% of the 
homeless sample could not be matched in the CRS, 



partly because some homeless people provided invalid 
CRS numbers. Second, our homeless deﬁ nition was 
broad and classed people as homeless if they had had 
any contact with a homeless shelter from 1999 to 2009. 
Thus, we have not taken into account that some people 
might have temporarily or permanently ceased to be 
homeless during the study period. We expect this factor 
led to an underestimation of our estimates.2 Third, we 
cannot make any statements regarding the causality 
between psychiatric disorders and homelessness. 
However, both homelessness and psychiatric morbidity 
probably contribute to the excess mortality in this 
population, and eﬀ orts to address both of these problems 
would probably be the most eﬀ ective way to improve the 
health status of the homeless shelter population. Fourth, 
only psychiatric disorders treated in psychiatric inpatient 
and outpatient facilities in Denmark were included; 
visits to primary health settings were not. Use of register 
data does not provide optimum conditions for estimation 
of the proportion of psychiatric disorders among 
homeless people, who often are ostracised and isolated 
from societal institutions. Supplementation of register 
data with validated diagnostic interviews would be ideal 
to estimate the exact prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric 
disorders in the homeless shelter population. However, 
we were unable to do diagnostic interviews because we 
were investigating such a large sample. Previous research 
has shown that psychiatric emergency contact 
is 
common among homeless people39 whereas contact with 
general medical services is not.40 We would expect that 
the actual prevalence of psychiatric disorders in this 
Danish homeless shelter population is higher than our 
estimates. Fifth, we were unable to control for all 
potentially relevant confounding factors in the analyses— 
eg, physical diseases,36 social network, and family contact. 
Finally, the Danish Homeless Register has only existed 
for 11 years, which implies that mean age at ﬁ rst contact 
will have been overestimated. 
In this study, we conﬁ rm previous ﬁ ndings that 
homeless people have complex psychiatric problems and 
suggest that especially substance abuse disorders are 
associated with increased mortality risk. Our ﬁ ndings 
underline the urgent need for more sustained eﬀ orts to 
reduce the high psychiatric morbidity and mortality in 
this high-risk group. Additionally, the high excess 
mortality for suicide and unintentional injuries suggests 
that prevention of death from external causes is very 
important in this socially marginalised population.
