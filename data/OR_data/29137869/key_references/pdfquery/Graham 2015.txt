Background: Mortality is known to be extremely high among people who have been imprisoned, but there is 
limited information about the factors that explain this increased risk. Methods: Standard record linkage methods 
were used to link Scottish prison records and mortality data for all individuals imprisoned in Scotland for the first 
time between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2007. Results: Among 76 627 individuals there were 4414 deaths 
(3982 in men). When compared with the general population, the age-standardized mortality rate ratio for those 
imprisoned was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3) for women. Further adjustment for an area measure 
of deprivation accounted for part but not all of this excess risk [adjusted rate ratio 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2) 
for men and women, respectively]. Relative risks were highest for drug and alcohol related causes, suicide and 
homicide and were markedly higher among women than men. Out of prison deaths were most frequent in the 
first 2 weeks after release from prison. Mortality rates were lower in those with longer total duration in prison and 
higher in those with multiple short episodes in prison. Conclusion: People who have been imprisoned in Scotland 
experience substantial excess mortality from a range of causes that is only partly explained by deprivation. The 
association of increased mortality with multiple periods in prison and the concentration of deaths in the early 
period after prison release both have implications for policy and practice.

Introduction 
People who have been imprisoned experience much higher all- 
largely due to 

their increased risk of death from suicide, drug misuse and 
alcohol.1 There is conflicting evidence about mortality experience 
while in prison, with some studies finding increased all-cause 
mortality compared with the general population2–4 and others 
similar5 or reduced6–8 levels. However, there is consistent evidence 
that mortality outside prison is substantially higher than that in the 



The Scottish Prison Service database recorded 92 383 people who 
were in prison at some time between 1 January 1996 and 31 
December 2007. Individuals already in prison on 1 January 1996 
or known to have been in prison at any time before this date were 
excluded (15 756), leaving 76 627 people imprisoned in Scotland for 
the first time between 1996 and 2007. 
Of these, 89% were male (Table 1). The median age at study entry 
(first imprisonment) was 26.7 years for men and 27.0 years for 
women. The mean number of imprisonments during 10 years of 
follow up was 2.8 for men and 2.4 for women, although around 
half had only one imprisonment. The median follow up time was 
6.9 years for men and 6.1 years for women. Similar proportions of 
men and women were married, divorced or separated. The majority 
reported their religion as Christian, and the overwhelming majority 
described their ethnic group as white (92.4% of men, 93.8% of 
women). Among those with non-missing postcodes, 24.2% of men 
and 24.5% of women were living in an area in the most deprived 
Carstairs deprivation quintile at the time of their first imprisonment. 
However, postcodes were unknown for a substantial proportion of 
both men (42.0%) and women (43.7%). 
Data linkage identified 4414 deaths during the study period (3982 
in men). The highest age-specific rate ratios were at younger ages for 
both men and women (Table 2). The overall SMR (standardized for 
age and year of death) for prisoners compared with the general 
population was 3.3 (95% CI 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3) 
for women. After further standardization for deprivation the corres- 
ponding figures were 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2), so that

general population, particularly during the first few weeks after 
release.1,3,9–14 Prisoners are more likely to come from a deprived 
area than the non-prison population,15 but it is not clear whether 
this accounts for their increased mortality rates. Multiple episodes of 
imprisonment have been associated with a chaotic lifestyle and 
possibly with increased mortality, but there is limited evidence 
about whether total duration of imprisonment5,16 or the numbers 
of episodes in prison16–18 are the most relevant. 
Our objectives were to examine the mortality of people who had 
been imprisoned in Scotland: to describe the pattern of causes 
of death; 
length and 
to examine the relative contribution of 
numbers of episodes of imprisonment and to estimate the contribu- 
tion of socioeconomic status (using an area measure of deprivation 
as a proxy) to excess mortality. 




We used a retrospective cohort design to examine mortality among 
those imprisoned in Scotland for the first time between 1996 and 
2007. Data on those imprisoned in Scotland at any time between 1 
January 1996 and 31 December 2007 were extracted from the 
Scottish Prison Service databases (PR1 and PR2), including dates 
of 
status, 
religion and ethnic group. Postcode of residence prior to imprison- 
ment was used to derive the Carstairs index, an area based measure 
of deprivation.19 The Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS 
National Services Scotland routinely obtains data on all deaths in 
Scotland from the National Records of Scotland (NRS). Linkage of 
the prisoner dataset to these death records (using probabilistic 
linkage methods) was used to identify all those who had died up 
to 31 December 2007. Personal identifiers were removed to produce 
an anonymized analysis dataset. The sample size was based on data 
availability so a power calculation was not carried out. 
Carstairs deprivation scores were divided into quintiles based on 
the whole Scottish population. The total time spent in prison was 
grouped into eight categories: <11 days; 11–28 days, 29–54 days, 
55–109 days; 110–219 days; 220–447 days; 448–910 days and 911 
and more days. The period of first imprisonment was grouped into 
3-year periods: 1996–98; 1999–2001; 2002–04 and 2005–07. Causes 
of death were examined by chapter groupings from the International 
Classification of Disease, 9th revision (for deaths prior to 2000) and 
10th revision (for subsequent deaths). Drug and alcohol related 
deaths were examined separately using the ICD9 and ICD10 codes 
shown in Table 3. Place of death (in or out of prison) was derived 
using the incarceration and death dates. Cases with missing data for 
a specific variable were excluded from analyses using that variable. 
The linked dataset was used to calculate indirectly standardized 
mortality ratios (SMRs) for the prison cohort for men and women 
separately using a person-years approach which took account of 
categories. 
spent 
the 
The whole Scottish population was used as the reference standard. 
For the deprivation-adjusted analyses the 2001 Carstairs quintile 
population estimates by age-band and sex were assigned across the 
whole period. All-cause and disease-specific SMRs were calculated 
for men and women, adjusting for age (in 5-year bands) and for 
Carstairs index quintile. Those with missing postcode (and therefore 
Carstairs) information were assigned to the most deprived quintile. 
A sensitivity analysis was carried out excluding all those with missing 
postcodes. SMRs were calculated separately for deaths occurring 
in and out of prison using the person-years method described 
earlier. Poisson regression was used to obtain adjusted mortality 
rate ratios. A series of models were explored and model 
fit 
assessed by examining standardized residual plots and the Akaike 
Information Criterion. Models were checked for over-dispersion. All 
analyses were carried out using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX).

adjustment for deprivation accounted for 43% of the excess risk in 
men and 29% in women. When records with missing deprivation 
information were excluded, the SMR was 3.2 for males and 7.5 for 
females, falling to 2.6 for males and 6.3 for females after additional 
standardisation for deprivation, 26 and 18% of the excess risk re- 
spectively (data not shown). 
In absolute terms, the most common cause of death for both men 
and women was mental and behavioural disorders, (24% of male 
deaths and 40% of female deaths) which were almost exclusively 
due to drug and alcohol related causes (Table 3). The second most 
common cause of death was from suicide and deaths of undetermined 
intent, but cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease also accounted 
for substantial numbers of deaths among both men and women. 
Mortality rates among those who had been imprisoned were 
higher than the general population for almost all causes with differ- 
ences more extreme among women. Compared with the general 
population, men who had been imprisoned were more than four 
times as likely to die from a mental and behavioural disorder and 
women 24 times as likely to die. Men were 3.7 times more likely and 
women 16.9 times more likely to die of accidental poisoning. Men 
were 3.5 times more likely than the general population to die from 
suicide and deaths of undetermined intent, and women 11.7 times 
more likely to do so. Substantially increased mortality rates were also 
apparent for homicide among men (SMR 4.3) and women (22.5), 
for all drug related deaths among men (4.4) and women (19.6) and 
for all causes directly related to alcohol among men (2.8) and 
women (9.1). 
The vast majority (98%) of deaths occurred outside prison. 
Compared with the general population, mortality among men was 
significantly lower while in prison (SMR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5, 0.7). 
Mortality among women in prison was higher (SMR 1.9, 95% CI 
0.9, 3.5) although the confidence interval was wide. Compared with 
the general population, the risk of death while outside prison was 
substantially raised for both men (SMR 2.5, 95% CI: 2.4, 2.6) and 
women (SMR 5.9 95% CI: 5.4, 6.5) and in both cases the out of 
prison mortality rate was substantially higher than the in-prison 
rate. Out-of-prison deaths were most likely to occur in the first 
month after release, particularly in the first 2 weeks; of 1715 
deaths in the first year after release 477 (28%) occurred in the 
first 4 weeks after release; of these 232 (49%) occurred in the first 
week and a further 121 (25%) in the second week. 
Consistent with the finding of lower in-prison mortality, adjusted 
mortality rates fell with increasing time in prison (Figure 1). 
In contrast, after controlling for other factors including total 
length of time in prison, mortality rose with increasing numbers 
of short prison episodes (defined as <6 months in duration), with 
the highest mortality seen in those with 3–7 short prison episodes. 
Mortality rates were not significantly raised in the highest category 
(8–60 episodes), though the CI was wide. Compared with 1996–98, 
there was a slight reduction in mortality in 2002–04 but no 
significant change between the start and the end of the study 
period. Those who were married or in common-law partnerships 
had the lowest mortality and mortality was also significantly lower 
among those of no or non-Christian religion or from non-White 
ethnic groups. 

We found substantially increased all-cause mortality among those 
who had been in prison in Scotland. Excess mortality was largely 
confined to the time out of prison, particularly the immediate period 
after release, and relative mortality was increased among women and 
those with multiple short episodes of detention. The relative 
mortality excess was largest 
for accidental poisoning, suicide, 
homicide and alcohol and drug related causes but was also raised 
for cardiovascular and respiratory causes, infections and (in women) 
lung cancer. The mortality risk was largest among younger age 
groups, with the highest 
seen among younger 
women. In absolute terms, drug-related deaths and suicides were 
the most important single causes of death. Adjustment for socio- 
economic status (using area deprivation as a proxy) accounted for 
less than half of the observed mortality excess. Longer duration of 
imprisonment was associated with lower mortality. There was little 
change in mortality over time.

This study is among the larger studies of prisoner health interna- 
tionally and includes a substantial period of follow up. It is the first 
comprehensive report of cause-specific mortality in a large sample of 
linkage by probability 
prisoners in Scotland. The accuracy of 
matching is limited by the quality of the identifiers in the datasets 
being linked and the range of identifiers available. Personal identi- 
fiers on the deaths and prison datasets are of high quality, and full 
name and date of birth were available. Based on validation studies of 
hospital data linked to deaths in Scotland, we estimate that our 
matching procedures should be around 98% accurate.20 We were 
able to assess the contribution of deprivation to the observed 
mortality excess seen in our study, which, to our knowledge, has 
not been previously reported on. The complete national coverage of 
the prison database means that these results are generalisable to the 
Scottish prisoner population. 
The postcode of previous residence was unknown at study entry 
for over 40% of the cohort, limiting our ability to adjust for depriv- 
ation. We assigned all prisoners with a missing postcode to the most 
deprived quintile, which has the effect of increasing the estimate of 
‘expected’ mortality and providing a conservative (or maximum) 
estimate of the contribution of deprivation to the observed excess 
of mortality in prisoners. As expected, excluding records with 
to which deprivation 
missing postcodes 
accounted for the prisoner mortality excess. 

Individual measures of socio-economic status were not available. 
The area measure of deprivation used in this study is an ecological 
measure of socioeconomic status and therefore the possibility of 
residual confounding remains. No information was available on 
the number of released prisoners who died outside Scotland; such 
deaths would lead to an underestimate of mortality but we do not 
think that this number is likely to be substantial. 
Population estimates by deprivation category are only available at 
census years, so we used Carstairs 2001 population estimates as the 
denominator for deprivation-adjusted analyses across the whole 
therefore slightly 
study time period. The population size is 
underestimated, particularly in more recent time periods. This 
slightly overestimates national death rates and expected deaths and 
so underestimates relative mortality for prisoners. However we 
believe that this effect is likely to be small. 
We excluded 15 756 prisoners who had an imprisonment recorded 
prior to, or were already imprisoned, on 1 January 1996 in order to 
avoid bias caused by including a selected group at low mortality risk 
who had survived to this date. A sensitivity analysis examining 
relative mortality by year of first imprisonment produced findings 
similar to those presented here (data available from authors). 
As with all mortality studies, these results rely on the quality of 
death certification. However the large mortality excesses we observed 
seem unlikely to be explained by death certification inaccuracies. 
The lack of modifiable risk factor information is an additional 
weakness of 
similar studies, and an 
important point to address in future research. 

Our findings are consistent with previous studies of prisoner 
mortality, which have reported SMRs ranging from 1.0 to 9.4 in 
men and 2.6 to 41.3 in women.9 Others have also noted increased 
mortality for mental and behavioural disorders, particularly alcohol 
and drug related deaths, suicide and homicide.2–4,9,10,12 In keeping 
with our findings, other studies have also reported increases in car- 
diovascular5,11,13 and respiratory2,9,11 mortality and lung cancer.11 
Our results are also consistent with many studies that have found 
higher mortality immediately following release.1,3,9–11,13,21 
Other studies have reported either lower mortality in prison than 
in the general population6,7 or a lower mortality excess while in 
prison than out, for all cause mortality,5 natural causes1,2,5 or spe- 
cifically for homicide and suicide.8 Although a 20-year study of the 
mortality of those in prison in England and Wales found a lower risk 
of mortality from deaths from natural causes, (SMR 0.7) overall 
mortality was higher than the general population (SMR 2.93).2 A 
data linkage study of prisoners in Australia found a higher mortality 
risk in prison than in the general population,3 while mortality 
among prisoners in Tennessee in the early 1970s was 20 times 


Figure 1 Deaths and mutually adjusted mortality rate ratios (and 95% CIs) by selected characteristics among adults imprisoned in Scotland 
for the first time between 1996 and 2007 
higher than among the general population.22 In keeping with our 
findings, Binswanger reported that increasing years of incarceration 
was associated with lower risk of mortality23 though Kariminia 
reported 
of 
incarceration.16 



After controlling for length of time in prison, we found higher 
mortality in those with multiple short prison episodes. Kariminia16 
reported stronger associations with number of imprisonments; being 
imprisoned four or more times more than doubled the risk of all- 
cause mortality; others have reported similar findings.24 
The high mortality from drugs, alcohol and suicide is likely to 
relate to the known levels of substance misuse25 and mental health 
problems in the Scottish prison population.26 However, elevated 
risks of mortality are observed across nearly all causes of death, 
suggesting risk factors are not confined to a narrow range. 
The security arrangements, daily routine and limited availability 
together with relative protection from 
of drugs and alcohol 
accidental death or homicide whilst in prison may contribute to 
the reduced in-prison mortality. The successful 
introduction of 
suicide prevention strategies and enhanced drug services in the 
Scottish Prison Service in the early 2000’s are also likely to have 
had a positive effect.27 Another relevant factor may be the higher 
consultation rate of prisoners 
general 
population,28 some of which may be attributed to prison policies 



such as routine medical examination on admission. Prisoners who 
are terminally ill are normally released to die in the community; 
adjustment 
for such compassionate release may contribute to 
lower in-prison mortality.21 
There was little change in mortality rates over time during a 
period when drug and alcohol related mortality was increasing in 
the Scottish population as a whole,29,30 suggesting that prison health 
services may have helped mitigate the impact on prisoners. 
Others have noted the striking health inequalities associated with 
the prison population and the opportunities to tackle health 
inequalities by providing support and supervision in prison and 
after 
the substantially 
elevated mortality among women and in younger age groups 
suggests the need for targeted interventions and consideration of 
community sentences when appropriate. 




The very high mortality rates immediately after release may be due 
to the problems of adjustment to freedom on release or to particu- 
larly high levels of risky behaviour. Drug deaths, suicide and 
homicide 
to post-release 
mortality. Opiate substitution therapy has been shown to be an 
effective measure to reduce drug deaths following liberation31 and 
the provision of naloxone (an opiate antagonist) to prisoners at 
to make an additional contribution. 
release has the potential 
Sustained suicide prevention strategies are vital, from the point of 
reception to release and beyond. A range of suicide risk factors have 
been identified in prisoner populations, in particular a previous psy- 
chiatric history; substance misuse, previous suicide attempts and key 
psychological characteristics.32,33 Violence reduction measures in 
prison and more widely in the community are also important. 
However, elevated risks of mortality are observed across nearly all 
causes of death, indicating the need for a comprehensive approach to 
risk factor reduction such as pre-release assessment and planning and 
facilitating the transition to life outside prison. 
Multiple episodes of short-term imprisonments can result in loss 
of continuity of key relationships, housing and employment 
opportunities which may be important risk factors for mental and 
other health problems. The escalating risk of mortality associated 
with this pattern of 
justice 
approaches 
repeated short periods of detention, 
promote alternatives to custody and provide closer supervision 
and support immediately following release. 




Addressing the healthcare needs of prisoners has the potential to 
reduce re-offending. More generally, 
these findings support a 
broader public health approach to prevention, early detection and 
intervention in offending lifestyles to prevent imprisonment. 
The data linkage methods used by this study offer an efficient and 
information on this 
low cost method of collecting further 
population. This could provide information on long term trends 
in overall and cause-specific mortality which could be used as 
baseline 
intervention studies. 
Mortality rates could also act as health care performance outcome 
indicators for prison based health services.

Background: Both media use and cancer knowledge have been identified as important predictors of a healthy 
lifestyle. However, little is known about the interplay between these two variables, and about differences 
between cancer diagnosed and non-diagnosed consumers of media and knowledge. This study investigated the 
relationship between media use (television and internet exposure) and lifestyle choices of cancer diagnosed 
and non-diagnosed individuals, and looked at the influence of cancer knowledge on this relationship. Methods: 
A cross-sectional, quantitative survey (the Leuven Cancer Information Survey) was administered to 621 cancer 
diagnosed and 1387 non-diagnosed individuals, aged 16–88 years old in Flanders (Belgium). Bivariate analyses, 
hierarchical linear regression analyses and advanced moderation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: 
Internet exposure was not a predictor of lifestyle choices. Television exposure, however, was a negative predictor 
of healthy lifestyle choices. Moreover, television exposure was a direct negative predictor of cancer knowledge, 
which in turn positively predicted lifestyle choices. However, no differences were found in the investigated rela- 
tionships between the two subsamples. Conclusion: These results indicate that higher levels of television exposure 
coincide with less cancer knowledge and with less healthy lifestyle choices. It offers a pathway for intervention by 
suggesting that improving cancer knowledge through television might positively affect lifestyle choices.

Introduction 
Research suggests that 4 out of 10 cancers could be prevented by 
healthier lifestyle choices (e.g. fruit and vegetable consumption, 
increased physical activity) and by early detection.1,2 Increased 
physical activity, 
for instance, has been linked to a decreased 
breast cancer risk.2 Several predictors of lifestyle choices have been 
identified in the literature. This study will examine two communi- 
cation-related predictors of lifestyle choices: media use and cancer 
knowledge. 
One of the media most commonly associated channels with 
unhealthy lifestyle choices is television. Exposure to television has 
been linked to a more sedentary lifestyle,3,4 snacking,5 insufficient 
consumption of fruits and vegetables4 and earlier smoking onset.6 In 
comparison to television, relatively little is known about the rela- 
tionship between internet use and lifestyle choices, despite the 
enormous amount of health information available on the internet.7 
While television exposure is usually identified as a predictor of 
unhealthy lifestyle choices, knowledge has been identified as a 
predictor of healthy lifestyle choices.8 One study reported that a 
low level of cancer knowledge was one of 
the most crucial 
predictors of insufficient cancer screening.9 A study among Latin- 
American women found that cancer knowledge was positively 
associated with perceived self-efficacy for cancer screening.10 Other 
research also found a positive 
relationship between cancer 
knowledge and screening behaviour.11
