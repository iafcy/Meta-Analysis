Rates and correlates of mortality amongst heroin users: Findings from the 
Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS), 2001–2009 





The study aimed to determine mortality rates, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), and correlates of 
mortality amongst the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS) cohort of 615 heroin users over 
the period 2001–2009. The cohort was followed for a total of 4820.1 person years. A total of 31 deaths 
(5% of the cohort) occurred across follow-up. The mean age at death was 34.5 years, and 58% were 
male. The most common cause of death was overdose (68%). The crude mortality rate was 6.43 per 
1000 person years, with no gender difference, and the SMR was 4.56 (males = 2.95, females = 18.57). The 
only signiﬁcant bivariate (hazard ratio = 3.69) and multivariate (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.03) correlate of 
mortality was a history of opioid overdose prior to baseline. Mortality rates were lower than those seen 
outside Australasia. Screening for overdose by those treating heroin users would be appropriate, and may 
contribute to reductions in overall mortality.

Globally, opioids make the largest contribution to illicit drug- 
related death, carry a higher mortality risk than other commonly 
used drugs, and are associated with annual mortality rates typi- 
cally ranging between one and three percent (Bartu et al., 2004; 
Darke et al., 2007a; Miller et al., 2007; Bauer et al., 2008; Bird, 
2010; Stenbacka et al., 2010). It is worth noting that mortality 
rates vary considerably by geographic region. Rates appear high- 
est in Asia, being approximately twice those of western Europe, 
three times those of North America and ﬁve times those of Aus- 
tralasia (Zhang et al., 2005; Bargagli et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007; 
Quan et al., 2007; Azim et al., 2008; Vlahov et al., 2008; Degenhardt 
et al., 2009; Bird, 2010). This may reﬂect differences in underlying 
regional population mortality rates, as well as differences in access 
to drug treatment and health care. 
The major causes of death are overdose, disease (predomi- 
nantly AIDS), suicide and trauma (Bartu et al., 2004; Antolini et al., 
2006; Soyka et al., 2006; Bargagli et al., 2006; Darke et al., 2007a; 
Degenhardt et al., 2009). The relative contribution of these, how- 
ever, varies considerably across countries. In countries with a high 
HIV seroprevalence amongst injecting drug users (IDU), AIDS is a 
major cause of death, while in low prevalence countries overdose,

suicide and trauma play far greater roles (Oppenheimer et al., 1994; 
Antolini et al., 2006; Bargagli et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2008; Soyka 
et al., 2006; Vlahov et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). A number 
of predictors of mortality have been identiﬁed. These include not 
being enrolled in drug treatment, injecting as a route of administra- 
tion, HIV positive serostatus, older age, a longer heroin using career, 
polydrug use, the presence of clinically signiﬁcant psychopathology 
and a suicide history (Quaglio et al., 2001; Bartu et al., 2004; Brugal 
et al., 2005; Soyka et al., 2006; Darke et al., 2007a; Azim et al., 2008; 
Bauer et al., 2008; Clausen et al., 2008; Stoove et al., 2009). Baseline 
predictors are of potentially great clinical importance for determin- 
ing the mortality risk of patients at treatment in-take, which may 
affect treatment delivery. 
The current study aimed to examine mortality rates, and cor- 
relates, amongst the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS) 
cohort over the period from commencement in February 2001 
until October 2009. The cohort consists of entrants to treatment 
for heroin dependence in opioid maintenance, detoxiﬁcation, and 
residential rehabilitation, as well as a comparison group of non- 
treatment users. The Australian setting for the cohort has a HIV 
seroprevalence amongst IDU of less than two percent, with pop- 
ulation wide access to free health care (Mathers et al., 2008). At 
baseline, a wide range of drug use, overdose, psychological, health 
and psychosocial measures were collected (Ross et al., 2005). These 
data were used to determine what were the clinically important 
baseline characteristics predict death over the study period, as in 
similar other studies of opioid users (Gossop et al., 2002).

2. Determine standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for the cohort, 





The data were collected as part of ATOS. Baseline interviews 
were conducted between February 2001 and August 2002, with 
three month (89% followed up), 12 month (80%), 24 month (76%) 
and 36 month (70%) follow-up interviews conducted. Prior to 
recruitment, all treatment agencies in the three modalities across 
the greater Sydney region were mapped. Agencies were then ran- 
domly selected, stratiﬁed by modality and area health service. The 
agencies comprised ten methadone/buprenorphine maintenance 
(MT) agencies, four drug free residential rehabilitation agencies 
(RR) and nine detoxiﬁcation facilities (DTX). In addition, a group of 
heroin users not currently in treatment (NT) were recruited from 
needle and syringe programs in the regional health areas from 
which treatment entrants were recruited. Ethics approvals were 
obtained from the University of New South Wales, and all rele- 
vant area health services. Eligibility criteria were: (i) no treatment 
for heroin dependence in the preceding month, (ii) no imprison- 
ment in the preceding month, (iii) agreed to give contact details 
for follow-up interviews, (iv) aged 18 years or over, and (v) ﬂu- 
ent in English. The total baseline cohort was 615 heroin users: MT 
(n = 201), DTX (n = 201), RR (n = 133) and NT (n = 80). Participants 
were interviewed at baseline, and at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months post- 
baseline, and paid A$20 for completion of each interview. A search 
of the Australian National Death Index was conducted in October 
2009, and details of deaths that had occurred amongst participants 
since 2001 was obtained. Participants were matched by full name, 
gender and date of birth. 

At baseline, participants were administered a structured inter- 
view that included demographics, treatment history, drug use 
history, overdose history, suicide history and a range of psy- 
chopathology. Drug use, needle sharing, injection-related health 
problems and criminal behaviours over the month preceding inter- 
view were measured using the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) (Darke 
et al., 1992). Current (1 month) global mental and physical health 
were measured using the Short-Form 12 (SF12), in which lower 
scores indicate poorer health (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) 
(Ware et al., 1996). DSM IV diagnoses of current (1 month) Major 
depression and lifetime Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were 
obtained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 
(CIDI) (World Health Organization, 1993). Diagnoses of Antisocial 
Personality Disorder (ASPD) were obtained from the Diagnos- 
tic Interview Schedule (Robins et al., 1981), modiﬁed to obtain 
DSM IV diagnoses. International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (10th 
edition) (ICD-10) diagnoses of BPD were obtained using the Inter- 
national Personality Disorders Examination Questionnaire used in 
the National Survey of Mental of Health and Wellbeing (Andrews 
et al., 1999). 

Means and standard deviations were reported for continuous 
variables. Person years of follow-up were calculated from baseline 
interview date until date of death or censorship at October 2010, 
when the search was conducted. Crude mortality rates per 1000 
person years (PY) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calcu- 
lated, as were standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) by reference to 
age speciﬁc death rates in the Australian population (Australian 
Bureau of Statistics, 2010). Bivariate Cox proportional hazards 
regressions were performed to determine unadjusted hazard ratios 
(HR) for baseline characteristics in the domains of demographics, 
drug use, overdose, suicide, psychopathology health and crime. In 
order to determine independent predictors of mortality, a multi- 
variate Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted. Age, 
sex and all variables with a p value <0.1 from the bivariate analyses 
were entered into the model. All analyses were conducted using 
PASW, Release 18 (SPSS Inc., 2009). 


The mean age of participants was 29.3 years (SD 7.8, range 
18–56), and 66% were male. The sample had completed a mean 
of 10.0 years of secondary education (SD 1.7, range 2–12), 29% 
had completed a trade/technical course, and six percent a uni- 
versity degree. The main sources of income were: social security 
allowances (46%), criminal activity (24%) and wage/salary (18%). 
It should be noted that these are main, and not sole, sources of 
income. 
The mean age of ﬁrst intoxication was 13.7 years (SD 3.3, range 
2–34 years). The mean age of ﬁrst heroin use was 19.6 years (SD 5.3, 
range 9–43 years), and the mean length of heroin use career at time 
of interview was 9.5 years (SD 7.4, range <1–35 years). The sam- 
ple had used heroin on a mean of 20.1 days (SD 8.1, range 1–28) 
in the four weeks preceding interview, 54% reported a history of 
heroin overdose, and 8% were non-injectors. The sample had used 
a mean of 9.0 (SD 1.7, range 3–11) drug classes in their lives, and 
4.8 (SD 1.7, range 2–9) in the preceding month. Ninety percent had 
previously been enrolled in a treatment program for opiate depen- 
dence. The mean SF12 global physical health score was 43.9 (SD 
9.8, range 15.5–65.4) and the mean global health score was 31.7 
(SD 11.1, range 8.9–67.3). A diagnosis of current (1 month) major 
depression was received by 25%, and 33% has attempted suicide. 
Forty one percent met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, 46% 
for a diagnosis of BPD and 73% for ASPD. 
Across the 36 month follow-up period of ATOS, there was sub- 
stantial cross-over between treatment modalities (Teesson et al., 
2008). Amongst the NT group, 93% received some form of treat- 
ment by 36 months (MT 40%, RR 21%, DTX 50%). Similarly, there 
was substantial crossover between baseline treatment groups: MT 
(RR 5% and DTX 11%), RR (MT 26% and DTX 36%) and DTX (MT 33% 
and RR 37%). 

The cohort was followed for a total of 4820.1 PY. A total of 31 
deaths (5%) occurred across follow-up, of which 18 (58%) were 
male. The crude mortality ratio was 6.43 per 1000 PY (95% CI 
4.37–9.13 per 1000 PY), with no signiﬁcant gender difference 
(Table 1). The SMR for the cohort was 4.56 (CI 3.09–6.47). Males 
had a SMR of 2.95 (CI 1.75–4.66) and females 18.57 (CI 9.89–31.52). 
Causes of death were: overdose (n = 19, 68%), disease (n = 7, 23%) 
and suicide (n = 2, 7%). In 3 cases the cause of death was unknown, 
due to lags in the National Death Index in providing full details of 
a death. Of the 19 known overdose fatalities, 16 had a history of 
overdose prior to enrolment in ATOS, and both suicides had made 
attempts prior to ATOS enrolment.

The mean age at death was 34.5 years (SD 8.1, range 20–55 
years), with no difference between males and females (36.2 v 33.0, 
p = 0.28). The mean elapsed time between baseline and death was 
4.4 years (SD 2.4, range 0.2–8.0 years), and mean length of heroin 
use 15.2 years (SD 8.6, range 1–32 years). There were no differ- 
ences between the index treatment groups in the proportions of 
decedents (p = 0.44): MT (3.5%), RR (7.5%), DTX (5.0%) and NT (5.0%). 

The only signiﬁcant bivariate association with mortality was a 
history of opioid overdose (Table 1). There was no signiﬁcant dif- 
ference in mortality rates for those who had overdosed on a single 
occasion (11.43 95% CI 5.24–21.72 per 1000 PY) and those who had 
overdosed on multiple occasions (8.96, 95% CI 5.12–14.54 per 1000 
PY) There were no signiﬁcant associations with demographic char- 
acteristics, length of drug use career, past month heroin and other 
drug use, suicide history, psychopathology, baseline health (one 
month) or baseline criminal activity (one month). 
In order to determine independent predictors of mortality and 
adjusted hazard ratios, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
regression was conducted. Age (years), sex (Male = 1, Female = 0) 
and all variables with a p value <0.1 from the bivariate analyses 
were entered into the model: baseline benzodiazepine use (Yes = 1, 
No = 0), baseline antidepressant use (Yes = 1, No = 0), overdose his- 
tory (Yes = 1, No = 0), baseline suicide attempt history (Yes = 1, 
No = 0). Again, the only signiﬁcant predictor of mortality was a 
history of overdose prior to baseline (Table 1). 

Several major ﬁndings emerged. First, the cohort died at four and 
a half times the expected population rate, and at rates consistent 
with earlier Australian studies. Second, overdose was overwhelm- 
ingly the major cause of death. Finally, and related to this, overdose 
history was the only signiﬁcant predictor of mortality. 
The crude mortality rate of the cohort was consistent with ear- 
lier Australian studies of opioid users (Bartu et al., 2004; Digusto 
et al., 2004; Tait et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009), and was 
substantially lower than those seen in Europe, Asia and North 
America (Zhang et al., 2005; Bargagli et al., 2006; Miller et al., 
2007; Quan et al., 2007; Vlahov et al., 2008; Bird 2010). In all prob- 
ability this reﬂects the very low rates of HIV infection amongst 
Australian opioid users. In all Australian mortality studies con- 
ducted to date, disease has played a negligible role in mortality 
compared to cohorts from other regions. As noted above, it may also 
partially reﬂect the relative ease of access to free drug treatment in 
the Australian health system. 
The demographic characteristics of decedents were typical of 
opioid deaths worldwide, in that they were predominantly male, 
aged on average in their thirties, injectors and had long heroin use 
careers. Despite the predominance of male fatalities, there was no 
gender difference in mortality rates, which is consistent with the 
bulk of studies internationally that report small, or no, gender dif- 
ferences (Oppenheimer et al., 1994; Sanchez-Carbonell and Seus, 
2000; Bartu et al., 2004; Darke et al., 2007a; Bargagli et al., 2006; 
Bauer et al., 2008; Stenbacka et al., 2010). Consistent with earlier 
work, however, female SMRs were substantially higher than those 
of males, reﬂecting the lower base population mortality rate of 
females. If the mortality rates of male and female illicit drug users 
are similar, as here, the SMR of female drug users will always be 
far greater compared to other females, than for male drug users 
compared to other males. 
Consistent with earlier Australian research, and the status of 
Australian IDU as a low HIV seroprevalence population, overdose 
dominated the cause of death (Bartu et al., 2004; Digusto et al., 
2004; Tait et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). In the Australian 
setting it is the risk of overdose that poses the single greatest threat 
to the life of the active heroin user. Interestingly, there was no dis- 
cernable difference between single or multiple overdose histories 
prior to baseline. It is an overdose history per se that is of clini- 
cal relevance for mortality risk. The fact that an overdose history 
predicted subsequent mortality is consistent with earlier studies 
of non-fatal overdose in which a prior history of overdose strongly 
predicted future non-fatal overdose (Cook et al., 1998; Powis et al., 
1999; Cofﬁn et al., 2007; Darke et al., 2007c). Amongst the ATOS 
cohort over the initial 36 months, an overdose in any one year was 
associated with an approximately six fold increase in the risk of an 
overdose in the subsequent year (Darke et al., 2007c). The current 
study indicates that this risk extends to predicting death. Indeed, 
of the 19 known overdose deaths, 16 had overdosed prior to ATOS 
enrolment. The data are consistent with retrospective data of those 
previously attended for overdose, where overdose was associated 
with subsequent risk of overdose mortality (Stoove et al., 2009). 
Similarly, both known suicides had histories of suicide attempts, 
consistent with the cohort’s pattern of past attempts strongly pre- 
dicting future ones (Darke et al., 2007b). 
The study is also of interest for what did not predict mor- 
tality. The most salient example was the absence of difference 
between those entering the treatment modalities and those not 
seeking treatment. As discussed earlier, treatment is associated 
with reduced drug use and mortality (Soyka et al., 2006; Clausen 
et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009). The natural history of the 
cohort, however, eroded the validity of such comparisons. By 12 
months, three quarters of the NT group had entered drug treat- 
ment, and over 90% had done so by 36 months (Ross et al., 2006; 
Teesson et al., 2008). Similarly, there was substantial movement 
between the treatment modalities across time, which confounds 
any comparative analyses of mortality rates between modalities. 
Route of administration also did not predict mortality, despite being 
associated with lower rates of non-fatal overdose in the cohort 
(Darke et al., 2008), and being associated with lower death rates 
in other studies (Bird, 2010). As with treatment, however, com- 
parisons were eroded by the fact that transitions between routes 
occurred, primarily from non-injecting to injecting (Darke et al., 
2008). No form of psychopathology predicted death, in all prob- 
ability reﬂecting the role of overdose, rather than suicide, as the 
predominant cause of death. The absence of health as a predictor 
reﬂects the low rate of HIV amongst Australian opioid users, and the 
relative health of the cohort. While the global health of the cohort 
was half a standard deviation below the population norm at base- 
line, by 12 months the cohort average had improved to population 
norms (Teesson et al., 2008). 
The major implication of this research for treatment agencies 
concerns screening for overdose histories. Overdose was the major 
cause of death, and a history of overdose increased the risk of death 
three fold across follow-up. Indeed, it was only overdose histo- 
ries that predicted death. Screening for overdose histories would 
appear prudent in determining patient risk, both for overdose and 
death, and tailoring intervention for high risk patients. 
As in all studies, caveats must be borne in mind. First, caution 
should be exercised in extending conclusions to other heroin using 
populations. The ATOS cohort, like most cohorts, was regular heroin 
users, with an extensive previous treatment history. There may well 
be differences in mortality rates and correlates amongst less fre- 
quent heroin users. It must be borne in mind, however, that the 
overwhelming demographics of death amongst heroin users are 
long-term users, similar in characteristics to the ATOS cohort. Sec- 
ond, the exclusion of those who had been in prison in the month 
prior to baseline interview should be borne in mind, as this is a 
high risk period. Third, ofﬁcial statistics are always prone to lags 


and possible omissions. We were thus not able to determine the 
cause of death for three cases. Finally, the detailed treatment and 
life events history of the cohort across the period were unknown, 
and follow-up interviews were restricted to 36 months. As noted 
above, however, this was a study of clinically relevant baseline 
characteristics that might be of use in determining the mortality 
risk for new treatment entrants. Also, the natural history of treat- 
ment means that any comparison between the modalities would 
be confounded by exposure to enrolments in multiple modalities. 
In summary, death rates amongst this cohort were lower than 
those seen outside Australasia. Overdose dominated the deaths 
amongst the cohort, and an overdose history was the sole predictor 
of mortality. Screening for overdose by those treating heroin users 
would be appropriate, and may contribute to reductions in overall 
mortality.
