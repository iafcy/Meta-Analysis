Aims To examine changes in causes of death in a cohort treated for opioid dependence, across time and age; quantify 
years of potential life lost (YPLL); and identify avoidable causes of death. Design People in New South Wales (NSW) 
who registered for opioid substitution therapy (OST), 1985–2005, were linked to a register of all deaths in Australia. 
Setting NSW, Australia. Measurements Crude mortality rates (CMRs), age–sex-standardized mortality rates 
(ASSRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) across time, sex and age. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were 
calculated with reference to Australian life tables and by calculating years lost before the age of 65 years. 
Findings There were 43 789 people in the cohort, with 412 216 person-years of 
follow-up. The proportion of 
the cohort aged 40+ years increased from 1% in 1985 to 39% in 2005. Accidental opioid overdoses, suicides, transport 
accidents and violent deaths declined with age; deaths from cardiovascular disease, 
liver disease and cancer 
increased. Among men, 89% of deaths were potentially avoidable; among women, 86% of deaths were avoidable. 
There were an estimated 160 555 YPLL in the cohort, an average of 44 YPLL per decedent and an average of 
29 YPLL before age 65 years. Conclusions Among a cohort of opioid-dependent people in New South Wales, 
1985–2005, almost nine in 10 deaths in the cohort were avoidable. There is huge scope to improve mortality among 
opioid-dependent people.

Elevated mortality rates and excess mortality have been 
well described in opioid-dependent populations in devel- 
oped countries. Dependent opioid users in these countries 
may be 15 times more likely to die than their non-opioid- 
using peers [1]. Drug overdose is the most common cause 
of death and chronic diseases, suicide and injury also 
contribute to excess mortality [1–3]. 
In recent decades changes have been observed in the 
contribution of different causes of death to premature 
mortality in opioid users. For example, AIDS-related 
deaths in Italy and Spain increased throughout the 
1980s and 1990s, and then decreased after the introduc- 
tion of highly active antiretroviral therapy [2,4–6]. 
Recent studies have reported an increased contribution 
of 
liver disease [7,8] and cancer [9] to mortality in 
Australian cohorts. Few studies, however, have described 
the full range of causes of death in this population and 
how they have varied over time and with age [1,10]. This 
is a particularly pertinent issue given the ageing of 
opioid-dependent populations in Australia and western 
Europe [11,12]. 
A second important public health consideration is to 
what extent deaths among opioid-dependent people are 
avoidable, given current knowledge about effective pre- 
‘avoidable 
ventive and health care [13]. Analysis of 
mortality’ and years of potential life lost may identify 
potential targets for intervention [10]. Avoidable mortal- 
ity includes conditions in which current health care may 
reduce case fatality, as well as conditions for which there 
are effective preventive interventions [13]. 



We were able to examine causes of death and poten- 
tially avoidable mortality in a cohort of all opioid- 
dependent people who entered opioid substitution therapy 
(OST) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 
1985 and 2005. Our aims were to (i): describe changes in 
causes of death across time and age group (ii); quantify 
years of potential life lost; and (iii) identify potentially 
avoidable causes of death in an Australian population of 
opioid-dependent people seeking treatment. 


Data for this study were derived from the Pharmaceutical 
Drugs of Addiction System (PHDAS) database and the 
National Death Index (NDI). The PHDAS contains records 
of all people in New South Wales (NSW) who register for 
opioid substitution treatment. Records for all people reg- 
istering for OST during the calendar years 1985–2005 
were linked probabilistically to the NDI, a statutory regis- 
ter of all deaths, including cause of death, in Australia. 
Linkage was performed by staff at the Australian Institute 
of Health and Welfare (the NDI data custodian) using an 
in-house probabilistic record linkage program called 
REMA (REcord MAtcher). The variables used for match- 
ing included full name, date of birth, sex and date and 
State of last known contact. 

Causes of death were recorded in the NDI using the Inter- 
national Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) version 9 (for 
deaths occurring 1985–96) and version 10 (1997– 
2005). Using data coded using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 in 
Australia for 1997 and 1998, we found ICD-9 and 
ICD-10 groupings to be consistent [14]. 
The most common causes of death were classiﬁed 
according to the categories deﬁned in Randall et al. [15]. 
This coding scheme is intentionally neither mutually 
exclusive nor exhaustive. Deaths were classiﬁed as drug- 
related (with subordinate categories of accidental opioid- 
related or accidental other drug-related), unintentional 
injuries (with subordinate category of motor vehicle acci- 
dent), violence, suicide, liver-related (with subordinate 
categories of chronic liver disease and viral hepatitis), 
cardiovascular, cancer, HIV, alcohol-related, chronic res- 
piratory disease and respiratory infections. 
A set of mutually exclusive causes of death was also 
coded, with the most common causes of death given 
prominence. Mutually exclusive categories were: acciden- 
tal opioid-related, accidental other drug-related, suicide, 
motor vehicle accidents, violence, liver-related, cardio- 
vascular, cancer and HIV, with all other deaths coded as 


‘other’. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes included in each cat- 
egory are available in the online appendix. 
We followed Page et al. [13] in classifying conditions 
into the broad ‘avoidable’ category, that included ‘ame- 
nable’ causes—for which existing health-care interven- 
tions could reduce case fatality—and ‘preventable’ 
causes—mortality which could be avoided through pre- 
vention at the individual and/or population level through 
life-style and environmental modiﬁcation or health 
policy. Their taxonomy of conditions was applied to the 
causes of death in our cohort (for details of all conditions 
see [13]). It is important to note that we have reported 
only the overarching category of ‘avoidable’ because of 
changes over the study period in availability of effective 
prevention and treatment interventions and access to 
these interventions. The intent with these analyses was to 
estimate the extent of avoidable mortality (regardless of 
whether or not it could be avoided through prevention or 
treatment). While there may have been some changes to 
causes of deaths considered ‘avoidable’ during the study 
period, Page et al. applied their taxonomy to Australian 
deaths between 1997 and 2001, and the bulk of the 
deaths in our data (82%) occurred after 1995. 

All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 [16]. 
Total and cause-speciﬁc crude mortality rates (CMRs) and 
Poisson 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated 
from the number of deaths and the number of person- 
years (PY) follow-up. PY were calculated by age, calendar 
year and sex, from the ﬁrst treatment registration until 
death or 31 December 2005, whichever occurred ﬁrst. 
Directly age–sex–standardized mortality rates (ASSRs, 
standardized to the average age and sex proﬁle of the 
cohort) and Poisson 95% CI were calculated and year 
group (1985–89, 1990–94, 1995–99, 2000–05) was 
entered into a Poisson regression model adjusted for age 
group and sex to determine the signiﬁcance of trends in 
standardized mortality over time. Standardized mortality 
ratios (SMRs) with Poisson 95% CI were calculated as the 
observed number of deaths divided by the expected 
number of deaths, with age-, sex- and year-speciﬁc mor- 
tality rates in the NSW population used to calculate the 
expected number of deaths. 
We compared the percentage of avoidable deaths in 
the cohort by sex to the percentage of these causes of 
death in the general Australian population for 15–64- 
year-olds in order to achieve a reasonably comparable age 
group. 
Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated in 
two ways. First, we used Australian life tables available on 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics website (http:// 
www.abs.gov.au). Life tables by year and sex were avail- 




able from 1993 to 2005; for 1985 to 1992, the 1993 life 
tables were used. For each death, the number of years of 
potential 
life lost was determined by the difference 
between the average life expectancy for someone of the 
same age and sex in that calendar year, and the age at 
death of the cohort member. Secondly, we calculated the 
number of years of life lost before the age of 65. This is 
the YPLL method used by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention [17]. 

Approval for the study was obtained from the NSW Popu- 
lation and Health Services Research Ethics Committee 
and the University of New South Wales Human Research 
Ethics Committee. 

The study cohort included 43 789 people; 28 939 men 
(66%) and 14 860 women. There was a total of 412 216 
PY of follow-up, with a median follow-up duration of 8.7 
years. The age proﬁle of the cohort changed over time, 
with the proportion of the cohort aged 40 years or older 
increasing from 1% in 1985 to 39% in 2005 (Cochrane– 
Armitage trend test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The sex proﬁle of 
the cohort also changed, with the proportion of men in 
the cohort increasing from 57% in 1985 to 65% in 2005 
(Cochrane–Armitage trend test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). 
due to unintentional injuries (n = 975; 26% of all deaths) 
and suicide (n = 484; 13% of all deaths). 
There was a dramatic decrease in standardized drug- 
related mortality rates from 1999–2000 to 2001–02 
strong 
(Table 1, Fig. 2). Furthermore, 
increases in accidental injury mortality rates across the 
follow-up period (Table 1). It is important to note that 
there may have been period and cohort effects in these 
mortality rates which it is difﬁcult to disentangle. 

The overall age-, sex- and year-standardized mortality 
ratio was 6.5 (95% CI = 6.3–6.7), indicating that our 
cohort had 6.5 times the rate of mortality than that 
expected in the population. Cause-speciﬁc excess mortal- 
ity across time is shown in Table 2. The causes with the 
greatest excess mortality rates were viral hepatitis (SMR 
46.3; 95% CI = 38.5–55.2) and drug-related deaths 
(SMR 39.9; 95% CI = 38.0–41.8). 
Table 3 shows that women were signiﬁcantly more 
likely than men to die of 
cardiovascular disease 
(P = 0.03), cancer (P = 0.03) or violence (P = 0.002), 
while men were signiﬁcantly more likely than women to 
die of suicide (P = 0.05). There were clear trends in 
causes of death with increasing age. Accidental opioid 
overdoses (P < 0.0001), suicides (P < 0.0001), motor 
(P < 0.0001) and violent deaths 
vehicle accidents 
(P = 0.003) all declined with age, while deaths related 
to cardiovascular disease (P < 0.0001), 
liver disease 
(P < 0.0001) and cancer (P < 0.0001) increased with 
age. 


There were 3685 deaths in the cohort between 1985 and 
2005 for a crude mortality rate of 894 per 100 000 PY 
(95% CI = 865, 923) (Table 1). The majority of deaths 
were drug-related (n = 1932; 52%), with most of these 
(n = 1574; 82% of all drug-related deaths) coded as acci- 
dental opioid deaths. The bulk of remaining deaths were 
Eighty-eight per cent (3240 of 3685) of all cohort deaths 
were from potentially avoidable causes: 89% of deaths in 
men and 86% of deaths in women. To provide a compari- 
son for illustrative purposes, 73% of deaths among the 
Australian population aged 15–64 years from 1997 to 
2001 were considered avoidable [13].

Using the Australian life tables approach, there was an 
estimated 160 055 YPLL in this cohort, an average of 44 
YPLL per person who died, and 29 years of YPLL before 
age 65 (Table 4). Just under half (45%) of the YPLL were 
due to accidental opioid-related deaths (an average loss 
of 46 years of potential life, or 31 years prior to age 65). 
Motor vehicle accidents accounted for the highest 
average YPLL, 47 years, or 33 years before age 65.

NSW. This cohort is likely to represent the majority of 
opioid-dependent people in that State during this period, 
perhaps as high as 80% [18]. The proportion of males in 
the cohort increased marginally over time. The cohort 
aged signiﬁcantly over the study period, reﬂecting a com- 
bination of the ageing of cohort members who enrolled 
early in the study period and lower rates of younger 
entrants in the latter part of the study period. This ageing 
effect has been noted in other Australian studies of people 
who inject drugs as well as opioid users. One potential 
reason for this trend could be the Australian ‘heroin 
shortage’ (discussed in more detail below) beginning 
in 2001. From 2001, 
there is good evidence that 
population-level drug injecting decreased [19] as did 
blood-borne virus (BBV) notiﬁcations among young 
people [20]. Younger injectors may have ceased injecting 
following the reduction in heroin supply and there were 
fewer new initiates to heroin use [21]. Since 2001, sur- 
veillance studies of needle and syringe programme 
attendees [22] and regular drug injectors sampled in the 
Illicit Drug Reporting System [18,23,24] have docu- 
mented steady increases in the average age of injectors. 
The substantial increase in accidental drug-induced 
deaths during the mid to late 1990s coincided with ready 
availability of heroin in major Australian drug markets 
[25]. This was followed by a substantial decrease in 
drug overdose mortality in 2001 that coincided with a 
decrease in heroin availability and an increase in its price 
in Australia [26] after the beginning of 2001 and was 
sustained for the remainder of the study period [27–29]. 




Further impacts of the Australian ‘heroin shortage’ have 
been discussed in detail elsewhere [27,30]. 
Liver disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer 
became increasingly important sources of mortality over 
time. It is likely that this trend will continue in the future, 
as the cohort ages. These ﬁndings agree with the results 
of similar analyses of mortality in the United Kingdom, 
where mortality from chronic diseases increasingly domi- 
nates mortality in opioid users over 40 years of age [31]. 
Our examination of mortality due to various causes in 
a population of Australian opioid users found different 
results from opioid-dependent cohorts in Spain [4]. The 
higher HIV-related mortality in Spain reﬂects the much 
lower levels of HIV infection among Australian users, 
thanks in part to the HIV prevention effects of the early 
introduction of OST and needle and syringe programmes 
(NSPs) in the mid-1980s [32,33]. 
The average of 44 years of potential life lost for each 
fatality in the cohort highlights the fact that deaths in 
opioid users often occur at a young age. This was particu- 
larly the case for avoidable causes of death such as drug 
overdose and injuries. The pattern of YPLL was broadly 
similar to previous analyses of a Californian male cohort 
(n = 581) in the United States, followed from 1962 to 
1997 [10]. Both studies found that opioid overdoses were 
the largest contributor to YPLL, but suicides made a 
larger contribution to YPLL in our cohort, and homicide a 
larger contribution in the Californian cohort. An addi- 
tional, striking difference was that the average YPLL prior 
to the age of 65 years per death was far higher in our 
cohort than in the US cohort (mean of 28.7 years versus 
18.3 years, respectively). 
The results suggest the need for different approaches 
to reducing mortality in younger and older opioid users. 
The highest mortality risk at younger ages is from over- 
dose, which remains the most frequent cause of death in 
this population despite the sustained and substantial 
decrease in these deaths since 2001. Enrolment in OST 
decreases the risk of fatal overdose signiﬁcantly [1], but 
poor retention [34] means that many clients are exposed 
to an elevated overdose risk after treatment cessation 
and on re-induction to methadone [34,35]. In previous 
analyses of 
treatment exposure in this cohort, we 
observed that at least half of follow-up time was spent out 
of treatment [35]. This means that there is clearly sub- 
stantial room to improve retention rates in OST in this 
population and thereby decrease overdoses. There are 
additional elevated risks of drug-related mortality in par- 
ticular following release from prison [36], which is a 
common experience for many opioid-dependent people. 
In other work with this cohort, four in 10 had had at least 
one prison episode between 2000 and 2012 [37]. 
Additional interventions are needed to reduce over- 
dose deaths when opioid-dependent people are not 
enrolled in OST. These include making naloxone available 
for peer administration to reduce fatal overdose [38–40] 
and measures to reduce overdose mortality after release 
from prison [36], where evidence is needed urgently on 
effective preventive interventions. Safe injection facilities 
can probably reduce overdose events in those who use 
them, but their limited scale of operation in most of the 
countries that allow them suggests that these facilities 
will have limited impact on opioid overdose mortality at a 
population level [41]. 
In older opioid-dependent people there are higher 
rates of death due to chronic diseases, reﬂecting 
increased risks of chronic infection with BBV such as 
HCV [42], heavy and dependent alcohol use [43] and 
cigarette smoking [43]. Although HIV is not prevalent 
among opioid-dependent people in Australia [44], this is 
an additional risk for mortality in many populations of 
opioid users world-wide [1]. Targeted prevention and 
treatment strategies are clearly needed. These include 
HCV screening and treatment [45]; HBV vaccination 
[46]; HIV prevention and treatment [33]; screening for 
and treatment of hazardous alcohol use; and smoking 
cessation interventions. 
Older OST clients are likely to have a broader range of 
physical and mental health problems for which they 
might seek treatment [47,48]. These could be delivered 
via OST clinics dealing with an ageing population with 
better retention in older users. It is also important to con- 
sider alternative platforms where this population may 
present or receive other health interventions and where 
preventive interventions may still be delivered, including 
general practice, hospital emergency departments and 
aged care services [49]. 


it relied on 
This study has several 
administrative data sets that were not designed for 
research purposes. The two data sets were linked 
probabilistically, creating a potential for errors in linkage. 
We believe that the linkage accuracy is high, given the 
similarity in our overall mortality patterns to that in Aus- 
tralian cohort of illicit drug users, where more detailed 
individual information was used to link to causes of death 
[50]. Secondly, although our cohort is comprised of 
opioid users who sought treatment, sentinel surveillance 
studies of people who inject drugs (98% of whom have a 
history of heroin use) suggest that half 
the opioid- 
dependent population are in OST at any time, and more 
than 80% report at least one episode of OST [18,23,24]. 
Thus, we believe that our cohort is reasonably repre- 
sentative of dependent opioid users in NSW. Thirdly, 
although we identiﬁed a cohort of people who were 
opioid-dependent upon treatment entry, not all people 


would have remained dependent for the entire period of 
follow-up. This means that we are not necessarily track- 
ing mortality in actively dependent opioid users. Never- 
theless, there is good reason to believe that many 
remained actively opioid-dependent. For example, among 
those who entered OST between 1985 and 1994 and who 
were still alive on 1 January 1995 (n = 17 253), 11 060 
(64%) had an episode of treatment in the period 1995– 
2006. This suggests that the great majority of our cohort 
were opioid-dependent across the study period. In so far 
as a proportion of this cohort was not, then our study 
ﬁndings have underestimated mortality among opioid- 
dependent people. Additionally, there are some exposures 
that occur during periods of active opioid use (e.g. 
hepatitis/HIV infection) whose consequences (e.g. AIDS 
and viral hepatitis-related deaths) persist even if opioid 
use ceases, so mortality related to these causes does not 
necessarily lessen with abstinence. 

This study documented elevated mortality among opioid- 
dependent people, and a large loss of years of life because 
of the early age at which many deaths occurred. Acciden- 
tal drug overdose was the largest contributor to death, 
especially among younger users, and contributed most to 
YPLL. As this cohort has aged, the proﬁle of deaths has 
changed. Strategies to reduce deaths vary with age. In 
younger users, it is desirable to increase retention in OST 
to reduce overdose deaths and provide naloxone to reduce 
deaths outside treatment. In older adults, strategies to 
reduce BBV infection and liver disease and cardiovascular 
and respiratory diseases need to be the focus.
