Aims: The present study investigates one-year incidence of mortality from suicide and other causes among 
heroin users in Taiwan. 
Design: A prospective national register-based cohort study. 
Setting: All heroin users who attended the methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs in all treat- 
ment centers in Taiwan. 
Participants: The sample comprised 10,842 heroin users attending MMT. Between Jan 2006 and Dec 2007, 
cases were identiﬁed through the multiple-center register system and followed until Dec 2008 for date 
and cause of death on the Taiwan national mortality database. 
Measurements: Standardized mortality ratios within one year of starting MMT were calculated as a ratio of actual 
versus expected numbers of deaths in the general population in Taiwan. Cox regression models were ﬁtted to 
estimate the effects of gender, age, education and marital status as well as heroin related behaviors. 
Findings: In total, 256 cases died, 67 through suicide. The mortality rate (per 100 person-years) in the ﬁrst year of 
all-cause and suicide was 1.71 and 0.45 respectively, representing 7.5- and 18.4-fold age- and gender-standardized 
mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the general population. Besides, the mortality rate in the ﬁrst year of overdoses, 
murder, HIV, somatic was 0.19, 0.02, 0.07, and 0.75 respectively, representing 68.4-, 27.7-, 76.8-, and 4.3-fold SMR 
increases to the general population. Older age and unemployment were independent risk factors for mortality. Fe- 
males had higher standardized mortality ratio than males for suicide and all-cause mortality. 
Conclusions: Results showed higher risk of suicide and other-cause mortality among heroin users in MMT than 
general population. Suicide is an important contributor to overall excess mortality among heroin users in 
MMT, and especially among women. Suicide prevention and physical health monitoring are important compo- 
nents of MMT programs.

Heroin use is linked to premature death. An updated meta-analysis 
has reported the mortality rates estimated are between 0.38 and 7.76 
per 100 person-years (PY), with a pooled mortality rate of 2.09 PY 
(Degenhardt et al., 2011). The rates are six to thirty times higher than 
in the general population (Darke, Degenhardt, & Mattick, 2007). The 



main causes of mortality are drug overdoses, trauma including suicide 
and homicide, and somatic causes including blood-borne infections 
(Clausen, Waal, Thoresen, & Gossop, 2009). Substance use is an indepen- 
dent indicator for suicide after controlling for depression, personality 
and life events (Cheng, Chen, Chen, & Jenkins, 2000), and the standard- 
ized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide for heroin users is 14 times that 
expected of matched peers (Darke & Ross, 2002). In a national sample 
of drug abusers entering treatment services throughout England, it 
was found that more than a quarter of the patients reported suicidal 
thoughts before treatment (Gossop et al., 1998). It was also shown 
that 10.9% of heroin users attempted suicide within one month before 
attending the methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) (Chen et al., 
2010). 
Most studies of the problems and treatment responses of dependent 
opioid users have been conducted in Western countries (Degenhardt et 
al., 2011) and it is unclear whether such ﬁndings can be generalized to 
other sociocultural settings. In particular, only four studies of mortality 
among heroin dependent users have reported ﬁndings from Asia (Azim 
et al., 2008, 2009; Quan et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). These found 
mortality rates that were higher than in most Western countries. How- 
ever, the possible links between heroin dependence and mortality 
among Asian heroin users remain poorly understood since previous 
studies are limited by small sample size and selection bias. The present 
study investigates the incidence of suicide, overdoses, and all-cause 
mortality among more than 10,000 heroin users after attending the 
methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Taiwan. 

Information including demographic factors and drug related behav- 
iors was collected on all patients who attended MMT in any treatment 
center. This data was registered on a computerized MMT register sys- 
tem at the Centre for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan 
(Taiwan CDC). The study sample comprised 10,842 cases identiﬁed 
through the multiple-center MMT register system between January 
2006 and December 2007, and followed until December 2008 for date 
and cause of death on the Taiwan national mortality database. Both 
data was linked with anonymity for the researchers. The proposal is 
agreed by the ethical committee in Taoyuan Psychiatric Hospital. The

Hospital. 
Using indirect standardization, annual age- and gender-speciﬁc mor- 
tality rates from Taiwanese national mortality statistics in 2007 were ap- 
plied to the study sample to compute the expected numbers of deaths. 
Each person's ﬁrst presentation within the study period was used in 
the calculation of risk over time. Since the register system started 
when MMT launched in Taiwan, it represented the ﬁrst time ever on a 
methadone program for the heroin users. The standardized mortality 
ratio (SMR) within one year of starting MMT in the study sample was 
calculated as a ratio of actual deaths in heroin users versus the annual 
expected numbers of deaths derived from general population in Taiwan. 
Standardized mortality ratios were described as simple ratios rather 
than according to the convention of 100 = no difference, because of 
the large size of the effects. The Crude mortality rate (CMR) was a mea- 
sure of the number of deaths against the person years of follow-up 
(PYFU) observed. PYFU is a summation of all participants' follow-up pe- 
riods. CMR was expressed here as the number of deaths per 100 PY. 
Information regarding the personal identiﬁcation of all individuals 
(national identiﬁer number, name, gender, location of residency and 
date of birth) recruited during the study period was checked against 
the databases of the national death register system. Within this system, 
all deaths from unnatural causes (suicide, overdoses and homicide) are 
decided on by a death verdict jointly assigned by a prosecutor and a cor- 
oner, whose main concern is the possibility of homicide. In a previous 
study in Taiwan, only 2 out of 117 suicides were judged to have been 
misclassiﬁed by coroners and prosecutors as accidental deaths (Cheng, 
1995). 
The risks of suicide, overdoses, death by somatic causes, and 
all-cause mortality (which included all unnatural deaths and deaths 
by natural causes) were calculated. Each person's ﬁrst presentation 
within the study period was used in the calculation of risk over time. 
All individuals traced until December 2008 by the national death 
register system for any length of time from their ﬁrst presentation 
were entered into a survival analysis. The risks of suicide, of mortality 
excluding suicide and other-cause mortality during the follow-up pe- 
riod were calculated using survival curve. In the survival analysis, the 
time function was calculated as the number of months from the index 
episode of attending MMT to December 2008 (end of follow-up) for 
those who survived until then or until the date of death if this preced- 
ed the end of the follow-up interval. Cox regression models were 
ﬁtted to estimate the effects of gender, age, education and marital sta- 
tus as well as heroin related behaviors (onset age, injection, comorbid 
substance) on survival. Hazard ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals 
were calculated. Analyses were carried out using the Statistical Pack- 
age for the Social Sciences version 15.0 for Windows. 

A total of 10,842 cases of heroin users after seeking MMT were reg- 
istered between Jan 2006 and Dec 2007. Follow-up information was 
available for all individuals until December 2008. The predominant 
route of heroin administration was by injection (91.3%, n = 9874). 
The use of amphetamines was also reported by 48.4% (n = 5229). 
The mean age of the sample was 36.8 years (range 16–78 years, 
SD = 8.4); 86.9% were males; 61.9% had fewer than nine years of edu- 
cation; over half were single and a quarter were married; 44.2% were 
unemployed. 
In total, 256 (2.4%) of the sample died during the study period: 67 of 
these died through suicide (0.6%) and 28 (0.3%) due to overdoses. 
Among the causes of mortality, 112 (43.8%) of the deaths were due to 
somatic causes, 67 (26.2%) to suicide, 29 (11.3%) to overdoses, 10 
(3.9%) to HIV, and 3 (1.2%) to murder. The incidence rate of all-cause 
mortality was 1.71 per 100 person-years (PY) and represented 7.5-fold 
age- and gender-standardized mortality ratio increases compared to 
a Follow-up year of cases were 6514.98, 7348.32 and 1117.29 years for ages b35, 35–49 and 50+, respectively.

the general population in Taiwan. Heroin users in MMT had a higher 
incidence rate (0.75 per 100 person-years) of somatic-cause death 
than general population with the SMR of 4.3. Incidence of drug over- 
doses was 0.19 per 100 person-years, and suicide 0.45 per 100 person- 
years. These deaths showed 68.4- and 18.4-fold age- and gender- 
standardized increases, respectively (Table 1). There was also a higher 
HIV death rate with SMR of 76.8. 
With regard to the effect of age on different types of mortality, older 
people (aged more than 50) had higher suicide, HIV, somatic causes and 
all-cause mortality rate, while young aged less than 35 was related to 
higher drug overdose death (Table 1). Men and women had similar 
rates of suicide and overdoses. All-cause mortality (crude mortality 
rate) was almost twice as high in men as in women. However, women 
had higher SMRs than men for suicide, overdose, and all-cause mortal- 
ity compared to general population in Taiwan since female had lower 
expected death rates than men in the general population (Table 2). 
For the risk factors of mortality, the two independent factors were iden- 
tiﬁed. These were older age and unemployment (Table 3). 

This prospective cohort study of Taiwanese MMT attendees showed 
that patients with a history of heroin use have a higher all-cause mortal- 
ity rate, suicide rate and overdose mortality rate compared to the gen- 
eral population. More speciﬁcally, the study also found a differential 
effect of age on different types of mortality: older opioid dependent 
people had higher rates of death due to suicide, HIV, somatic causes, 
and all-cause mortality rate, while younger age was related to a higher 
rate of overdose death. 
To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst prospective study with a 
national cohort which has investigated the suicide and mortality of 
MMT participants in the Asian region. The present study also has 
the largest sample size compared to the four previous reports from 
Asia (Azim et al., 2008, 2009; Quan et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). 
The incidence rate of all-cause mortality in the ﬁrst year was 1.71 
per 100 PY, representing 7.5 age- and gender-standardized increases. 
The ﬁnding is similar to that from a previous study in Taiwan. Chen et 
al. followed 1051 heroin users attending treatment of detoxiﬁcation 
in one psychiatry center and found the annual mortality rate of 
patients was 1.94% (Chen, Kuo, & Tsai, 2001). Heroin users in Asia 
have been reported to have the highest mortality estimate (5.23 
deaths per 100 PY), followed by Western Europe (2.22), North Amer- 
ica (1.70), central Europe (1.55) and Australasia (1.08) (Degenhardt 
et al., 2011). The ﬁndings in the present study are more similar to 
those from North American studies and also ﬁndings from Europe 
but lower than that previously reported from Asia (Azim et al., 2008, 
2009; Quan et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). 
The mortality rate reported in this study may also have been 
inﬂuenced by the sample selection process. Previous studies have 
shown that opioid users have a higher mortality risk when out of treat- 
ment than when in treatment (Brugal et al., 2005; Degenhardt et al., 
2011). Engagement with MMT programs has been found to be associated

with a lower mortality rate than for opioid-dependent persons not in 
treatment (Caplehorn & Drummer, 1999) or those who have left 
treatment (Bartu, Freeman, Gawthorne, Codde, & Holman, 2004; 
Buster, van Brussel, & van den Brink, 2002). This may be the reason 
why our result is lower than previous studies in Asia since the partic- 
ipants came from opioid users seeking maintenance treatment. 
Nonetheless, this population still has a much higher risk for prema- 
ture death than the general population. Men have a higher crude 
mortality rate but a lower SMR than women. The ﬁnding is the 
same as that in European countries (Bargagli et al., 2006). The differ- 
ence may be primarily due to the difference in general mortality 
between men and women (high mortality rate among adult men in 
general population) (Degenhardt et al., 2011). 
The incidence rate of suicide mortality in the ﬁrst year was 0.45 per 
100 PY, representing an 18.4-fold age- and gender-standardized in- 
crease. As for overall mortality, men have a higher crude suicide rate 
but a lower SMR than women. Indeed, the SMR for suicide is nearly 
twice that for all-cause mortality. Suicide represents a substantial and 
important contribution to the overall excess mortality seen among 
heroin users in MMT. The present study found that women have a 
higher SMR than men for suicide. This ﬁnding differed from the results 
reported by a cohort study investigating fatal incidents of self-harm 
among those with previous self-harm history in Taiwan (Chen et al., 
2011). Chen et al. reported that the suicide SMR was twice as high in 
men compared with women among a sample with a history of self- 
harm (Chen et al., 2011). It is suggested that female heroin users in 
MMT are at greater risk of suicide compared to non-using female 
peers than males are compared to their male peers (Darke & Ross, 
2002). Whether the difference is merely due to the difference in general 
mortality between men and women or heroin use has unique risk for 
women needs further investigation. For example, heroin can affect the 
menstrual cycle (Schmittner, Schroeder, Epstein, & Preston, 2005) and 
menstrual cycle is associated with suicide (Dogra et al., 2007). 
Few studies have explored the issue of age-speciﬁc mortality. We 
found a differential effect of age on different types of mortality. Older 
people had higher suicide, HIV, somatic causes and all-cause mortality 
rate, while younger age was related to higher overdose death. The re- 
sults were similar to the ﬁndings from Norway (Clausen et al., 2009). 
In Clausen's study, they found younger opioid users were at greater 
risk of overdose while older users were at higher risk of both somatic 
and traumatic deaths. Another retrospective study from England and 
Wales also reported that older heroin users in MMT were more likely 
to die of pre-existing medical conditions, whereas deaths among youn- 
ger users were associated with drug overdoses (Webb et al., 2003). 
Higher suicide and somatic related mortality in elder people is consis- 
tent with the ﬁndings in general population and in self-harm popula- 
tion (Chen et al., 2011). We found the effect of older age on all-cause 
mortality remained signiﬁcant even after controlling for gender, educa- 
tion, marital status, injection, poly-substance use, and unemployment. 
Higher somatic mortality in older people may be due to that addiction 
is associated with an altered proﬁle of common biomarkers of aging, 
such as chronic antigenic overload, immune stimulation, immune sup- 
pression and signs of accelerated aging (Reece, 2007). Increasing risk 
of death for older users by exacerbation of a pre-existing medical 
condition is also suggested (Webb et al., 2003). On the contrary, it has 
been reported that young heroin users have less knowledge of the risk 
factors for unintentional opioid overdose compared with older users 
(Neira-Leon et al., 2006), so younger people are more likely to die of 
overdose. We suggest that clinicians need to pay attention to the differ- 
ent risks for different age population such as overdose risk for young 
people but somatic problems or suicide risk for older users. Unemploy- 
ment was also found to be an independent predictor of mortality effect 
and was also reported in another MMT cohort study in Spain (Brugal et 
al., 2005). Unemployment may be a marker of poor social integration or 
of the difﬁculty in obtaining access to and beneﬁt from available health 
services (Brugal et al., 2005). 
The study ﬁndings are subject to certain limitations. The study 
only looks at the mortality rate in heroin users over a one year period 
after seeking MMT. Whether the longer term effects are similar to this 
relatively short term ﬁnding needs further investigation. We do not 
have the exact treatment duration of MMT for participants and can- 
not estimate the effect of treatment on different mortality. We do 
not measure other important factors such as mental illness, HIV, or 
HCV, and cannot evaluate the effect of these factors on the observed 
mortality rate. Another limitation is that the cause of death could be 
incorrectly recorded. 

The present study showed the greatly elevated risk of premature 
death among heroin users in Taiwan. The mortality rate is not higher 
than those from North American and Europe studies as previous Asia 
studies suggested. There was a high risk of premature death through 
suicide. Suicide should be recognized as an important contributor to 
the overall excess mortality among heroin users, and especially among 
female heroin users after seeking MMT. 
In addition to standard 
addiction-oriented interventions, treatment services should give atten- 
tion to overdose prevention and to factors which are suggestive of 
suicide risk. In practice, it may be extremely difﬁcult to draw a clear dis- 
tinction between accidental and deliberate overdoses. However, drug 
dependent patients who report current suicidal ideation or a history 
of suicide attempts or self-harm may require special and immediate 
treatment response. Clinical services should be alert to this issue and 
should conduct a careful assessment where there are indications of sui- 
cidal risk (Gossop, 2003). There is also increasing awareness and con- 
cern about the physical health problems among drug users (Volkow & 
Li, 2005), and additional attention is needed for the monitoring and 
treatment of physical health problems since around 50% of the deaths 
in our study were caused by somatic problems.
