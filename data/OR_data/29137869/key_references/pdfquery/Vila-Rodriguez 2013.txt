The Hotel Study: Multimorbidity in a Community Sample 
Living in Marginal Housing 
















Objective: The health of people living in 
marginal housing is not well characterized, 
particularly from the perspective of multi- 
morbid illness. The authors investigated 
this population in a community sample. 
Method: A prospective community sam- 
ple (N=293) of adults living in single-room 
occupancy hotels was followed for a me- 
dian of 23.7 months. Assessment included 
psychiatric and neurological evaluation, 
multimodal MRI, and viral testing. 
Results: Previous homelessness was de- 
scribed in 66.6% of participants. Fifteen 
deaths occurred during 552 person-years of 
follow-up. The standardized mortality ratio 
was 4.83 (95% CI=2.91–8.01). Substance 
dependence was ubiquitous (95.2%), with 
61.7% injection drug use. Psychosis was the 
most common mental 
illness (47.4%). A 
neurological disorder was present in 45.8% 
of participants, with deﬁnite MRI ﬁndings in 
28.0%. HIV serology was positive in 18.4% of 
participants, and hepatitis C virus serology 
in 70.3%. The median number of multi- 
morbid illnesses (from a list of 12) was three. 
Burden of multimorbidity was signiﬁcantly 
role functioning 
correlated with lower 
score. Comorbid addiction or physical ill- 
ness signiﬁcantly decreased the likelihood 
of treatment for psychosis but not the 
likelihood of treatment for opioid depen- 
dence or HIV disease. Participants who died 
during follow-up appeared to have proﬁles 
of multimorbidity similar to those of the 
overall sample. 
Conclusions: This marginally housed co- 
hort had greater than expected mortality 
and high levels of multimorbidity with 
adverse associations with role function 
and likelihood of treatment for psychosis. 
These ﬁndings may guide the develop- 
ment of effective health care delivery in 
the setting of marginal housing. 


with low-income tenants are associated with substance 
dependence, mental illness, and infectious diseases (1, 2). 
This is the case in both resource-rich and resource-limited 
settings (2). In the Downtown Eastside neighborhood of 
Vancouver, British Columbia, single-room occupancy 
hotels have low barriers to tenancy and are often the only 
alternative to homelessness. In response to an epidemic of 
overdose deaths in this neighborhood, a supervised 
injecting facility was established (3). Speciﬁc initiatives 
were also deployed to facilitate access to highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (4). These initiatives limited over- 
dose deaths (3) and decreased HIV-/AIDS-related mor- 
bidity and mortality as well as new HIV diagnoses (4). 
However, knowledge concerning the general health of 
people living in marginal housing is poor (5). Street 
homelessness, or living in shelters, is associated with high 
mortality and is linked to psychiatric disorders, including 
substance abuse (6, 7). Living in marginal housing may be 
associated with mortality similar to that associated with 
homelessness (8). 
Increasing emphasis is being placed on the role of 
multimorbidity in determining health outcomes (9). In 
aging populations, physical 
illness may predispose to 
psychiatric disorders (10). For the relatively younger 
residents of single-room occupancy hotels, physical illness 
may be a consequence of substance dependence and 
mental illness (11). The implications of injected opioid 
dependence for infectious disease are relatively well 
deﬁned (12). Less is known about risks related to stimulant 
drugs, particularly crack cocaine and methamphetamine, 
which are often used nonparenterally (13–15). Neurolog- 
ical disorders in the homeless include traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) (16) and cognitive impairment (17). The 
prevalence of other neurological disorders, such as sei- 
zures, movement disorders, and stroke, is unknown. The 
relationships between neurological illness, substance de- 
illness are unclear, as are the 
pendence, and mental 
implications for psychosocial function and the ability to 
access medical care. This information is important to 
inform efforts to control HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
through the implementation of “seek, test, treat, and 





retain” strategies (18, 19). To begin to establish an evidence 
base addressing these issues, we initiated a longitudinal 
cohort study of multimorbidity in residents of single-room 
occupancy hotels. We report the baseline ﬁndings and 
mortality for the initial 2-year phase of follow-up. 

this study (F.V.R. and W.G.H.) used this diagnostic process in- 
dependently for 98 participants. For the major mental illness 
categories reported, the kappa values were 0.77 for psychosis, 0.60 
for mood disorders, and 0.61 for anxiety disorders. For substance 
dependence, the kappa values were 0.81 for alcohol, 0.74 for 
methamphetamine, 0.71 for cocaine, and 0.73 for opioids. Level of 
psychosocial functioning was rated using the Role Functioning 
Scale (40) and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assess- 
ment Scale in DSM-IV (41). 


The study was carried out in Vancouver, British Columbia, 
with staggered recruitment from single-room occupancy hotels 
located in a low-income neighborhood and managed by a not- 
for-proﬁt housing agency. In Canada, below-standard housing is 
deﬁned as falling short in at least one of the following crite- 
ria: adequacy (not in need of repairs, according to residents), 
affordability (costs ,30% of before-tax household income), or 
suitability (makeup of bedrooms and household). In many 
single-room occupancy hotels, the need for repairs is obvious 
even from casual observation. Rents generally range from 40% to 
65% of the income provided by social service beneﬁts. The 
single-room occupancy hotels typically comprise single rooms of 
80 to 120 square feet (8–12 m2), with a sink and possibly a hotplate. 
Toilet and shower facilities, located at the end of hallways, are 
shared by 10 to 15 tenants. All single-room occupancy hotels 
housing study participants were over 75 years old and had 
evidence of bedbug, cockroach, and mouse infestation. 
Following the baseline assessment (see Table 1 for instruments 
used [20–41]), the study design included monthly follow-up for up 
to 5 years. Inclusion criteria were living in one of four single-room 
occupancy hotels and ability to communicate in English. Inability 
to provide informed consent was the sole exclusion criterion. 
Informed consent was obtained to communicate clinically signi- 
ﬁcant ﬁndings to the participants’ physicians. Medical care was 
provided free of charge through the Canadian health system. 
Participants received a modest honorarium. The protocol was 
approved by the ethics board of the University of British Columbia. 

Mortality is the only outcome reported from follow-up. For 
participants who died, hospital records were obtained from the 
year before death; health care providers were interviewed; and 
coroner’s reports were requested. 

A lifetime review of substance exposure was obtained, and 
drug-dependence-related sections of the Mini-International Neu- 
ropsychiatric Interview were completed. A description, on a week- 
by-week basis, of all alcohol and prescription, licit, and illicit 
drugs used over the previous 4 weeks was recorded, as well as 
scores for the Maudsley Addiction Proﬁle for the same period. A 
urine drug screen also was obtained. 

Records of hospitalization for mental illness were obtained, 
dating as far back as 50 years. The Mini-International Neuro- 
psychiatric Interview was administered, and it was supple- 
mented by a clinical interview and mental status examination 
carried out by a psychiatrist. All available clinical information 
(see Table 1) was used to make psychiatric and substance 
dependence diagnoses using procedures from the Best Estimate 
Clinical Evaluation and Diagnosis form (30), as previously used 
for genetic studies (42) and adapted in this study to DSM-IV 
criteria rather than DSM-III-R criteria. Previous reports of these 
diagnostic procedures indicated between-rater reliabilities of 0.53 
to 0.91 for major mental disorders (43). The two diagnosticians in 
Medical history was reviewed with a structured interview. Inquiry 
into neurological symptoms included history of seizures (most recent 
and treatment) and TBI, including duration of loss of consciousness, 
confusion or memory loss, dizziness, headache or blurred vision, and 
need for hospitalization. A screening neurological examination was 
carried out by a psychiatrist or a neurologist, and ratings were com- 
pleted. Cognitive disorders were diagnosed on the basis of clinical 
ﬁndings from the history, the neurological examination, and neuro- 
psychological testing, according to DSM-IV criteria. 
An MRI scan was obtained using a Philips 3.0-T Achieva 
scanner (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam). Sequences included 
a full-brain three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo, ﬂuid atten- 
uated inversion recovery, three-dimensional venous blood-oxygen- 
level-dependent imaging, and MR angiography. All MRI scans 
were reviewed by a neuroradiologist, and ﬁndings were reported 
according to standardized deﬁnitions (44). 
Blood samples drawn for testing at the British Columbia 
Centre for Disease Control included serology for HIV, hepatitis B 
virus (HBV), and HCV, as well as qualitative polymerase chain 
reaction for HCV. A CBC and differential with platelet count was 
conducted, and AST and ALT levels were determined. 

The standardized mortality ratio was calculated (by H.W.). 
This was the ratio of the observed number of deaths to the 
number of deaths expected if the study cohort experienced the 
age- and sex-speciﬁc death rates seen in the 2009 Canadian 
general population. The Boice-Monson method was used to 
calculate the 95% conﬁdence interval. 
The likelihood-ratio chi-square test was used to compare the 
prevalence of seizures and of cognitive impairment in those with 
and without a history of TBI (this and subsequent analyses were 
conducted by W.G.H.). A similar approach was used to compare 
risk behavior in the past 30 days between participants who were 
infectious (with HIV, HCV, or HBV) and those who were not. 
To examine the consequences of multimorbidity for psychosocial 
function, we selected 12 illnesses (psychosis; alcohol, stimulant, or opi- 
oid dependence; movement disorder; TBI; seizures; cognitive im- 
pairment; brain infarction; and active HIV, HCV, or HBV infection). 
Each participant was assigned a multimorbidity score representing the 
sum of illnesses present, with a range of 0–12. If an illness, such as 
stroke, was not assessed because of contraindications for MRI or 
serology for an illness was missing, that illness was scored as absent. 
Spearman correlation was performed between the multimorbidity score 
and the total score for the Role Functioning Scale, as well as the score 
for the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. 
To investigate the possible effects of multimorbidity on likeli- 
hood of treatment, we examined treatment history regarding 
psychosis (antipsychotic drug treatment prescribed), opioid de- 
pendence (methadone prescribed), and HIV (highly active anti- 
retroviral therapy prescribed). In the group of participants with 
psychosis, we used the likelihood-ratio chi-square statistic to 
compare the use of antipsychotic drugs among participants with 
psychosis only with the use among participants with psycho- 
sis and comorbid opioid dependence or HIV. Similar compar- 
isons were performed in the opioid-dependent group, using

Participants were enrolled in a staggered fashion be- 
tween November 13, 2008, and July 31, 2011. On a hotel- 
by-hotel basis, all tenants were approached to participate, 
and 293/406 (72.2%) agreed and met inclusion criteria. 
Table 2 summarizes participants’ demographic character- 
istics. At enrollment, most participants had lived in their 
current single-room occupancy hotel for over a year. Two- 
thirds had a history of homelessness. By the end of the 
period of observation, 150/292 (51.4%) participants were 
living in the same hotels as at enrollment. Most others

were living nearby in different hotels, and only 15/292 
(5.1%) had become homeless. 

As a consequence of the staggered enrollment to allow 
completion of baseline assessments, participants had 
a variable period of follow-up or months at risk, ending 
January 31, 2012 (minimum for all participants, 6 months; 
31/293 (11%) were lost to follow-up before the sixth 
monthly assessment). The median period of risk was 23.7 
months, taken into account as part of the calculation of 
standardized mortality ratio. During 552 person-years of 
observation, 15/293 (5.1%) participants died. Coroner’s 
reports were obtained for the seven who died outside 
hospital settings. No deaths were attributed to suicide, 10 
were a consequence of physical illness, and ﬁve were drug 
overdose-related (see Table S1 in the data supplement that 
accompanies the online edition of 
this article). The 
standardized mortality ratio was 4.83 (95% conﬁdence 
interval=2.91–8.01) compared with age- and sex-matched 
Canadian population data. 

Substance dependence affected nearly all participants 
(Table 3). In the previous year, 179/290 (61.7%) partic- 
ipants had injected drugs, and 241/292 (82.5%) par- 
ticipants reported ever having injected. Mental illness 
affected the majority of participants, most commonly 
psychosis. Current suicidal ideation (deﬁned as a score $1 
ideation item of the Beck Depression 
on the suicidal 
Inventory [1=thoughts of suicide but would not carry it 
out] and a score $2 on the suicidal ideation item of the 
Maudsley Addiction Proﬁle [2=thoughts of ending life 
sometimes]) was present in 28/288 (9.7%) participants. 
Only a minority (30/293 [10.2%]) had a history of long-term 
psychiatric hospitalization, with a greater number report- 
ing hospitalization for mental illness in a general hospital 
(105/293 [35.8%]). Similar proportions suffered from 
schizophrenia or other chronic form of psychosis or from 
substance-induced psychosis (see Table S2 in the online 
data supplement). 

Movement disorders were the most common neurolog- 
ical ﬁnding and were often associated with exposure to 
stimulant or antipsychotic drugs or both (Table 3; see 
also Table S3 in the data supplement). Of those with 
a movement disorder, the frequencies of the most com- 
mon syndromes were as follows: parkinsonism, N=11/52 
(21.2%); dyskinesia, N=23/52 (44.2%); and akathisia, N=34/ 
52 (65.4%). 
Pathological ﬁndings on MRI were found in 65/232 
(28.0%) participants; brain infarction was the most com- 
mon ﬁnding. The prevalence rate was 13/143 (9.1%) for 
those 30–49 years old, 11/57 (19.3%) for those 50–59 years 
old, and 2/11 (18.2%) for those 60–67 years old. For those 
with brain infarction, rates of seizures, movement dis- 
order, or clinically signiﬁcant cognitive impairment did 
not differ signiﬁcantly from those of participants with no 
brain infarction. Of the 20 aneurysms detected on MR

angiography, all were 7 mm or less in size, and one each 
was located in the anterior or posterior communicating 
artery. A participant who died from a subarachnoid 
hemorrhage did not have an aneurysm detected on the 
earlier MRI. 
A history of serious head or facial injury was endorsed by 
186/292 (63.7%) participants; more narrowly deﬁned TBI 
was less frequent (Table 3). Examples of MRI ﬁndings 
related to TBI are presented in Figure S1 in the online data 
supplement. Seizures were more common in those with 
deﬁnite TBI (N=15/31 [48.4%]) than in those without 
(N=11/262 [4.2%] p,0.001). Similarly, clinical diagnoses of 
cognitive impairment were more frequent among partic- 
ipants with deﬁnite TBI (N=10/31 [32.3%]) compared with 
those without (N=9/262 [3.4%] p,0.001). 
Positive serology for HCV and for HIV was common. 
Nine new cases of HCV, two new carriers of HBV, and one 
new case of HIV were detected at study entry. The AST: 
platelet ratio index was above a threshold of 2.0, suggestive 
of hepatic cirrhosis, in 5.8% of participants (Table 3; see 
also Table S4 in the data supplement). Only 10 participants 
reported previous interferon-based treatment for HCV. In 
contrast, nearly all those with positive HIV serology had 
received antiretroviral therapy, with 42/47 (89.4%) of those 
with available data having virologic suppression in the past 
(see Table S5 in the data supplement). Behaviors known to 
increase the risk of viral transmission, including penetra- 
tive sex without a condom, injection drug use, needle 
sharing, and crack pipe sharing, were reported by 207/270 
(76.7%) members of the cohort (see Table S5 in the data 




supplement). Injection drug use was more prevalent in 
those at risk of spreading HCV, HIV, or HBV than those not 
at risk (p,0.001). Of those who had injected in the 
previous month, 109/146 (74.7%) reported using the 
supervised injecting facility. 

Of the 12 illnesses evaluated in greater detail, the median 
multimorbidity score (the sum of illnesses present) was 3 
(Figure 1), with an interquartile range of 2–4. The median 
multimorbidity burden was 3 for both male and female 
participants and was not correlated with age (Spearman 
ra=0.06). Greater multimorbidity was correlated with lower 
scores on the Role Functioning Scale (ra=20.21, p,0.001; 
N=289) and the Social and Occupational Functioning 
Assessment Scale (ra=20.20, p,0.001; N=290). This ﬁnding 
was similar when the sample was limited to those with 
complete data for all 12 multimorbidity assessments, 
including MRI and serology (Role Functioning Scale: 
ra=20.22, p=0.001; Social and Occupational Functioning 
Assessment Scale: ra=20.23, p,0.001; N=215). 
The prevalence of treatment of three illnesses—psychosis 
(32.6%), opioid dependence (49.6%), and AIDS (61.5%)— 
was suboptimal (Table 4). Participants with psychosis 
with multimorbidity (opioid dependence and/or HIV/ 
AIDS) were less than half as likely to have their psychosis 
treated than those with psychosis alone (p=0.003). In 
contrast, the presence of multimorbidity did not in- 
ﬂuence the likelihood of treatment for opioid addiction 
or HIV/AIDS. 
At baseline, participants who subsequently died had 
a greater multimorbidity score (median=4) than those who 
were alive at follow-up (median=3); however, this differ- 
ence was not statistically signiﬁcant. 

In our sample, participants with a high prevalence of 
previous homelessness and considerable social disadvan- 
tage living in marginal housing had a high level of 
mortality. Substance dependence, mental and neurolog- 
ical illnesses, and infectious diseases were common. Drug 
dependence played a direct role in one-third of deaths; 
most others represented complex multimorbidity. Greater 
multimorbidity was associated with poorer psychosocial 
functioning. The high level of directly observed mortality 
among persons living in single-room occupancy hotels is 
consistent with ﬁndings from analyses of administrative 
data sets comprised of persons living in similar circum- 
stances in Canada (8) and is similar to data reported for 
those living in literal homelessness in the United States 
and Scandinavia (6, 7, 45). 
In the community setting of our sample, there are 
approximately 7,100 single-room occupancy hotel rooms, 
and there are an estimated 1,600 homeless persons living 
on the street or in shelters (46). A recent study of street and 
shelter homelessness in Vancouver found an ethnic and 
educational background similar to that in our sample, with 
a slightly younger mean age (38.0 years compared with 
44.1 years) and a larger proportion of women (37.2% 
compared with 23.3%) (47). Two-thirds of our sample had 
a history of homelessness. We cautiously suggest that 
many of the present ﬁndings may be relevant to the 
Vancouver homeless population and perhaps other home- 
less populations. However, obtaining the comprehensive 
evaluations reported, including detailed review of medical 
and psychiatric records, neurological examination, MRI, 
and neuropsychological testing, as well as serology and 
liver function testing to allow diagnosis of multimorbidity, 
makes replication of our study challenging. 
Substance dependence was nearly universal. Depen- 
dence on cocaine or methamphetamine has long been 
associated with psychotic symptoms (48, 49). The esti- 
mated prevalence of psychosis in our sample (47.4%) was 
higher than the estimated prevalence in a meta-analysis of 
studies of the homeless (12.7%) (11). However, our estimate 
of the prevalence of schizophrenia and schizoaffective 
disorder was 12.6%, consistent with the meta-analysis and 
with a recent study using the Mini-International Neuro- 
psychiatric Interview for diagnosis in a sample of homeless 
persons in three cities in our province (47). The ﬁndings 
from urine drug screens were consistent with the high 
prevalence of substance-induced psychosis in our sample, 
contributing to the high overall prevalence of psychosis. 
Although the prevalence of schizophrenia and related 
psychotic illness was still high in absolute terms, only 
a minority of those with psychosis represented mentally ill 
patients who had previously been cared for in an asylum or 
similar institutional setting. 
Neurological illness was also common. The high fre- 
quency of movement disorders is likely related to stim- 
ulant drug use as well as exposure to antipsychotic drugs 
(50, 51). However, most participants with stimulant de- 
pendence in our study did not have movement disorders. 
The prevalence of brain infarctions that we observed ap- 
pears to be similar to reported rates for healthy persons 
ages 30–49 (9.1% in the present study compared with 4%2 
9% in other reports) but higher for those ages 50–59 (19.3% 
compared with ,9%) and 60–69 (18.2% compared with 
,12%) (44, 52). The high prevalence of crack cocaine use 
in our cohort may have contributed to risk for brain 
infarction (53, 54). Those with MRI evidence of infarc- 
tion did not have elevated rates of seizures, movement 
disorders, or clinically obvious cognitive impairment. 
The relatively high rate of aneurysms may be related to 
stimulant dependence (55, 56). Most aneurysms were not 
in a size range or location associated with risk of rupture 
(57); however, ongoing use of stimulants could modify the 
predictive value of anatomical risk factors. The broadest 
deﬁnition of TBI yielded a high prevalence, similar to that 
reported for people living in homeless shelters (16). More 
narrowly deﬁned TBI was more likely to be associated with

a Panel A shows the distribution of total multimorbid illnesses (0–12) in the cohort. The lower part of the panel shows the percentage of 
participants with increasing multimorbidity for each of the 12 conditions assessed. Since only three participants had persistent HBV infection, 
there is no bar to represent this group. Two of these participants scored 13, and one scored 14. Panel B shows the relationship between 
multimorbidity (0–12), scores on the Role Functioning Scale, and the number of participants at each intersection of multimorbidity number 
and level of function. The Role Functioning Scale comprises four items (work productivity, independent living [self-care], immediate social 
network relationships, and extended social network relationships); each item is scored on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating 
better functioning. HCV=hepatitis C virus; qPCR=quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
ongoing symptoms, such as seizures or cognitive impair- 
ment, in contrast to brain infarctions that appeared re- 
latively silent. 
The very high rates of HIV and HCV in our cohort were 
similar to those reported in a previous study of people 
living in the same neighborhood (58). The high rate of 
previous successful treatment for HIV/AIDS conﬁrms that 
with appropriately deployed strategies, patients with HIV/ 
AIDS are amenable to therapeutic intervention (4). How- 
ever, the rates of ongoing treatment were disappoint- 
ing, although not as low as those for treatment of opioid 
dependence and psychosis. Infection with HCV was least 
likely to be treated (58), even in the presence of relatively 
high rates of participants with elevated biomarkers 
suggesting ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis. This ﬁnding is consistent 
with ﬁndings from other reports indicating that social 
disadvantage, poor health literacy, and disengagement 
from the health care system are risk factors for low 
likelihood of treatment of HCV (19). Of additional concern, 
behaviors increasing the risk of spreading infection were 
common. As oral drug treatments for HCV become 
available, a greater emphasis should be placed on the 
challenges of delivering this care in a population with 
multimorbid illness (19). In particular, the high prevalence 
the absence of substitution treat- 
of stimulant use, 
ment analogous to methadone, and the potential difﬁcul- 
ties accessing care in the face of ongoing psychosis and 
other mental illness will require the development of com- 
prehensive strategies, perhaps modiﬁed from those pro- 
posed for opioid addiction and HIV infection (59). 
Multimorbidity was highly prevalent, with co-occurring 
substance dependence, mental and neurological illnesses, 
and infectious diseases. Multimorbidity is reported to 
increase in association with greater socioeconomic dep- 
rivation (10). Even within the narrowed range of severe 
social deprivation in our cohort of persons living in single- 
room occupancy hotels, greater multimorbidity was 
associated with poorer psychosocial function. Multimor- 
bidity was also associated with a lower likelihood of 
treatment of psychosis but not opioid dependence or 
HIV. Internationally, in the overall population, more se- 
vere mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, are more

likely to be treated than less severe illnesses (60). This 
relationship may break down in the face of multimorbidity 
between mental illness, substance dependence, and phys- 
ical illness. 
The opportunity to investigate a reasonably large cohort 
of persons living with social disadvantage in single-room 
occupancy hotels was the unique feature of our study. 
Other investigators have described the challenges of 
gaining access to single-room occupancy hotels and other 
types of marginal housing, resulting in a paucity of 
information on the health status of tenants (5). While we 
cannot be certain that our observations generalize to other 
settings, many clinicians in urban practice are familiar 
with smaller numbers of individuals in public clinics with 
similar multimorbidity. Local assessment of speciﬁc health 
needs in marginally housed populations may be as 
important as locally based assessment in the homeless 
(11). Although we attempted to be thorough and detailed 
with our assessment and analysis strategy, undoubtedly 
other illnesses were missed, and the psychiatric diagnoses 
could change over time. Our sample of women was likely 
too small to permit informative sex-based analyses. Finally, 
our assessment of mortality had at least two limitations. 
Although only 11% of participants could not be followed up 
for at least 6 months, we were unable to systematically 
search death records or coroner’s reports to determine 
whether these individuals had died. If some of those lost to 
follow-up had died, our standardized mortality rate might 
be too conservative. Second, although none of the outside- 
of-hospital deaths in our sample were attributed to suicide, 
this cause of death may be underestimated. Four of the 
seven participants who died outside hospital settings were 
seen at least 1 month before death, and none expressed 
suicidal ideation according to the previously described 
criteria. However, since ﬁve of these seven deaths were 
attributed to overdoses, excluding suicide as a cause is 
difﬁcult. 
In conclusion, mortality was high in this cohort of 
persons living in marginal housing. Multimorbidity was 
common, and provision of treatment was inadequate. 
Collaborative care strategies may have a role in improving 
the health of persons living in these circumstances and 
needs to be investigated (61, 62).
