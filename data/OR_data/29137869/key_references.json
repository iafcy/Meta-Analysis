            "title": "Psychiatric disorders and mortality among people in homeless shelters in Denmark: a nationwide register-based cohort study.",
            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe increased mortality of homeless people compared with non-homeless people might be linked to psychiatric disorders. However, homeless people are, because of their insufficient accommodation, difficult to sample and monitor, which has limited previous studies. We aimed to assess registered psychiatric disorders, mortality, and predictors of mortality in the homeless shelter population in Denmark.\n## METHODS\nWe did a nationwide, prospective, register-based cohort study of homeless people aged 16 years and older who were registered in the Danish Homeless Register between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2009. We calculated the proportion of registered psychiatric disorders, overall and cause-specific standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and life expectancy. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to assess predictors of death.\n## FINDINGS\n32,711 homeless people (23,040 men and 9671 women) were included in the study population. 14,381 men (62\u00b74%) and 5632 women (58\u00b72%) had registered psychiatric disorders, and 11,286 men (49\u00b70%) and 3564 women (36\u00b79%) had a substance abuse diagnosis. During the study period, 3839 men (16\u00b77%) and 951 women (9\u00b78%) died. The overall SMR for men was 5\u00b76 (95% CI 5\u00b74-5\u00b78) and for women was 6\u00b77 (6\u00b72-7\u00b71), and external causes accounted for 1161 (27\u00b79%) of 4161 deaths for which information on the cause was available. Remaining life expectancy at age 15-24 years was 21\u00b76 years (95% CI 21\u00b72-22\u00b71) and 17\u00b74 years (16\u00b74-18\u00b75) lower for homeless men and women, respectively, than the general population. Registered substance abuse disorder was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with no psychiatric contact registered (adjusted HR 1\u00b74, 95% CI 1\u00b73-1\u00b75 for men; 1\u00b77, 1\u00b74-2\u00b71 for women).\n## INTERPRETATION\nHealth problems are extensive in the homeless shelter population and there is an urgent need for more sustained efforts to reduce the high morbidity and mortality, especially from external causes. Register data is an important resource to supplement existing knowledge on homeless people with more valid and detailed information.\n## FUNDING\nThe Danish Council for Independent Research.\n",

            "title": "The challenge of understanding mortality changes among street youth.",
            "abstract": "According to a cohort study conducted in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec from 1995 to 2000, the mortality rate among street youth was 921/100,000 person-years. Several new community initiatives aiming to increase access to housing and to social and health services for the homeless were implemented in the city between 2000 and 2003. This study aims to update the mortality rate estimate for the period 2001-2006 and to examine factors that could explain a difference between rates, if any. A second cohort study was conducted between 2001 and 2006. The Cohort 2 mortality rate was computed and compared with the Cohort 1 rate. Several analyses were then carried out: (1) mortality rates in the general population were compared with street youth rates using standardized mortality ratios (SMR); (2) Cohorts 1 and 2 distributions of risk factors for mortality were examined, and their effects were assessed using multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses carried out on a combined Cohorts 1 and 2 dataset. Mortality rate among street youth decreased by 79% while it declined by only 19% in the general population; the SMR for Cohort 1 was higher than for Cohort 2 (11.6 versus 3.0). Multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses yielded estimates that were close to the model's estimates based on Cohort 1 data only, and participation in Cohort 1 was an independent predictor of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 9.0. The mortality decline cannot be completely explained by a similar decrease among the general population or by a difference in distribution of risk factors for mortality between the two cohorts. Field workers suggested that the decrease in heroin consumption they had observed in the streets might have contributed to the mortality decline. We then performed additional analyses which showed that even though the proportion of street youth currently using heroin decreased significantly between 1995 and 2005, the association between heroin use and mortality was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.3). It seems that various factors could have contributed to the decline in mortality rates among street youth, one plausible factor being the implementation of new services for the homeless. This study underscores the importance of monitoring risky behaviors among vulnerable populations to ensure that morbidity and mortality data among these populations is correctly interpreted. Setting up a system to monitor the drug market could improve the quality of information collected.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nThe health of people living in marginal housing is not well characterized, particularly from the perspective of multimorbid illness. The authors investigated this population in a community sample.\n## METHOD\nA prospective community sample (N=293) of adults living in single-room occupancy hotels was followed for a median of 23.7 months. Assessment included psychiatric and neurological evaluation, multimodal MRI, and viral testing.\n## RESULTS\nPrevious homelessness was described in 66.6% of participants. Fifteen deaths occurred during 552 person-years of follow-up. The standardized mortality ratio was 4.83 (95% CI=2.91-8.01). Substance dependence was ubiquitous (95.2%), with 61.7% injection drug use. Psychosis was the most common mental illness (47.4%). A neurological disorder was present in 45.8% of participants, with definite MRI findings in 28.0%. HIV serology was positive in 18.4% of participants, and hepatitis C virus serology in 70.3%. The median number of multimorbid illnesses (from a list of 12) was three. Burden of multimorbidity was significantly correlated with lower role functioning score. Comorbid addiction or physical illness significantly decreased the likelihood of treatment for psychosis but not the likelihood of treatment for opioid dependence or HIV disease. Participants who died during follow-up appeared to have profiles of multimorbidity similar to those of the overall sample.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis marginally housed cohort had greater than expected mortality and high levels of multimorbidity with adverse associations with role function and likelihood of treatment for psychosis. These findings may guide the development of effective health care delivery in the setting of marginal housing.\n",

When compared with the general population, the age-standardized mortality rate ratio for those imprisoned was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3) for women. Further adjustment for an area measure of deprivation accounted for part but not all of this excess risk [adjusted rate ratio 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2) for men and women, respectively]. Relative risks were highest for drug and alcohol related causes, suicide and homicide and were markedly higher among women than men. Out of prison deaths were most frequent in the first 2 weeks after release from prison. Mortality rates were lower in those with longer total duration in prison and higher in those with multiple short episodes in prison.\n## CONCLUSION\nPeople who have been imprisoned in Scotland experience substantial excess mortality from a range of causes that is only partly explained by deprivation. The association of increased mortality with multiple periods in prison and the concentration of deaths in the early period after prison release both have implications for policy and practice.\n",

Mortality rates were estimated using the person-time method. SMRs were calculated using sex, age, and calendar-specific death rates from the NSW population. Time trends in SMRs were assessed using the test for linear trends.\n## RESULTS\nThe median overall follow-up of the cohort was 7.7 years. We identified 5137 deaths (4714 men, 423 women) among the cohort of which the vast majority (4834, 94%) occurred following release from custody. All-cause SMR was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.6-3.8) in men and 7.8 (95% CI: 7.1-8.5) in women. SMRs were substantially raised for deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders (men: 13.2, 95% CI: 12.3-14.0; women: 62.8, 95% CI: 52.7-74.9) and drug-related deaths (men: 12.8, 95% CI: 12.2-13.5; women: 50.3, 95% CI: 43.7-57.8). The SMR for death by homicide was 10.2 (95% CI: 8.9-11.7) in men and 26.3 (95% CI: 17.8-39.0) in women. Aboriginal men were 4.8 times, and Aboriginal women 12.6 times, more likely to die than the general NSW population. Over the study period on average all-cause SMR decreased significantly in men (p = 0.003) and women (p = 0.05) largely due to the decline in SMRs for drug-related deaths and suicide.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn the largest study so far reported, mortality of male and female offenders was far greater than expected for all major causes, especially deaths caused by drug overdose. Despite some indication of a reduction in excess mortality in recent years, there remains an overwhelming need for enhanced responses to mental health and drug problems for people who have been in prison.\n",

All in all, 1441 deaths were recorded during 111,445 person-years of follow-up. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) associated with different primary substance types were calculated and Cox-regression analyses were performed in order to establish hazard ratios (HR) associated with injection drug use and psychiatric comorbidity. SMRs for primary users of specific substances were: cannabis: 4.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2-5.8), cocaine: 6.4 (CI: 3.9-10.0), amphetamine: 6.0 (CI: 4.2-8.3), heroin: 9.1 (CI: 8.5-9.8), and other opioids 7.7 (CI: 6.6-8.9). For MDMA ('ecstasy') the crude mortality rate was 1.7/1000 person-years (CI: 0.4-7.0) and the SMR was not significantly elevated. Injection drug use was associated with significantly increased hazard ratios in users of opioids and cocaine/amphetamine. Overall, psychiatric comorbidity was not associated with increased mortality (HR: 1.1 [CI: 0.9-1.2], p=.28), but an association was found specifically among cocaine/amphetamine users (HR: 3.6 [CI: 2.1-6.4], p<.001).\n",

Gender-specific overall mortality rate, proportion of deaths by cause (drug-related, HIV, other), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and the attributable risk fraction (ARF) were estimated.\n## RESULTS\nCrude mortality rates varied from 1 per 100 person-years in the Dublin and London cohorts to 3.8 per 100 person-years in Barcelona. The highest drug-related mortality rate was 10 per 1,000 person-years in Barcelona; the rates were approximately 7 per 1,000 person-years in Denmark, London, Rome, and Vienna, and <3.5 per 1,000 person-years for the others cohorts. The mortality rate for AIDS was <2 per 1,000 person-years in all the cohorts except Lisbon, Rome, and Barcelona, for which it was approximately 6 per 1,000 person-years. The highest SMR among males was 21.1 in Barcelona, and among females the highest SMRs were 53.7 and 37.7 in Barcelona and Rome, respectively. In Denmark the ARF was 5%, whereas it was >10% in all other study sites and 24% in Barcelona.\n## CONCLUSION\nCohort mortality studies, especially in combination with estimates of prevalence, provide useful insights into the impact of opiate use on mortality across European countries and emphasize how preventing overall and drug-related deaths among opiate users can significantly improve the health of the population.\n",

Their median age was 24 years; with a range from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for different causes of death.\n## RESULTS\nDuring a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7-29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period, ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer (4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths (2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category \"drug dependence\" was listed in the vast majority of cases (37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death, with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9-86.9).

            "abstract": "## AIMS\nThe present study investigates one-year incidence of mortality from suicide and other causes among heroin users in Taiwan.\n## DESIGN\nA prospective national register-based cohort study.\n## SETTING\nAll heroin users who attended the methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs in all treatment centers in Taiwan.\n## PARTICIPANTS\nThe sample comprised 10,842 heroin users attending MMT. Between Jan 2006 and Dec 2007, cases were identified through the multiple-center register system and followed until Dec 2008 for date and cause of death on the Taiwan national mortality database.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nStandardized mortality ratios within one year of starting MMT were calculated as a ratio of actual versus expected numbers of deaths in the general population in Taiwan. Cox regression models were fitted to estimate the effects of gender, age, education and marital status as well as heroin related behaviors.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, 256 cases died, 67 through suicide. The mortality rate (per 100 person-years) in the first year of all-cause and suicide was 1.71 and 0.45 respectively, representing 7.5- and 18.4-fold age- and gender-standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the general population. Besides, the mortality rate in the first year of overdoses, murder, HIV, somatic was 0.19, 0.02, 0.07, and 0.75 respectively, representing 68.4-, 27.7-, 76.8-, and 4.3-fold SMR increases to the general population. Older age and unemployment were independent risk factors for mortality. Females had higher standardized mortality ratio than males for suicide and all-cause mortality.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nResults showed higher risk of suicide and other-cause mortality among heroin users in MMT than general population. Suicide is an important contributor to overall excess mortality among heroin users in MMT, and especially among women. Suicide prevention and physical health monitoring are important components of MMT programs.\n",

            "title": "Mortality among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo systematically review cohort studies of mortality among people who inject drugs, examine mortality rates and causes of death in this group, and identify participant- and study-level variables associated with a higher risk of death.\n## METHODS\nTailored search strings were used to search EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO. The grey literature was identified through online grey literature databases. Experts were consulted to obtain additional studies and data. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).\n## FINDINGS\nSixty-seven cohorts of people who inject drugs were identified, 14 of them from low- and middle-income countries. The pooled CMR was 2.35 deaths per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.12-2.58). SMRs were reported for 32 cohorts; the pooled SMR was 14.68 (95% CI: 13.01-16.35). Comparison of CMRs and the calculation of CMR ratios revealed mortality to be higher in low- and middle-income country cohorts, males and people who injected drugs that were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It was also higher during off-treatment periods. Drug overdose and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were the primary causes of death across cohorts.\n## CONCLUSION\nCompared with the general population, people who inject drugs have an elevated risk of death, although mortality rates vary across different settings. Any comprehensive approach to improving health outcomes in this group must include efforts to reduce HIV infection as well as other causes of death, particularly drug overdose.\n## OBJECTIF\nExaminer syst\u00e9matiquement les \u00e9tudes de cohortes de la mortalit\u00e9 chez les toxicomanes par injection, \u00e9tudier les taux de mortalit\u00e9 et les causes de d\u00e9c\u00e8s dans ce groupe, et identifier les variables, au niveau des participants et des \u00e9tudes, associ\u00e9es \u00e0 un risque accru de d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\n## M\u00c9THODES\nDes crit\u00e8res de recherche sp\u00e9cifiquement adapt\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour les recherches r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur EMBASE, Medline et PsycINFO.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nWe examine major causes of death amongst persons in contact with drug-treatment services across Scotland during April 1996-March 2006, hereafter Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD) cohort.\n## METHODS\nDrug-treatment records were linked to national registers of deaths and hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnoses. For eras 1996/97-2000/01 and 2001/02-2005/06, we calculated cause-specific death-rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) using age-, sex- and calendar-rates of the general Scottish population. Major causes of death were identified by high SMRs (>5 across eras) or rates (>50 per 100,000 person-years in either era), and their time-specific influences characterised by proportional hazards analyses.\n## RESULTS\nThe SDMD cohort comprised 69,456 individuals, 350,315 person-years and 2590 deaths. The overall SMR reduced from 6.4 (95% CI: 6.0-6.9) to 4.8 (95% CI: 4.6-5.0) between eras. We identified five major causes of death: drug-related (1383 deaths), homicide (118) and infectious diseases (90) with high SMRs; suicide (269) and digestive system disease (168) with high rates. HCV diagnosis marked individuals with at least double the risk of cause-specific mortality, including adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for no HCV diagnosis of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.41-0.53) for drug-related deaths (DRDs) and 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10-0.22) for death from digestive system disease. Increased DRD risk at older age (>34 years) appeared specific to HCV-diagnosed individuals (interaction: \u03c7\u2081\u00b2=7.7, p=0.01). Alcohol misuse increased HRs: for DRD (1.76, 95% CI: 1.50-2.06), suicide (1.88, 95% CI: 1.35-2.60), deaths from digestive system disease (3.19, 95% CI: 2.21-4.60) and non-major causes (1.87, 95% CI: 1.49-2.35). Stimulant misuse increased suicide risk: adjusted HR 1.91 (95% CI: 1.43-2.54).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDrug-users in Scotland are exposed to variously increased mortality risks. HCV-diagnosed individuals are particularly vulnerable, and may need additional support.\n",

            "abstract": "## AIMS\nTo evaluate premature mortality and causes of death from young adulthood to middle age in a cohort of drug users followed during almost four decades.\n## DESIGN\nFollow-up study of a consecutive cohort of patients with drug abuse/dependence.\n## METHODS\nA cohort of 561 drug abusers, admitted to a detoxification and short-term rehabilitation unit 1970-1978 was followed to December 31st, 2006. Standardized interviews and hospital records with toxicological analyses were used for demographic data, substance use and psychiatric diagnoses at admission. For Follow-up analyses, autopsy protocols including toxicology tests and death certificates were obtained for assessment of causes of death which were coded according to ICD-10. Age-group standardized mortality ratios were calculated independently for both sexes.\n## RESULTS\n204 persons (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. SMR was 5.94 for the cohort. Compared to an age- and gender-matched population, the risk of premature death was about eighteen times higher between the ages of 20-44 and about five times higher from 45 up to the age of 69. Of 120 (59%) drug-related deaths, 43 were opiate overdoses, and 3 were overdose from amphetamine. A total of 53 (26%) persons died violent deaths: 39 suicides, of which 25 were drug-related, 3 homicides and 12 accidents. The Swedish national causes of death register underestimated drug-related death by 37% and suicide by 85% compared to the results from this study.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature often drug-related and violent death well into middle age, and to a great extent the drug addicts died from the same drug they had abused when they were first admitted for treatment. The underestimation of drug-related death and suicide in some national death cause registers could be reduced if the doctor routinely records ICD codes when issuing death certificates and autopsy protocols.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nFew longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades.\n## METHODS\nFollow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing risks Cox regression analysis.\n## RESULTS\nOf 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of non drug related death.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death.\n",

Estimation of standardized mortality ratios comparing the population in treatment to the Swiss population (standardized to the year 2000).\n## RESULTS\nOver the 7-year period, the crude death rate of patients in heroin-assisted treatment, and including one month after discharge from treatment, was 1% per year. The standardized mortality ratio for the entire observation period was 9.7 (95% C.I. 7.3-12.8), with females having higher standardized mortality ratios (SMR 17.2) than males (SMR 8.4). There was no clear time trend.\n## CONCLUSION\nMortality in heroin-assisted treatment was low compared to the mortality rate of Swiss opioid users 1990s (estimated to be between 2.5 and 3%). It was also low compared to mortality rates of opioid users in other maintenance treatments in other countries as reported in the literature. The SMR was also lower than that reported in the only meta-analysis in the literature: 13.2 (95% C.I. 12.3-14.1). The low mortality rate is all the more noteworthy as heroin-assisted treatment in Switzerland included only refractory opioid addicts with existing severe somatic and/or mental problems.\n## DECLARATION OF INTEREST\nNo conflicts of interest declared.\n",

Information about the Israeli general population from the Central Bureau of Statistics was used for comparison to match sex and age to the cohort under study. Crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 100 persons per year (PY) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.\n## RESULTS\nThe overall CMR for MMT users was 1.49/100 PY (CI 1.40-1.59) and was not associated with gender, age at entering MMT, ethnicity, and immigrant status. The leading causes of mortality were sudden/undefined death (0.31/100 PY, CI 0.26-0.35), overdose (0.22/100 PY, CI 0.17-0.27), and cancer (0.15/100 PY, CI 0.12-0.18). The MMT users were 12.2 times more likely to die from all causes than people from the general population. Overall, our estimates were comparable with the figures pooled from relevant studies.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that the excess mortality of MMT users is associated with an increased morbidity, which alone or in combination with service-related risks, lead to worse outcomes.\n",

            "abstract": "The health and social conditions of women living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside has recently been the focus of substantial international attention. Since few studies have examined rates and correlates of death among addicted women in Canada, we have characterized patterns of mortality among female injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver. The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) is a prospective open cohort study of IDUs. The analyses presented here, were restricted to women enrolled between May 1996 and May 2002 and who were aged 14 years or older. We estimated cumulative mortality rates using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression was used to calculate univariate and adjusted relative hazards. Between May 1996 and May 2002, 520 female IDUs have been recruited from the Vancouver area among whom 68 died during the study period. Elevated rates of mortality were observed among those who reported, baseline sex-trade involvement, those with HIV-infection at baseline, and those who lived in unstable housing at baseline (all log-rank: p<0.05). In adjusted analyses, HIV infection (RH = 3.09 [95% CI: 1.86-5.11]; p<0.001), unstable housing (RH = 1.74 [95% CI: 1.10-2.86]; p=0.029) and sex-trade involvement (RH = 1.82 [95% CI: 0.95-3.45]; p=0.071) were associated with the time to death. When the number of observed deaths was compared to the number of expected deaths based on the general female population of British Columbia using indirect standardization, the rate of death among female IDUs was elevated by a factor of 47.3 (95% CI: 36.1-58.5). In Vancouver, female IDUs have rates of mortality almost 50 times that of the province's female population. Our findings are consistent with a growing number of reports from other settings internationally, and demonstrate the need for an appropriate evidence-based strategy to address the health and social needs of addicted women.\n",

            "abstract": "Multiple factors affect injecting drug-related mortality, many of which will vary over time and between jurisdictions. There are relatively few studies of mortality among injecting drug users (IDU) in Australia. We aimed to provide data comparable to those reported internationally on the rate of mortality among IDU in Australia. We retrospectively examined mortality among participants (N=220) from the first Australian cohort study of IDU by linking coded personal identifier records with a national death register. The overall mortality rate among those followed-up was 0.83 per 100 PY (95% CI, 0.56-1.21 per 100 PY). This rate is lower than those reported internationally but comparable to the limited Australian data from other cohorts of IDU. Mortality was higher among males, most common among those aged in their early thirties and drug-related mortality occurred typically after substantial injecting careers. Extensive experience of incarceration (>or=3 times) was associated with increased risk of mortality. These results suggest that rates of mortality among Australian IDU may be lower than those reported internationally, with low HIV prevalence and Australia's long-held harm reduction framework potentially contributing to this result. Further studies using defined cohorts followed over time are needed to examine long-term outcomes among IDU in Australia.\n",

Temporal trends were estimated using Poisson regression.\n## RESULTS\nThe overall all-cause SMR was 13.9 (95% confidence interval 12.6-15.3). The SMR significantly declined after 1996, especially due to a decline among women (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The highest SMR was observed among HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals during 1990-1996 (SMR 61.9, 95% confidence interval 50.4-76.0), which significantly declined after this period among women (P\u200a=\u200a0.001). In contrast, SMR for HCV-monoinfected, and HCV/HIV-uninfected PWUD did not significantly change over time. The SMR for non-natural deaths significantly declined (P\u200a=\u200a0.007), whereas the SMR for HIV-related deaths was the highest during all calendar periods.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found evidence for declining all-cause mortality among PWUD compared with the general population rates. Those with HCV/HIV-coinfection showed the highest SMR. The decline in the SMR seems to be attributable to the decline in mortality among women. Mortality rates due to non-natural deaths came closer to those of the general population over time. However, HIV-related deaths remain an important cause of mortality among PWUD when compared with the general Dutch population. This study reinforces the importance of harm-reduction interventions and HCV/HIV treatment to reduce mortality among PWUD.\n",

All the deceased were male, and all their deaths were \"unnatural\"--that is, caused by drug overdose or accident. This translates into the crude mortality rates for the whole cohort being 4.8 deaths per 1,000 person-years (PY), and into a specific mortality ratio in the males SMR=14.4 with the peak at the age of 15-20 (SMR=60.1), declining to SMR=8.2 at the age of 25-30.

The current study examines reductions in mortality related to treatment in an entire treatment population.\n## METHODS\nData from the New South Wales (NSW) Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, recording every \"authority to dispense\" methadone or buprenorphine as opioid replacement therapy, 1985-2006, was linked with data from the National Deaths Index, a record of all deaths in Australia. Crude mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated according to age, sex, calendar year, period in- or out-of-treatment, medication type, previous treatment exposure and cause of death.\n## RESULTS\nMortality among 42,676 people entering opioid pharmacotherapy was elevated compared to age and sex peers. Drug overdose and trauma were the major contributors. Mortality was higher out of treatment, particularly during the first weeks, and it was elevated during induction onto methadone but not buprenorphine. Mortality during these risky periods changed across time and treatment episodes. Overall, mortality was similarly reduced (compared to out-of-treatment) whether patients were receiving methadone or buprenorphine. It was estimated that the program produced a 29% reduction in mortality across the entire cohort.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMortality among treatment-seeking opioid-dependent persons is dynamic across time, patient and treatment variables. The comparative reduction in mortality during buprenorphine induction may be offset by the increased risk of longer out-of-treatment time periods. Despite periods of elevated risk, this large-scale provision of pharmacotherapy is estimated to have resulted in significant reductions in mortality.\n",
