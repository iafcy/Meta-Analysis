            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Research on street children and youth has shown that this population is at high risk for substance use. Though risky sexual behaviours have been investigated and widely reported among street youth in resource constrained-settings, few studies have explored the relationship between substance use and other risk behaviours. This study was therefore conducted to examine the association between substance use and risky sexual behaviours among homeless youth in Ghana.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional survey of a convenient sample of 227 (122 male and 105 female) street connected children and youth was conducted in Ghana in 2012. Using self-report measures, the relationship between substance use and risky sexual behaviours was examined using logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Substance use was relatively high as 12% and 16.2% reported daily use of alcohol and marijuana respectively. There were age and sex differences in substance use among the sample. As compared to males, more females had smoked cigarettes, used alcohol and marijuana. While alcohol use decrease with age, marijuana use on the other hand increases with age. Results from multivariate analysis revealed that having ever drunk alcohol and alcohol use in the past one month were independently associated with all the four indices of risky sexual behaviour (ever had sex, non-condom use, multiple sexual partners and survival sex). Both marijuana use and smoking of cigarettes were associated with having ever had sex, multiple sexual partners and survival sex. Other drug use was independently associated with non-condom use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Substance use seems to serve as a possible risk factor for sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth. Harm reduction interventions are needed to prevent street children and youth from engaging in substance use and risky sexual behaviours. Such programmes should pay special attention to females and younger children who are highly susceptible to the adverse conditions on the street."

Training was offered to a variety of professionals and paraprofessionals, but most often to physicians and nurses. Median program duration was 16 hours, but programs' duration, intensity and size varied widely. Most programs used evidence-based guidelines and reported adherence to core tobacco treatment competencies. Training programs were less frequent in low-income countries and in Africa. Securing funding was the major challenge for most programs; current funding sources were government (58%), non-government organizations (23%), pharmaceutical companies (17%) and, in one case, the tobacco industry.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Training programs for tobacco treatment providers are diverse and growing. Most upper- and middle-income countries have programs, and most programs appear to be evidence-based. However, funding is a major challenge. In particular, more programs are needed for non-physicians and for low-income countries."

            "abstract": "The rapid increase in communication and transportation between Africa and other continents as well as the erosion of social fabric attended by poverty, ethnic conflicts, and civil wars has led to increased trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs. Cannabis dominates illicit trade and accounts for as much as 40% of global interdiction. Due to escalating seizures in recent years, the illicit trade in heroin and cocaine has become a concern that has quickly spread from West Africa to include Eastern and Southern Africa in the past 10 years. All regions of Africa are characterized by the use of cannabis, reflecting its entrenched status all over Africa. Most alarming though is the use of heroin, which is now being injected frequently and threatens to reverse the gain made in the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of HIV infection and other blood-borne diseases among injection drug users is five to six times that among the general population, calling for urgent intervention among this group. Programs that aim to reduce the drug trafficking in Africa and needle syringe programs as well as medication-assisted treatment (MAT) of heroin dependence while still in their infancy in Africa show promise and need to be scaled up."

            "abstract": "Enhancement of women's autonomy is a key factor for improving women's health and nutrition. With nearly 12 million orphan and vulnerable children (OVC) in Africa due to HIV/AIDS, the study of OVC primary caregivers' nutrition is fundamental. We investigated the association between married women's autonomy and their nutritional status; explored whether this relationship was modified by OVC primary caregiving; and analyzed whether decision-making autonomy mediated the association between household wealth and body mass index (BMI). This cross-sectional study used the data from Demographic Health Surveys collected during 2006-2007 from 20- to 49-year-old women in Namibia (n = 2633), Swaziland (n = 1395), and Zambia (n = 2920). Analyses included logistic regression, Sobel, and Goodman tests. Our results indicated that women's educational attainment increased the odds for being overweight (Swaziland and Zambia) and decreased the odds for being underweight (Namibia). In Zambia, having at least primary education increased the odds for being overweight only among child primary caregivers regardless of the OVC status of the child, and having autonomy for buying everyday household items increased the odds for being overweight only among OVC primary caregivers. Decision-making autonomy mediated the association between household wealth and OVC primary caregivers' BMI in Zambia (Z = 2.13, p value = 0.03). We concluded that depending on each country's contextual characteristics, having education can decrease the odds for being an underweight woman or increase the odds for being an overweight woman. Further studies should explore why in Namibia education has an effect on women's overweight status only among women who are caring for a child."

Data are from the 2010 South African National Urban Prevalence Study of Gambling Behavior. A representative sample of the urban adult population in South Africa (N = 3,000). Responses to the 9-item PGSI and ratings on the Beck Depression Index, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Tool (WHO ASSIST). Cross tabulations and Chi square analyses along with logistic regression analyses with and without controls for socio-demographic and/or socio-economic variables were used to identify comorbidities. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance use were clearly higher among the sample at risk for problem gambling. Black African racial status and living in areas characterized by migrant mining workers was associated with increased risk of problem gambling and comorbidities. There is strong evidence that findings of comorbidities between pathological gambling and depression, anxiety and substance abuse in developed countries generalize to the developing country of South Africa. Historical context, however, gives those comorbidities a unique demographic distribution."

We review recent studies in high-risk groups as well as findings relating to geographical heterogeneity and the potential for targeting 'high-transmission zones' in the 10 countries with highest HIV prevalence.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Our review of recent studies confirmed earlier findings that, even in the context of generalized epidemics, MSM have a substantially higher prevalence than the general population. Estimates of prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) in sub-Saharan African countries are rarely available and, when they are, often outdated. We identified recent studies of sex workers in Kenya and Uganda. In all three cases - MSM, PWID, and sex workers - HIV prevalence estimates are mostly based on convenience. Moreover, good estimates of the total size of these populations are not available. Our review of recent studies of high-risk populations defined on the basis of geography showed high levels of both new and existing infections in Kenya (slums), South Africa (peri-urban communities), and Uganda (fishing villages).\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Recent empirical findings combined with evidence from phylogenetic studies and supported by mathematical models provide a clear rationale for testing the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of targeted HIV prevention approaches in hyperendemic populations to supplement measures aimed at the general population."

The Alcohol Use Disorder Inventory Tool and Beck Depression Inventory 1 were used to assess these factors and their affect on pediatric adherence.

Drawing on participatory research methods (interviews, focus groups, photo-essays, story writing and observations), we bring together the findings of two qualitative studies from rural communities in Ethiopia and Kenya involving 94 orphans and their households. We argue that children's contributions to household livelihoods are pivotal to the coping of households affected by AIDS. Despite various socio-economic constraints placed on their childhood, orphans' access to the household-based resources of extended families enhances their ability to obtain long-term means for their livelihoods. Care for orphaned children is also influenced by reciprocity in terms of household labour contributions, the care of sick family members and generating and contributing income in return for adult protection and provisions. We conclude that a one-dimensional view of orphans as \"burdens\" not only overshadows the meaningful contributions they make to their families, but also diverts attention away from interventions grounded in their felt needs and capacities."

Immigrant groups include those from Latin America/Caribbean, East and South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe/Central Asia, and Middle East/North Africa. Multivariate logistic regressions are estimated using cross-sectional data from the New Immigrant Survey (N = 7,397). Results show that patterns of smoking and binge drinking vary by gender and by region of origins. In addition, arriving at age 0-9 are directly associated with higher odds of binge drinking among adult women. Among adult men, age at migration moderates the association between length of residence and substance use. Specifically, length of residence has more detrimental effects for adolescent immigrants (arriving at age 10-18) on smoking, while its detrimental effects are more pronounced for childhood immigrants (arriving at age 0-9) on binge drinking. We interpret our findings within the critical period model in epidemiological research, concluding that adolescence and childhood are critical life stages that are associated with differential effects of length of residence when looking at smoking and binge drinking among immigrant men."

Three themes are sketched: (1) As both HIV prevalence and circular migration increase, former migrant workers affected by AIDS may return to their families for care and support, especially at the end of life, often under crisis conditions. Families thus lose promising members, as well as sources of support. However, very little is known about the children of such migrants. (2) Following patterns of migration established for far different reasons, children may have to relocate to different places, sometimes over long distances, if their AIDS-affected parents can no longer care for them. They face the same adaptation challenges as other children who move, but complicated by loss of parent(s), AIDS stigma, and often poverty. (3) The issue of migrant families living with HIV has been studied to some extent, but mainly in developed countries with a long history of migration, and with little attention paid to the children in such families. Difficulties include involuntary separation from family members, isolation and lack of support, disclosure and planning for children's care should the parent(s) die and differences in treatment access within the same family. Numerous research and policy gaps are defined regarding the three themes, and a call is made for thinking about migration, families and AIDS to go beyond description to include resilience theory, and to go beyond prevention to include care."

Problems associated with high HIV prevalence are compounded by gender inequality and high rates of gender-based violence exacerbated by heavy alcohol use and increasing methamphetamine use.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Informal drinking establishments (known as shebeens) were geocoded and mapped. Based on visual examination, we identified 36 neighbourhoods, each of which contained between three to seven drinking venues clustered together. Neighbourhoods were separated from each other by at least 200m. We randomly selected 30 of the 36 neighbourhoods. Outreach workers screened males in shebeens and screened their female partners. This analysis includes 580 study participants recruited from 30 neighbourhoods between 2010 and 2012. All participants completed a baseline questionnaire that included individual-level, couple-level, and neighbourhood-level measures of alcohol and other drug use, HIV infection, and HIV risk behaviours. Multilevel fixed effects regression analyses stratified by gender were conducted to examine correlates of HIV infection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Women were twice as likely as men to be HIV infected, yet they reported fewer sex partners. Neighbourhood prevalence of HIV was correlated with greater likelihood of HIV infection among women, but not men. Neighbourhood methamphetamine use was marginally associated with HIV among women but not among men. At the individual level, heavy alcohol use was marginally associated with HIV infection among men but not among women. Having an HIV positive partner was the strongest correlate of being HIV positive among both men and women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Findings from this study underscore the need for policy makers to direct scarce resources to the communities, places within communities, and populations, especially vulnerable women, where the impact on HIV prevention and onward transmission will be greatest."

For eras 1996/97-2000/01 and 2001/02-2005/06, we calculated cause-specific death-rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) using age-, sex- and calendar-rates of the general Scottish population. Major causes of death were identified by high SMRs (>5 across eras) or rates (>50 per 100,000 person-years in either era), and their time-specific influences characterised by proportional hazards analyses.\n## RESULTS\nThe SDMD cohort comprised 69,456 individuals, 350,315 person-years and 2590 deaths. The overall SMR reduced from 6.4 (95% CI: 6.0-6.9) to 4.8 (95% CI: 4.6-5.0) between eras. We identified five major causes of death: drug-related (1383 deaths), homicide (118) and infectious diseases (90) with high SMRs; suicide (269) and digestive system disease (168) with high rates. HCV diagnosis marked individuals with at least double the risk of cause-specific mortality, including adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for no HCV diagnosis of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.41-0.53) for drug-related deaths (DRDs) and 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10-0.22) for death from digestive system disease. Increased DRD risk at older age (>34 years) appeared specific to HCV-diagnosed individuals (interaction: χ₁²=7.7, p=0.01). Alcohol misuse increased HRs: for DRD (1.76, 95% CI: 1.50-2.06), suicide (1.88, 95% CI: 1.35-2.60), deaths from digestive system disease (3.19, 95% CI: 2.21-4.60) and non-major causes (1.87, 95% CI: 1.49-2.35). Stimulant misuse increased suicide risk: adjusted HR 1.91 (95% CI: 1.43-2.54).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDrug-users in Scotland are exposed to variously increased mortality risks.

HIV prevalence varied from 15.9% in The Gambia to 68% in Benin among female sex workers, whereas it ranged from 9.8% in The Gambia to 34.9% in Nigeria for MSM. Yet, important data gaps exist, including key populations size estimations in several countries as well as HIV prevalence, incidence and other biomarkers of HIV risk. Because of sociocultural, legal, political and economic challenges, exacerbated by a poor health system infrastructure, the HIV response is not strategically directed toward programs for key populations in countries with concentrated epidemics.

Underdeveloped urban areas, or townships, are particularly hard hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Alcohol use in these townships has been established as an important risk factor for HIV transmission. Likewise, alcohol serving venues (shebeens) have been identified as sites where substance abuse and sexual risk taking occur. However, little is known about how proximity of alcohol serving establishments (shebeens) to one's residence may be related to sexual risk-taking We surveyed 3,261 men and women attending shebeens in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. We investigated the relationships between attending nearby (<15 min walk) versus distant (>15 min walk) shebeens, and sex and substance abuse related risk-taking. Women who attended distant shebeens versus nearby shebeens relative to their residence were approximately twice as likely to report HIV positive status. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that these women were also more likely to report other sexually transmitted infections, greater numbers of sex partners, higher rates of alcohol and drug use, and seeking out new sex partners at shebeen. No differences in sex behavior, substance use or HIV/STI were identified among men. Proximity of shebeens appears to be an important contextual factor in explaining HIV/STI transmission risk-taking. Future studies should focus on how anonymity may be related to sexual risk and substance use behaviors among women in South African townships."

Miraa (e.g., Lara) from Kenya was the most popularly used khat variety, sold in pre-wrapped bundles of approximately 250 g costing £3 each and delivered four days a week. Harari (e.g., Owdi) from Ethiopia was sold in 200 g, 400 g and 1 kg bundles, priced between £5 and £20 and delivered two days a week. The primary benefit of khat use was reported to be social interaction. The customers were predominantly adult males of Somali origin. Most sellers claimed a self-imposed ban on sales to children under 18 years old. Khat bundles had no labelling describing variety or weight and sellers had no knowledge of the use of pesticides on khat and did not advertise the risks associated with khat use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Khat selling establishments were businesses that did not adhere to trade standards regulations (e.g., labelling khat bundles).

            "abstract": "Researching the epidemiology and estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) for mainstream populations anywhere in the world has presented a challenge to researchers. Three major approaches have been used in the past: surveillance and record review systems, clinic-based studies, and active case ascertainment methods. The literature on each of these methods is reviewed citing the strengths, weaknesses, prevalence results, and other practical considerations for each method. Previous conclusions about the prevalence of FAS and total FASD in the United States (US) population are summarized. Active approaches which provide clinical outreach, recruitment, and diagnostic services in specific populations have been demonstrated to produce the highest prevalence estimates. We then describe and review studies utilizing in-school screening and diagnosis, a special type of active case ascertainment. Selected results from a number of in-school studies in South Africa, Italy, and the US are highlighted. The particular focus of the review is on the nature of the data produced from in-school methods and the specific prevalence rates of FAS and total FASD which have emanated from them. We conclude that FAS and other FASD are more prevalent in school populations, and therefore the general population, than previously estimated. We believe that the prevalence of FAS in typical, mixed-racial, and mixed-socioeconomic populations of the US is at least 2 to 7 per 1,000. Regarding all levels of FASD, we estimate that the current prevalence of FASD in populations of younger school children may be as high as 2-5% in the US and some Western European countries."

Several new community initiatives aiming to increase access to housing and to social and health services for the homeless were implemented in the city between 2000 and 2003. This study aims to update the mortality rate estimate for the period 2001-2006 and to examine factors that could explain a difference between rates, if any. A second cohort study was conducted between 2001 and 2006. The Cohort 2 mortality rate was computed and compared with the Cohort 1 rate. Several analyses were then carried out: (1) mortality rates in the general population were compared with street youth rates using standardized mortality ratios (SMR); (2) Cohorts 1 and 2 distributions of risk factors for mortality were examined, and their effects were assessed using multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses carried out on a combined Cohorts 1 and 2 dataset. Mortality rate among street youth decreased by 79% while it declined by only 19% in the general population; the SMR for Cohort 1 was higher than for Cohort 2 (11.6 versus 3.0). Multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses yielded estimates that were close to the model's estimates based on Cohort 1 data only, and participation in Cohort 1 was an independent predictor of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 9.0. The mortality decline cannot be completely explained by a similar decrease among the general population or by a difference in distribution of risk factors for mortality between the two cohorts. Field workers suggested that the decrease in heroin consumption they had observed in the streets might have contributed to the mortality decline. We then performed additional analyses which showed that even though the proportion of street youth currently using heroin decreased significantly between 1995 and 2005, the association between heroin use and mortality was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.3). It seems that various factors could have contributed to the decline in mortality rates among street youth, one plausible factor being the implementation of new services for the homeless. This study underscores the importance of monitoring risky behaviors among vulnerable populations to ensure that morbidity and mortality data among these populations is correctly interpreted. Setting up a system to monitor the drug market could improve the quality of information collected.\n"

Over the study period on average all-cause SMR decreased significantly in men (p = 0.003) and women (p = 0.05) largely due to the decline in SMRs for drug-related deaths and suicide.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn the largest study so far reported, mortality of male and female offenders was far greater than expected for all major causes, especially deaths caused by drug overdose. Despite some indication of a reduction in excess mortality in recent years, there remains an overwhelming need for enhanced responses to mental health and drug problems for people who have been in prison.\n"

Transmission in Africa is mainly heterosexual and approximately 60 % of the infected are women. Asia has epidemics among intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men, and among sex workers and their customers. Several Asian countries now have generalized epidemics. Urban populations are more affected than rural ones in all geographical areas of the world, with only a few exceptions. Modern HIV treatment saves many lives, but only an increase of preventive measures can reverse the current trends. To obtain a reversal, it is adamant with broad mobilization of affected populations, clear political leadership and prioritisation and a considerable increase in help from developed countries."

Data were extracted to Epi Info (version 7) and chi-square analyses undertaken. RESULTS. Lifetime alcohol use remained stable but high at 20 - 25% and 49.1 - 49.6% according to South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) and Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) data, respectively. Age of initiation remained stable; 12% of adolescents initiated alcohol use prior to age 13 years. Significant gender differences existed with more males having ever consumed alcohol, engaged in binge drinking, and driven or walked under the influence of alcohol (DUI and WUI, respectively). Binge drinking among females increased significantly from 27% to 36% (SADHS) and 18% to 27% (YRBS). DUI and WUI increased. Homicide/violence, suicide and unintentional deaths were significantly associated with blood alcohol concentration (BAC).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although SA has made significant strides in alcohol control and prevention of alcohol-related harm over the past decade, early alcohol initiation remains a concern and binge drinking is increasing, especially among females. Significant associations exist between BAC and alcohol-related fatalities. Findings imply that regulatory policies are inadequate; additional efforts are required to ensure that control strategies translate into a reduction in harmful alcohol use by SA youth."

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the literature on various mental health problems and their impact on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Depression, anxiety disorders, and disorders related to substance abuse were identified as key role-players influencing adherence. The severity of symptoms related to these disorders was found to be inversely related to ART adherence, with the possible exception of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD was found to have both positive and negative implications for adherence, with severity of symptoms ranging from health-protective concern to disabling distress. Possible solutions aimed at addressing the adverse effects of mental health problems on adherence are discussed. Routine screening in ART settings is suggested in settings where follow-up of positive screen scores are possible, along with the necessary interventions to resolve the disorder of concern. Suggested interventions include utilising psychotherapeutic treatment, both in isolation and in conjunction with medication, to address mental health problems. Furthermore, finding effective ways of marshalling social support is recommended for ensuring optimal adherence, and possibly mitigating the adverse effects of mental health problems. Further research is needed to find feasible ways of identifying, assessing and treating patients with mental health problems in resource-constrained settings where HIV prevalence is highest."

There were 2.3 million new HIV infections globally and 1.6 million AIDS deaths in 2012. As a result of large roll-out programs with integrated voluntary counselling and testing and prevention programs in resource limited settings, sexual transmission of HIV decreased substantially over the last years. However, the world is not on track to reduced HIV transmission among people who inject drugs. Especially in Eastern Europe and Asia prevention coverage for people who inject drugs remains low. In addition, effective prevention among these people is undermined by stigmatisation, discrimination, punitive policy frameworks and law enforcement practices, which discourage people from seeking the health and social services they need. Antiretroviral coverage among pregnant women living with HIV reached 62 % in 2012 resulting in a reduction of newly infected children by 35 % from 2009. In 2012, 9.7 million people in low and middle-income countries received antiretroviral therapy, representing 61 % of all who were eligible under the 2010 WHO HIV treatment guidelines. Under the 2013 guidelines, this represents only 34 % of the 28.3 million people eligible in 2013. A new concept to curb the HIV epidemic is \"Test and Treat\" which involves population-wide HIV tests with immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy among all HIV infected individuals. However, there are concerns regarding the sustainability of such treatment programs for decades due to lost to follow up and insufficient adherence and the danger of a large increase of resistant HIV which jeopardize the effectiveness of affordable treatments."

In SAm/SSA, limited data suggest that mean HIV prevalence is proportional to HCV prevalence (beta = 0.84, R(2) = 0.99), but will be much greater than in non-SAm/SSA settings with no threshold HCV prevalence that corresponds to low HIV risk. At low HCV prevalences (<50%), time-series data suggest that any change in HIV prevalence over time is likely to be much smaller (<25%) than the change in HCV prevalence over the same time-period, but that this difference diminishes at higher HCV prevalences.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      HCV prevalence could be an indicator of HIV risk among IDUs.

Abstaining girls believed that their friends and parents think that they should abstain from sex, that their friends abstained from sex and that abstinence helped them to mature emotionally. Abstinent boys expressed intentions to abstain from sex until marriage. Targeted intervention research is required to encourage South African rural high school learners to delay their sexual initiation to reduce their risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

This article provides a broad overview of the prevalence, aetiology, assessment and management of co-morbid EDs and substance use disorders (SUDs).\n    \n\n\n          Review:\n        \n      \n      The co-occurrence of EDs and SUDs is high. The functional relationship between EDs and SUDs vary within and across ED subtypes, depends on the class of substance, and needs to be carefully assessed for each patient. Substances such as caffeine, tobacco, insulin, thyroid medications, stimulants or over the counter medications (laxatives, diuretics) may be used to aid weight loss and/or provide energy, and alcohol or psychoactive substances could be used for emotional regulation or as part of a pattern of impulsive behaviour. A key message conveyed in the current literature is the importance of screening and assessment for co-morbid SUDs and EDs in patients presenting with either disorder. There is a paucity of treatment studies on the management of co-occurring EDs and SUDs. Overall, the literature indicates that the ED and SUD should be addressed simultaneously using a multi-disciplinary approach. The need for medical stabilization, hospitalization or inpatient treatment needs to be assessed based on general medical and psychiatric considerations. Common features across therapeutic interventions include psycho-education about the aetiological commonalities, risks and sequelae of concurrent ED behaviours and substance abuse, dietary education and planning, cognitive challenging of eating disordered attitudes and beliefs, building of skills and coping mechanisms, addressing obstacles to improvement and the prevention of relapse. Emphasis should be placed on building a collaborative therapeutic relationship and avoiding power struggles. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been frequently used in the treatment of co-morbid EDs and SUDs, however there are no randomized controlled trials. More recently evidence has been found for the efficacy of dialectical behavioural therapy in reducing both ED and substance use behaviours.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Future research would benefit from a meta-analysis of the current research in order to better understand the relationships between these two commonly co-occurring disorders."

Despite evidence of the need for care, a remarkable deficit of providers for MNS disorder service delivery persists in sub-Saharan Africa. This critical workforce can be developed from a range of non-specialist and specialist health workers who have access to evidence-based interventions, whose roles, and the associated tasks, are articulated and clearly delineated, and who are equipped to master and maintain the competencies associated with providing MNS disorder care. In 2012, the Neuroscience Forum of the Institute of Medicine convened a meeting of key stakeholders in Kampala, Uganda, to discuss a set of candidate core competencies for the delivery of mental health and neurological care, focusing specifically on depression, psychosis, epilepsy, and alcohol use disorders. This article discusses the candidate core competencies for non-specialist health workers and the complexities of implementing core competencies in low- and middle-income country settings. Sub-Saharan Africa, however, has the potential to implement novel training initiatives through university networks and through structured processes that engage ministries of health.

Based on analyses of data from several representative national surveys over the period 2000-2007, this paper examines the extent to which this is the case in South Africa. It explores trends in the number of children living in child-only households and characterises these children relative to children living in households with adults (mixed-generation households). The findings indicate that the proportion of child-only households is relatively small (0.47% in 2006) and does not appear to be increasing. In addition, the vast majority (92.1%) of children resident in child-only households have a living parent. The findings raise critical questions about the circumstances leading to the formation of child-only households and highlight that they cannot for the main part be ascribed to HIV orphaning. Nonetheless, the number of children living in this household form is not insignificant, and their circumstances, when compared with children in mixed-generation households, indicate a range of challenges, including greater economic vulnerability and inadequate service access. We argue that a solitary focus on the HIV epidemic and its related orphaning as the cause of child-only households masks other important issues for consideration in addressing their needs, and risks the development of inappropriate policies, programmes and interventions."

The main outcome was a marker of sub-clinical vascular disease, mean carotid intima media thickness (mCIMT), measured using high resolution ultrasound.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Compared with Caucasians, the black Africans demonstrated higher mCIMT (age and sex adjusted β=0.044, 95% CI, 0.024-0.064 mm). The blacks also had higher 24h systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, adiposity, and C-reactive protein. In addition, blacks were less physically active (790.0 kcal/d vs 947.3 kcal/d, p<0.001), more likely to smoke (25% vs 16.3%, p=0.002), and demonstrated higher alcohol abuse (gamma glutamyl transferase, 66.6 μ/L vs 27.2 μ/L, p<0.001) compared with Caucasians. The difference in mCIMT between blacks and Caucasians was attenuated by 34% when conventional risk factors were added to the model and a further 18% when health behaviors were included.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is an excess burden of sub clinical vascular disease seen in black Africans compared to Caucasians, which can be largely explained by health behaviors and conventional risk factors."

The overall injury death rate of 157.8 per 100,000 population is nearly twice the global average, and the rate of homicide of women by intimate partners is six times the global average. With a focus on homicide, and violence against women and children, we review the magnitude, contexts of occurrence, and patterns of violence, and refer to traffic-related and other unintentional injuries. The social dynamics that support violence are widespread poverty, unemployment, and income inequality; patriarchal notions of masculinity that valourise toughness, risk-taking, and defence of honour; exposure to abuse in childhood and weak parenting; access to firearms; widespread alcohol misuse; and weaknesses in the mechanisms of law enforcement. Although there have been advances in development of services for victims of violence, innovation from non-governmental organisations, and evidence from research, there has been a conspicuous absence of government stewardship and leadership. Successful prevention of violence and injury is contingent on identification by the government of violence as a strategic priority and development of an intersectoral plan based on empirically driven programmes and policies."

We examined the association between psychopathology and substance use in high school students to determine the nature of the associations and the role of demographic factors in these associations. Grade 8 (N=480) and Grade 11 (N=459) students from 39 high schools in Cape Town, South Africa, completed a self-administered questionnaire. Psychopathology information was obtained from total scores on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Lifetime prevalence rates were calculated for tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and inhalant use. Associations between psychopathology and substance use were determined using regression analyses and structural equation modeling. On adjusting for demographic characteristics, significant associations were found between PTSD and all substance use, between depression, alcohol, cannabis and inhalant use, and between anxiety and cannabis use. The associations of PTSD and depression with alcohol and cannabis use, and between anxiety and cannabis use, were moderated by grade. Although psychopathology and substance use were associated with each other, these associations occurred in accordance with substance and grade. Roles for gender, age and ethnicity emerged in the associations, but further investigation is recommended to examine these."

            "abstract": "HIV is no longer a new or emerging disease in southern Africa. In the era of HIV and AIDS, families and households have continued to form, build, migrate and dissolve. Children born in the 1980s with the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission have already gone on to start the next generation of families and households. Isolating the impact of HIV and AIDS on families and households is complex given that the epidemic has become part of the direction and force of contemporary demographic, social and economic processes and trends. Cycles of family and household life have occurred in a changing HIV and AIDS public-health environment, one in which HIV treatment access has increased rapidly. As part of an on-going process to assess the relevance and effectiveness of policies and programmes designed to protect and support children affected by HIV and AIDS, it is necessary to update our knowledge about the family and household circumstances in which children live. This paper summarises findings from a review on the \"Demographic Evidence of Family and Household Changes in Response to the Effects of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa: Implications for Efforts to Strengthen Families\". The review examined published literature presenting data from empirical studies, primarily large, cross-sectional or longitudinal population-based or sample surveys. The family or household life-cycle is used as a conceptual and organisational framework. The implications of the demographic evidence are discussed in relation to policy and programme responses to strengthen families and households in the region."

Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) associated with different primary substance types were calculated and Cox-regression analyses were performed in order to establish hazard ratios (HR) associated with injection drug use and psychiatric comorbidity. SMRs for primary users of specific substances were: cannabis: 4.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2-5.8), cocaine: 6.4 (CI: 3.9-10.0), amphetamine: 6.0 (CI: 4.2-8.3), heroin: 9.1 (CI: 8.5-9.8), and other opioids 7.7 (CI: 6.6-8.9). For MDMA ('ecstasy') the crude mortality rate was 1.7/1000 person-years (CI: 0.4-7.0) and the SMR was not significantly elevated. Injection drug use was associated with significantly increased hazard ratios in users of opioids and cocaine/amphetamine. Overall, psychiatric comorbidity was not associated with increased mortality (HR: 1.1 [CI: 0.9-1.2], p=.28), but an association was found specifically among cocaine/amphetamine users (HR: 3.6 [CI: 2.1-6.4], p<.001).\n"

            "abstract": "The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has endured several major events of infection parenteral transmission. Recent work has established the utility of using hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a proxy biomarker for assessing the epidemic potential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) parenteral transmission. In this review, we use data on the prevalence of HCV infection antibody (seroprevalence) among general population and high risk population groups to assess the potential for HIV parenteral transmission in MENA. Relatively low prevalence of HCV infection in the general population groups was reported in most MENA countries indicating that parenteral HIV transmission at endemic levels does not appear to be a cause for concern. Nonetheless, there could be opportunities for localized HIV outbreaks and transmission of other blood-borne infections in some settings such as healthcare facilities. Though there have been steady improvements in safety measures related to parenteral modes of transmission in the region, these improvements have not been uniform across all countries. More precautions, including infection control training programs, surveillance systems for nosocomial infections and wider coverage and evaluation of hepatitis B virus immunization programs need to be implemented to avoid the unnecessary spread of HIV, HCV, and other blood-borne pathogens along the parenteral modes of transmission."

            "abstract": "South Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in the world. The purpose of this study was to identify high risk factors associated with drinking alcohol prior to pregnancy recognition in 24 neighborhoods in the Cape Flats outside Cape Town, South Africa. An interviewer assessed risk among 619 pregnant Black/African women between the ages of 18 and 41 years. Logistic regression analyses explored factors associated with drinking alcohol post conception but prior to pregnancy recognition. Forced multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that drinking prior to pregnancy recognition was associated with being younger, single, having better living conditions, smoking, having a longer gestation prior to pregnancy recognition, having a greater number of sexual partners, and a higher incidence of intimate partner violence. Depressive symptoms tended to be higher among alcohol users. These risk factors were consistent with other research on the characteristics of South African women having children with a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and/or of non pregnant women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. These findings highlight the need for women of child-bearing age to be routinely screened for alcohol use and its associated risk factors. Intervention efforts could be integrated into health initiatives already present in South Africa including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. Preconception care is particularly important since pregnancy recognition often occurs several weeks to months following conception and could be implemented by South African community health workers. These endeavors should facilitate national goals of healthier pregnancies and the elimination of FASDs in South Africa."

One hypothesis is that psychological and behavioural variables associated with adolescence may increase risk of developing TB. The study aimed to determine whether psychosocial and behavioural variables affect incidence of TB disease in adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A case-control study design was used in adolescents who were participants in a TB epidemiological study. Cases were adolescents diagnosed with TB disease. Approximately half of the controls had no TB disease but a positive TST indicative of latent TB. Half had neither TB disease nor latent TB. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by participants. The questionnaire consisted of a combination of standardised psychosocial instruments.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 292 participants, 62 were cases, 112 had latent TB and 118 neither TB disease nor latent TB. There were no significant differences in instrument scores between cases and controls. There was a trend for certain adverse life events to be more common in the TB-disease group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In adolescents, a trend for association between TB incidence and psychosocial and behavioural variables was not statistically significant. Given the trend, research with larger samples, and more comprehensive assessment of the relationship between stressors and TB, is warranted."

In addition, 15.9% reported at least 1 condom breakage during the previous week. There was a significant association between all types of violence and HIV prevalence. The adjusted prevalence ratios of HIV were 1.45 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-2.00), 1.42 (95% CI, 1.02-1.98), and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08-1.41) among those who had ever experienced physical, sexual, and psychological violence, respectively.

We compared the effects of interventions using risk ratios (RR), and presented RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 12 eligible trials. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). The remaining two trials, in general adult populations, were conducted in Timor-Leste and South Africa. Sustained incentive programmesOnly two trials have assessed whether material incentives and enablers can improve long-term adherence and completion of treatment for active TB, and neither demonstrated a clear benefit (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; two trials, 4356 participants; low quality evidence). In one trial, the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday, whilst in the other trial, nurses distributing the vouchers chose to \"ration\" their distribution among eligible patients, giving only to those whom they felt were most deprived.Three trials assessed the effects of material incentives and enablers on completion of TB prophylaxis with mixed results (low quality evidence). A large effect was seen with regular cash incentives given to drug users at each clinic visit in a setting with extremely low treatment completion in the control group (treatment completion 52.8% intervention versus 3.6% control; RR 14.53, 95% CI 3.64 to 57.98; one trial, 108 participants), but no effects were seen in one trial assessing a cash incentive for recently released prisoners (373 participants), or another trial assessing material incentives offered by parents to teenagers (388 participants). Single once-only incentivesHowever in specific populations, such as recently released prisoners, drug users, and the homeless, trials show that material incentives probably do improve one-off clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of anti-TB prophylaxis (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96; three trials, 595 participants; moderate quality evidence), and may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29; two trials, 1371 participants; low quality evidence). Comparison of different types of incentivesSingle trials in specific sub-populations suggest that an immediate cash incentive may be more effective than delaying the incentive until completion of treatment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.24; one trial, 300 participants; low quality evidence), cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (completion of TB prophylaxis: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.56; one trial, 141 participants; low quality evidence; return for skin test reading: RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; one trial, 652 participants; low quality evidence); and higher cash incentives may be more effective than lower cash incentives (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; one trial, 404 participants; low quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Material incentives and enablers may have some positive short term effects on clinic attendance, particularly for marginal populations such as drug users, recently released prisoners, and the homeless, but there is currently insufficient evidence to know if they can improve long term adherence to TB treatment."

            "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental deficits that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol. These can include cognitive, behavioural, and neurological impairment, as well as structural and functional brain damage. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is among the most sensitive endpoints affected in FASD. The cerebellar peduncles, large bundles of myelinated nerve fibers that connect the cerebellum to the brainstem, constitute the principal white matter element of the EBC circuit. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to assess white matter integrity in fibre pathways linking brain regions. DTI scans of 54 children with FASD and 23 healthy controls, mean age 10.1 ± 1.0 years, from the Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort were processed using voxelwise group comparisons. Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to lower fractional anisotropy (FA) bilaterally in the superior cerebellar peduncles and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the left middle peduncle, effects that remained significant after controlling for potential confounding variables. Lower FA and higher MD in these regions were associated with poorer EBC performance. Moreover, effects of alcohol exposure on EBC decreased significantly after inclusion of these DTI measures in regression models, suggesting that these white matter deficits partially mediate the relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to EBC. The associations of greater alcohol consumption with these DTI measures are largely attributable to greater radial diffusivity, possibly indicating poorer myelination. Thus, these data suggest that fetal alcohol-related deficits in EBC are attributable, in part, to poorer myelination in key regions of the cerebellar peduncles."

All 37 inmates from sub-Saharan Africa were immune. Considering only people native from regions other than sub-Saharan Africa, 7 of 40 inmates born after 1981 were susceptible (18.5%), whereas none of the 39 inmates born in 1981 or before were susceptible (p = 0.006).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Susceptibility to measles was fairly low in this prison population composed mainly of migrants. Living in sub-Saharan Africa during childhood, and birth before 1982 were protective factors associated with the presence of immunity against measles. The heterogeneity of vaccination campaigns in the various regions of the world, particularly in terms of the timing of their introduction and scale of diffusion, explains epidemiological variability. Targeted vaccination in accordance to origin and age would offer excellent herd immunity and would substantially reduce risks of outbreaks as well as costs."

Titles and abstracts were screened to identify studies describing relevant services, using a broad definition of empowerment. Data were extracted on service-delivery models and degree of FSW involvement, and analysed with reference to a four-stage framework developed by Ashodaya. This conceptualises community empowerment as progressing from (1) initial engagement with the sex worker community, to (2) community involvement in targeted activities, to (3) ownership, and finally, (4) sustainability of action beyond the community.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 5413 articles screened, 129 were included, describing 42 projects. Targeted services in FSW 'hotspots' were generally isolated and limited in coverage and scope, mostly offering only free condoms and STI treatment. Many services were provided as part of research activities and offered via a clinic with associated community outreach. Empowerment processes were usually limited to peer-education (stage 2 of framework). Community mobilisation as an activity in its own right was rarely documented and while most projects successfully engaged communities, few progressed to involvement, community ownership or sustainability. Only a few interventions had evolved to facilitate collective action through formal democratic structures (stage 3). These reported improved sexual negotiating power and community solidarity, and positive behavioural and clinical outcomes. Sustainability of many projects was weakened by disunity within transient communities, variable commitment of programmers, low human resource capacity and general resource limitations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most FSW SRH projects in Africa implemented participatory processes consistent with only the earliest stages of community empowerment, although isolated projects demonstrate proof of concept for successful empowerment interventions in African settings."

A sample of 22,188 subjects was analyzed (of whom, 3,162 were foreign).

Descriptive analysis of the population, determination of area of origin with major alcohol consumption and related factors for each kind of consumption, separating immigrant and native population, were performed. The immigrant profile was heterogeneous, though predominantly aged between 35 and 54, and were living with their family and working. 3.4% of immigrants and 3.2% of natives were considered excessive drinkers; 8.9% and 10%, respectively, reported binge drinking in the last year. Immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, and Latin America, Andean countries had significantly a higher report of frequent alcohol consumption and/or binge drinking compared to native. On the contrary, born in Africa was a protective factor. Unemployment was the most relevant related factor, being more important in the immigrant population. The excessive alcohol consumption in immigrants is dissimilar; the interventions must be adapted to their social situation, environments and areas of origin."

Patients with cocaine related problems continue to be predominantly male, with a mean age of around 30 years. Substantial changes in the racial profile of patients have occurred over time. Poly drug use is high with cocaine often used with alcohol, cannabis and other drugs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These trends point to the possibility of cocaine use becoming a serious health and social issue in South Africa and demonstrate the utility of continued monitoring of cocaine treatment admissions in the future. They also highlight the need to address cocaine use in national and provincial policy planning and intervention efforts. In terms of treatment, the findings highlight the need to ensure that treatment practitioners are adequately trained to address stimulant problems, poly drug use, and HIV and other risk behaviour related to crack cocaine use. Possible gaps in access to treatment by certain sectors of the population should be addessed as a matter of urgency."

            "abstract": "Core groups contain individuals who are regularly infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and are able to transmit their infection to a large number of sexual partners. Classical core groups, such as sex workers and their male partners, or men who have sex with men (MSM), have contributed to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant N gonorrhoeae over many years. Sex workers and their clients were the most important core group driving the dissemination of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae in the 1970s. Such individuals have continued to contribute to penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae outbreaks as well as to the subsequent emergence of gonococcal resistance to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, spectinomycin and cephalosporins in various settings. MSM have been a very important core group since the 1980s, first with the spread of TetM-expressing N gonorrhoeae and, second, with the dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant N gonorrhoeae. MSM-associated sexual networks have most recently been critical to the spread of gonococci resistant to third generation extended spectrum cephalosporins, including cefixime and ceftriaxone. Individuals within other core groups have also been linked to the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhoea, such as military personnel, travellers, drug users, young adults, older men and members of street gangs. Understanding core behaviours and their geospatial clustering is essential for an optimal public health response to the rising prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhoea. Furthermore, rapid and effective treatment of N gonorrhoeae infections in core individuals and their sexual partners should be a priority for gonorrhoea control programmes."

Searches and extraction were undertaken using protocols and cross-checking of decisions by two authors. Additional data were requested from study investigators where studies did not report relevant data.\n## RESULTS\n1911 articles and 2 reports were identified from searches, with data from another four studies located from review articles. Seven cohorts of \"problem\" or dependent cocaine users reported data that permitted mortality rates to be estimated. Crude mortality rates ranged from 0.53 (95% CI: 0.10-1.58) to 6.16 (95% CI: 5.21-7.11) per 100 PY.

In the Cape Town region, we identified a sizeable cohort of adolescents with alcohol use disorders (AUD) without externalizing or other psychiatric disorders. We examined brain morphology in 64 such adolescents compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed using FSL's FIRST software for subcortical volumes, and cortical gray matter (GM) was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regions of interest (ROI) analysis. AUD boys had smaller thalamic and putamen volumes compared to non-drinking boys, while AUD girls had larger thalamic and putamen volumes compared to non-drinking girls. VBM revealed a large region of decreased GM density in AUDs compared to controls located in the left lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, extending medially deep into the parietal lobe. Smaller GM volume in this region was also present when examined using ROI analysis. Our lack of findings in other brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, suggests that reports of smaller brain volumes in adolescent AUDs in the literature are a consequence of psychiatric and substance abuse comorbidities."

This high incidence rate is linked to a number of factors, including HIV co-infection and alcohol use disorders. The diagnosis and treatment package for TB and HIV co-infection is relatively well established in South Africa. However, because alcohol use disorders may present more insidiously, making it difficult to diagnose, those patients with active TB and misusing alcohol are not easily cured from TB. With this in mind, the primary purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to provide screening for alcohol misuse and to test the efficacy of brief interventions in reducing alcohol intake in those patients with active TB found to be misusing alcohol in primary health care clinics in three provinces in South Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Within each of the three selected health districts with the highest TB burden in South Africa, 14 primary health care clinics with the highest TB caseloads will be selected.

To better understand this association, data were analysed from a cross-sectional, behavioural survey of 297 FSWs in Mombasa, a well-known tourist destination and the second largest port in Africa and capital city of the Coast Province in Kenya. Among the FSWs, lifetime use of different substances was reported by 91% for alcohol, 71% for khat, 34% for marijuana, and 6% for heroin, cocaine, glue or petrol. The majority (79%) used more than one substance, and multiple-substance use was reported by all respondents who ever used marijuana, heroin, cocaine, glue and petrol. The risk of HIV acquisition was perceived as medium to high by 41% of respondents, 75% of whom attributed this risk to multiple partners. Sexual violence was reported by 48% of respondents, and 30% indicated that this happened several times. Despite HIV prevention programmes targeting FSWs in Mombasa, most of them continue to engage in risky sexual behaviours.

Community interventions for children who have been orphaned or rendered vulnerable take many forms, including educational assistance, home-based care, legal protection and psychosocial support. Despite a recent influx of funding for programme implementation, there exists little evidence to inform policymakers about whether their investments are improving the lives of vulnerable children and meeting key benchmarks including the Millennium Development Goals. This paper reviews the current evidence base on evaluations of community interventions for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in high HIV-prevalence African settings, focusing on studies' methodologies. Sources reviewed include published research studies and evidence from the unpublished programmatic \"grey literature\" located through database and internet searches. A total of 21 studies, varying in scope and generalisability, were identified. Interventions reviewed address children's wellbeing through various strategies within their communities. Evaluation methodologies reflect quantitative and qualitative approaches, including surveys (with and without baseline or comparison data), costing studies, focus groups, interviews, case studies, and participatory review techniques. Varied study methodologies reflect diverse research questions, various intervention types, and the challenges associated with evaluating complex interventions; highlighting the need to broaden the research paradigm in order to build the evidence base by including quasi-experimental and process evaluation approaches, and seeking further insights through participatory qualitative methodologies and costing studies. Although findings overall indicate the value of community interventions in effecting measurable improvements in child and family wellbeing, the quality and rigour of evidence is varied. A strategic research agenda is urgently needed to inform resource allocation and programme management decisions. Immediate imperatives include building local technical capacity to conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation research, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems to collect process and outcome data (including costing) on key support models. Donors and implementers must support the collection of sound empirical evidence to inform the development and scale-up of OVC programmes."

Peak rates, for most indicators, were reached at the end of the '90s, to fall down in the following years. The only indicator which seemed not to show any declining rates is number of deaths, but this may be related to a more general increase in stimulant death rates recently observed in the UK.

More feasible interventions reduced HIV prevalence from one-fifth to one-half. High rates of condom use in sex work had the greatest effect, whereas STI treatment contributed to HIV declines at lower levels of condom use. Interventions reaching the 40% of sex workers with most clients reduced HIV transmission nearly as much as less targeted approaches attempting to reach all sex workers. Declines were independent of antiretroviral therapy rollout and robust to realistic changes in parameter values.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      'Upstream' transmission in sex work remains important in advanced African HIV epidemics even in the context of antiretroviral therapy.

Each survey population was a cross-sectional sample of women aged 15-49 years and men aged 15-59 years, with information on tobacco use and media access being obtained by face-to-face interviews. An index of media utilization was constructed based on responses to questions on the frequency of reading newspapers, frequency of watching television and frequency of listening to the radio. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were considered as potentially confounding covariates.

Men with a high media utilization were 21% less likely to use tobacco compared to those with low media utilization [AOR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.73-0.85]. In the male sample, tobacco use also declined with the increased frequency of reading newspapers (or magazines), listening to radio and watching television.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Mass media campaigns, conducted in the context of comprehensive tobacco control programmes, can reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in sub-Saharan Africa.

This paper describes such data from the first 17 countries participating in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      Household surveys with a combined sample size of 85,052 were carried out in the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), Middle East and Africa (Israel, Lebanon, Nigeria, South Africa), Asia (Japan, People's Republic of China), and Oceania (New Zealand). The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess the prevalence and correlates of a wide variety of mental and substance disorders. This paper focuses on lifetime use and age of initiation of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine. Alcohol had been used by most in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand, with smaller proportions in the Middle East, Africa, and China. Cannabis use in the US and New Zealand (both 42%) was far higher than in any other country. The US was also an outlier in cocaine use (16%). Males were more likely than females to have used drugs; and a sex-cohort interaction was observed, whereby not only were younger cohorts more likely to use all drugs, but the male-female gap was closing in more recent cohorts. The period of risk for drug initiation also appears to be lengthening longer into adulthood among more recent cohorts. Associations with sociodemographic variables were consistent across countries, as were the curves of incidence of lifetime use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Globally, drug use is not distributed evenly and is not simply related to drug policy, since countries with stringent user-level illegal drug policies did not have lower levels of use than countries with liberal ones.

In a country such as South Africa where rates of these infectious diseases are high, it is concerning that there is limited/no data on prevalence rates of mental disorders such as PTSD and its associated factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and associated factors in TB, TB retreatment and/or TB-HIV co-infected primary public health-care patients in three districts in South Africa. Brief screening self-report tools were used to measure: PTSD symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and alcohol misuse. Other relevant measures, such as adherence to medication, stressful life events and sexual risk-taking behaviours, were obtained through structured questions. A total of 4900 public primary care adult patients from clinics in high TB burden districts from three provinces in South Africa participated. All the patients screened positive for TB (either new or retreatment cases). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 29.6%. Patients who screened positive for PTSD symptoms and psychological distress were more likely to be on antidepressant medication. Factors that predicted PTSD symptoms were poverty, residing in an urban area, psychological distress, suicide attempt, alcohol and/or drug use before sex, unprotected sex, TB-HIV co-infected and the number of other chronic conditions. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of TB and HIV."

To better understand the state of orphans and potential adopters in this debate, we utilize the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to study who adopts internationally and the status of orphaned children in sub-Saharan Africa. According to NSFG data adopters are church going, highly educated, stable families aware of the challenges faced by international adoption, with high rates of infertility and rates of child abuse half the population average. According to the DHS data, orphans in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from significantly higher deprivation, reduced schooling and increased levels of stunting and underweight reported than their cohort. Using this data, we estimate conservatively that that 1 50 000 orphans from our sample of sub-Saharan African countries died from their 5-year birth cohort. Given the large number of families seeking to adopt and the high number of orphan deaths, it seems counterproductive to restrict international adoptions given the significantly lower risks faced by children in adopted families compared with remaining orphaned."

Studies among sex workers have linked higher social capital with protective HIV-related behaviors; however, few studies have examined social capital among sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa. This cross-sectional study examined relationships between two key social capital constructs, social cohesion among sex workers and social participation of sex workers in the larger community, and HIV-related risk in Swaziland using respondent-driven sampling. Relationships between social cohesion, social participation, and HIV-related risk factors were assessed using logistic regression. HIV prevalence among the sample was 70.4% (223/317). Social cohesion was associated with consistent condom use in the past week (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-3.90) and was associated with fewer reports of social discrimination, including denial of police protection. Social participation was associated with HIV testing (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.36-4.03) and using condoms with non-paying partners (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.13-3.51), and was inversely associated with reported verbal or physical harassment as a result of selling sex (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.91). Both social capital constructs were significantly associated with collective action, which involved participating in meetings to promote sex worker rights or attending HIV-related meetings/ talks with other sex workers. Social- and structural-level interventions focused on building social cohesion and social participation among sex workers could provide significant protection from HIV infection for female sex workers in Swaziland."

At the 3-month follow-up, the ASSIST was re-administered telephonically. An intervention was received by 127 patients. A significant reduction in substance use was reported in 92 patients who completed a 3-month follow-up evaluation (p<0.001). Of the 60 patients referred to further care, half entered treatment.

            "abstract": "Given the mortality and morbidity attributed to tobacco worldwide, global funding for tobacco control research, is greatly insufficient If compared with the fight against other diseases, tobacco control remains grossly under-funded. Data necessary to monitor the tobacco epidemic is inadequate even in the richer countries. It is therefore hardly surprising that studies on the state of data in developing countries and especially in francophone Africa conclude that standardised and comparable data are missing in all fields of tobacco control. Data available is often old, incomplete and hardly representative. This can be explained by both the lack of adequate capacity to conduct research and the low priority given to tobacco control as a health problem. In poor countries and regions where other diseases such as malaria and AIDS seem more pressing, the tobacco industry has almost no difficulty in using unfounded arguments about its contribution to the economy. Public authorities are thus intimidated by the threats of economic loss or attracted by immediate economic gains. This too often weakens the political will to act on issues of tobacco control. The little data available for the region, however, is alarming. Tobacco consumption has rapidly increased in recent years. This trend is confirmed by tobacco industry projected expansion in the region. Consequently, research programmes for Francophone African countries need to take into account the emergency of the situation, the context of Francophone Africa and, as well as, the limited resources available. Recently global research programmes such as the \"Global Youth Tobacco Survey\" have begun helping low-income countries in addressing the need for comparable and standardised data. The subject of an appropriate research agenda for tobacco control for low income countries has been discussed by international, national agencies, as well as, the NGO community in the context of the development of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Given that the most important factors as regards changing tobacco use in a population include changing its social acceptability, as well as, providing a legal framework for tobacco control, recommendations for appropriate research for low-income countries have highlighted the need to define research programmes able to support actions which will produce the largest impact on the population, will serve to accelerate the ratification of the FCTC, will hasten the adoption of low-cost evidence-based measures such as tax increases, complete bans on advertising, smoke-free legislation, and will stop the tobacco industry's offensive in these countries. Large international initiatives to support the development of tobacco control research in low-income countries and particularly Africa have been launched. However, because of the language barriers, African Francophone countries may not have the same access to them than their Anglophone counterparts. Special attention should, therefore, be given to strengthen recent initiatives in this field which take into consideration the important dimension of language for Francophone Africa."

            "abstract": "The fight against HIV remains complicated with contracting donor resources and high burden of HIV among reproductive age adults still often limiting independent economic development. In the widespread HIV epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is proposed that key populations with specific HIV acquisition and transmission risk factors, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and people who use drugs (PUD), are less relevant because HIV transmission is sustained in the general population with average HIV acquisition and transmission risks. However, the understanding that key populations are less relevant in the epidemics of Africa is based on the surveillance system from which these populations are mostly excluded. Outside of SSA, the epidemics of HIV are generally concentrated in the same populations that are excluded from the primary HIV surveillance systems in SSA. The manuscripts included in this special issue present convincing data that FSW, MSM, and PUD carry disproportionate burdens of HIV wherever studied in SSA, are underrepresented in HIV programs and research, and require specific HIV prevention services. These manuscripts collectively suggest that the only effective path forward is one that transcends denial and stigma and focuses on systematically collecting data on all populations at risk for HIV. In addition, there is a need to move to a third generation of HIV surveillance as the current one inadvertently devalues HIV surveillance among key populations in the context of widespread HIV epidemics. Overall, the data reviewed here demonstrate that the dynamics of HIV in Africa are complex and achieving an AIDS-free generation necessitates acceptance of that complexity in all HIV surveillance, research, and prevention, treatment, and care programs."

            "abstract": "Strong research evidence has shown that medical male circumcision significantly reduces heterosexual HIV acquisition among men. However, its effectiveness is enhanced by behavioural factors such as condom use. Currently, little is known of unprotected sex associated with male circumcision (MC) among alcohol-drinking tavern-going men, or whether engagement in unprotected sex may differ between men who have been traditionally circumcised and those who have been medically circumcised. The study sought to determine the relative importance of alcohol consumption and MC as correlates of unprotected sex and to compare the risk of engaging in unprotected sex between traditionally circumcised and medically circumcised tavern-going men from two rural villages in North-West province, South Africa. Data from 314 adult men (≥18 years) were analysed. The men were recruited from four bars/taverns using systematic sampling. They responded to questions regarding their demographic characteristics, alcohol consumption, circumcision status and method (where applicable), and engagement in unprotected sex. Descriptive analyses and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Age, education, relationship status, alcohol consumption and traditional male circumcision (TMC) were independently and significantly associated with unprotected sex. Specifically, probable alcohol dependence and traditional circumcision were independent risk factors for engaging in unprotected sex among tavern-going men. Traditionally circumcised men had a higher risk of engaging in unprotected sex than medically circumcised men. Interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, encouraging protective behaviour among men who have undergone TMC, and increasing condom use are needed in bar/tavern settings. HIV prevention education must be urgently incorporated into TMC programmes."

The present study explores the appropriateness of a particular theoretical framework, Problem Behavior Theory, to account for variation in problem behavior among adolescents in informal settlements around a large, rapidly urbanizing city in sub-Saharan Africa. Data were collected from samples of never married adolescents of both sexes, aged 12-19, living in two Nairobi slum settlements (N = 1,722). Measures of the theoretical psychosocial protective and risk factor concepts provided a substantial, multi-variate, and explanatory account of adolescent problem behavior variation and demonstrated that protection can also moderate the impact of exposure to risk. Key protective and risk factors constitute targets for policies and programs to enhance the health and well-being of poor urban adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa."

Data on socio-demographic variables, clinical disease features, anxiety and mood disorders were collected. The frequency of any anxiety disorder (AD) was 30.8% and major depressive disorder (MDD) 11.3%. Although differences by disease group did not reach statistical significance, rates of suicidality (34.8%) and panic disorder (4.1%) were highest for the TB-HIV group (n = 269), while rates of generalised AD (13.3%), obsessive compulsive disorder (7.6%), posttraumatic stress disorder (7.4%) and any AD (37.8%) were highest for the HIV group (n = 149). Female gender (p = 0.004) predicted any current AD as well as current suicidality (p = 0.009), while lower education status (p < 0.001) predicted current MDD.

The primary aim of this pilot, randomized trial was to examine whether an adapted evidence-based intervention would be equally, more, or less effective at reducing HIV risk behaviours when delivered using an individual or group format.

            "abstract": "Sex work remains an important contributor to HIV transmission within early, advanced and regressing epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, but its social and behavioral underpinnings remain poorly understood, limiting the impact of HIV prevention initiatives. This article systematically reviews the socio-demographics of female sex workers (FSW) in this region, their occupational contexts and key behavioral risk factors for HIV. In total 128 relevant articles were reviewed following a search of Medline, Web of Science and Anthropological Index. FSW commonly have limited economic options, many dependents, marital disruption, and low education. Their vulnerability to HIV, heightened among young women, is inextricably linked to the occupational contexts of their work, characterized most commonly by poverty, endemic violence, criminalization, high mobility and hazardous alcohol use. These, in turn, predict behaviors such as low condom use, anal sex and co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections. Sex work in Africa cannot be viewed in isolation from other HIV-risk behaviors such as multiple concurrent partnerships-there is often much overlap between sexual networks. High turn-over of FSW, with sex work duration typically around 3 years, further heightens risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Targeted services at sufficiently high coverage, taking into account the behavioral and social vulnerabilities described here, are urgently required to address the disproportionate burden of HIV carried by FSW on the continent."

We used the existing literature to summarize the options for expanding health insurance coverage, describe which countries have tried these strategies, and identify and describe evaluation studies. We included any report of a policy or strategy to expand health insurance coverage and any evaluation and economic modelling studies. Vulnerable populations were defined as children, the elderly, women, low-income individuals, rural population, racial or ethnic minorities, immigrants, and those with disability or chronic diseases. Forty-five databases were searched for relevant documents. The authors applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data using pre-coded forms, on contents of health insurance schemes or programmes, and used the framework approach to establish categories. Of the 21,528 articles screened, 86 documents were finally included. Descriptions about the USA dominated (72), with only five from Africa, six from Asia and two from South America. We identified six main categories: (1) changing eligibility criteria of health insurance; (2) increasing public awareness; (3) making the premium more affordable; (4) innovative enrollment strategies; (5) improving health care delivery; and (6) improving management and organization of the insurance schemes. All six categories were found in the literature about schemes in the USA, and schemes often included components from each category. Strategies in developing countries were much more limited in their scope. Evaluation studies numbered 25, of which the majority were of time series design. All studies found that the expansion strategies were effective, as assessed by the author(s). In countries expanding coverage, the categories identified from the literature can help policy makers consider their options, implement strategies where it is common sense to do so and establish appropriate implementation monitoring."

The purpose of this paper is to describe the distribution of main risk factors for NCDs by socioeconomic status (SES) among adults aged 50 years and older within a country and compare these risk factors across six lower- and upper-middle income countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study population in this paper draw from SAGE Wave 1 and consisted of adults aged 50-plus from China (N=13,157), Ghana (N=4,305), India (N=6,560), Mexico (N=2,318), the Russian Federation (N=3,938) and South Africa (N=3,836). Seven main common risk factors for NCDs were identified: daily tobacco use, frequent heavy drinking, low level physical activity, insufficient vegetable and fruit intake, high risk waist-hip ratio, obesity and hypertension. Multiple risk factors were also calculated by summing all these risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of daily tobacco use ranged from 7.7% (Ghana) to 46.9% (India), frequent heavy drinker was the highest in China (6.3%) and lowest in India (0.2%), and the highest prevalence of low physical activity was in South Africa (59.7%). The highest prevalence of respondents with high waist-to-hip ratio risk was 84.5% in Mexico, and the prevalence of self-reported hypertension ranging from 33% (India) to 78% (South Africa). Obesity was more common in South Africa, the Russia Federation and Mexico (45.2%, 36% and 28.6%, respectively) compared with China, India and Ghana (15.3%, 9.7% and 6.4%, respectively). China, Ghana and India had a higher prevalence of respondents with multiple risk factors than Mexico, the Russia Federation and South Africa. The occurrence of three and four risk factors was more prevalent in Mexico, the Russia Federation and South Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There were substantial variations across countries and settings, even between upper-middle income countries and lower-middle income countries. The baseline information on the magnitude of the problem of risk factors provided by this study can help countries and health policymakers to set up interventions addressing the global non-communicable disease epidemic."

            "abstract": "The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 has increased throughout Europe. This is an epidemiological study of patients infected chronically with HCV genotype 4 in Denmark. The HCV strains analyzed originated from patient samples collected between 1999 and 2007 as part of the national Danish hepatitis B and C network, DANHEP. Sequence analyses were based on the envelope 1 region of HCV. Results from a total of 72 patients indicated a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Fifty-six patients (78%) were infected with one of the three dominating subtypes: 4d, 4a, or 4r. The remaining 16 patients (22%) were infected with subtypes 4h, 4k, 4l, 4n, 4o, or 4Unclassified. Three epidemiological profiles were identified: (1) patients infected with HCV by intravenous drug use were infected solely with subtype 4d. They were all of European origin, and 15 of the 16 patients were ethnic Danes. No single transmission event could be confirmed, but the pairwise nucleotide identity within the patients of Danish origin was relatively high (∼95%), suggesting a recent introduction into Denmark. (2) The 21 patients infected with subtype 4a all came from Northern Africa, Egypt, Pakistan, or the Middle East. (3) Patients from Southern Africa dominated among patients infected with subtype 4r (10 of 12 patients). This study demonstrates that HCV genotype 4d has been introduced in and spread among Danish intravenous drug users. The remaining subtypes show restricted distribution, infecting almost exclusively patients from geographical areas with a relatively high prevalence of HCV genotype 4 infections."

In this region, individuals with HIV-1/HBV co-infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) frequently receive lamivudine as the only agent active against HBV, raising concerns for development of HBV resistance to lamivudine. We aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical, and virologic outcomes of chronic HBV infection, including HBV resistance to lamivudine, in a cohort of HIV-1 seropositive Kenyan women on long-term ART.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective cohort study, HIV-1 seropositive women initiated three-drug ART regimens that included lamivudine as the single drug active against HBV.

We estimated the prevalence of chronic HBV and examined associations between HBV co-infection and clinical and virologic outcomes with chi-square tests, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In a cohort of 159 women followed for a median of 3.4 years (interquartile range 1.4-4.5), 11 (6.9%; 95% CI 3.1-10.7) had chronic HBV infection. Of these, 9 (82%) achieved undetectable plasma HBV DNA levels. One woman developed lamivudine resistance, for an incidence of 3 per 100 person-years. The HBV co-infected women were at greater risk for abnormal ALT elevations compared to HIV-1 mono-infected women (HR 2.37; 95% CI 1.1-5.3).

Culling and data extraction followed protocols. DisMod-MR, the latest version of the generic disease modelling system, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, imputed prevalence by age, year and sex for 187 countries and 21 regions. Disability weight for opioid dependence was estimated through population surveys and multiplied by prevalence data to calculate the years of life lived with disability (YLDs).

Gender-specific overall mortality rate, proportion of deaths by cause (drug-related, HIV, other), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and the attributable risk fraction (ARF) were estimated.\n## RESULTS\nCrude mortality rates varied from 1 per 100 person-years in the Dublin and London cohorts to 3.8 per 100 person-years in Barcelona. The highest drug-related mortality rate was 10 per 1,000 person-years in Barcelona; the rates were approximately 7 per 1,000 person-years in Denmark, London, Rome, and Vienna, and <3.5 per 1,000 person-years for the others cohorts. The mortality rate for AIDS was <2 per 1,000 person-years in all the cohorts except Lisbon, Rome, and Barcelona, for which it was approximately 6 per 1,000 person-years. The highest SMR among males was 21.1 in Barcelona, and among females the highest SMRs were 53.7 and 37.7 in Barcelona and Rome, respectively. In Denmark the ARF was 5%, whereas it was >10% in all other study sites and 24% in Barcelona.\n## CONCLUSION\nCohort mortality studies, especially in combination with estimates of prevalence, provide useful insights into the impact of opiate use on mortality across European countries and emphasize how preventing overall and drug-related deaths among opiate users can significantly improve the health of the population.\n"

A comprehensive literature search of studies published from January 1988 through September 2007 yielded 21 relevant studies. Significant intervention effects were found for the following outcomes: condom use, condom acquisition/condom carrying, delayed sexual initiation among youth, and reduced incident STIs. The stratified analyses for condom use indicated that interventions were efficacious for various groups (e.g., youth, adults, males, commercial sex workers, clinic populations, and populations in areas with high STI incidence). Interventions increasing the availability of or accessibility to condoms or including additional individual, small-group or community-level components along with condom distribution were shown to be efficacious in increasing condom use behaviors. This review suggests that SLCDIs provide an efficacious means of HIV/STI prevention."

While steps have been taken to promote and pass legislation that upholds equal rights for women, this paper examines the ways in which discourses of gender equality and ensuing sexual rights can have complex, contradictory and even adverse implications when they are mobilised, resisted and reinterpreted at local level. Drawing upon research undertaken in the Caprivi Region of Namibia, this paper examines this ways in which men and women respond to ideas about gender equality, and seeks to place these responses within the wider context of socioeconomic change and understandings of morality prevalent within the region. The tendency of many young women to seek out relationships with older men and the increasing costs of bride-wealth payments play a key role in reinforcing patriarchal attitudes and fuelling disrespect for women's rights both before and within marriage. In addition, a failure to adhere to customary norms, which uphold men's dominant role, continues to threaten the support networks and assets available to women. The consequences of this situation are examined with particular focus on implications for the future transmission of HIV."

            "abstract": "This paper examines the extent to which under five children in households or communities adversely affected by HIV/AIDS are disadvantaged, in comparison with other children in less affected households/communities. The study is based on secondary analysis of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data collected during 2003-2008 from 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where the DHS has included HIV test data for adults of reproductive age. We apply multilevel logistic regression models that take into account the effect of contextual community/country level HIV/AIDS factors on child malnutrition. The outcome variable of interest is child undernutrition: stunting, wasting and underweight. The results suggest that across countries in sub-Saharan Africa, children whose mothers are infected with HIV are significantly more likely to be stunted, wasted or underweight compared to their counterparts of similar demographic and socio-economic background whose mothers are not infected. However, the nutritional status of children who are paternal orphans or in households where other adults are HIV positive are not significantly different from non-orphaned children or those in households where no adult is infected with HIV. Other adult household members being HIV positive is, however, associated with higher malnutrition among younger children below the age of one. Further analysis reveals that the effect of mothers' HIV status on child nutritional status (underweight) varies significantly across communities within countries, the effect being lower in communities with generally higher levels of malnutrition. Overall, the findings have important implications for policy and programme efforts towards improved integration of HIV/AIDS and child nutrition services in affected communities and other sub-groups of the population made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. In particular, children whose mothers are infected with HIV deserve special attention."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is very high in Africa. However, information obtained from the increasing number of African studies on IPV among pregnant women has not been scientifically analyzed. This paper presents a systematic review summing up the evidence from African studies on IPV prevalence and risk factors among pregnant women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A key-word defined search of various electronic databases, specific journals and reference lists on IPV prevalence and risk factors during pregnancy resulted in 19 peer-reviewed journal articles which matched our inclusion criteria. Quantitative articles about pregnant women from Africa published in English between 2000 and 2010 were reviewed. At least two reviewers assessed each paper for quality and content. We conducted meta-analysis of prevalence data and reported odds ratios of risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of IPV during pregnancy ranges from 2% to 57% (n = 13 studies) with meta-analysis yielding an overall prevalence of 15.23% (95% CI: 14.38 to 16.08%). After adjustment for known confounders, five studies retained significant associations between HIV and IPV during pregnancy (OR1.48-3.10). Five studies demonstrated strong evidence that a history of violence is significantly associated with IPV in pregnancy and alcohol abuse by a partner also increases a woman's chances of being abused during pregnancy (OR 2.89-11.60). Other risk factors include risky sexual behaviours, low socioeconomic status and young age.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of IPV among pregnant women in Africa is one of the highest reported globally. The major risk factors included HIV infection, history of violence and alcohol and drug use. This evidence points to the importance of further research to both better understand IPV during pregnancy and feed into interventions in reproductive health services to prevent and minimize the impact of such violence."

Although in utero alcohol exposure is the primary trigger, there is evidence for genetic- and other susceptibility factors in FAS development.

Hereafter candidates were prioritized for experimental investigation by investigating criteria pertinent to FAS and binary filtering. 29 Criteria were assessed by mining various database sources to populate criteria-specific gene lists. Candidate genes were then prioritized for experimental investigation using a binary system that assessed the criteria gene lists against the candidate list, and candidate genes were scored accordingly. A group of 87 genes was prioritized as candidates and for future experimental validation. The validity of the binary prioritization method was assessed by investigating the protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and common promoter element binding sites of the top-ranked genes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This analysis highlighted a list of strong candidate genes from the TGF-beta, MAPK and Hedgehog signalling pathways, which are all integral to fetal development and potential targets for alcohol's teratogenic effect.

The amount of bias correction ranged from <1 to >30 %, in parallel with the level of stigma associated with each behavior. Considering the current upward trajectory of HIV infection in the Middle East and North Africa region, as well as the ongoing high level of risky behaviors and considerable underreporting of many such behaviors in surveys, bias corrections may be needed, especially in the context of Iran, to obtain more accurate information to guide prevention and care responses to stop the growing HIV epidemic in this vulnerable group of women."

Feasibility and acceptability of ACASI, and a comparative analysis of enrolment responses between ACASI and FtF on an identical risk assessment questionnaire were evaluated. In total, 139 women and 259 men, 81% of eligible cohort participants, completed both interviews. ACASI captured a higher median number of regular (2 vs. 1, p<0.001, both genders) and casual partners in the last week (3 vs. 2, p = 0.04 in women; 2 vs. 1, p<0.001 in men). Group sex (21.6 vs. 13.5%, p<0.001, in men), intravenous drug use (IDU; 10.8 vs. 2.3%, p<0.001 in men; 4.4 vs. 0%, p = 0.03 in women), and rape (8.9 vs. 3.9%, p = 0.002, in men) were reported more frequently in ACASI. A surprisingly high number of women reported in ACASI that they had paid for sex (49.3 vs. 5.8%, p<0.001). Behaviours for recruitment (i.e. anal sex, sex work, sex between males) were reported less frequently in ACASI. The majority of women (79.2%) and men (69.7%) felt that answers given in ACASI were more honest. Volunteers who were not able to take ACASI (84 men, and 37 women) mostly lacked reading skills.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/significance:\n        \n      \n      About 1 in 5 cohort participants was not able to complete ACASI, mostly for lack of reading skills.

ACASI appears to be a useful tool for high risk behaviour assessments in the African context."

Temporal trends were estimated using Poisson regression.\n## RESULTS\nThe overall all-cause SMR was 13.9 (95% confidence interval 12.6-15.3). The SMR significantly declined after 1996, especially due to a decline among women (P < 0.001). The highest SMR was observed among HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals during 1990-1996 (SMR 61.9, 95% confidence interval 50.4-76.0), which significantly declined after this period among women (P = 0.001). In contrast, SMR for HCV-monoinfected, and HCV/HIV-uninfected PWUD did not significantly change over time. The SMR for non-natural deaths significantly declined (P = 0.007), whereas the SMR for HIV-related deaths was the highest during all calendar periods.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found evidence for declining all-cause mortality among PWUD compared with the general population rates. Those with HCV/HIV-coinfection showed the highest SMR. The decline in the SMR seems to be attributable to the decline in mortality among women. Mortality rates due to non-natural deaths came closer to those of the general population over time. However, HIV-related deaths remain an important cause of mortality among PWUD when compared with the general Dutch population. This study reinforces the importance of harm-reduction interventions and HCV/HIV treatment to reduce mortality among PWUD.\n"

            "abstract": "The world is undergoing a rapid health transition, with an ageing population and disease burden increasingly defined by disability. In Sub-Saharan Africa the next 40 years are predicted to see reduced mortality, signalling a surge in the impact of chronic diseases. We modelled these epidemiological changes and associated mental health workforce requirements. Years lived with a disability (YLD) predictions for mental and substance use disorders for each decade from 2010 to 2050 for four Sub-Saharan African regions were calculated using Global Burden of Disease 2010 study (GBD 2010) data and UN population forecasts. Predicted mental health workforce requirements for 2010 and 2050, by region and for selected countries, were modelled using GBD 2010 prevalence estimates and recommended packages of care and staffing ratios for low- and middle-income countries, and compared to current staffing from the WHO Mental Health Atlas. Significant population growth and ageing will result in an estimated 130% increase in the burden of mental and substance use disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, to 45 million YLDs. As a result, the required mental health workforce will increase by 216,600 full time equivalent staff from 2010 to 2050, and far more compared to the existing workforce. The growth in mental and substance use disorders by 2050 is likely to significantly affect health and productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. To reduce this burden, packages of care for key mental disorders should be provided through increasing the mental health workforce towards targets outlined in this paper. This requires a shift from current practice in most African countries, involving substantial investment in the training of primary care practitioners, supported by district based mental health specialist teams using a task sharing model that mobilises local community resources, with the expansion of inpatient psychiatric units based in district and regional general hospitals."

In the 're-settlement' period two inequalities emerged; the largest ethnic group, Pepel, continued to have high mortality when the mortality of other groups declined; likewise girls continued to have an elevated mortality whereas mortality of boys declined.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Whereas specific 'free' interventions reduced social inequalities for the groups affected, for the total population health-inequalities were slightly amplified during the war. Once the population returned to their urban homes, mortality fell to pre-war levels even though some fighting continued, limited humanitarian aid was available and the pre-war infra-structure had not been re-established."

In addition, the FSW were more likely to perceive that they had alcohol or other drug problems, and that they had a need for treatment and a desire to go for treatment. Less than 20% of participants in either group had any awareness of alcohol and drug treatment programs, with only 3% of the FSW and 2% of the non-SW reporting that they tried but were unable to enter treatment in the past year.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      FSW need and want substance abuse treatment services but they often have difficulty accessing services.

            "abstract": "Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and to explore its association with childhood maltreatment, substance misuse, posttraumatic stress, and suicidal behavior in a representative community sample of women. IPV was operationalized as a \"physical attack or beating by a spouse, boyfriend, or live-in partner.\" We surveyed 637 women in Memphis, Tennessee, by telephone survey. Sixteen percent reported ever experiencing IPV by a male partner, and 75% endorsed multiple assaultive acts. Of abused women, 5.9% met current PTSD diagnostic criteria, and an additional 11.8% were assessed with subthreshold symptoms. Abused women were more likely than other women to be divorced, to have less than 13 years education, to endorse high levels of childhood victimization, to have abused drugs and alcohol, and to have attempted suicide. Twenty-three percent of IPV+ (abused) women reported a suicide attempt at some time in their lives compared with 3% of IPV- (nonabused) women (p < .0001). Further, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that childhood sexual and emotional abuse and low educational attainment were the only significant predictors of IPV. These results suggest that in women who endorse IPV, careful inquiry of past abuse, trauma-related symptoms, suicidal behavior, and drug use may be important, so that interventions can be both timely and appropriate."

The primary objective of this study was to assess the status of the HIV epidemic among PWID in MENA by describing HIV prevalence and incidence. Secondary objectives were to describe the risk behavior environment and the HIV epidemic potential among PWID, and to estimate the prevalence of injecting drug use in MENA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      This was a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines and covering 23 MENA countries. PubMed, Embase, regional and international databases, as well as country-level reports were searched up to December 16, 2013. Primary studies reporting (1) the prevalence/incidence of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) among PWIDs; or (2) the prevalence of injecting or sexual risk behaviors, or HIV knowledge among PWID; or (3) the number/proportion of PWID in MENA countries, were eligible for inclusion. The quality, quantity, and geographic coverage of the data were assessed at country level. Risk of bias in predefined quality domains was described to assess the quality of available HIV prevalence measures. After multiple level screening, 192 eligible reports were included in the review. There were 197 HIV prevalence measures on a total of 58,241 PWID extracted from reports, and an additional 226 HIV prevalence measures extracted from the databases. We estimated that there are 626,000 PWID in MENA (range: 335,000-1,635,000, prevalence of 0.24 per 100 adults). We found evidence of HIV epidemics among PWID in at least one-third of MENA countries, most of which are emerging concentrated epidemics and with HIV prevalence overall in the range of 10%-15%. Some of the epidemics have however already reached considerable levels including some of the highest HIV prevalence among PWID globally (87.1% in Tripoli, Libya). The relatively high prevalence of sharing needles/syringes (18%-28% in the last injection), the low levels of condom use (20%-54% ever condom use), the high levels of having sex with sex workers and of men having sex with men (15%-30% and 2%-10% in the last year, respectively), and of selling sex (5%-29% in the last year), indicate a high injecting and sexual risk environment. The prevalence of HCV (31%-64%) and of sexually transmitted infections suggest high levels of risk behavior indicative of the potential for more and larger HIV epidemics.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study identified a large volume of HIV-related biological and behavioral data among PWID in the MENA region. The coverage and quality of the data varied between countries. There is robust evidence for HIV epidemics among PWID in multiple countries, most of which have emerged within the last decade and continue to grow. The lack of sufficient evidence in some MENA countries does not preclude the possibility of hidden epidemics among PWID in these settings. With the HIV epidemic among PWID in overall a relatively early phase, there is a window of opportunity for prevention that should not be missed through the provision of comprehensive programs, including scale-up of harm reduction services and expansion of surveillance systems."

In a cross-sectional study, neuropathy status was determined in 598 HIV-infected adults using validated tools (Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen and a modified version of the Total Neuropathy Score) to categorize subjects as DSP versus no DSP. Symptomatic DSP (SDSP) required the presence of at least two neuropathic signs together with symptoms. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory evaluations were prospectively performed. CD4 counts, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and questionnaires regarding previous tuberculosis (TB) and alcohol exposure were collected retrospectively. Approximately half (49%) of the study population were diagnosed with DSP, and 30% of the study population were diagnosed with SDSP. In multivariate analyses the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) of DSP were independently associated with ART use (OR 1.7, 1.0-2.9), age (per 10 year increment) (OR 1.7, 1.4-2.2), and prior TB (OR 2.0, 1.3-3.0). Pain or paresthesias were reported as moderately severe by 70% of those with SDSP. Stavudine use was significantly associated with DSP. DSP is a clinically significant problem in urban HIV-infected Africans. Our findings raise the possibility that the incidence of DSP may be reduced with avoidance of stavudine-containing regimens in older subjects, especially with a history of prior TB infection."

The emergence of HIV and AIDS has only exacerbated long-standing challenges to improving children's health in the region, with recent cohorts experiencing pediatric AIDS and high levels of orphan status, situations which are monitored globally and receive much policy and research attention. Children's health, however, can be affected also by living with HIV-infected adults, through associated exposure to infectious diseases and the diversion of household resources away from them. While long recognized, far less research has focused on characterizing this distinct and vulnerable population of HIV-affected children.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 23 countries collected between 2003 and 2011, we estimate the percentage of children living in a household with at least one HIV-infected adult.

            "abstract": "Chronic depressive illness may cause shrinkage of the hippocampus with stress-induced release of glutamate and nitric oxide possibly causally linked to this pathology. Poor antidepressant compliance may contribute to this pathology as well as to long term morbidity. However, antidepressant withdrawal-associated symptoms in depressed patients often reflect hyperserotonergia. The effect of chronic imipramine (IMI; 15 mg/kg/d ip x 3wks) treatment and withdrawal on swim stress responsiveness was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats together with assay of hippocampal NO synthase (NOS) activity. The dependence of any biobehavioral changes following IMI withdrawal on 5HT(2A/C) receptor-mediated events was studied using the 5HT(2A/C) receptor antagonist, ritanserin (RIT; 4 mg/kg/day ip x 7 days), administered alone or during IMI withdrawal. IMI significantly inhibited the situational stress response to forced swimming while also significantly decreasing NOS activity. IMI withdrawal was associated with a significant increase in swim immobility together with a significant increase in NOS activity compared to both control and IMI-treated groups. RIT re-established the anti-immobility effects and reversed NOS hyper-function during IMI withdrawal, although alone it increased NOS activity. Antidepressant discontinuation therefore increases stress responsiveness together with disinhibition of hippocampal NOS through a mechanism involving 5HT(2A/C) receptor activation. The resulting increased nitrergic activity may have significant implications for depressive illness and its treatment."

Individual-level risks for HIV infection are at the core of these epidemics and are powerfully impacted by social, structural, and population-level risks and protections. The emerging epidemics among injection drug users across Eurasia are largely the result of needle sharing, but the drivers of disease spread include increases in opiate availability, limited HIV infection prevention and programs for drug users, and undermining policy environments. An emerging epidemic of HIV infection among men who have sex with men in developing countries is primarily spread through unprotected anal intercourse but is also driven by limited HIV infection prevention services, social stigma, and the lack of human rights protection. The epidemic in southern Africa, which is spreading largely through heterosexual exposure, is driven by high rates of labor migration, concurrent sexual partnerships, gender inequalities, and the limited availability of male condoms.

Shack housing was independently associated with moderate or severe disability (odds ratio 3.42, 95% CI 1.22-9.59, p = 0.02). Despite limited rehabilitation resources, 67% of survivors had mild to moderate disability at 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Apart from initial stroke severity, risk factors for poor survival were a severe disability category and the presence of impaired swallowing at discharge.

This study investigated how hazardous/harmful use of alcohol and drugs impacts the health status of 1503 patients attending HIV clinics. Of the sample, 37 % indicated hazardous/harmful drinking and 13 % indicated a drug problem. Hazardous/harmful use of alcohol and drugs was significantly related to health status, with participants using substances more likely to have TB-positive status (χ(2) = 4.30, p < 0.05), less likely to be on ARVs (χ(2) = 9.87, p < 0.05) and having lower CD4 counts (t = 4.01, p < 0.05). Structural equation modelling confirmed the centrality of hazardous/harmful use of alcohol as a direct and indirect determinant of disease progression. Based on these findings it is recommended that patients attending HIV clinics be routinely screened for problematic alcohol and/or drug use, with strong emphasis on ensuring ARV adherence in those with problematic alcohol use."

These co-occurring public health problems raise the need to understand alcohol consumption among trauma-exposed pregnant women in this setting. Since a known predictor of drinking during pregnancy is drinking behavior before pregnancy, this study explored the relationship between women's drinking levels before and after pregnancy recognition, and whether traumatic experiences - childhood abuse or recent intimate partner violence (IPV) - moderated this relationship.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Women with incident pregnancies (N = 66) were identified from a longitudinal cohort of 560 female drinkers in a township of Cape Town, South Africa. Participants were included if they reported no pregnancy at one assessment and then reported pregnancy four months later at the next assessment. Alcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and traumatic experiences of childhood abuse and recent IPV were also assessed. Hierarchical linear regressions controlling for race and age examined childhood abuse and recent IPV as moderators of the effect of pre-pregnancy recognition drinking on post-pregnancy recognition AUDIT scores.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Following pregnancy recognition, 73% of women reported drinking at hazardous levels (AUDIT ≥ 8). Sixty-four percent reported early and/or recent exposure to trauma. While drinking levels before pregnancy significantly predicted drinking levels after pregnancy recognition, t(64) = 3.50, p < .01, this relationship was moderated by experiences of childhood abuse, B = -.577, t(60) = -2.58, p = .01, and recent IPV, B = -.477, t(60) = -2.16, p = .04. Pregnant women without traumatic experiences reported drinking at levels consistent with levels before pregnancy recognition. However, women with traumatic experiences tended to report elevated AUDIT scores following pregnancy recognition, even if low-risk drinkers previously.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study explored how female drinkers in South Africa may differentially modulate their drinking patterns upon pregnancy recognition, depending on trauma history.

In southern Africa, food insecurity has been linked to high-risk sexual behaviors, difficulty with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, higher rates of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and more rapid HIV progression. Sex workers in Swaziland are a population that is most at risk of HIV. Little is known about the context and needs of sex workers in Swaziland who are living with HIV, nor how food insecurity may affect these needs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 female sex workers who are living with HIV in Swaziland.

Informants used good nutrition and the ability to access \"healthy\" foods as a strategy to manage their HIV infection. Informants discussed difficulty in adhering to ART when faced with the prospect of taking pills on an empty stomach.

Overall, 67.2 per 1000 children (95% CI 56.2-79.7) had full FAS features. Growth retardation was also common in this population: 66.6% (1181/1774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1776) stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference <2 SD for age. Mothers of children with FAS were less likely to have full-time employment or have attended secondary school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked.

One consequence is risky sexual behavior, a major problem in sub-Saharan Africa already facing the synergistic problems of poverty and HIV/AIDS. This study of female students aged ≥ 18 years in two universities in Nigeria uses a multi-stage stratified random sampling method, and each subject that gave consent to the study was administered with a structured questionnaire by trained interviewers; 2,408 female students were studied (1,854 from the University of Ibadan and 554 from the Bayero University, Kano). The mean age of the respondents was 21.6 (SD = 2.9), and about two-thirds (65.7%) were aged between 20-24, with 2,204 (91.5%) being single and 4.3% married. In all, 23.4% of the subjects used one form of substance. Alcoholic drinks of palm wine, alcoholic wine, and beer were the most common of substances used (22.7%), followed by tobacco (2%) and cannabis (1%). Substance use was significantly associated with religious affiliation of the students (p < 0.001), as the prevalence of substance use was least among Muslim students (11.7%) and highest among those who professed traditional religion (39.4%). Alcohol use was also positively associated with sexual activity (p < 0.001). Among the 547 students who used alcohol, 147 (26.9%) had sex in the 4 weeks prior to the survey, while among the 1,861 non-users, only 8.9% did so. The practice of unprotected sex was found not to be associated with substance use: a slightly lower proportion (29.5% vs. 36.6%) of substance users engaged in unprotected sex in their last encounter compared to non-users. There is need to scale up public health education on the dangers of substance use and its associated sexual risk behavior."

While there exists a substantial body of knowledge regarding resilience of homeless youth, few studies has examined the relationship between perceived resilience and health risk behaviours. The present study describes the findings from a quantitative examination of street-related demographics, resilience, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, sexual risk behaviours and violent related behaviours among 227 homeless youth. The findings revealed that perceived resilience was negatively related to suicidal ideation, substance abuse and violence. Suicidal ideation was positively related to both substance abuse and violence, whilst violence and substance abuse were positively correlated. Multiple regressions showed that perceived resilience served as a protective factor for suicidal ideation and having multiple sexual lifetime partners, suggesting that youth with lower level of perceived resilience were more likely to engage in various health risks behaviours."

We compared the yield, geographic distribution, and demographic characteristics of populations tested by mobile- and clinic-based HIV testing programs deployed by iThembalabantu Clinic in Durban, South Africa. From July to November 2011, 4,701 subjects were tested; HIV prevalence was 35 % among IPHC testers and 10 % among mobile testers (p < 0.001). Mobile testers varied in mean age (22-37 years) and % males (26-67 %). HIV prevalence at mobile sites ranged from 0 to 26 %. Testers traveled further than the clinic closest to their home; mobile testers were more likely to test ≥5 km away from home. Mobile HIV testing can improve testing access and identify testing sites with high HIV prevalence. Individuals often access mobile testing sites farther from home than their nearest clinic. Geospatial techniques can help optimize deployment of mobile units to maximize yield in hard-to-reach populations."

Their median age was 24 years; with a range from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for different causes of death.\n## RESULTS\nDuring a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7-29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period, ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer (4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths (2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category \"drug dependence\" was listed in the vast majority of cases (37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death, with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9-86.9). The SMR was 5.4 (95% CI, 1.3-21.5) for cardiovascular diseases, and 4.3 (95% CI, 1.4-13.5) for cancer. The SMR was 13.2 (95% CI, 6.6-26.4) for accidents, 10.7 (95% CI, 4.5-25.8) for suicides, and 28.6 (95% CI, 7.1-114.4) for other violent deaths.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe risk of death among opioid addicts was significantly higher for all causes of death compared with the general population, implying a poor prognosis over a 20-year period for this young patient group.\n"

The lack of evidence-based publications within the prescribed review period of 12-18 months precludes an accurate description of the prevailing epidemiology and burden of disablement in this country. The few studies yielding epidemiological data were conducted prior to 2002. These suggest that the prevalence rate of intellectual disability is greater than in high-income countries.

The proportion of females who smoked was lower than SLT users in most countries. Older age was strongly associated with both smoking and SLT use among men and women. Smoking among both men and women was weakly associated, but SLT use was strongly associated, with education. Similarly, smoking among men and women was weakly associated, but SLT use was strongly associated, with the wealth index.

            "abstract": "The term 'addiction' was traditionally used in relation to centrally active substances, such as cocaine, alcohol, or nicotine. Addiction is not a unitary construct but rather incorporates a number of features, such as repetitive engagement in behaviours that are rewarding (at least initially), loss of control (spiralling engagement over time), persistence despite untoward functional consequences, and physical dependence (evidenced by withdrawal symptoms when intake of the substance diminishes). It has been suggested that certain psychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive, repetitive behaviours share parallels with substance addiction and therefore represent 'behavioural addictions'. This perspective has influenced the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which now has a category 'Substance Related and Addictive Disorders', including gambling disorder. Could other disorders characterised by repetitive behaviours, besides gambling disorder, also be considered 'addictions'? Potential examples include kleptomania, compulsive sexual behaviour, 'Internet addiction', trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and skin-picking disorder. This paper seeks to define what is meant by 'behavioural addiction', and critically considers the evidence for and against this conceptualisation in respect of the above conditions, from perspectives of aetiology, phenomenology, co-morbidity, neurobiology, and treatment. Research in this area has important implications for future diagnostic classification systems, neurobiological models, and novel treatment directions."

It examines this right as articulated within United Nations and regional human rights treaties, non-binding or so-called soft law instruments from international organisations and the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies. It explores the use of economic, social and cultural rights mechanisms, and those within civil and political rights, as they engage the right to health of prisoners, and identifies the minimum legal obligations of governments in order to remain compliant with human rights norms as defined within the international case law. In addressing these issues, this article adopts a holistic approach to the definition of the highest attainable standard of health. This includes a consideration of adequate standards of general medical care, including preventative health and mental health services. It also examines the question of environmental health, and those poor conditions of detention that may exacerbate health decline, disease transmission, mental illness or death. The paper examines the approach to prison health of the United Nations human rights system and its various monitoring bodies, as well as the regional human rights systems in Europe, Africa and the Americas. Based upon this analysis, the paper draws conclusions on the current fulfilment of the right to health of prisoners on an international scale, and proposes expanded mechanisms under the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment to monitor and promote the health rights of prisoners at the international and domestic levels."

In addition, the 2011 National Youth Tobacco Survey was analyzed for U.S. students aged 13-15 years. Country-specific prevalence of current smoking, current SLT use, and concurrent use patterns were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The national prevalence of current cigarette smoking among students aged 13-15 years ranged from 1.8% (Rwanda) to 32.9% (Latvia), whereas current SLT use ranged from 1.1% (Montenegro) to 14.4% (Lesotho). In the U.S. and most European countries surveyed, current smoking prevalence was significantly higher than SLT prevalence, in contrast to patterns observed in low- and middle-income countries. Also, in most of the surveyed countries outside of Europe and the United States, SLT use among girls was as common as their use of cigarettes, and not significantly different from use by boys. When compared with U.S. adolescents, the odds of SLT use were highest among African adolescents (adjusted odds ratio = 3.98; 95% CI: 2.19-7.24) followed by those in the Southeast Asian region (adjusted odds ratio = 2.76; 95% CI: 1.38-5.53).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Region-specific patterns of tobacco use were noticed. Furthermore, it is alarming that in several low- and middle-income countries, the prevalence of SLT use among females did not differ from that among males, suggesting the possibility of a future shared burden of disease between both males and females."

            "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease. Knowledge of HCV variability is crucial for clinical and epidemiological analysis. HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) has become increasingly prevalent in European countries, including France, in recent years. The present study investigates the heterogeneity of HCV-4 in south-western France by phylogenetic analysis of NS5B sequences from 166 patients. The E2 region of 90 strains was also analysed. Genotype 4 accounts for 7.4 % of HCV infections in this area. Analysis of the NS5B region revealed 12 subtypes and the NS5B and E2 phylogeny data were congruent, except for one strain. The epidemiological data indicated two main groups of patients. One included intravenous drug users (IVDUs) of French origin, who were infected by homogeneous strains of subtypes 4a or 4d. The second group comprised non-IVDU patients who were infected with heterogeneous strains. This group was subdivided into patients of French origin, who were infected with eight subtypes, and patients from non-European countries (Central Africa or the Middle East), who were mainly infected with 4f, 4k, 4r and other subtypes; they showed the greatest genetic heterogeneity. This study of a large cohort of patients shows the great diversity of HCV-4 strains, and that these subtypes have spread differently."

            "abstract": "Single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) can generate useful information regarding metabolite concentrations provided that the MR signal can be averaged over several minutes during which the subject remains stationary. This requirement can be particularly challenging for children who cannot otherwise be scanned without sedation. To address this problem we developed an EPI volume navigated (vNav) SVS PRESS sequence, which applies real-time head pose (location and orientation), frequency, and first-order B0 shim adjustments. A water-independent preprocessing algorithm removes residual frequency and phase shifts resulting from within-TR movements. We compare results and performance of the standard and vNav PRESS sequences in a sample of 9- to 10-year-olds from a South African cohort of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and healthy controls. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data in the deep cerebellar nuclei were initially acquired with the standard PRESS sequence. The children were re-scanned 1 year later with the vNav PRESS sequence. Good quality data were acquired in 73% using the vNav PRESS sequence, compared to only 50% for the standard PRESS sequence. Additionally, tighter linewidths and smaller variances in the measured concentrations were observed. These findings confirm previous reports demonstrating the efficacy of our innovative vNav sequence with healthy volunteers and young children with HIV and expand its application to a school-aged population with FASD-disorders often associated with attention problems and hyperactivity. This study provides the most direct evidence to date regarding degree to which these new methods can improve data quality in research studies employing MRS."

The group intervention Stepping Stones has been shown to reduce men's perpetration of violence in more rural areas, but violence experienced by women in the study was not affected. Economic empowerment interventions with gender training can protect older women from violence, but microloan interventions have proved challenging with young women. We investigated whether combining a broad economic empowerment intervention and Stepping Stones could impact on violence among young men and women. The intervention, Creating Futures, was developed as a new generation of economic empowerment intervention, which enabled livelihood strengthening though helping participants find work or set up a business, and did not give cash or make loans.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We piloted Stepping Stones with Creating Futures in two informal settlements of Durban with 232 out of school youth, mostly aged 18-30 and evaluated with a shortened interrupted time series of two baseline surveys and at 28 and 58 weeks post-baseline. 94/110 men and 111/122 women completed the last assessment, 85.5% and 90.2% respectively of those enrolled.

This was the first study in Mozambique to determine the prevalence of HIV and associated demographic and risk behaviors, and assess use and access to prevention and healthcare services among Mozambicans working in South African mines. Men who had worked in a South African mine in the past 12 months were recruited between February and May 2012 using time location sampling (TLS) at the Ressano Garcia border between Mozambique and South Africa. Demographic and behavioral data were collected through a standardized questionnaire, and HIV prevalence was estimated by testing dried blood spots (DBS) with two enzyme immunoassays. In total, 432 eligible mine workers were recruited. Mean age was 43 years. Most were married or cohabitating; among them, 12.6 % had two or more wives/marital partners in Mozambique. In the 12 months preceding the survey, 24.7 % had an occasional sexual partner, and 6.6 % had at least one partner who was a female sex worker. Only one in five (18.5 %) used a condom during last sex. HIV prevalence among mineworkers was 22.3 %, and 74.6 % of those who tested positive as part of the survey did not know their status. HIV prevalence was significantly higher (p = 0.018) among those that were uncircumcised (31.2 %) than those who were circumcised (18.5 %). Multiple partners (multiple spouses, cross-border relations, and multiple occasional partnerships), inconsistent condom use, and a high proportion of infected mineworkers who do not know their HIV status increases the risk of HIV transmission in this population. Combination strategies involving the promotion of condom use, HIV testing, and male circumcision should be strengthened among mineworkers."

Most PCUs are primary intranasal cocaine users, never-injectors and never-opioid users (PICUNINOs) and are usually underrepresented in cohort mortality studies. The aim is to estimate excess mortality in all PCUs and in the subgroups of never-opioid users and PICUNINOs in Spain.\n## METHODS\n714 PCUs aged 18-30 were street-recruited in 2004-2006 in Spain and followed until 2010 to ascertain vital status. Drug use was self-reported at baseline and 1-2years later. Mortality was compared with that of the general population using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).\n## RESULTS\nSMRs were 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4-9.0), 2.5 (95%CI: 0.8-7.8) and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.0-9.6), respectively, among all participants, never-opioid users and PICUNINOS when using only baseline data on drug use, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.2-8.5) and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.2-9.9) among the latter two subgroups, when using baseline plus follow-up data.\n## CONCLUSION\nShort-term mortality in young Spanish PCUs is 5 times higher than in the general population.

Evidence supports implementation of the following interventions to reduce unprotected sex among female sex workers: peer-mediated condom promotion, risk-reduction counselling and skills-building for safer sex. One study found that interventions to counter hazardous alcohol-use lowered unprotected sex. Data also show effectiveness of screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and syndromic STI treatment, but experience with periodic presumptive treatment is limited. HIV testing and counselling is essential for facilitating sex workers' access to care and antiretroviral treatment (ART), but testing models for sex workers and indeed for ART access are little studied, as are structural interventions, which create conditions conducive for risk reduction. With the exception of Senegal, persistent criminalization of sex work across Africa reduces sex workers' control over working conditions and impedes their access to health services. It also obstructs health-service provision and legal protection.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is sufficient evidence of effectiveness of targeted interventions with female sex workers in Africa to inform delivery of services for this population. With improved planning and political will, services - including peer interventions, condom promotion and STI screening - would act at multiple levels to reduce HIV exposure and transmission efficiency among sex workers. Initiatives are required to enhance access to HIV testing and ART for sex workers, using current CD4 thresholds, or possibly earlier for prevention. Services implemented at sufficient scale and intensity also serve as a platform for subsequent community mobilization and sex worker empowerment, and alleviate a major source of incident infection sustaining even generalized HIV epidemics. Ultimately, structural and legal changes that align public health and human rights are needed to ensure that sex workers on the continent are adequately protected from HIV."

            "abstract": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) have a higher prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD), as compared with heterosexual men. HIV infection is independently associated with higher rates of CMD. Given this context, and the high background community prevalence of HIV in South Africa, MSM are at even greater risk of developing CMD. The aim of this research was to investigate neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders in MSM who were referred for assessment and management of mental health problems, in an MSM Clinic in urban Cape Town, South Africa. Twenty-five men were screened using the MINI, AUDIT, DUDIT, and IPDE Screener. Depression, suicidality, as well as alcohol and drug use disorders were highly prevalent in this group (44, 56, 48, and 56 % respectively). The personality disorder screening was suggestive of a high prevalence of personality disorders. The high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders in this sample supports the idea that integrated mental health services are needed to address the complex needs of this population. Adequate input into the mental health needs of this population could reduce the potential for HIV acquisition and transmission, improve adherence to treatment and care, and ensure the provision a comprehensive health service for MSM."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nFew longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades.\n## METHODS\nFollow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing risks Cox regression analysis.\n## RESULTS\nOf 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of non drug related death.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death.\n"

            "abstract": "UN reports point to a steady increase in heroin use in a number of African countries, including South Africa. South Africa also has one of the highest HIV infection prevalence rates in the world. Given the link between intravenous heroin use and HIV transmission, this study aimed to investigate HIV-related risk behaviors among heroin users in the city. A snowballing or chain referral sampling technique was used to find 239 heroin users in Cape Town who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Overall, 24% of all the participants reported that they had injected heroin in the past 30 days and 89% of these had shared a needle at least once during that period. Condom use was irregular among the survey participants. Three percent stated that they were HIV positive. Heroin use has become a major concern in Cape Town and may still be increasing. While injecting use still appears to be fairly limited, this has the potential to change. Further debate is required regarding the introduction of harm reduction approaches that have been found to be effective elsewhere."

FSW projects in many settings have demonstrated effective ways of altering this risk, improving the health and wellbeing of these women. Yet the optimum delivery model of FSW projects in Africa is unclear. This systematic review describes intervention packages, service-delivery models, and extent of government involvement in these services in Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      On 22 November 2012, we searched Web of Science and MEDLINE, without date restrictions, for studies describing clinical and non-clinical facility-based SRH prevention and care services for FSWs in low- and middle-income countries in Africa. We also identified articles in key non-indexed journals and on websites of international organizations. A single reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and extracted data from articles using standardised tools.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We located 149 articles, which described 54 projects. Most were localised and small-scale; focused on research activities (rather than on large-scale service delivery); operated with little coordination, either nationally or regionally; and had scanty government support (instead a range of international donors generally funded services). Almost all sites only addressed HIV prevention and STIs. Most services distributed male condoms, but only 10% provided female condoms. HIV services mainly encompassed HIV counselling and testing; few offered HIV care and treatment such as CD4 testing or antiretroviral therapy (ART). While STI services were more comprehensive, periodic presumptive treatment was only provided in 11 instances. Services often ignored broader SRH needs such as family planning, cervical cancer screening, and gender-based violence services.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Sex work programmes in Africa have limited coverage and a narrow scope of services and are poorly coordinated with broader HIV and SRH services. To improve FSWs' health and reduce onward HIV transmission, access to ART needs to be addressed urgently. Nevertheless, HIV prevention should remain the mainstay of services. Service delivery models that integrate broader SRH services and address structural risk factors are much needed. Government-led FSW services of high quality and scale would markedly reduce SRH vulnerabilities of FSWs in Africa."

Electronic database searches using appropriate keywords/terms were conducted to identify observational studies of khat use. Assessment of quality and risk of bias of all included studies was conducted, and the results were synthesised descriptively. Nine eligible cross-sectional studies were identified. All assessed self-reported tobacco among khat users and were carried out in Africa and the Middle East. Eight reported cigarettes and one reported waterpipes as the mode of use. Methods of tobacco use prevalence assessment varied. Prevalence of \"current\" tobacco use among students and university teachers ranged from 29 to 37%; \"lifetime\" tobacco use in university teachers was 58% and \"undefined\" tobacco use in nonspecific adults and students ranged from 17 to 78%. Daily tobacco use among adults was reported as 17% whilst simultaneous tobacco and khat use was reported as between 14 and 30% in students. In conclusion, tobacco prevalence among khat users appears significant. Findings should be interpreted cautiously due to self-reported tobacco use, diversity in questions assessing tobacco use, and type of tobacco consumption. Future research should address the methodological shortcomings identified in this review before appropriate policy interventions can be developed."

            "abstract": "Formalized task shifting structures have been used to rapidly scale up antiretroviral service delivery to underserved populations in several countries, and may be a promising mechanism for accomplishing universal health coverage. However, studies evaluating the quality of service delivery through task shifting have largely ignored the patient perspective, focusing on health outcomes and acceptability to health care providers and regulatory bodies, despite studies worldwide that have shown the significance of patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality. This study aimed to measure patient satisfaction with task shifting of antiretroviral services in hospitals and health centres in four regions of Ethiopia. This cross-sectional study used data collected from a time-motion study of patient services paired with 665 patient exit interviews in a stratified random sample of antiretroviral therapy clinics in 21 hospitals and 40 health centres in 2012. Data were analyzed using f-tests across provider types, and multivariate logistic regression to identify determinants of patient satisfaction. Most (528 of 665) patients were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the services received, but patients who received services from nurses and health officers were significantly more likely to report satisfaction than those who received services from doctors [odds ratio (OR) 0.26, P < 0.01]. Investments in the health facility were associated with higher satisfaction (OR 1.07, P < 0.01), while costs to patients of over 120 birr were associated with lower satisfaction (OR 0.14, P < 0.05). This study showed high levels of patient satisfaction with task shifting in Ethiopia. The evidence generated by this study complements previous biomedical and health care provider/regulatory acceptability studies to support the inclusion of task shifting as a mechanism for scaling-up health services to achieve universal health coverage, particularly for underserved areas facing severe health worker shortages."

We included modelling studies reporting both cost and expected impact of a PrEP roll-out. We explored five issues: prioritisation strategies, adherence, behaviour change, toxicity, and resistance. Of 961 studies retrieved, 13 were included. Studies modelled populations (heterosexual couples, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs) in generalised and concentrated epidemics from Southern Africa (including South Africa), Ukraine, USA, and Peru. PrEP was found to have the potential to be a cost-effective addition to HIV prevention programmes in specific settings. The extent of the impact of PrEP depended upon assumptions made concerning cost, epidemic context, programme coverage, prioritisation strategies, and individual-level adherence. Delivery of PrEP to key populations at highest risk of HIV exposure appears the most cost-effective strategy. Limitations of this review include the partial geographical coverage, our inability to perform a meta-analysis, and the paucity of information available exploring trade-offs between early treatment and PrEP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our review identifies the main considerations to address in assessing cost-effectiveness analyses of a PrEP intervention--cost, epidemic context, individual adherence level, PrEP programme coverage, and prioritisation strategy.

            "abstract": "Some types of intravaginal practices (IVP) may increase the risk for HIV acquisition. This is particularly worrisome for populations with dual high prevalence of HIV and IVP. Women involved in transactional sex are at increased risk for HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Social, cultural and economic influences are strong drivers of IVP in this population. To explore this, we carried out a qualitative research study to investigate the drivers and motivations for using IVP within a large observational study of women at high risk of HIV in Tanzania and Uganda from September 2008 to September 2009. Of the 201 women selected, 176 women took part in a semi-structured in-depth interview. Additionally, in Tanzania, eight focus group discussions among study participants and community members were carried out to obtain information on community norms and expectations. IVP were motivated by overlapping concerns with hygiene, morality, sexual pleasure, fertility, relationship security, and economic security. These motives were driven by the need to meet cultural and social expectations of womanhood, and at the same time attend to personal well-being. Among women involved in transactional sex in East Africa, interventions aimed at modifying or eliminating IVP should attend to local cultural and social norms as well as the individual as an agent of change."

Younger age and injecting drug use was a frequently reported risk factor. Other risk factors included CD4 count, socioeconomic variables, and pharmacy stock outs. Treatment interruptions increased the risk of death, opportunistic infections, virologic failure, resistance development, and poor immunological recovery. Proposed interventions to minimize interruptions included counseling, mental health services, services for women, men, and ethnic minorities.

The effects of behaviors that accompany unhealthy alcohol consumption are a pervasive risk factor for HIV transmission and progression. Our objective was to estimate the portion of HIV infections attributable to unhealthy alcohol use and to evaluate the impact of hypothetical interventions directed at unhealthy alcohol use on HIV infections and deaths.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We estimated outcomes over a time horizon of 20 years using a computer simulation of the Kenyan population. This computer simulation integrates a compartmental model of HIV transmission with a mechanistic model of HIV progression that was previously validated in sub-Saharan Africa. Integration of the transmission and progression models allows simultaneous consideration of alcohol's effects on HIV transmission and progression (e.g., lowering antiretroviral adherence may increase transmission risk by elevating viral load, and may simultaneously increase progression by increasing the likelihood of AIDS). The simulation considers important aspects of heterogeneous sexual mixing patterns, including assortativeness of partners by age and activity level, age-discordant relationships, and high activity subgroups. Outcomes included number of new HIV infections, number of AIDS deaths, and infectivity (number of new infections per infected person per year).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our model estimated that the effects of behaviors accompanying unhealthy alcohol consumption are responsible for 13.0% of new HIV infections in Kenya. An alcohol intervention with effectiveness similar to that observed in a published randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based intervention in Kenya (45% reduction in unhealthy alcohol consumption) could prevent nearly half of these infections, reducing their number by 69,858 and reducing AIDS deaths by 17,824 over 20 years. Estimates were sensitive to assumptions with respect to the magnitude of alcohol's underlying effects on condom use, antiretroviral therapy adherence, and sexually transmitted infection prevalence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A substantial number of new HIV infections in Kenya are attributable to unhealthy alcohol use.

Increasing age was associated with higher rates of every type of insomnia but females were only more likely than males to report difficulty initiating sleep. Independently, chronic pain conditions, chronic medical conditions, as well as the presence of a DSM-IV mental disorder significantly increased the risk of having insomnia. Multivariate analysis suggests that, even though demographic factors and comorbid physical and mental conditions partly accounted for the association of insomnia with role impairment, a decrement of about 6% of estimated lost work in the prior month was probably attributable to insomnia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings indicate that insomnia is common even in this relatively young population.

A rapid assessment ethnographic study was undertaken using observation, mapping, key informant interviews and focus groups in known 'hotspots' for drug use and sexual risk in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. Key informant (KI) and focus group interviews involved drug users and service providers. Purposeful snowball sampling and street intercepts were used to recruit drug users. Outcome measures included drug-related sexual HIV risk behaviour, and risk behaviour related to injection drug use, as well as issues related to service use. HIV testing of drug-using KIs was conducted using the SmartCheck Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test. Non-injection drug use (mainly cannabis, methaqualone, crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine) and injection drug use (mainly heroin) was occurring in these cities. Drug users report selling sex for money to buy drugs, and CSWs used drugs before, during and after sex. Most (70%) of the drug-using KIs offered HIV testing accepted and 28% were positive, with rates highest among CSWs and MSM. IDUs reported engaging in needle sharing and needle disposal practices that put them and others at risk for contracting HIV. There was a widespread lack of awareness about where to access HIV treatment and preventive services, and numerous barriers to accessing appropriate HIV and drug-intervention services were reported. Multiple risk behaviours of vulnerable populations and lack of access to HIV prevention services could accelerate the diffusion of HIV. Targeted interventions could play an important role in limiting the spread of HIV in and through these under-reached and vulnerable populations."

            "abstract": "In the last 10 years HIV-1/human T-cell leukemia virus (HIV-1/HTLV) coinfection has emerged as a worldwide health problem. The numbers of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfections in South America and Africa are increasing, as well as HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfections in the USA and Europe. Coinfections by either HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 and HIV-1 frequently occur in persons with a history of injection drug use. Since HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells and HTLV-2 has a tropism for CD8+ T-cells, the influence of coinfection on HIV-1 disease progression may be different. The effect of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection on HIV-I pathogenesis is controversial as soluble factors produced by HTLV-1 infected cells can either enhance or suppress HIV-1 infection. In HTLV-1/HIV-1 coinfected patients, upregulation of HIV-1 expression was attributed to strong activation of cytokines that promoted HIV infection. The introduction of HAART has dramatically reduced HIV-1 morbidity and mortality, but has given rise to an increased number of inflammatory syndromes. While HAART is successful for controlling HIV disease, it has little impact on HTLV-1/2 genome expression. The consequence of coinfection, even with HAART, may well be the reported increase in neurologic disease. Several epidemiologic and in vitro studies of the influence of HTLV infection on HIV-1 related AIDS progression suggest that HTLV-1 infection can promote HIV-1 replication and accelerate the clinical progression to AIDS. However, other studies have not confirmed these observations. The differences in study outcomes could be related to the occurrence of different HIV-1 phenotypes in clinical disease. In contrast, evidence points to a confirmed protective role of HTLV-2 that is manifested as improved survival and delayed progression to AIDS. The protective effect may be the result of maintaining normal-range levels of CD4 and CD8 counts, lowering HIV replication, and immune activation. As a corollary, the number of long-term nonprogressors for AIDS in the HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfected group was found to be significantly higher than in HIV-1 monoinfected cases. Investigations of the natural factors induced by HTLV-2 that influence HIV-1 replication show that CCL3L1 (an isoform of CCL3) is preferentially induced in HTLV-2 exposed seronegative HIV individuals and in long-term nonprogressor HTLV-2/HIV-1 coinfected persons. The CCL3L 1 inhibits HIV replication and thus acts as a potent effector against both HIV infection and disease progression. As a complement to upregulation of CCL3L1, other chemokines and cytokines induced by HTLV-2 may contribute to induction of the Th1 response against invading pathogens, in contrast to the dominant Th2 response that appears to favor HIV infection. The number of individuals with either single HIV-1 or HTLV-2 infection, in a cohort of Italian intravenous drug users monitored for 20 years, decreased significantly over time. However, the magnitude of HTLV-2 decrease was significantly less than that of HIV-1, pointing to the need for increased attention to, and control of, HTLV infection. In conclusion, the long-term effects of HIV and HTLV coinfections are poorly understood and the mechanisms of dysregulation of cellular biosynthesis by HTLV that impact HIV disease progression remain elusive."

            "abstract": "Alcohol dependence (AD) has a large heritable component. Genetic variation in genes involved in the absorption and elimination of ethanol have been associated with AD. However, some of these polymorphisms are not present in an African population. Previous studies have reported that a type of AD which is characterized by anxious behaviour may be a genetically specific subtype of AD. We investigated whether variation in genes encoding cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) or acetaldehyde-metabolising enzymes (ALDH1A1, ALDH2) might alter the risk of AD, with and without symptoms of anxiety, in a Cape population with mixed ancestry. Eighty case control pairs (one with AD, one without AD) were recruited and individually matched for potential confounders. Genotype data were available for 29 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the three genes. Linkage disequilibrium D' values were evaluated for all pairwise comparisons. Allele and haplotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls using a χ2 test. The ACAG haplotype in block 4 of the ALDH1A1 gene provided evidence of an association with AD (p = 0.03) and weak evidence of an association with AD without symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.06). When a genetic score was constructed using SNPs showing nominal evidence of association with AD, every extra risk allele increased the odds of AD by 35% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08, 1.68, p = 0.008) and the odds of having AD with anxiety symptoms increased by 53% (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.14, 2.05, p = 0.004). Although our results are supported by previous studies in other populations, they must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the potential influence of population stratification."

This article, which provides a desk review of the current status of mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders in South Africa, suggests that South Africa has a number of policies that bode well for promoting mental health from infancy through to old age. There is, however, a need for programmatic interventions to promote resilience in vulnerable populations. Of note, is the need for programmes to address maternal depression and strengthen attachment and psychosocial stimulation during infancy, strengthen families, promote health enhancing school environments, and address intimate partner violence and build health enhancing social capital. Given the multifaceted nature of risk and protective influences, the need for a multi-sectoral plan of action is highlighted."

Our objective was to determine the undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (\"undiagnosed tuberculosis\") prevalence in a representative sample of prisoners in a South African prison. In addition we investigated risk factors for undiagnosed tuberculosis, to explore if screening strategies could be targeted to high risk groups, and, the performance of screening tools for tuberculosis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      In this cross-sectional survey, male prisoners were screened for tuberculosis using symptoms, chest radiograph (CXR) and two spot sputum specimens for microscopy and culture. Anonymised HIV antibody testing was performed on urine specimens. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of symptoms and investigations were calculated, using Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated on sputum culture as the gold standard. From September 2009 to October 2010, 1046 male prisoners were offered enrolment to the study. A total of 981 (93.8%) consented (median age was 32 years; interquartile range [IQR] 27-37 years) and were screened for tuberculosis. Among 968 not taking tuberculosis treatment and with sputum culture results, 34 (3.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-4.9%) were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HIV prevalence was 25.3% (242/957; 95% CI 22.6-28.2%). Positive HIV status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-4.2) and being an ex-smoker (aOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.9) were independently associated with undiagnosed tuberculosis. Compared to the gold standard of positive sputum culture, cough of any duration had a sensitivity of 35.3% and specificity of 79.6%.

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades, \"Big Tobacco\" has spread its tentacles across the developing world with devastating results. The global incidence of smoking has increased exponentially in Africa, Asia and South America and it is leading to an equally rapid increase in the incidence of smoking-induced morbidity and mortality on these continents. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to respond to this crisis by devising a set of regulations to limit the spread of smoking, and many countries have bound themselves to follow the WHO's guidelines. This article provides an overview of these regulatory measures and the authors attempt to defend them from the perspective of liberty and autonomy. Their motivation is to countermand any attempt by the tobacco industry to attack the regulations on the grounds that they infringe the liberty rights of producers and consumers. It is also argued, however, that a blanket ban of the production, sale and consumption of tobacco cannot be justified on the grounds of autonomy alone."

No nationally-representative studies have examined the relationship between multiple dimensions of alcohol use and transactional sex in women in South Africa. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between alcohol dependence, binge drinking and frequency of drinking in the past month and transactional sex in adult women in South Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study using multi-stage, cluster sampling collected data from a nationally representative sample of 5,969 women aged 16-55 years in 2012. The analysis conducted for this paper was restricted to women reporting sexual activity in the past 12 months (n = 3,594). Transactional sex was defined as having received money/gifts in exchange for sex with any sex partner in the past year. Alcohol use measures included: alcohol dependence (≥2 positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire); binge drinking (≥4 drinks for women on one occasion); and drinking frequency in the previous month. Logistic regression models were built to test the hypotheses that each dimension of alcohol use was associated with transactional sex.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      About 6.3% (n = 225) of sexually active women reported transactional sex.

The birth order of the index children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3 groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups, 16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39). Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD: higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Maternal data in this population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the children.

Data were collected from December 2003 through 2004, using the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Hazardous use of tobacco was most common, followed by alcohol and then other drugs. Hazardous tobacco use was associated with the 18-25 years age group, no religious involvement, high school completion, and higher stress. Hazardous alcohol use was associated with male gender, younger men, no religious involvement, employment, some high school education, and higher stress. Hazardous use of other drugs was associated with Colored (mixed) race (particularly among men), no religious involvement, employment, and stress. For all substances, women, particularly Black women, had the lowest rates of hazardous use. Although the study is cross-sectional, it does identify groups that may be at high risk of substance misuse and for whom intervention is urgent. Because prevalence of substance use is high in this population, routine screening should be introduced in primary care clinics."

            "abstract": "The health and social conditions of women living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside has recently been the focus of substantial international attention. Since few studies have examined rates and correlates of death among addicted women in Canada, we have characterized patterns of mortality among female injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver. The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) is a prospective open cohort study of IDUs. The analyses presented here, were restricted to women enrolled between May 1996 and May 2002 and who were aged 14 years or older. We estimated cumulative mortality rates using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression was used to calculate univariate and adjusted relative hazards. Between May 1996 and May 2002, 520 female IDUs have been recruited from the Vancouver area among whom 68 died during the study period. Elevated rates of mortality were observed among those who reported, baseline sex-trade involvement, those with HIV-infection at baseline, and those who lived in unstable housing at baseline (all log-rank: p<0.05). In adjusted analyses, HIV infection (RH = 3.09 [95% CI: 1.86-5.11]; p<0.001), unstable housing (RH = 1.74 [95% CI: 1.10-2.86]; p=0.029) and sex-trade involvement (RH = 1.82 [95% CI: 0.95-3.45]; p=0.071) were associated with the time to death. When the number of observed deaths was compared to the number of expected deaths based on the general female population of British Columbia using indirect standardization, the rate of death among female IDUs was elevated by a factor of 47.3 (95% CI: 36.1-58.5). In Vancouver, female IDUs have rates of mortality almost 50 times that of the province's female population. Our findings are consistent with a growing number of reports from other settings internationally, and demonstrate the need for an appropriate evidence-based strategy to address the health and social needs of addicted women.\n"

We examined longitudinal data from a birth cohort sample (N = 1,795) who were assessed at age 11 years on cognitive measures and then approximately 25 years later on lifetime alcohol use and alcohol use disorder symptom count. The sample was from Mauritius (eastern Africa), which allowed us to examine these relationships in a non-Western society with a different social structure than is typical of prior cognitive studies on primarily White samples in Western societies. Poorer performance on the Trail Making Test B-A in childhood predicted being a lifetime drinker, even after covarying for gender, childhood psychosocial adversity, and Muslim religion. Lower academic achievement and verbal IQ, but not performance IQ, were predictive of subsequent alcohol problems after including demographic covariates; the relationship between verbal IQ and alcohol problems was stronger in females than males. A nonlinear relationship emerged for Trails, suggesting that only more extreme impairment on this measure was indicative of later alcohol problems. Results of this study provide evidence that verbal deficits and poor academic performance exist in a general cohort sample by age 11 years (when 99% were nondrinkers) for those who go on to develop alcohol problems.

The present review explores trends and outcomes as they relate to education, family formation and sexual and reproductive health and the interrelationships among these areas. It is based on both published and unpublished reports. Over the past 20 years, school enrollment has increased for much of the subcontinent; although the gender gap has narrowed, females remain educationally disadvantaged. Likewise, marriage is occurring later today than a generation ago, posing new challenges of out-of-wedlock births, clandestine abortions, and an increased likelihood of engaging in premarital sex. So, too, although there has been a slowing of the population growth in much of the region, in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the population is doubling every 30 years. Although acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the predominant cause of death among youth, maternal mortality remains a major risk of death for youth--in some countries 600 times greater than that of peers in the industrialized world."

We conducted a cross-sectional household survey of 1018 women aged 18-44 years in one urban (n=606) and one rural (n=412) site. The women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We defined the primary dependent variable, being at risk of having an AEP, as current alcohol use, not being pregnant, being fertile, and no effective use of contraceptives. The independent variables included demographic, substance use, health perceptions, psycho-social, and partner characteristics. The rural women (21.84%) were more likely than their urban counterparts (11.22%) to be at risk of an AEP. In multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of being in the \"at risk\" group for the urban women were (a) being 'white' as opposed to 'black/African', and being 'coloured' as opposed to 'black/African'; and (b) current smoking. For the rural women, significant risk factors were (a) current smoking and (b) early onset of alcohol use. The significant protective factors were (a) education; (b) knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; (c) parity. Use of stricter alcohol use criteria (i.e., three or more drinks and five or more drinks per sitting) in the definition of risk of an AEP yielded slightly different patterns of significant predictors. The results revealed high levels of risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, especially amongst the rural women, and a need for location-specific prevention programmes. The high burden of AEP in South Africa calls for the establishment of national AEP prevention strategies and programmes as a matter of urgency."

Screening for HAD in South Africa involves several challenges, including few culturally appropriate and validated screening tools, and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct screening. This study examined rates of positive HAD screens as determined by the cutoff score on the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) administered by nonspecialist community health workers (CHWs) in South Africa and examined associations between positive HAD screens and common risk factors for HAD. Sixty-five Xhosa-speaking HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with low CD4 counts and documented ART adherence problems were administered a battery of demographic, psychiatric and neurocognitive screening measures. Positive HAD screens were present in 80% of the sample. Presence of a current alcohol dependence disorder and CD4 counts of 200 or lower were significantly associated with positive HAD screens. HIV-positive South Africans on ART with low CD4 counts and ART adherence problems may be at a very high risk for HAD, highlighting the need for more routine screening and monitoring of neurocognitive functions among South Africa's millions of PLWH on ART. Future research is needed to: (1) validate IHDS performance against a gold standard neurocognitive battery for the detection of HAD among larger samples of Xhosa-speaking South Africans with ART adherence difficulties and (2) compare performance of CHW to expert health care personnel in administering the IHDS."

            "abstract": "Migration and HIV research in sub-Saharan Africa has focused on HIV risks to male migrants, yet women's levels of participation in internal migration have met or exceeded those of men in the region. Moreover, studies that have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence among migrant compared to non-migrant women. However, little is known about the pathways through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. This study aimed to characterize the contexts and processes that may facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission among migrant women in the Kisumu area of Nyanza Province, Kenya. We used qualitative methods, including 6 months of participant observation in women's common migration destinations and in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 male and 40 female migrants selected from these destinations. Gendered aspects of the migration process may be linked to the high risks of HIV observed in female migrants - in the circumstances that trigger migration, livelihood strategies available to female migrants, and social features of migration destinations. Migrations were often precipitated by household shocks due to changes in marital status (as when widowhood resulted in disinheritance) and gender-based violence. Many migrants engaged in transactional sex, of varying regularity, from clandestine to overt, to supplement earnings from informal sector trading. Migrant women are at high risk of HIV transmission and acquisition: the circumstances that drove migration may have also increased HIV infection risk at origin; and social contexts in destinations facilitate having multiple sexual partners and engaging in transactional sex. We propose a model for understanding the pathways through which migration contributes to HIV risks in women in high HIV prevalence areas in Africa, highlighting potential opportunities for primary and secondary HIV prevention at origins and destinations, and at key 'moments of vulnerability' in the migration process."

Humans acquire trypanosomiasis following the bite of a tsetse fly infected with the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) spp. -i.e., T.b. gambiense in West and Central Africa and T.b. rhodesiense in East and Southern Africa. Over the last decade HAT diagnostic capacity to estimate HAT prevalence has improved in active case-finding areas but enhanced passive surveillance programs are still lacking in much of rural sub-Saharan Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective-cross-sectional study examined the use of national census data (1999) to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts to assess the potential of HAT-acquired infection in those areas. A multilevel study design estimated the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, nested within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. Residents and recent migrants of working age were studied. Tsetse fly's impact on disability was conceptualised via two exposure pathways: directly from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection or indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional deficiencies and poverty.

Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level."

            "abstract": "The khat plant contains psychoactive alkaloids with psychostimulant properties, and has been used for centuries as a recreational and religious drug, mainly in some African and Middle Eastern countries. With changing migration patterns, epidemiological and clinical outcomes may have changed. The aim of this article is to review current knowledge on pharmacological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of khat use. Khat use is still highly prevalent in the countries mentioned, and in African and Yemeni emigrant groups. Preclinical and clinical data confirm its addictive potential as well as possible psychological, psychiatric and medical consequences related to stimulant use; however, existing epidemiological studies do not focus on the prevalence of problematic use or dependence. There are no indications of high prevalence of khat use in other cultural and ethnic groups. Data are lacking on possible increased psychotogenic risks when khat is used outside of the original cultural context. As with alcohol use in many countries, khat use can be considered as a lifestyle in some specific countries, covering the spectrum from nonproblematic use to problematic use and dependence. Khat dependence is associated with high morbidity and societal and economical costs."

Using a cross-sectional study design, a total of 900 active FSWs between the ages of 18 and 35 years were recruited from 52 brothels within Nasarawa State, Nigeria. A rapid test algorithm was used to determine their HIV status. The BED IgG-Capture enzyme immunoassay (CEIA) was applied on the HIV-seropositive samples to detect recent HIV-1 infection for the estimation of incidence among those with HIV infection. Of the 900 FSWs tested, 335 (37.2%) were found to be positive for HIV. Of these, 63 showed evidence of recent infection. Using two third-generation BED analysis approaches that account for false-recent rate, an annualized adjusted HIV incidence of 11.97% (95% CI: 8.51-15.43%) and 12.36% (95% CI: 8.18-16.34%) was observed; difference P>0.05. In addition, 875 (97.2%) of the FSWs readily agreed to participate in HIV clinical trials. We have developed the expertise and infrastructure necessary for clinical trial investigations in sub-Saharan Africa. We have recorded a high proportion of recent HIV infections among FSWs in Nigeria and also provided an enabling environment for future studies of HIV prevention methods."

            "abstract": "Amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) have become the focus of increasing attention worldwide. There are understandable concerns over potential harms including the transmission of HIV. However, there have been no previous global reviews of the extent to which these drugs are injected or levels of HIV among users. A comprehensive search of the international peer-reviewed and grey literature was undertaken. Multiple electronic databases were searched and documents and datasets were provided by UN agencies and key experts from around the world in response to requests for information on the epidemiology of use. Amphetamine or methamphetamine (meth/amphetamine, M/A) use was documented in 110 countries, and injection in 60 of those. Use may be more prevalent in East and South East Asia, North America, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and a number of European countries. In countries where the crystalline form is available, evidence suggests users are more likely to smoke or inject the drug; in such countries, higher levels of dependence may be occurring. Equivocal evidence exists as to whether people who inject M/A are at differing risk of HIV infection than other drug injectors; few countries document HIV prevalence/incidence among M/A injectors. High risk sexual behaviour among M/A users may contribute to increased risk of HIV infection, but available evidence is not sufficient to determine if the association is causal. A range of possible responses to M/A use and harm are discussed, ranging from supply and precursor control, to demand and harm reduction. Evidence suggests that complex issues surround M/A, requiring novel and sophisticated approaches, which have not yet been met with sufficient investment of time or resources to address them. Significant levels of M/A in many countries require a response to reduce harms that in many cases remain poorly understood. More active models of engagement with M/A users and provision of services that meet their specific needs are required."

            "abstract": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) represents the single most significant advance in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The vast majority of patients treated with HAART will experience long-term remission of HIV disease. HAART does not cure HIV of course, but it changes the disease into a chronic and manageable condition. Use of HAART is associated with decreased HIV/AIDS-related morbidity, fewer opportunistic infections, and reduced mortality. Evidence has also shown that HAART can reduce HIV transmission. This is most clearly illustrated in studies of vertical or mother-to-child HIV transmission, in which use of HAART by the infected mother has virtually eliminated HIV transmission to her infant. Research has further shown that HAART use among heterosexual discordant couples in Africa was associated with a 92% reduction in HIV transmission. Until recently, the use of HAART among drug-using populations has remained controversial. However, HAART has now been shown to produce similar survival benefit when individuals with and without history of drug use were compared. This article discusses the need for an expansion in the provision of HAART to those in medical need, including drug users, to curb the devastating toll of the HIV pandemic. Such an effort should be done with the full promotion of human rights, including the need to respect each patient's privacy and autonomy. Public health programs to intensify HAART use should be carried out within a comprehensive \"combination prevention\" framework. Such an approach for drug users would emphasize drug addiction treatment, HIV prevention including HIV testing and counseling and behavioral risk reduction interventions, and the removal of structural barriers to treat HIV-infected drug users and retain them in care."

We found that recent exposure to intimate partner violence among men was associated with all forms of drug use, whereas women who were recently abused were more likely to suffer from depression and problem drinking. We also found high levels of problem drinking among both men (58%) and women (42%). Men were more likely to use drugs. Exposure to community violence increased sexual risk behaviors among men.

The determinants of HIV risk associated with sex work occur at several levels, including individual biological and behavioural, dyadic and network, and community and social environmental levels. Evidence indicates that effective HIV prevention packages for sex workers should include combinations of biomedical, behavioural, and structural interventions tailored to local contexts, and be led and implemented by sex worker communities. A model simulation based on the South African heterosexual epidemic suggests that condom promotion and distribution programmes in South Africa have already reduced HIV incidence in sex workers and their clients by more than 70%. Under optimistic model assumptions, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis together with test and treat programmes could further reduce HIV incidence in South African sex workers and their clients by up to 40% over a 10-year period. Combining these biomedical approaches with a prevention package, including behavioural and structural components as part of a community-driven approach, will help to reduce HIV infection in sex workers in different settings worldwide."

Using multivariate logistic regression, we measured the impact of unawareness of the health consequences of tobacco use on behaviour and attitudes towards tobacco control.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A median of 62.6% of school personnel were unaware of at least one health consequence of tobacco use. School personnel in countries with mandatory cigarette health warning labels had lower odds of being unaware of any health consequence of tobacco use than countries where health warning labels were not mandatory (adjusted OR [aOR]=0.51; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71). A significant dose-response relationship was seen between being ignorant of 1; 2; or ≥3 tobacco use health consequences respectively (compared with not being ignorant of any), and the odds of the following outcomes: non-support of bans on tobacco industry sponsorship of school or extracurricular activities (aOR=1.47; 1.91; and 2.98); non-support of bans on all tobacco advertisements (aOR=1.24; 1.78; and 2.68) and non-support of policies prohibiting tobacco use by school personnel on campus (aOR=1.79; 4.45; and 4.56).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Unawareness of the health consequences of tobacco use was associated with poor support for tobacco control policies.

EOS is considered extremely rare and its prevalence in comparison to the worldwide prevalence of schizophrenia (1%) has not adequately been studied. Patients who experience the first episode of psychosis need to be treated early and optimally to lessen the morbidity and improve the outcome of the illness. Treatment needs to be a combination of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities. Pharmacological intervention is necessary for remission, improvement of positive symptoms and to aid with the efficacy of psychosocial interventions. There is a lack of efficacy and safety data of the use of antipsychotic medication in children, with most of the information available being extrapolations of adult data. An increased use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of EOS has been accompanied by growing concern about the appropriate use and associated side effects in children and adolescents. This update highlights new developments, concepts and treatment trends in EOS."

            "abstract": "Malawi, a very poor country located in southern Africa, is no exception to the growing trend and severity in HIV prevalence. By the end of 2003 there were 900 000 adults and children in Malawi living with HIV/AIDS. Adult prevalence was estimated to be 15%, which is higher than the 7.1% average rate for sub-Saharan Africa. In order to understand the spread of HIV/AIDS it is imperative to address the economic, social, cultural, and political issues that impact on women's contraction and spread of the virus. We do so in this paper by critically examining the gendered context of HIV/AIDS with reference to Malawi. The theoretical framework for this research focuses on poverty, gender relations, regional migration patterns, and global economic changes which place women in highly vulnerable situations. The study was conducted in a low-income area in Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi. In 2003 and 2004, 60 randomly selected women who lived in a low socioeconomic residential area completed a structured interview on issues concerning individual economic situations, marriage history, fertility, family planning and social networks, gender, sexual partnerships, and HIV/AIDS. Focus group interviews were also conducted with an additional 20 women. The results of our study indicate that the rising epidemic among women in Malawi is firstly driven by poverty which limits their options. Secondly, gender inequality and asymmetrical sexual relations are basic to spreading HIV/AIDS among women. Thirdly, in spite of their awareness through media and health care professionals, women are unable to protect themselves, which further increases their vulnerability."

This high incidence rate is linked to a number of factors, including HIV co-infection and alcohol use disorders. The diagnosis and treatment package for TB and HIV co-infection is relatively well established in South Africa. However, because alcohol use disorders may present more insidiously, making it difficult to diagnose, those patients with active TB and misusing alcohol are not easily cured from TB. With this in mind, the primary purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial was to provide screening for alcohol misuse and to test the effectiveness of brief interventions in reducing alcohol intake in those patients with active TB found to be misusing alcohol in primary public health care clinics in three districts in South Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Within each of the three provinces targeted, one district with the highest TB burden was selected.

In each district, 7 of the 14 (50%) clinics were randomly assigned to a control arm and another 7 of the 14 (50%) clinics assigned to intervention arm. At the clinic level systematic sampling was used to recruit newly diagnosed and retreatment TB patients. Those consenting were screened for alcohol misuse using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Patients who screened positive for alcohol misuse over a 6-month period were given either a brief intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills (IMB) Model or an alcohol use health education leaflet.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 4882 tuberculosis patients screened for alcohol and agreed to participate in the trial, 1196 (24.6%) tested positive for the AUDIT.

This study seeks to analyze gender differences in risk for intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration according to childhood and adult risk factors in a national sample of South African men and women. Using data from the cross-sectional, nationally representative South Africa Stress and Health Study, the authors examine data from 1,715 currently married or cohabiting adults on reporting of intimate partner violence. Our analysis include (a) demographic factors, (b) early life risk factors (including exposure to childhood physical abuse, witnessing parental violence, parental closeness, and early onset DSM-IV disorders), and (c) adult risk factors (including experiencing the death of a child and episodes of DSM-IV disorders after age 20). Although prevalence rates of intimate partner violence are high among both genders, women are significantly more likely than men to report being victimized (29.3% vs. 20.9%). Rates of perpetrating violence are similar for women and men (25.2% and 26.5%, respectively). Men are more likely to report predictive factors for perpetration, whereas women are more likely to report predictors for victimization. Common risk factors among men and women reporting perpetration include exposure to childhood physical abuse, witnessing parental violence, and adult onset alcohol abuse/dependence. However, risk factors in male perpetrators are more likely to include cohabitation, low income, and early and adult-onset mood disorders, whereas risk factors in female perpetrators include low educational attainment and early onset alcohol abuse/dependence. The single common risk factor for male and female victims of partner violence is witnessing parental violence. Additional risk factors for male victims are low income and lack of closeness to a primary female caregiver, whereas additional risk factors for female victims are low educational attainment, childhood physical abuse, and adult onset alcohol abuse/dependence and intermittent explosive disorder. Intimate partner violence is a significant public health issue in South Africa, strongly linked to intergenerational cycling of violence and risk exposure across the life course. These findings indicate that gender differences in risk and common predictive factors, such as alcohol abuse and exposure to childhood violence, should inform the design of future violence-prevention programs and policies."

            "abstract": "## AIM\nTo determine the mortality in a cohort of very young injecting drug users (IDUs), and the factors associated with it.\n## DESIGN\nA database linkage prospective (follow-up) cohort study.\n## SETTING\nA convenience sample of clients of 2 low-threshold facilities, 1 drug treatment clinic, and one special facility for children with severe behavioural disorders, who were all younger than 19 and older than 15, was interviewed one or more times in 1996-8 and asked to agree with their being interviewed again after 10 or more years.\n## PARTICIPANTS\n151 (65 male, 86 female) IDUs recruited in October 1996 - December 1998.\n## MEASUREMENT\nDatabase linkage study compared unique identifiers (IDs) of the recruited subjects with the general register of deaths to determine the life status, and the causes of death of those deceased. Where necessary, we examined the death protocols directly.\n## FINDINGS\nAltogether, 8 deaths were registered between recruitment and 31st December 2008 (1,660 person-years). All the deceased were male, and all their deaths were \"unnatural\"--that is, caused by drug overdose or accident. This translates into the crude mortality rates for the whole cohort being 4.8 deaths per 1,000 person-years (PY), and into a specific mortality ratio in the males SMR=14.4 with the peak at the age of 15-20 (SMR=60.1), declining to SMR=8.2 at the age of 25-30. Except gender, we found no \"predictors of death\" in this high-risk cohort.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe overall mortality in the cohort was substantially higher than in the general population; in the male part of the cohort of young injecting drug users it was excessively high in the first three years after recruitment, and caused by external causes exclusively; the mortality in the female sub-cohort was zero, i.e. lower than in the general population of the same age range. Our findings suggest a need to develop targeted prevention of overdoses and other unnatural deaths in young male drug injectors.\n"

This study assessed whether experiencing violence is associated with reduced drug abstinence among adult women (n = 603) participating in a randomized field trial for an HIV prevention study in Cape Town. In relation to drug abstinence at 12-month follow-up, multivariable regression models were used to assess (1) baseline partner and non-partner victimization, and (2) victimization at 12-month follow-up among participants reporting baseline victimization. Baseline partner (AOR = 0.6; 95 % CI 0.4-0.9) and non-partner victimization (AOR = 0.6; 95 % CI 0.4-0.9) were associated with a reduced likelihood of drug abstinence at follow-up. Among participants who reported victimization at baseline, those no longer reporting victimization at follow-up did not differ significantly in drug abstinence compared with those who reported victimization at follow-up. The study findings highlight the lasting impact of victimization on women's drug use outcomes, persisting regardless of whether violence was no longer reported at follow-up. Overall, the findings support the need for the primary prevention of violence to address the cycle of violence, drug use, and HIV among women in this setting."

Ready-to-use foods (RUF) are energy-dense, lipid-based products that do not require cooking or refrigeration that have been used to prevent and treat malnutrition among vulnerable children. The effectiveness of these products in improving child nutritional status depends on household use by caregivers. To identify the key facilitators and barriers that influence appropriate in-home RUF consumption by supplemental feeding program beneficiaries, we conducted individual interviews among caregivers (n = 80), RUF producers (n = 8) and program staff (n = 10) involved in the Byokulia Bisemeye mu Bantu supplemental feeding program in Bundibugyo, Uganda. By documenting caregiver perceptions and feeding practices related to RUF, we developed a conceptual framework of factors that affect appropriate feeding with RUF. Findings suggest that locally produced RUF is well received by caregivers and children, and is perceived by caregivers and the community to be a healthy supplemental food for malnourished children. However, child feeding practices, including sharing of RUF within households, compromise the nutrient delivery to the intended child. Interventions and educational messages informed by this study can help to improve RUF delivery to targeted beneficiaries."

The presence of a large number of potential confounders, however, complicates the assessment of the actual size of this causal effect, leaving room for a substantial amount of bias. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the role of confounding in the observed association between problem drinking and tuberculosis, assessing the effect of the adjustment for a relatively large number of potential confounders on the estimated prevalence odds ratio of tuberculosis among problem drinkers vs. moderate drinkers/abstainers in a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the South African adult population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A propensity score approach was used to match each problem drinker in the sample with a subset of moderate drinkers/abstainers with similar characteristics in respect to a set of potential confounders.

Within the limitations of a cross-sectional study design with self-reported tuberculosis status, these results adds to previous evidence of a causal link between problem drinking and tuberculosis, and suggest that the observed higher prevalence of tuberculosis among problem drinkers commonly found in population studies cannot be attributed to the confounding effect of the uneven distribution of other risk factors."

Several countries in Asia have demonstrated that reducing transmission in sex work can reverse established epidemics among sex workers, their clients and the general population. Experience and emerging research from Africa reaffirms unprotected sex work to be a key driver of sexual transmission in different contexts and regardless of stage or classification of HIV epidemic. This validation of the epidemiology behind sexual transmission carries an urgent imperative to realign prevention resources and scale up effective targeted interventions in sex work settings, and, given declining HIV resources, to do so efficiently. Eighteen articles in this issue highlight the importance and feasibility of such interventions under four themes: 1) epidemiology, data needs and modelling of sex work in generalised epidemics; 2) implementation science addressing practical aspects of intervention scale-up; 3) community mobilisation and 4) the treatment cascade for sex workers living with HIV.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Decades of empirical evidence, extended by analyses in this collection, argue that protecting sex work is, without exception, feasible and necessary for controlling HIV/STI epidemics. In addition, the disproportionate burden of HIV borne by sex workers calls for facilitated access to ART, care and support. The imperative for Africa is rapid scale-up of targeted prevention and treatment, facilitated by policies and action to improve conditions where sex work takes place. The opportunity is a wealth of accumulated experience working with sex workers in diverse settings, which can be tapped to make up for lost time. Elsewhere, even in countries with strong interventions and services for sex workers, an emerging challenge is to find ways to sustain them in the face of declining global resources."

There is a need to identify adherence indicators that will ensure long-term treatment success. A cross-sectional review of 921 adult patients on ART for at least 1 year was conducted. Through an administered adherence survey, key indicators were found to be highly correlated with patient adherence. The adherence rate in this sample was 72% after being on treatment for an average of 15 months. This data suggest that having a high perceived quality of care and owning one's own home positively affected patients' adherence. Indicators such as alcohol use in the last month and a high level of depression negatively affected patients' adherence. Targeting specific indicators for specific interventions will guard against nonadherence, leading to treatment failure."

This study was undertaken as a pilot study to provide direction for a large-scale, systematic, countrywide or regional analysis. Hypotheses tested include the following: 1) drug use/misuse is related to violent behavior; 2) drug use/misuse is related to predatory violent behavior; and 3) drug use/misuse increases the likelihood that those addicted to drugs will commit violent acts. In order to test these hypotheses, two data sets were used to increase the robustness of the study. The first data set was collected during the summer of 1996, and was based on a self-reported survey of 117 subjects (17 women and 100 men), from different neighborhoods in Greater Accra and from different ethnic groups, mean age of 32, most were unemployed. The second data set was collected during the summer of 1997, based on a self-reported survey of 216 (45 women and 171 men) subjects from different neighborhoods in Greater Accra, from different ethnic groups, mean age of 31, most of whom were also unemployed. All hypotheses were confirmed by analysis of the data collected. This suggests that an expanded, countrywide study using the same procedures and instrumentation would provide a meaningful foundation for sound decisions by governmental officials and policy-makers in dealing with drug use and violence in Ghana. Further, the approach could serve as a model for other countries addressing similar problems."

The prevalence of HBV in this hospital population was higher than predicted on the basis of notifications to the passive surveillance scheme.

This paper presents the findings of a nationwide survey of disability organisations in South Africa. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of disability organisations in addressing the HIV epidemic among disabled people in South Africa. The findings suggest that while organisations recognise the importance of providing HIV education, and many have taken steps to do so, disabled people are largely excluded from general HIV prevention messages. Disabled people also have significant difficulties in accessing general health care, relevant for HIV testing and treatment.

Rail passenger and rail pedestrian fatalities were defined as cases with motor vehicle passenger and pedestrian fatalities as the respective controls. Data were collected from post-mortem reports at two mortuaries from 1994 to 1996. Blood alcohol concentration was the dependent variable. The independent variables were age, gender, date of death, day of week, time of injury and external cause of death. The late afternoon and early evening period from 1600 hours to 1900 hours had the highest frequency of fatalities for all case and control groups. Of the 56 predominately male (89%) railway passenger cases with an average age of 34.5 (SD 12.5) years, Friday (27%) was the most frequent day of death. Railway pedestrian cases (89% male, average age 36.8 years (SD 13.3)) were more likely to be killed on a Monday (11% of cases).

We therefore designed a comprehensive dedicated intervention targeting young FSW and assessed its impact on HIV incidence in Burkina Faso.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between September 2009 and September 2011 we conducted a prospective, interventional cohort study of FSW aged 18 to 25 years in Ouagadougou, with quarterly follow-up for a maximum of 21 months. The intervention combined prevention and care within the same setting, consisting of peer-led education sessions, psychological support, sexually transmitted infections and HIV care, general routine health care and reproductive health services. At each visit, behavioural characteristics were collected and HIV, HSV-2 and pregnancy were tested. We compared the cohort HIV incidence with a modelled expected incidence in the study population in the absence of intervention, using data collected at the same time from FSW clients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 321 HIV-uninfected FSW enrolled in the cohort completed 409 person-years of follow-up. No participant seroconverted for HIV during the study (0/409 person-years), whereas the expected modelled number of HIV infections were 5.05/409 person-years (95% CI, 5.01-5.08) or 1.23 infections per 100 person-years (p=0.005). This null incidence was related to a reduction in the number of regular partners and regular clients, and by an increase in consistent condom use with casual clients (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.19; 95% CI, 1.16-4.14, p=0.01) and with regular clients (aOR=2.18; 95% CI, 1.26-3.76, p=0.005).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Combining peer-based prevention and care within the same setting markedly reduced the HIV incidence among young FSW in Burkina Faso, through reduced risky behaviours."

            "abstract": "In developing countries such as South Africa, not much is known about the prevalence of assaults and seclusion occurring in mental health wards over time. Here, we describe a 5-year trend in assaults and seclusions, stratified by gender, at Stikland Hospital, South Africa. A retrospective review of clinical records of patients admitted to the acute psychiatric admission wards at Stikland and involved in assault and secluded was undertaken between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Data on the number of patient and staff assaults as well as seclusions, gender, age, marital status, level of education, level of income, duration of hospital admission and primary psychiatric diagnosis were collected. Significantly (P < 0.01) more men than women engaged in patient assaults, while significantly (P < 0.01) more men were secluded than women. On a monthly basis, the number of gender-stratified patient assaults and seclusions significantly increased (P < 0.01) throughout the study period. In conclusion, we show here that gender had a significant effect on both patient assault and seclusion numbers, which increased towards the end of the study period. Monitoring of these events is therefore important to continuously improve quality of care."

            "abstract": "Road traffic injuries, a major global public health burden, are concentrated in low-income and middle-income countries.(1) In contrast to high-income countries, pedestrians make up the largest group of road traffic injuries and fatalities in low- and middle-income countries. This article presents an analysis of pedestrian fatalities (2001-2004) in four South African cities. The article describes the magnitude, demographic, and temporal factors associated with pedestrian fatalities and presents a typological analysis to identify particular groups of at risk pedestrians. The analysis can serve to inform the development of prevention programmes tailored to the needs of specific at risk pedestrian groups. Data were obtained from the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System (NIMSS). The results indicated that there were a total of 7433 pedestrian deaths (2001-2004) for the four cities and the majority occurred over weekends. Most (56.7%) were between ages 20 and 44 years. Overall, there were 3.3 male pedestrian deaths for every female pedestrian death, and over half (58%) of the 4004 cases tested were positive for alcohol. A typological analysis identified three categories of pedestrian fatalities: (1) male pedestrian fatalities that showed high levels of alcohol concentrations, (2) female and elderly pedestrian deaths that occurred between 6 AM and midday, and (3) children, adolescents, and young adult pedestrian fatalities that typically occurred during weekday afternoons and evenings. The findings call for multiple strategies for combating pedestrian fatalities."

Material incentives (given as cash, vouchers and tokens), have been used to improve adherence.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of material incentives in people undergoing diagnostic testing, or receiving prophylactic or curative therapy, for tuberculosis.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; and reference lists of relevant publications; to 22 June 2011.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomized controlled trials of material incentives in patients being investigated for tuberculosis, or on treatment for latent or active disease.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      At least two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The effects of interventions are compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 11 eligible studies. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). One additional trial recruited malnourished men receiving active treatment for tuberculosis in Timor-Leste.Material incentives may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results compared to normal care (two trials, 1371 participants: RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29, low quality evidence).Similarly, incentives probably improve clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of antituberculosis prophylaxis (three trials, 595 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96, moderate quality evidence), and may improve subsequent completion of prophylaxis in some settings (three trials, 869 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.58, low quality evidence).We currently don't know if incentives can improve long-term adherence and completion of antituberculosis treatment for active disease. Only one trial has assessed this and the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday (one trial, 265 participants, RR 0.98, 95%CI 0.86 to 1.12, very low quality evidence).Several trials have compared different forms or levels of incentive. These comparisons remain limited to single trials and robust conclusions cannot be made. In summary, cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (return for test results: one trial, 651 participants: RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.19, low quality evidence, adherence to tuberculosis prophylaxis: one trial, 141 participants: RR 1.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.56, low quality evidence) and higher amounts of cash may be more effective than lower amounts (return for test results: one trial, 404 participants: RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.16, low quality evidence).Material incentives may also be more effective than motivational education at improving return for tuberculin skin test results (low quality evidence), but may be no more effective than peer counselling, or structured education at improving continuation or completion of prophylaxis (low quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is limited evidence to support the use of material incentives to improve return rates for tuberculosis diagnostic test results and adherence to antituberculosis preventive therapy. The data are currently limited to trials among predominantly male drug users, homeless, and prisoner subpopulations in the USA, and therefore the results are not easily generalised to the wider adult population, or to low- and middle-income countries, where the tuberculosis burden is highest.Further high-quality studies are needed to assess both the costs and effectiveness of incentives to improve adherence to long-term treatment of tuberculosis."

Among the sexually active 15-17-year-olds, most reported multiple partners (54%) and never using condoms (52%). Most girls (53% in Greater Cairo and 90% in Alexandria) had experienced sexual abuse. The majority of street children experienced more than one of these risks.

Recent studies shows TB is rising in certain parts of the world, and Saudi Arabia is one of them. Several factor contribute in predisposing the subjects for infection including but not limited to addiction to various compounds which have immune modulation properties, such as amphetamines and Heroin etc. Khat a plant whose leaves are chewed for its euphoric effect in east Africa and Arabian Peninsula including Saudi Arabia, is considered as mildly addictive, and its principle compound, Cathinone shares structural and functional similarity with amphetamine a known immunomodulator. Tuberculosis being a disease of immune modulation has a varied spectrum of complex interplay of proinflammatory molecules, resistin is one of them. In the present study, we try to explore the trinity of khat addiction, serum resistin level and tuberculosis by correlating the serum resistin level in non khat addicted healthy subjects, khat addicted healthy subjects, and in patients, both khat addicted and non khat addicted, with active tuberculosis. We observed significantly higher resistin level among the apparently healthy khat addicted subjects as compared to non addicted healthy controls. Thereafter, when we compare the resistin levels between khat addicted and non khat addicted TB patients we did not found significant difference between the two groups. However bacillary load was observe to be significantly higher among the khat addicted TB patient as compare to non addicted one. Validation of above results in animal model revealed dose dependant increase in bacillary growth in the Wistar rats treated with khat. Taken together these results suggest the role of khat in immune modulation albeit in the limited frame of resistin level."

            "abstract": "AIDS has increased the number of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in sub-Saharan Africa who could suffer detrimental life experiences. We investigated whether OVCs have heightened risks of adverse reproductive health outcomes including HIV infection. Data on HIV infection, sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms and pregnancy, and common risk factors were collected for OVCs and non-OVCs in a population survey of 1523 teenage children in eastern Zimbabwe between July 2001 and March 2003. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for statistical association between OVC status, adverse reproductive health outcomes and suspected risk factors. Amongst women aged 15-18 years, OVCs had higher HIV prevalence than non-OVCs (3.2% versus 0.0%; p = 0.002) and more common experience of STI symptoms (5.9% versus 3.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.75, 95% CI 0.80-3.80) and teenage pregnancy (8.3% versus 1.9%; 4.25, 1.58-11.42). OVCs (overall), maternal orphans and young women with an infected parent were more likely to have received no secondary school education and to have started sex and married, which, in turn, were associated with poor reproductive health. Amongst men aged 17-18 years, OVC status was not associated with HIV infection (0.5% versus 0.0%; p = 1.000) or STI symptoms (2.7% versus 1.6%; p = 0.529). No association was found between history of medical injections and HIV risk amongst teenage women and men. High proportions of HIV infections, STIs and pregnancies among teenage girls in eastern Zimbabwe can be attributed to maternal orphanhood and parental HIV. Many of these could be averted through further female secondary school education. Predicted substantial expanded increases in orphanhood could hamper efforts to slow the acquisition of HIV infection in successive generations of young adults, perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty and disease."

Headache is a common neurological disorder and one of the most common reasons for visiting the neurology clinics in Nigeria. Low socioeconomic status has been linked with primary headaches. Factors that may precipitate and sustain headaches are common in Africa especially in urban slums. There are limited population based data on the prevalence of headache from Nigeria and other African countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 3 phase cross-sectional descriptive study was done to survey at least 40% of the adult population (Igbos) living in an urban slum using the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd Edition (ICHD-I) criteria using a validated Igbo language adaptation (translation and back-translation into Igbo language) of a World Health Organization protocol for screening neurological disorders in the community.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The lifetime prevalence of headache of any type was 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.2-69.2), significantly higher in females (70.2% [95% CI 67.0-73.4]) than in males (62.3% [95% CI 58.5-66.1]; P = .0.002). The prevalence of primary headaches was also significantly lower in males than in females (44.9% [95% CI 45.5-53.3] vs 53.2% (95% CI 49.3-57.1), P = .002). Female (52.1%) drinkers had a statistically higher prevalence of primary headaches than male drinkers (43.6%; P = .004). The prevalence of migraine was 6.4% (95% CI 5.1-7.7); 7.5% (95% CI 5.6-9.4) in females and 5% (95% CI 3.3-6.7) in males (P = .058). Migraine with aura was similar in both males and females. Migraine without aura was significantly higher in females (5.7%) than males (3.1%) (P = .022). Tension-type headache (TTH) had an overall prevalence of 13.8% (95% CI 11.3-16.3), males 12.2% (95% CI 9.7-14.7), and females 15.1% (95% CI 12.6-17.6; P = .118.) The peak decade for all primary headaches was 20-29 years for males (49.8%) and 60-69 years for females (57.5%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Headache is a common health problem in an urban slum in Enugu south east Nigeria where 66.7% of participants had experienced headache in their lifetime, and 49.4% had experienced primary headaches. The prevalence of migraine and TTH were 6.4% (5% in males and 7.5% in females) and 13.8% (12.2% in males and 15.1% in females), respectively. The peak ages of migraine and tension-type headache were 30-39 and 60-69 years, respectively. The prevalence of primary headaches was significantly higher among subjects who used alcohol significantly."

Four dimensions have been determined that define the profile of women resorting to IAs: age, reproductive history and marital status; type of health services used; social level; and earlier or late IA and its repetitive use. Age and related factors were important determinants. Economic status and knowledge of the health system were related to access to contraception and IA information. Spanish, Western European and South American women had a higher social level than Romanian and African women. Late IA use and a lower recurrence characterised Asian, North African and Spanish women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Differences on IA use between groups of different women seem to be related to vulnerability (economic, social, knowledge and use of healthcare services).

There is a paucity of research examining the health care costs of caring for children with FAS or PFAS in this country. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted using an interviewer-administered questionnaire amongst caregivers of children (0-12 years) with FAS/PFAS in the Western Cape to estimate the utilization of health care services; the annual direct and indirect health care costs per child as well as the total cost to society for providing health care services to children with FAS/PFAS. It was found that the median number of annual visits to public health care facilities per child was 8 (IQR 4 to 14). The total average annual cost per child was $1039.38 (95% CI: $808.68; $1270.07) and the total annual societal cost for the Western Cape was $70,960,053.68 (95% CI: $5,528,895.48; $86,709,971.13). Caregivers in receipt of a social support grant reported spending significantly less on health care for a child with FAS/PFAS (Fisher's exact p=0.004). These study results confirm the significant burden of FAS/PFAS on the Western Cape economy and the health care system which has significant implications for FAS prevention."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Tobacco is the major cause of cancer and a relevant risk factor for several other chronic diseases. Due to the epidemiological transition in developing countries with overall increasing life expectancy there is an increasing relevance of chronic diseases to the total burden of diseases. Furthermore, there are indications for a rise in the consumption of tobacco products in developing countries. Since in Africa data on smoking prevalence are scarce and cancer diagnosis is often imprecise or missing, it is difficult to estimate the current and future number of cancer cases attributable to tobacco smoking. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the effects of smoking on lung cancer in selected developing countries in Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We combined data on smoking prevalence from different African countries with estimates on age-specific lung cancer rates in smokers and non-smokers from industrialized countries and data on age and sex distribution in African countries. We perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of the assumptions necessary for the procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      If the smoking prevalence in African countries will remain on the current level, we estimate age-specific lung cancer rates lower than those in Germany. Despite the relatively small proportion of adults aged 50 and more which is the age when most cancer cases occur, there is an appreciable number of deaths from lung cancer that could be prevented when smoking prevalence could be reduced. Depending on assumptions we estimate up about 50,000 lung cancer deaths per year in Africa, most of which could be prevented.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Efforts for smoking prevalence reduction are much more needed in the developing world. Better and more comprehensive data on smoking are needed for more precise estimates."

The aim of this study was to assess the oral health status of prison inmates in the Western Cape (Pollsmoor, Goodwood, Paarl and Worcester). A cross-sectional epidemiological survey involving a clinical oral examination and face-to-face interviews was used to collect information on DMFT, periodontal health, perceived needs and the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of inmates to oral health. Clinical examinations were carried out using WHO criteria. Of the 340 study participants, 264 were male and 76 were female. The prevalence of oral disease was high. The mean DMFT was 15.45 and the total DMFT increased with age. There was a reported impact on oral health quality of life, with many citing problems with eating, drinking and pain. Self-reported dental needs indicated a perceived need for dentures, scaling and fillings. Over two thirds of the sample (72%) reported that the dental services that they presently receive are poor. This study found a high prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease among the correctional service populations. There is an urgent need for the development of a basic oral health care package that should be offered to all inmates as eventually many of them will be returning to the community."

This research examines these overlapping risk factors among 1,145 pregnant Xhosa women living in 24 township neighborhoods in Cape Town, South Africa. Results revealed that 66 % of pregnant women experienced at least one risk factor. In descending order of prevalence, 37 % reported depressed mood, 29 % were HIV+, 25 % used alcohol prior to knowing that they were pregnant, and 15 % had a previous childbirth with a LBW infant. Approximately 27 % of women had more than one risk factor: depressed mood was significantly associated with alcohol use and LBW, with a trend to significance with HIV+. In addition, alcohol use was significantly related to HIV+. These results suggest the importance of intervening across multiple risks to maternal and child health, and particularly with depression and alcohol use, to positively impact multiple maternal and infant outcomes."

Standardized interviews and hospital records with toxicological analyses were used for demographic data, substance use and psychiatric diagnoses at admission. For Follow-up analyses, autopsy protocols including toxicology tests and death certificates were obtained for assessment of causes of death which were coded according to ICD-10. Age-group standardized mortality ratios were calculated independently for both sexes.\n## RESULTS\n204 persons (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. SMR was 5.94 for the cohort. Compared to an age- and gender-matched population, the risk of premature death was about eighteen times higher between the ages of 20-44 and about five times higher from 45 up to the age of 69. Of 120 (59%) drug-related deaths, 43 were opiate overdoses, and 3 were overdose from amphetamine. A total of 53 (26%) persons died violent deaths: 39 suicides, of which 25 were drug-related, 3 homicides and 12 accidents. The Swedish national causes of death register underestimated drug-related death by 37% and suicide by 85% compared to the results from this study.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature often drug-related and violent death well into middle age, and to a great extent the drug addicts died from the same drug they had abused when they were first admitted for treatment. The underestimation of drug-related death and suicide in some national death cause registers could be reduced if the doctor routinely records ICD codes when issuing death certificates and autopsy protocols.\n"

            "abstract": "The high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome in sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in a dramatic increase in orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) over the past decade. These children typically rely on extended family networks for support, but the magnitude of the crisis has resulted in traditional familial networks becoming overwhelmed and more economically and socially vulnerable. Previous research consistently demonstrates the positive influence of household asset ownership on children's well-being. Using data from impoverished households caring for OVC in rural Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe, this study explores the influence of household asset ownership on OVC health vulnerability (HV) and social vulnerability (SV). Findings indicate that asset ownership is associated with significantly lower SV, in terms of school attendance and birth registration. Yet, assets do not emerge as a direct influence of OVC HV as measured by disease and chronic illness, although having a chronically ill adult in the household increases HV. These findings suggest that asset ownership, specifically a combination of fixed and movable assets, may offset the influence of other risk factors for children's SV."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      High rates of alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders have been noted in South Africa. Although a number of risk factors for alcohol use and abuse/dependence have been identified, there is a lack of information regarding risk factors for progression through the different stages of alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders. Our aim was to examine sociodemographic predictors of transition across stages of alcohol use, abuse and dependence (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition), and remission in the South African population.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A national probability sample of 4,315 adult South Africans was administered Version 3.0 of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found high rates of transition from regular alcohol use to abuse but low rates from alcohol abuse to dependence. All stages of alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders were more common in younger than in older respondents at comparable time points. Younger age (below 50), male gender, lower education, and having been a student were all associated with ever using alcohol, but only male gender was associated with the transition to regular use and abuse. Furthermore, younger age and late age at onset of alcohol abuse were associated with remission from abuse.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The importance of socio-demographic predictors appears to vary across stages of alcohol use and could be used to guide the precision of intervention strategies."

Eligible women were hazardous or harmful drinkers who scored between 7 and 19 (full range, 1-40) on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Intervention participants received 6 counseling sessions approximately monthly. The equal-attention control group received 6 nutrition sessions. Participants were followed for 6 and 12 months after the intervention, with at least 86% retention at both time points.

All but one of the studies reported the use of brief intervention strategies. Only seven studies contained information which allowed for the calculation of an effect size, and were therefore included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size for all outcomes combined was small but significant (g = 0.25, p < 0.001). The overall outcome for substance use was also small but significant (g = 0.24, p < 0.001). For studies with behavioural outcomes, the overall effect size reached significance (g = 0.28, p < 0.001).

            "abstract": "After Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean Basin has the second highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world. The number of HIV cases in the region is likely to increase significantly over the next decade due to patterns of sexual behaviour, drug use, migration, and the sociocultural practices and legal and religious taboos which serve as barriers to safe sex, as well as stigma, shame, and denial which preclude many issues from being openly discussed and addressed. Studying the HIV epidemic in the Caribbean Basin is difficult, as efforts to synthesize information are often hampered by a lack of uniformity and availability of surveillance data in many parts of the region. In addition, behavioural surveillance is limited, and interventions addressing the cultural context of Caribbean populations are few in number. Overall, the geographic, political, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the Caribbean underscores the complexity of understanding broader regional patterns of HIV infection and developing and implementing targeted and appropriate responses."

The goal of this study is to examine whether, marijuana use and problem drinking mediate the relationship between histories of childhood sexual, abuse (CSA) and HIV risk behaviors among heterosexual men. Participants were 1181 Black men aged, 18-45 from randomly selected neighborhoods in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Audio computer assisted, self-interviewing was used to assess self-reported childhood sexual abuse, problem drinking, and marijuana (dagga) use, and HIV sexual transmission behavior with steady and casual partners. Data were analyzed using multiple meditational modeling. There was more support for problem, drinking than marijuana use as a mediator. Findings suggest that problem drinking and marijuana use, mediate HIV sexual risk behaviors in men with histories of CSA. Focusing on men with histories of CSA, and their use of marijuana and alcohol may be particularly useful for designing strategies to reduce, HIV sexual transmission in South Africa."

            "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      The present review discusses current concepts of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART). As the HIV epidemic enters its fourth decade (the second decade of ART), research must address evolving factors in HAND pathogenesis. These include persistent systemic and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, aging in the HIV-infected brain, HIV subtype (clade) distribution, concomitant use of drugs of abuse, and potential neurotoxicity of ART drugs.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Although the severest form of HAND, HIV-associated dementia (HAD), is now rare due to ART, the persistence of milder, functionally important HAND forms persist in up to half of HIV-infected individuals. HAND prevalence may be higher in areas of Africa where different HIV subtypes predominate, and ART regimens that are more effective in suppressing CNS HIV replication can improve neurological outcomes. HAND are correlated with persistent systemic and CNS inflammation, and enhanced neuronal injury due to stimulant abuse (cocaine and methamphetamine), aging, and possibly ART drugs themselves.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Prevention and treatment of HAND requires strategies aimed at suppressing CNS HIV replication and effects of systemic and CNS inflammation in aging and substance-abusing HIV populations. Use of improved CNS-penetrating ART must be accompanied by evaluation of potential ART neurotoxicity."

This study aimed to evaluate the determinants of motherhood among FSWs, their sexual risks, and their engagement in health care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to July 2013 among FSWs in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The study used respondent-driven sampling for HIV testing and behavioral data collection. Predictors of motherhood and the association of motherhood and sex work dynamics were assessed separately using logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 696 women enrolled, the majority of participants (76.6%, n = 533) had at least 1 biological child. Mothers were more likely to have a nonpaying partner [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20 to 2.49], and significantly less likely to currently desire to conceive (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.33). Motherhood was predictive of having reduced condomless vaginal or anal sex with a new client [age-adjusted odds ratio (aaOR), 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.97] in the past 30 days, and increased condomless vaginal or anal sex with a nonpaying partner (aaOR, 1.49; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.96). Motherhood was prognostic of a higher likelihood of ever being tested for HIV (aaOR, 1.89; 95% CI: 1.55 to 2.31). Motherhood was predictive of reporting limited difficulty when accessing health services (aaOR, 0.15; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.34).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Motherhood is common among FSWs. The results indicate that FSWs who are mothers may have more exposure to health care because of seeking antenatal/perinatal services, presenting important opportunities for inclusion in the HIV continuum of care and to prevent vertical transmission."

            "abstract": "The economic contributions from tobacco cultivation and sales of products are often noted - jobs and incomes for farmers and employees, tax revenues for governments and enormous profits for cigarette companies, and for some countries, foreign exchange from net exports and foreign investment These are of course important. But set against these economic gains, there are also large economic losses that are less visible and less talked about, but also need to be counted. Many of these economic losses arise from the adverse health effects of tobacco use, but there are others too that affect a much wider group of citizens, and in particular, may exacerbate poverty among smokers and their families. This paper looks at the economic impact of tobacco use from the perspective of families, and at national level, for developing countries, providing a framework for considering the specific situations in Francophone African countries. Set against the economic benefits from tobacco, there are substantial economic costs. Annual health care costs are higher for smokers, and the burden of these costs falls on families, the public purse and employers/insurers. Earnings and productivity losses because of tobacco-related illness and premature death can be huge, and are borne by employers and employees. Illness is a major precipitating cause of poverty. Lit cigarettes cause thousands of fires and lost lives. Environmental damage to the soil from tobacco growing, pesticides and fertilizer, and deforestation resulting from firewood use to cure tobacco, can impose high economic losses. And there is the insidious, often overlooked cost of harm to the well-being of poor families whose scarce resources are used for cigarettes and other tobacco products instead of food and other necessities. We conclude that reducing tobacco use is good for health, good economics, and good for development"

A one-day national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004. A random and proportional probability sample design was used, based on the number of AIDS cases reported since 1999 by hospital wards. Weighted estimations were computed. HIV-infected adults (out/in-patients) were included after consent. Data were collected on demographic criteria, HIV, HCV and HBV infections, as well as on antiviral therapies. Overall, 1849 HIV-infected patients were included. The prevalence of anti-HCV or HCV RNA positivity (HCV co-infection) was 24.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21.3-27.6] and varied from 3.1% in men who had sex with men to 92.8% in injecting drug users (IDUs). The prevalence of positive HCV RNA was 17.0% [95% CI:14.7-19.4]. The prevalence of HBs antigen (Ag) or HBV DNA positivity was 7.0% [95% CI: 5.9-8.1] and varied with the continent of birth from 2.1% in Northern Africa to 10.8% in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of HIV-HCV-HBV co-infection was 1.6% [95% CI: 1.0-2.4], mostly IDUs (83.3%). A severe liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma) was diagnosed in 24.7% of the positive HCV RNA patients. This study confirmed the burden of HCV infection in French HIV-infected patients and described for the first time in France the epidemiological characteristics of HIV-HBV co-infection.

This manuscript reports the first medically documented cases of prolintane abuse in the United States.

The second patient, a healthy 26-year-old female, presented to the emergency department after intrauterine fetal death and spontaneous delivery. GC-MS revealed the presence of multiple drugs, including cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, hydrocodone, and prolintane. The medical and scientific communities should be aware of the potential for prolintane abuse because it may cause symptoms similar to those of the amphetamines but is not likely to be detected by a routine urine drug screen."

The number of new cases has been predicted as 564,000, corresponding to 398,000 in men and 166,000 in women. The geographic areas at highest risk are located in Eastern Asia, Middle Africa, and some countries of Western Africa. Changes in incidence among migrant populations underline the predominant role of environmental factors in the etiology of primary liver cancer. In high-risk countries, the early cases of primary liver cancer occur already at ages 20 and above, underlying the impact of viral exposures early in life. In countries at low risk, primary liver cancer is rare before the 50s, translating the impact of late exposures with moderate risks and long latency intervals. Sex ratios are typically between 2 and 4. The incidence of primary liver cancer is increasing in several developed countries including the United States, and the increase will likely continue for several decades. The trend has a dominant cohort effect related to exposures to hepatitis B and C viruses. The variability of primary liver cancer incidence is largely explained by the distribution and the natural history of the hepatitis B and C viruses. The attributable risk estimates for the combined effects of these infections account for well over 80% of liver cancer cases worldwide. Primary liver cancer is the first human cancer largely amenable to prevention using hepatitis B virus vaccines and screening of blood and blood products for hepatitis B and C viruses."

The minimum inhibitory concentration ranges for each antibiotic were as follows: ciprofloxacin (0.002-32 mg/L), ceftriaxone (≤0.002-0.064 mg/L), cefixime (≤0.016-0.38 mg/L), spectinomycin (2-24 mg/L), azithromycin (0.023-1 mg/L), penicillin (0.094-32 mg/L), and tetracycline (0.019-256 mg/L).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The high prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant gonorrhea observed in Kampala-based FSW emphasizes the need for sustainable gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs in Uganda and, in general, Africa."

            "abstract": "People who use drugs are at higher risk of HIV: directly through the sharing of injecting equipment, indirectly through associated risk behavior, and physiologically through the substances' impact on the immune system. Drug users, especially people who inject drugs (PWID) are a bridge to the general population. The treatment of drug addiction and provision of harm reduction interventions have impact on HIV transmission and incidence. Addiction treatment reduces the frequency of drug-related risky behaviors and enhances access and adherence to HIV treatment, resulting in fewer new infections. However, the drug policies of many African countries are punitive and hostile to harm reduction programs. These fuel criminalization of drug use and discrimination against the drug user thereby preventing individuals with drug addiction from accessing treatment programs. There is need to formulate policies aimed at protecting the rights of people with drug addiction and address the ethical aspects of treatment."

            "abstract": "Female sex workers (FSWs) bear a disproportionately large burden of HIV infection worldwide. Despite decades of research and programme activity, the epidemiology of HIV and the role that structural determinants have in mitigating or potentiating HIV epidemics and access to care for FSWs is poorly understood. We reviewed available published data for HIV prevalence and incidence, condom use, and structural determinants among this group. Only 87 (43%) of 204 unique studies reviewed explicitly examined structural determinants of HIV. Most studies were from Asia, with few from areas with a heavy burden of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, and eastern Europe. To further explore the potential effect of structural determinants on the course of epidemics, we used a deterministic transmission model to simulate potential HIV infections averted through structural changes in regions with concentrated and generalised epidemics, and high HIV prevalence among FSWs. This modelling suggested that elimination of sexual violence alone could avert 17% of HIV infections in Kenya (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1-31) and 20% in Canada (95% UI 3-39) through its immediate and sustained effect on non-condom use) among FSWs and their clients in the next decade. In Kenya, scaling up of access to antiretroviral therapy among FSWs and their clients to meet WHO eligibility of a CD4 cell count of less than 500 cells per μL could avert 34% (95% UI 25-42) of infections and even modest coverage of sex worker-led outreach could avert 20% (95% UI 8-36) of infections in the next decade. Decriminalisation of sex work would have the greatest effect on the course of HIV epidemics across all settings, averting 33-46% of HIV infections in the next decade. Multipronged structural and community-led interventions are crucial to increase access to prevention and treatment and to promote human rights for FSWs worldwide."

We used Respondent-driven Sampling in 2006, 2008 and 2010 to recruit men who have multiple female sexual partners. We performed several logistic regression analyses to compare HIV sexual risk behaviours, and HIV infection over time. Decreases in inconsistent condom use with main partners were not sustained in 2010. Inconsistent condom use with non-main partners, partner numbers and having one-time partners continued to decrease over time. Levels of alcohol consumption in 2010 reverted to a level higher than in 2006. Non-significant increases in HIV prevalence and reporting a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) were found. The decrease in numbers of and one-time sexual partners, and in inconsistent condom use with non-main partners augers well for decreasing HIV incidence among men in the study community, but might be offset by decreases in consistent condom use with main partners, and increases in alcohol consumption and STIs."

However, homeless people are, because of their insufficient accommodation, difficult to sample and monitor, which has limited previous studies. We aimed to assess registered psychiatric disorders, mortality, and predictors of mortality in the homeless shelter population in Denmark.\n## METHODS\nWe did a nationwide, prospective, register-based cohort study of homeless people aged 16 years and older who were registered in the Danish Homeless Register between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2009. We calculated the proportion of registered psychiatric disorders, overall and cause-specific standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and life expectancy. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to assess predictors of death.\n## FINDINGS\n32,711 homeless people (23,040 men and 9671 women) were included in the study population. 14,381 men (62·4%) and 5632 women (58·2%) had registered psychiatric disorders, and 11,286 men (49·0%) and 3564 women (36·9%) had a substance abuse diagnosis. During the study period, 3839 men (16·7%) and 951 women (9·8%) died. The overall SMR for men was 5·6 (95% CI 5·4-5·8) and for women was 6·7 (6·2-7·1), and external causes accounted for 1161 (27·9%) of 4161 deaths for which information on the cause was available. Remaining life expectancy at age 15-24 years was 21·6 years (95% CI 21·2-22·1) and 17·4 years (16·4-18·5) lower for homeless men and women, respectively, than the general population. Registered substance abuse disorder was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with no psychiatric contact registered (adjusted HR 1·4, 95% CI 1·3-1·5 for men; 1·7, 1·4-2·1 for women).\n## INTERPRETATION\nHealth problems are extensive in the homeless shelter population and there is an urgent need for more sustained efforts to reduce the high morbidity and mortality, especially from external causes.

Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery).

The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time.

In this paper we review the available literature to assess the social, economic and cultural factors that shape many fisherfolks' life-styles and that make them both vulnerable to infection and difficult to reach with anti-retroviral therapy and continued prevention efforts. We conclude from the available evidence that fisherfolk will be among those untouched by planned initiatives to increase access to anti-retroviral therapies in the coming years; a conclusion that might apply to other groups with similar socio-economic and sub-cultural attributes, such as other seafarers, and migrant-workers including small-scale miners, and construction workers."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among poor Black African and Coloured women in South Africa compounds their sexual risk for HIV. Given South Africa's history of ethnic disparities, ethnic differences in sex risk profiles may exist that should be taken into account when planning HIV risk reduction interventions. This paper aims to describe ethnic differences in AOD use and AOD-related sexual risks for HIV among vulnerable women from Cape Town, South Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional data on 720 AOD-using women (324 Black African; 396 Coloured) recruited from poor communities in Cape Town were examined for ethnic differences in AOD use and AOD-related sexual risk behavior.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ethnic differences in patterns of AOD use were found; with self-reported drug problems, heavy episodic drinking and methamphetamine use being most prevalent among Coloured women and cannabis use being most likely among Black African women. However, more than half of Black African women reported drug-related problems and more than a third tested positive for recent methamphetamine use. More than a third of women reported being AOD-impaired and having unprotected sex during their last sexual encounter. Coloured women had four-fold greater odds of reporting that their last sexual episode was AOD-impaired and unprotected than Black African women. In addition, close to one in two women reported that their sexual partner was AOD-impaired at last sex, with Coloured women having three-fold greater odds of reporting that their partner was AOD-impaired at last sex than Black African women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings support the need to develop and test AOD risk reduction interventions for women from both ethnic groups.

Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological basis of the conditions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medications for the treatment of people with both diagnoses.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Review authors ran complementary searches on EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH) (to August 2013). We located unpublished trials through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER service and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to August 2013). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue.Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We calculated categorical and continuous treatment effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment using a random-effects model with effect-size variability expressed using Chi(2) and I(2) heterogeneity statistics.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included five placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting.Study participants had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III- and DSM IV-diagnosed alcohol use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (two studies), social anxiety disorder (SAD; two studies) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; one study). Four trials assessed the efficacy of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine); one RCT investigated the efficacy of buspirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) partial agonist. Treatment duration lasted between eight and 24 weeks. Overall, 70% of participants included in the review were male.There was very low quality evidence for an effect of paroxetine on global clinical response to treatment, as assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I). Global clinical response was observed in more than twice as many participants with paroxetine than with placebo (57.7% with paroxetine versus 25.8% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.41; 2 trials, 57 participants). However, there was substantial uncertainty regarding the size of the effect of paroxetine due to the small number of studies providing data on clinically diverse patient samples. The second primary outcome measure was reduction of anxiety symptom severity. Although study investigators reported that buspirone (one trial) was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms over 12 weeks, no evidence of efficacy was observed for paroxetine (mean difference (MD) -14.70, 95% CI -33.00 to 3.60, 2 trials, 44 participants) and sertraline (one trial). Paroxetine appeared to be equally effective in reducing the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine in one RCT. The maximal reduction in anxiety disorder symptom severity was achieved after six weeks with paroxetine (two RCTs) and 12 weeks with buspirone (one RCT), with maintenance of medication efficacy extending to 16 with paroxetine and 24 weeks with buspirone. There was no evidence of an effect for any of the medications tested on abstinence from alcohol use or depression symptoms. There was very low quality evidence that paroxetine was well tolerated, based on drop-out due to treatment-emergent adverse effects. Nevertheless, levels of treatment discontinuation were high, with 43.1% of the participants in the studies withdrawing from medication treatment. Certain adverse effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence-base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication.Large, rigorously conducted RCTs would help supplement the small evidence-base for the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders. Further research on patient subgroups who may benefit from pharmacological treatment, as well as novel pharmacological interventions, is warranted."

South Africa is no exception although there is an emerging knowledge base, especially for paediatric burns. The current study describes the epidemiology of burn mortality across the lifespan in Cape Town (2.9 million inhabitants in 2001), one of the six South African metropolitan centres.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The distribution of burn mortality across socio-demographic groups and also their circumstances of occurrence were investigated using four year (2001 to 2004) surveillance data from the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System (n = 1024 cases).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Burn mortality occurred at a rate of 7.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 7.3-8.3). Males sustained fatal rates 2.2 times more than that for females (p < 0.001), with rates significantly higher in the 25 to 38 and 39 to 50 age groups than at other ages (p < 0.001). The greatest difference between male and female deaths was observed in the 25 to 38 year age group, when almost three male deaths occurred for every female one. The vast majority of fatal burns were registered as accidental and occurred in the home, either over the cold and wet months or during recreational periods over weekends and across the year. Alcohol intoxication was reported for the majority of those adults whose alcohol blood levels were tested (i.e. 52.6% of cases aged 16+ years).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Besides paediatric burns, the high prevalence and circumstances of occurrence of burns among middle age men are a source of concern. There are reasons to believe that this over-representation is a reflection of detrimental living conditions, life-style and poor socio-economic status. It is recommended that there be greater prioritisation of prevention activities that involve the control or management of kerosene heat sources, the provision of alternatives to flammable housing materials, and the implementation of strategies to reduce harmful drinking practices."

In this paper, we systematically review the literature on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior in southern Africa, the region of the world with the greatest HIV/AIDS burden. Studies show a consistent association between alcohol use and sexual risks for HIV infection. Among people who drink, greater quantities of alcohol consumption predict greater sexual risks than does frequency of drinking. In addition, there are clear gender differences in alcohol use and sexual risks; men are more likely to drink and engage in higher risk behavior whereas women's risks are often associated with their male sex partners' drinking. Factors that are most closely related to alcohol and sexual risks include drinking venues and alcohol serving establishments, sexual coercion, and poverty. Research conducted in southern Africa therefore confirms an association between alcohol use and sexual risks for HIV. Sexual risk reduction interventions are needed for men and women who drink and interventions should be targeted to alcohol serving establishments."

Demographic Health Surveys data (2006-2007) from 20 to 49 year old women in Namibia (n = 6,305), Swaziland (n = 2,786), and Zambia (n = 4,389) were analyzed using weighted marginal means and logistic regressions. OVC primary caregivers in Namibia and Swaziland had a lower mean AWI than other women in the same country. In Zambia, OVC primary caregivers had a lower mean AWI score than non-primary caregivers living with an OVC but a higher mean AWI score than non-OVC primary caregivers. In Swaziland and Zambia, even small increases in household wealth were associated with higher odds for being overweight regardless of women's caregiving status. Only in Namibia, OVC primary caregiving modified the effect of the previous association. Among Namibian OVC primary caregivers, women who had at least medium household wealth (4 or more AWI items) were more likely to be overweight than their poorest counterparts (0 or 1 AWI items). OVC primary caregivers are facing household wealth disparities as compared to other women from their communities. Future studies/interventions should consider using population-based approaches to reach women from every household wealth level to curb overweight in Swaziland and Zambia and to focus on specific household wealth characteristics that are associated with OVC primary caregivers' overweight status in Namibia."

We reviewed imprisonment, HIV prevalence, and the proportion of prisoners who are IDUs in 152 low-income and middle-income countries. Information on imprisonment was obtained for 142 countries. Imprisonment rates ranged from 23 per 100,000 population in Burkina Faso to 532 per 100,000 in Belarus and Russia. Information on HIV prevalence in prisons was found for 75 countries. Prevalence was greater than 10% in prisons in 20 countries. Eight countries reported prevalence of IDUs in prison of greater than 10%. HIV prevalence among IDU prisoners was reported in eight countries and was greater than 10% in seven of those. Evidence of HIV transmission in prison was found for seven low-income and middle-income countries. HIV is a serious problem for many countries, especially where injection drug use occurs. Because of the paucity of data available, the contribution of HIV within prison settings is difficult to determine in many low-income and middle-income countries.

However, alcohol abuse was indirectly associated with STIs through its association with multiple sexual partners.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings of alcohol abuse among physically and sexually violated women as well as the association between alcohol abuse and a history of symptoms of STIs and testing positive for STIs have significant public health implications. In sub-Saharan Africa, where women are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic screening for alcohol use should be part of comprehensive STIs and HIV prevention programs."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to establish the association between substance abuse and the sociodemographic characteristics of secondary school students. All the students of 17 randomly stratified public secondary schools in Nairobi were required to complete self-administered sociodemographic and the School Toolkit questionnaires in a cross-sectional descriptive survey. Nearly all (96.6%; 1252/1296) the students, comprising more males (62.5%) than females, completed all the items on the questionnaires. Their mean age was 17 years. Alcohol and cigarette use were common and began as early as before age 11. No significant correlation was found between fathers' education and substance abuse. Mothers' education had a significant but negative correlation. There were increased rates of substance abuse compared to past surveys. Campaigns against drug use should include those aged 11 years and should focus on education on the dangers of alcohol and tobacco use, as these are gateways to use of other drugs."

            "abstract": "The importance of perceived vulnerability to risk-reducing behaviors, including HIV testing, is fairly established, especially among youth in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, the majority of studies that examined this important relationship used cross-sectional data that inherently assume that perceived vulnerability does not change. While these studies have been useful, the assumption of perceived vulnerability as time invariant is a major flaw and has largely limited the practical usefulness of this variable in AIDS prevention and programing. Using longitudinal data and applying random-effects logit models, this study makes a major contribution to scholarship by examining if changes in perceived vulnerability associate with a change to test for HIV among 857 young people in Cape Town, South Africa. Results show that female youth who changed their risk perceptions were more likely to also change to test for HIV, but the effects were completely attenuated after controlling for theoretically relevant variables. No significant relationships were observed for males. Also, females who were virgins at wave 2 but had sex between waves were significantly more likely to have changed to test for HIV. Of most importance was that sexual behavior eliminated the effects of change in risk perceptions suggesting that a change in perception may have occurred as a result of changes in sexual behavior. AIDS prevention programs must pay particular attention to helping youth become aware of their vulnerability to HIV risks, especially as these have implications for risk-reducing behaviors, especially for females who are burdened."

Four subsidized low-cost housing communities were selected within the City of Cape Town in this cross-sectional survey. Structured interviews were administered in 336 dwellings on 173 plots. Data was obtained from 1,080 persons with a response rate of 100%. Almost all of the state-subsidized houses had one or more shacks in the backyard, increasing the occupation density and putting the municipal sanitation infrastructure under pressure. In 40% of main houses, one or more cases of diarrhea were reported during the two weeks preceding the survey, in contrast to 23% of shacks (p < 0.0007). Of the total group, 1.7% willingly disclosed that they were HIV positive, while 3.5% reported being tuberculosis (TB) positive. One of them reported having multiple drug-resistant TB. None of the HIV positive or TB positive persons was on any treatment. A reported 6.3% of the families admitted regularly eating only one meal per day, whereas 18.5% reported having only two meals per day. The shack dwellers had significantly higher education and employment status (p < 0.01), since they had to pay rent. Improvements in health intended by the rehousing process did not materialize for the recipients of low-cost housing in this study. The health vulnerability of individuals in these communities had considerable implications for the curative health services. Sanitation failures, infectious disease pressure, and environmental pollution in these communities represent a serious public health risk. The densification caused by backyard shacks, in addition, has municipal service implications and needs to be better managed. Urgent intervention is needed to allow the state-funded housing schemes to deliver the improved health that was envisaged at its inception."

            "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess prevalence and factors associated with binge drinking, cannabis use and tobacco use among ethnic Norwegians and ethnic minority adolescents in Oslo. We used data from a school-based cross-sectional survey of adolescents in junior- and senior high schools in Oslo, Norway. The participants were 10,934 adolescents aged 14-17 years, and just over half were females. The sample was comprised of 73.2 % ethnic Norwegian adolescents, 9.8 % 1st generation immigrants, and 17 % 2nd generation adolescents from Europe, the US, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Logistic regression models were applied for the data analyses. Age, gender, religion, parental education, parent-adolescent relationships, depressive symptoms and loneliness were covariates in the regression models. Ethnic Norwegian adolescents reported the highest prevalence of binge drinking (16.1 %), whereas the lowest prevalence was found among 2nd generation adolescents from Asia (2.9 %). Likewise, the past-year prevalence for cannabis use ranged from 10.6 % among 2nd generation Europeans and those from the US to 3.7 % among 2nd generation Asians. For daily tobacco use, the prevalence ranged from 12.9 % among 2nd generation Europeans and the US to 5.1 % among 2nd generation Asians. Ethnicity, age, gender, religion, parental education, and parent-adolescent relationships and mental health status were significantly associated with binge drinking, cannabis and tobacco use. These factors partly explained the observed differences between ethnic Norwegians and ethnic minority adolescents in the current study. There are significant differences in substance use behaviors between ethnic Norwegian and immigrant youth. Factors like age, gender, religion, parental education and relationships and mental health status might influence the relationship between ethnicity and substance abuse. The findings have implications for planning selective- as well as universal prevention interventions."

Street intercepts and purposive snowball sampling were used to recruit drug-using MSM. A rapid assessment was undertaken which included observation, mapping, key informant interviews and focus group interviews with MSM. Drug using key informants were tested for HIV. The use of drugs like crack cocaine, cannabis and methamphetamine to specifically facilitate sexual encounters was evident. Drugs led to inconsistent condom use and other high-risk sexual activities despite HIV risk knowledge being high. Many injecting drug-using MSM shared needles and reused equipment. Among MSM who agreed to HIV testing, one-third tested positive. Views about drug and HIV treatment and preventive services and their efficacy were mixed. Various barriers to accessing services were highlighted including homosexual stigmatization and availability of drugs in treatment facilities. Recommendations include addressing the gap between HIV-risk knowledge and practice, extending VCT services for MSM, increasing the visibility of drug abuse services within communities, addressing concerns about drug availability in treatment centers as well as reintegration issues and the need for after-care services, reducing stigmatization in drug and HIV services for MSM and finally, strengthening the link between drug treatment services and HIV prevention by integrating HIV/drug-related risks into HIV prevention efforts and HIV risks into drug use prevention efforts."

            "abstract": "The burden of disease due to tobacco for each country will depend on the prevalence of tobacco use and the duration of the epidemic. Given that the tobacco epidemic in West African Francophone countries is relatively recent, the burden of disease due to tobacco use is currently low. However, tobacco related burden of disease in Francophone West African countries is increasing as the number of smokers continues to increase and the population has been smoking for a longer period of time. If the current trends continue, West African countries will be suffering the massive consequences of tobacco use in two or three decades. Apart from the classical health consequences of tobacco consumption such as certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, there are some conditions of special importance in low income African countries such as the increased risk of tuberculosis infection and mortality amongst smokers, low birth weight for babies of smoking mothers, and tobacco consumption associated malnutrition especially amongst women. Furthermore, developing countries, with inadequate resources and other important health issues, cannot afford the costs of the chronic degenerating conditions caused by tobacco use, as these are very expensive to treat. Tobacco control in Francophone African countries is still deficient Human and financial resources which are often scarce in West African countries are dedicated to other health issues since tobacco is normally not amongst the public health priorities. Legislation in Francophone African countries is limited and not adequately enforced. A major reason for governments' inaction on tobacco is their fear of creating unemployment and loss of revenue from tobacco taxes. This fear is derived mainly from the arguments of the tobacco industry. Apart from lobbying governments, the tobacco industry uses all kinds of strategies to market their products in these countries and faces practically no barriers to their business in these countries. It is essential that Francophone African countries take immediate action and develop and implement comprehensive multisectoral tobacco control programmes. These programmes must be integrated into the existing public health programmes and make use of existing infrastructure and resources in order to stop the tobacco epidemic from expanding. In February 2005, the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) entered into force. Most Francophone African countries have signed the treaty thus expressing their intention to become Parties in the future. WHO urges these countries to become Parties as soon as possible and to implement the WHO FCTC provisions in order to control the tobacco epidemic. WHO in turn will provide guidelines and assistance for the process of becoming Parties to the treaty and implementing tobacco control measures outlined therein."

Prisoners and officers in 3 of the 46 prisons in Ghana were surveyed from May 2004 to May 2005. Subjects voluntarily completed a risk-factor questionnaire and provided blood specimens for unlinked anonymous testing for the presence of antibodies to HIV, HCV and Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg). Almost 16% (3770) of the total of 23,980 prison inmates in Ghana were eligible, and 281 (7.5%) of those eligible took part, whilst almost 23% (1120) of the total of 4910 prison officers were eligible, and 82 (7.3%) of those eligible took part.

Many African countries lack useful data on the size of female sex worker populations to inform national HIV programmes. A female sex worker size estimation exercise using three different venue-based methodologies was conducted among female sex workers in all provinces of Rwanda in August 2010. The female sex worker national population size was estimated using capture-recapture and enumeration methods, and the multiplier method was used to estimate the size of the female sex worker population in Kigali. A structured questionnaire was also used to supplement the data. The estimated number of female sex workers by the capture-recapture method was 3205 (95% confidence interval: 2998-3412). The female sex worker size was estimated at 3348 using the enumeration method. In Kigali, the female sex worker size was estimated at 2253 (95% confidence interval: 1916-2524) using the multiplier method. Nearly 80% of all female sex workers in Rwanda were found to be based in the capital, Kigali.

Despite the large body of published information regarding the biological and clinical significance of retroviral coinfections, controversy throughout several decades of research was fueled by several flawed epidemiologic studies and anecdotal reports that were not always supported with ample statistical and scientific evidence. However, the growing consensus obtained from recent systematic and well-devised research provides support for at least three conclusions: (1) HIV-1 and HTLV-1 coinfections are often seen in the context of patients with high CD4(+) T cell counts presenting with lymphoma or neurological complications; (2) HIV-1 and HTLV-2 coinfections have been linked in some cases to a \"long term nonprogressor\" phenotype; and (3) differential function and/or overexpression of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Tax proteins likely play a pivotal role in the clinical and immunologic manifestations of HIV/HTLV-1 and -2 coinfections.

Papsak drinkers were more likely to have CAGE scores of 2 or more than drinkers of other alcoholic beverages (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8, 95% CI [1.4, 5.5]). Increasing levels of socioeconomic deprivation predicted both current drinking and preferred papsak consumption.

By region, Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the largest IDU prevalence (median 0.65%) (min 0.3%; max 2.2%; Q1 0.39%; Q3 1.32%) [corrected] followed by Asia and Pacific: 0.24% (min 0.004%; max 1.47%; Q1 0.14%; Q3 1.47%) [corrected] In the Middle East and Africa the median value equals 0.2% (min 0.0003%; max 0.35%; Q1 0.11%; Q3 0.23%) [corrected] and in Latin America and the Caribbean: 0.12% (min 0.11%; max 0.69%; Q1 0.04%; Q3 0.13%) [corrected] Subnational areas with the highest IDU prevalence among adults (8-14.9%) were Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Balti (Moldova), Astrakhan, Barnadul, Irtkustk, Khabarovsk, Kaliningrad, Naberezhnyje Chelny, Penza, Togliatti, Volgograd, Voronez, and Yaroslavl (Russia), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Ashgabad (Turkmenistan), Ivano-Frankivsk and Pavlograd (Ukraine) and Imphal, Manipur (India). 66% (297/447) of the IDU estimates were reported without technical information. Data on the IDU age/gender distributions are also scarce or unavailable for many countries. In 11 Eastern European and Central Asian countries the age group <or=20-29 represented >50% of the total. The proportion of IDU men was 70%-90% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and there was a marked absence of data on women outside this region.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Unfortunately data on IDU prevalence available to national and international policymakers is of an unknown and probably yet to be tested quality. This study provide baseline figures but steps need to be taken now to improve the reporting and assessment of these critical data."

A total of 644 young (<30 years) injection drug users completed a baseline interview and were enrolled in a prospective cohort study, known as the UFO (\"U Find Out\") Study, from November 1997 to December 2007. Using the National Death Index, the authors identified 38 deaths over 4,167 person-years of follow-up, yielding a mortality rate of 9.1 (95% confidence interval: 6.6, 12.5) per 1,000 person-years. This mortality rate was 10 times that of the general population. The leading causes of death were overdose (57.9%), self-inflicted injury (13.2%), trauma/accidents (10.5%), and injection drug user-related medical conditions (13.1%). Mortality incidence was significantly higher among those who reported injecting heroin most days in the past month (adjusted hazard ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 24.3). The leading cause of death in this group was overdose, and primary use of heroin was the only significant risk factor for death observed in the study. These findings highlight the continued need for public health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this population in order to reduce premature deaths.\n"

In 1992 the prevalence rate was 3.9%. However in 12 years, by 2004, the prevalence rate had reached 42.6%. This article explores some of the traditional cultural practices and experiences that increase Swazi women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The traditional cultural practices fall into four categories: (1) socialization and the roles of women, (2) the minority status of women, (3) the practice of a dowry, and (4) the wife as an inheritance. The women's experiences include the Swazi men's beliefs in the virginity cure myth, the women's extreme poverty, and the Swazi men who are migrant workers in neighboring states. This article concludes with recommendations for public policy and for future research within the context of Swazi culture."

Reliability was fair for the SAMISS overall (κ = 0.39, CI(95) 0.29-0.49, P < 0.01), but was higher for the substance abuse component compared to the mental illness component. Reliability for the IHDS between counsellors and nurses was slight (κ = 0.11, CI(95) 0.00-0.27, P < 0.02).

The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria.

In order to gain an estimate of the extent of long-term traumatisation among political activists who experienced torture and abuse in detention during the apartheid era in South Africa, a sample of 148 survivors of such experiences were recruited in a cross-sectional study and asked to complete the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), the Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the Trauma Symptoms section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). The proportions of the sample that scored above the clinical cut-points on these measures were calculated. On the HSCL, 14.19% of the sample scored above the cut-point for clinical significance of 44; on the IES, 17.57% scored above the clinical cut-point of 44; and on the HTQ, 37.83% scored above the cut-point of 75. Moreover, the sample's mean scores were significantly higher than the cut-point for clinically significant distress on the HSCL (p < 0.001); significantly lower than the cut-point for severe traumatisation on the IES (p < 0.001); and non-significantly lower than the cut-point for clinically significant traumatisation on the HTQ (p = 0.074). These results are considered in terms of current theoretical debates on the relevance and applicability of posttraumatic stress disorder as a circumscribed nosological entity in developing countries that are in the process of coming to terms with a history of political conflict."

These very large and productive groups of the population are exposed to various sexual and reproductive health risks. The aim of this study was to assess exposure to Sexually Explicit Materials (SEM) and factors associated with exposure among preparatory school students in Hawassa city, Southern Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional institution based study involving 770 randomly selected youth students of preparatory schools at Hawassa city.

Data was entered by EPI INFO version 3.5.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software packages. The result was displayed using descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Statistical association was done for independent predictors (at p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Result and discussion:\n        \n      \n      About 750 students were participated in this study with a response rate of 97.4%. Among this, about 77.3% of students knew about the presence of SEM and most of the respondents 566(75.5%) were watched SEM films/movies and 554(73.9%) were exposed to SE texts. The overall exposure to SEM in school youths was 579(77.2%). Among the total respondents, about 522(70.4%) claimed as having no open discussion on sexual issues with in their family. Furthermore, About 450 (60.0%) respondents complained for having no sexual and reproductive health education at their school.

However, there still remain some serious concerns. Most people become sexually active during adolescence. Premarital sexual activity is common and is on the rise worldwide. Rates are highest in sub Saharan Africa, where more than half of girls aged 15-19 are sexually experienced. Millions of adolescents are bearing children, in sub-Saharan Africa. More than half of women give birth before age 20. The need for improved health and social services aimed at adolescents, including reproductive health services, is being increasingly recognized throughout the world. Approximately 85 % of world adolescents live in developing countries. Each year, up to 100 million becomes infected with a curable sexually transmitted disease (STI). About 40 % of all new global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur among 15-24 year olds; with recent estimates of 7000 infected each day. These health risks are influenced by many interrelated factors, such as expectations concerning early marriage and sexual relationships, access to education and employment, gender inequities, sexual violence, and the influence of mass media and popular culture. Furthermore, many adolescents lack strong stable relationships with parents or other adults whom they can talk to about their reproductive health concerns. Despite these challenges, programs that meet the information and service needs of adolescents can make a real difference. Successful programs help young people develop life-planning skill, respect the needs and concerns of young people, involve communities in their efforts, and provide respectful and confidential clinical services. Accordingly, the government of Ethiopia now works on improving adolescent's health as one part of MDG (Goal VI-halting transmission of HIV/AIDS, STI, and other communicable diseases) with a focus on adolescents, since they are most affected population. This finding, therefore, will benefit the government to partly evaluate the goal achieving through adolescents exposure status to sexually explicit materials and improvement of sexual issues free talk with in school with class mates and their family at home. For that matter, we authors decided to publish this finding in BMC Reproductive Health Journal so that on line access will be easy to all governing bodies that they use to re-plan their strategies for better product of plan. Moreover, Researchers, Practitioners, policy makers, Students, school leaders and professionals will also benefit from this finding for their future researches references, knowledge gain and practice."

When compared with the general population, the age-standardized mortality rate ratio for those imprisoned was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.2, 3.4) for men and 7.6 (6.9, 8.3) for women. Further adjustment for an area measure of deprivation accounted for part but not all of this excess risk [adjusted rate ratio 2.3 (2.2, 2.4) and 5.7 (5.1, 6.2) for men and women, respectively]. Relative risks were highest for drug and alcohol related causes, suicide and homicide and were markedly higher among women than men. Out of prison deaths were most frequent in the first 2 weeks after release from prison. Mortality rates were lower in those with longer total duration in prison and higher in those with multiple short episodes in prison.\n## CONCLUSION\nPeople who have been imprisoned in Scotland experience substantial excess mortality from a range of causes that is only partly explained by deprivation. The association of increased mortality with multiple periods in prison and the concentration of deaths in the early period after prison release both have implications for policy and practice.\n"

The commonest disorder being substance and alcohol use disorders (42.0%). 23.3% of prisoners were diagnosed with current psychotic, bipolar, depressive and anxiety disorders. 46.1% were diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. The majority of prisoners diagnosed as having an Axis 1 disorder in this study, were neither diagnosed nor treated in prison.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is a high prevalence of mental disorders among prisoners in a prison population in Durban, South Africa. The majority of these prisoners are untreated in prison, related to non detection of the mental disorder. Greater mental health awareness and provision of mental health services focusing on staff training programmes to detect mental illnesses are needed and further research is recommended throughout South Africa."

Important criteria for prioritising research were burden of disease, social justice, and availability of funds. Stakeholder groups differed in the importance they gave to the personal interest of researchers as a criterion for prioritising research. Researchers' and stakeholders' priorities were consistent with burden of disease estimates, however suicide was underprioritised compared with its burden. Researchers' and stakeholders' priorities were also largely congruent with the researchers' projects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of this first ever conducted survey of researchers and stakeholders regarding research priorities in mental health suggest that it should be possible to develop consensus at regional and international levels regarding the research agenda that is necessary to support health system objectives in LAMI countries."

            "abstract": "While alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (AIPD) is well recognised, relatively little is known about the condition. We undertook a review of the literature to identify studies on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying neurobiology and treatment of AIPD. Few prospective studies have been conducted on AIPD. Recent advances have focussed on epidemiological, phenomenological, neuro-imaging, treatment and outcome issues. Current evidence suggests AIPD can be clinically distinguished from alcohol-withdrawal delirium and schizophrenia. The disorder may be more common than previously recognised depending on the inclusion criteria applied. AIPD is associated with high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, high re-hospitalization and mortality rates and suicidal behaviour. Concurrent dysregulation of several neurotransmitter systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of hallucinations in alcohol dependence, and neuro-imaging studies suggest perfusion abnormalities to various brain regions. Antipsychotic treatment remains the preferred treatment for AIPD. The prognosis appears less favourable than previously believed, yet usually good when abstinence can be maintained."

To strengthen the evidence base of future HIV prevention and sexual health programmes during international sporting events, we monitored the supply and demand of female sex work in the weeks before, during and after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      We conducted three telephonic surveys of female sex workers advertising online and in local newspapers, in the last week of May, June and July 2010. The overall response rate was 73.4% (718/978). The number of sex workers advertising online was 5.9% higher during the World Cup than before. The client turnover rate did not change significantly during (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 1.05; 95%CI: 0.90-1.23) or after (aRR = 1.06; 95%CI: 0.91-1.24) the World Cup.

The HIV epidemic in WCA appears to have distinct dynamics compared to the rest of SSA, being more concentrated among key populations such as female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID) and clients of FSWs. To explore the epidemiology of HIV in the region, a systematic review of HIV literature among key populations in WCA was conducted since the onset of the HIV epidemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the databases PubMed, CINAHL and others for peer-reviewed articles regarding FSWs, MSM and PWID in 24 countries with no date restriction. Inclusion criteria were sensitive and focused on inclusion of any HIV prevalence data among key populations.

There were 60 articles characterizing the burden of disease among FSWs, eight for their clients, one for both, six for MSM and one for PWID. The pooled HIV prevalence among FSWs was 34.9% (n=14,388/41,270), among their clients was 7.3% (n=435/5986), among MSM was 17.7% (n=656/3714) and among PWID from one study in Nigeria was 3.8% (n=56/1459).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The disproportionate burden of HIV among FSWs appears to be consistent from the beginning of the HIV epidemic in WCA. While there are less data for other key populations such as clients of FSWs and MSM, the prevalence of HIV is higher among these men compared to other men in the region. There have been sporadic reports among PWID, but limited research on the burden of HIV among these men and women. These data affirm that the HIV epidemic in WCA appears to be far more concentrated among key populations than the epidemics in Southern and Eastern Africa. Evidence-based HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes in WCA should focus on engaging populations with the greatest burden of disease in the continuum of HIV care."

Asia is the region with the second highest attributable fraction of the HIV epidemic after sub-Saharan Africa. This review synthesises studies that depict the barriers and facilitators encountered by sex workers in Asia when negotiating consistent condom use. A total of 18 studies published between January 1989 and May 2015 were included in the review. Data were extracted, critically appraised and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Individual-level factors related to sex workers' knowledge, perception and power, as well as interpersonal-level factors that encompassed dynamics with clients and peer-related factors, presented as both barriers and facilitators to sex workers' condom negotiation process. In addition, the structural environment of sex work, access to resources, poverty, stigma, the legal environment and the role of media were also identified as factors in influencing the condom negotiation process of sex workers. A multisectoral interventional approach that addresses the multilevel barriers encountered by sex workers in condom negotiation is needed. Awareness of safe-sex practice should be collectively enhanced among sex workers, clients and brothel managers."

            "abstract": "Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is characterised by the presence of immune responses to previously acquired Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection without clinical evidence of active tuberculosis (TB). Here we report evidence-based guidelines from the World Health Organization for a public health approach to the management of LTBI in high risk individuals in countries with high or middle upper income and TB incidence of <100 per 100 000 per year. The guidelines strongly recommend systematic testing and treatment of LTBI in people living with HIV, adult and child contacts of pulmonary TB cases, patients initiating anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment, patients receiving dialysis, patients preparing for organ or haematological transplantation, and patients with silicosis. In prisoners, healthcare workers, immigrants from high TB burden countries, homeless persons and illicit drug users, systematic testing and treatment of LTBI is conditionally recommended, according to TB epidemiology and resource availability. Either commercial interferon-gamma release assays or Mantoux tuberculin skin testing could be used to test for LTBI. Chest radiography should be performed before LTBI treatment to rule out active TB disease. Recommended treatment regimens for LTBI include: 6 or 9 month isoniazid; 12 week rifapentine plus isoniazid; 3-4 month isoniazid plus rifampicin; or 3-4 month rifampicin alone."

There are relatively few studies of mortality among injecting drug users (IDU) in Australia. We aimed to provide data comparable to those reported internationally on the rate of mortality among IDU in Australia. We retrospectively examined mortality among participants (N=220) from the first Australian cohort study of IDU by linking coded personal identifier records with a national death register. The overall mortality rate among those followed-up was 0.83 per 100 PY (95% CI, 0.56-1.21 per 100 PY). This rate is lower than those reported internationally but comparable to the limited Australian data from other cohorts of IDU. Mortality was higher among males, most common among those aged in their early thirties and drug-related mortality occurred typically after substantial injecting careers. Extensive experience of incarceration (>or=3 times) was associated with increased risk of mortality. These results suggest that rates of mortality among Australian IDU may be lower than those reported internationally, with low HIV prevalence and Australia's long-held harm reduction framework potentially contributing to this result. Further studies using defined cohorts followed over time are needed to examine long-term outcomes among IDU in Australia.\n"

The present work tested the associations between stigma and health-related outcomes among people with HIV who inject drugs in Kohtla-Järve, Estonia and St. Petersburg, Russia. These two cities share some of the highest rates of HIV outside of sub-Saharan Africa, largely driven by injection drug use, but Estonia has implemented harm reduction services more comprehensively. People who inject drugs were recruited using respondent-driven sampling; those who indicated being HIV-positive were included in the present sample (n = 381 in St. Petersburg; n = 288 in Kohtla-Järve). Participants reported their health information and completed measures of internalized HIV stigma, anticipated HIV stigma, internalized drug stigma, and anticipated drug stigma. Participants in both locations indicated similarly high levels of all four forms of stigma. However, stigma variables were more strongly associated with health outcomes in Russia than in Estonia. The St. Petersburg results were consistent with prior work linking stigma and health. Lower barriers to care in Kohtla-Järve may help explain why social stigma was not closely tied to negative health outcomes there. Implications for interventions and health policy are discussed."

This study aimed to assess the determinants of smoking initiation and susceptibility to future smoking among a population of high school school students in Lagos, Nigeria.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Baseline data from an intervention study designed to assess the effect of an anti-smoking awareness program on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of adolescents was analyzed. The survey was carried out in six randomly selected public and private secondary schools in local government areas in Lagos state, Nigeria.

The estimated prevalence rate in the west and center of the region, however, has remained stable at 0.2%. The HIV epidemics in Eastern Europe and Central Asia are typically driven by unsafe drug injection and by onward transmission to the sexual partners of people who inject drugs. In the western part of the region, the epidemic remains concentrated among men who have sex with men and migrants from countries with generalized epidemics. Means of preventing and fighting HIV should, first and foremost, be directed to those parts of the population that are most exposed to the risk of the infection. Proceeding from the data presented, recommendations are given for ways of decreasing HIV prevalence in the region, such as promoting dialogue and awareness among multistakeholders, including policy makers, donors, and population groups most exposed to the infection."

Although the prominently known routes of initiation into drug use are; by contact between potential users and individuals already using the drugs and self initiation, the role played by a special class of individuals referred to as drug lords can not be ignored. We consider a simple but useful compartmental model of drug use that accounts for the contribution of contagion and drug lords to initiation into drug use and drug epidemics. We show that the model has a drug free equilibrium when the threshold parameter R0 is less that unity and a drug persistent equilibrium when R0 is greater than one. In our effort to ascertain the effect of policing in the control of drug epidemics, we include a term accounting for law enforcement. Our results indicate that increased law enforcement greatly reduces the prevalence of substance abuse. In addition, initiation resulting from presence of drugs in circulation can be as high as seven times higher that initiation due to contagion alone."

Detailed documentation of physical features indicates that FAS children in South Africa have characteristics similar to those elsewhere: poor growth and development, facial and limb dysmorphology, and lower intellectual functioning. Frequent, severe episodic drinking of beer and wine is common among mothers and fathers of FAS children. Their lives are characterized by serious familial, social and economic challenges, compared with controls. Heavy episodic maternal drinking is significantly associated with negative outcomes of children in the area of nonverbal intelligence but even more so in verbal intelligence, behavior and overall dysmorphology (physical anomalies).

Using weekly data from the period 2002-2006 for the country's nine provinces, non-linear auto-regression exogenous (NARX) regression models were fitted to explain variations in RTFs and to assess the degree to which the variations between the provinces were associated with the temporal variations in risk factors. Results suggest that a proportion of the variations in weekly RTFs could be explained by factors other than the size of the province population, with both temporal and between-province residual variance remaining after accounting for the modelled risks.

Pellagra is caused by deficiency of niacin (nicotinic acid) and/or its tryptophan (Trp) precursor and is compounded by B vitamin deficiencies. Existence on maize or sorghum diets and loss of or failure to isolate niacin from them led to pellagra incidence in India, South Africa, Southern Europe in the 18th century and the USA following the civil war. Pellagra is also induced by drugs inhibiting the conversion of Trp to niacin and by conditions of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Skin photosensitivity in pellagra may be due to decreased synthesis of the Trp metabolite picolinic acid → zinc deficiency → decreased skin levels of the histidine metabolite urocanic acid and possibly also increased levels of the haem precursor 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) and photo-reactive porphyrins. Depression in pellagra may be due to a serotonin deficiency caused by decreased Trp availability to the brain. Anxiety and other neurological disturbances may be caused by 5-ALA and the Trp metabolite kynurenic acid. Pellagra symptoms are resolved by niacin, but aggravated mainly by vitamin B6. Alcohol dependence can induce or aggravate pellagra by inducing malnutrition, gastrointestinal disturbances and B vitamin deficiencies, inhibiting the conversion of Trp to niacin and promoting the accumulation of 5-ALA and porphyrins. Alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy should be managed with niacin, other B vitamins and adequate protein nutrition. Future studies should explore the potential role of 5-ALA and also KA in the skin and neurological disturbances in pellagra."

By contrast, on the Proximity Judgment task, the exposed children recruited additional parietal pathways involving the right and left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus, which may entail verbally mediated recitation of numbers and/or subtraction to assess relative numerical distances.

Robust unit cost estimates are essential for the better use of resources, and information on the heterogeneity in the unit cost of delivering HIV services across facilities - both within and across countries - is critical to identifying and addressing inefficiencies. There is limited information on the unit cost of HIV prevention services in sub-Saharan Africa and information on the heterogeneity within and across countries and determinants of this variation is even more scarce. The \"Optimizing the Response in Prevention: HIV Efficiency in Africa\" (ORPHEA) study aims to add to the empirical body of knowledge on the cost and technical efficiency of HIV prevention services that decision makers can use to inform policy and planning.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      ORPHEA is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in 304 service delivery sites in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zambia to assess the cost, cost structure, cost variability, and the determinants of efficiency for four HIV interventions: HIV testing and counselling (HTC), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), and HIV prevention for sex workers. ORPHEA collected information at three levels (district, facility, and individual) on inputs to HIV prevention service production and their prices, outputs produced along the cascade of services, facility-level characteristics and contextual factors, district-level factors likely to influence the performance of facilities as well as the demand for HIV prevention services, and information on process quality for HTC, PMTCT, and VMMC services.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      ORPHEA is one of the most comprehensive studies on the cost and technical efficiency of HIV prevention interventions to date.

The Yerelon clinic in Burkina Faso has provided combined preventative and therapeutic services, including anti-retroviral therapy (ART), for FSWs since 1998, with evidence suggesting it has decreased HIV prevalence and incidence in this group. No data exists on the costs of such a combined prevention and treatment intervention for FSW. This study aims to determine the mean cost of service provision per patient year for FSWs attending the Yerelon clinic, and identifies differences in costs between patient groups.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Field-based retrospective cost analyses were undertaken using top-down and bottom-up costing approaches for 2010. Expenditure and service utilisation data was collated from primary sources. Patients were divided into groups according to full-time or occasional sex-work, HIV status and ART duration. Patient specific service use data was extracted. Costs were converted to 2012 US$. Sensitivity analyses considered removal of all research costs, different discount rates and use of different ART treatment regimens and follow-up schedules.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Using the top-down costing approach, the mean annual cost of service provision for FSWs on or off ART was US$1098 and US$882, respectively. The cost for FSWs on ART reduced by 29%, to US$781, if all research-related costs were removed and national ART monitoring guidelines were followed. The bottom-up patient-level costing showed the cost of the service varied greatly across patient groups (US$505-US$1117), primarily due to large differences in the costs of different ART regimens. HIV-negative women had the lowest annual cost at US$505.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Whilst FSWs may require specialised services to optimise their care and hence, the public health benefits, our study shows that the cost of ART provision within a combined prevention and treatment intervention setting is comparable to providing ART to other population groups in Africa."

            "abstract": "According to the latest 2014 UNAIDS report, which was based on the 2012 South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence & Behavior Survey, there were between 6.3 and 6.4 million HIV infected people in South Africa. Although the number of new infections appears to have declined in the past 5 years, 370,000 new infections were still estimated to occur in 2013. Young, black women were most at risk with a very high incidence of 4.5%. Of the infected, only 2.2 million were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), meaning that the majority living with HIV was not virally suppressed and thus at risk of infecting somebody else. Eight out of 10 South Africans still believed they were at low risk of HIV infection. Condom use was declining and multiple sexual partnerships were increasing. These findings raise questions about whether current control efforts are properly addressing the drivers of the epidemic. Recent behavior change campaigns target intergenerational sex and blame the high transmission rates among girls on 'sugar daddies' thus diverting attention away from common risk behaviors in the general population. Reduction of new infections is crucial. Much of the current global HIV debate focuses on treatment as prevention (TasP) - an approach hampered by resource problems and the fact that most people are infected by someone who is unaware of his/her HIV status. This raises doubts TasP alone is a sufficient and sustainable solution to prevention. It is not enough to mainly treat those already infected; there is also a need to allocate more resources to address the root causes - ART plus norm and behavior change. We thus propose increased attention to common sexual and social norms and behaviors. New and harmful community norms are one of the major drivers of the ongoing spread of HIV among young women and men in black communities. Addressing sexual risk behaviors and the gender and sexual norms that influence them to scale requires ensuring communities are provided with skills to reflect on the individual and social mechanisms by which these risk behaviors are generated and normalized. To achieve this, partnerships must be formed between political leaders, researchers, technocrats and affected communities. Considering the severity of the epidemic and the continued high incidence of HIV, it is high time to review the current strategy to HIV control in South Africa and allocate more resources to approaches that emphasize community driven norm and behavior change."

Between Jan 2006 and Dec 2007, cases were identified through the multiple-center register system and followed until Dec 2008 for date and cause of death on the Taiwan national mortality database.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nStandardized mortality ratios within one year of starting MMT were calculated as a ratio of actual versus expected numbers of deaths in the general population in Taiwan. Cox regression models were fitted to estimate the effects of gender, age, education and marital status as well as heroin related behaviors.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, 256 cases died, 67 through suicide. The mortality rate (per 100 person-years) in the first year of all-cause and suicide was 1.71 and 0.45 respectively, representing 7.5- and 18.4-fold age- and gender-standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the general population. Besides, the mortality rate in the first year of overdoses, murder, HIV, somatic was 0.19, 0.02, 0.07, and 0.75 respectively, representing 68.4-, 27.7-, 76.8-, and 4.3-fold SMR increases to the general population. Older age and unemployment were independent risk factors for mortality. Females had higher standardized mortality ratio than males for suicide and all-cause mortality.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nResults showed higher risk of suicide and other-cause mortality among heroin users in MMT than general population. Suicide is an important contributor to overall excess mortality among heroin users in MMT, and especially among women. Suicide prevention and physical health monitoring are important components of MMT programs.\n"

As parental death often leaves youth with altered emotional and physical resources, substance use may be greater among orphaned adolescents. Utilizing data from a household survey of 15-24 year old South Africans (n = 11,904), multivariable models were fitted to examine the association of factors from five domains with alcohol and drug use, and to compare substance use among orphaned versus non-orphaned youth. Results showed that factors from individual, family, and community domains were most associated with substance use. Compared with non-orphans, paternal and double orphaned males were more likely to have consumed alcohol, and paternally orphaned females had significantly greater odds of having used drugs. Findings confirm that some sub-groups of orphaned youth are at increased risk of substance use and families and communities may be influential in moderating this risky behavior."

Gender inequality issues continue to drive the HIV epidemic in South Africa, where Black African women bear the greatest HIV burden. Limited access to services; little capacity to negotiate sex and condom use; and other legal, social, and economic inequities make women highly vulnerable to HIV infection. Behavioral interventions have been shown to decrease risk behaviors, but they have been less successful in reducing HIV incidence. Conversely, biomedical prevention strategies have proven to be successful in reducing HIV incidence, but require behavioral interventions to increase uptake and adherence. Consequently, there is a need for integrated approaches that combine biomedical and behavioral interventions. Effective combination prevention efforts should comprise biomedical, behavioral, and structural programming proven in randomized trials that focuses on the driving forces and key populations at higher risk of HIV infection and transmission.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This prospective, geographically clustered randomized field experiment is enrolling participants into two arms: a control arm that receives standard HIV testing and referral for treatment; and an intervention arm that receives an evidence-based, woman-focused behavioral intervention that emphasizes risk reduction and retention, the Women's Health CoOp.

Forty-six articles were reviewed. The review describes the heterogeneity of theoretical frameworks employed, as well as the limited ability of any one to adequately explain the relationship between high school dropout and substance use. A refinement of the many confounding and mediating variables into coherent conceptual categories would aid more robust theory building and theory integration. In spite of differences in dropout definitions and diverse measures of substance use across studies, the main findings point to a largely consistent relationship between dropping out of high school and substance use. However, socially disadvantaged and poor persons, dropouts, and drug users are over-represented in some of the loss to follow-up groups in longitudinal studies surveyed. More rigorous mechanisms to retain participants in longitudinal studies should be employed. Suggestions for future research include comparisons between urban and rural populations, employing qualitative research methods, and research in developing countries, which have the least favourable school outcomes and a dearth of research on high school dropout."

Given the media attention on sex work, future sporting events offer strategic opportunities to implement services for sex workers and their clients, especially as health service utilisation might decrease in this period."

            "abstract": "Accurate prevalence data on heroin use, that points to where problems exist and the extent of these problems, is necessary to guide the formulation of effective substance abuse policy and practice. The purpose of this study was to provide surveillance information about the nature and extent of heroin use in South Africa. Data were collected from 41 specialist alcohol and other drug treatment centres in two metropolitan sites (Cape Town and Gauteng Province) between January 1997 and December 2003. Treatment indicators point to a substantial increase in heroin use over time. Most heroin users in treatment tend to be white, male, between the ages of 21 and 24 years and tend to smoke rather than inject the substance. However, this profile is changing. These emerging trends point to the possibility of heroin use becoming a serious health and social issue in South Africa and demonstrate the need for continued monitoring of heroin use patterns in the future and the development of a strategic plan for intervening before the situation deteriorates further."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a wide range of neurocognitive effects. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned with an unconditioned stimulus, has been shown to be a potential biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis, and the neural circuitry underlying EBC is known to involve the cerebellar peduncles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has proven useful for assessing central nervous system white matter integrity. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirteen children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 12 matched controls were scanned using DTI and structural MRI sequences. The DTI data were processed using a voxelwise technique, and the structural data were used for volumetric analyses. Prenatal alcohol exposure group and EBC performance were examined in relation to brain volumes and outputs from the DTI analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fractional anisotropy (FA) and perpendicular diffusivity group differences between alcohol-exposed and nonexposed children were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Alcohol exposure correlated with lower FA and greater perpendicular diffusivity in this region, and these correlations remained significant even after controlling for total brain and cerebellar volumes. Conversely, trace conditioning performance was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in the left middle peduncle. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was partially mediated by lower FA in this region.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD.

We identified and described four broad models of care for orphaned and separated children, including: institutional care (sub-classified as 'Pure CCI' for those only providing residential care, 'CCI-Plus' for those providing both residential care and community-based supports to orphaned children , and 'CCI-Shelter' which are rescue, detention, or other short-term residential support), family-based care, community-based care and self-care. Children in institutional care (95%) were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to have their basic material needs met in comparison to those in family-based care (17%) and institutions were better able to provide an adequate standard of living.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Each model of care we identified has strengths and weaknesses.

Meta-analyses were conducted to obtain pooled univariate and multivariate relative risk estimates. Subgroup analyses were performed for studies having different sample types: males or females and population-based or high-risk, and ones that differentiated between problem and asymptomatic drinkers. Alcohol drinkers were more apt to be HIV+ than nondrinkers. The pooled unadjusted odds ratio (OR) from 20 studies was 1.70 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.45-1.99). Results from 11 studies that adjusted for other risk factors produced a pooled risk estimate of 1.57 (95% CI = 1.42-1.72). Males and females had similar risk estimates, while studies involving high-risk samples tended to report larger pooled odds ratios than studies of the general population. When compared with nondrinkers, the pooled estimates of HIV risk were 1.57 (95% CI = 1.33-1.86) for non-problem drinkers versus 2.04 (95% CI = 1.61-2.58) for problem drinkers, a statistically significant difference (z = 2.08, P <0.04). Alcohol use was associated with HIV infection in Africa and alcohol-related interventions might help reduce further expansion of the epidemic."

However, important regional differences in trends and mode of transmission: Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected by HIV. Since 2001, the number of people with HIV in Eastern Europe and Central Asia increased from 650,000 to 1,5 million in 2007. Overall trends were stable in Central and Western Europe. Heterosexual and homosexual transmission accounts for the largest proportion in these regions. Transmission among injecting drug users has decreased. Similar trends have been observed in Italy: in 2007, there were 1,679 new diagnoses, equivalent to an incidence of 6,0 per 100,000 population. Over the years there has been a progressive increase in the proportion of diagnoses among women and in the median age at diagnosis, as well as changes in the exposure categories (i.e. a decrease in the proportion of injecting drug users and an increase in infections attributed to homosexual and heterosexual contacts). The era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has resulted in a reduction of morbidity and mortality. Before the advent of cART in 1996, the main causes of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV were the opportunistic infections and malignancies AIDS associated."

Studies have attributed alcoholism with the high rates of HIV infection due to its impact on sexual behaviour and arousal. African countries with high rates of alcoholism also reportedly have higher rates of HIV infection. This study explores rural communities' perspectives on the risk factors for HIV infection among women who are in alcohol discordant relationships where the man drinks alcohol excessively. Data were gathered through focus group discussions in rural central Kenya where alcoholism has reached epidemic levels. Key findings indicate the perceived severity of alcoholism, the perceived impact of alcoholism on men's reproductive health and the unmet sexual and reproductive needs of women in alcohol discordant relationships. Women engage in risky sexual behaviours in an attempt to meet these needs. Such risky behaviour in addition to alcohol-related sexual violence and low response-efficacy for safer sexual practices make them vulnerable to HIV infection and enhances the spread of HIV within communities. The study concludes that in preventing HIV infection among women in alcohol communities affected by alcohol, it is important to focus on their response efficacy. Intervention programmes that focus on HIV prevention among older married women and that integrate alcohol and HIV prevention are long overdue."

The purpose of this collaborative effort, which relies on the expertise and services of agencies and institutions from 26 countries, is to mobilize experts from various fields to share lessons learned about effective (and ineffective) strategies for reaching those most neglected, to ultimately realize a decline in HIV/AIDS infection and death rates. It is hoped the sharing of culturally sensitive educational materials and prevention strategies will decrease new HIV cases, increase participation in clinical trials, and mobilize grassroots efforts to affect health policy. Emerging from GHAA is the Charting Healthy Pathways for Vulnerable Populations, a 15-year initiative scheduled for 2006 through 2020. The inaugural launching took place in Hyderabad, India, in February 2006, and the first biennial global conference was held in October 2007 in Richard's Bay, South Africa. Several regional cluster meetings are scheduled in various countries before the second global conference in China in October 2009. In the meantime, cluster countries' representatives will be engaging in various forms of dialogue to promote innovative prevention/awareness strategies, identification of resources and services to be rendered, potential research collaborations, and networking to engage others in the cause of GHAA as we move to become the \"global voice for vulnerable HIV populations\"."

            "abstract": "Humans have always used drugs, probably as part of their evolutionary and nutritional heritage. However, this previous biological adaptation is unlikely to be so in the modern world, in which 2 billion adults (48% of the adult population) are current users of alcohol, 1.1 billion adults (29% of the adult population) are current smokers of cigarettes and 185 million adults (4.5% of the adult population) are current users of illicit drugs. The use of drugs is determined largely by market forces, with increases in affordability and availability increasing use. People with socio-economic deprivation, however measured, are at increased risk of harmful drug use, as are those with a disadvantaged family environment, and those who live in a community with higher levels of substance use. Substance use is on the increase in low-income countries which, in the coming decades, will bear a disproportionate burden of substance-related disability and premature death."

            "abstract": "The present study investigated potential predictors of the psychological sequelae of torture among 143 former political activists who had been detained during the apartheid era in South Africa. Using multiple regression analyses, the authors found that the number of times detained for political reasons, negative social support, strong religiousness, female gender, and number of days detained significantly predicted psychological distress and symptoms of traumatization as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (adjusted R(2) = .183) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (adjusted R(2) = .152). The number of times detained for political reasons, negative social support, strong religiousness, and female gender emerged as salient risk factors for psychological distress, whereas duration of imprisonment appeared to protect against posttraumatic symptoms. This article discusses these results in terms of the current research on factors associated with traumatization."

At least 65% of the population at risk should be treated in each round for LF elimination to occur. In Kenya, MDA using diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) and albendazole data shows declining compliance (proportion of eligible populations who receive and swallow the drugs) levels (85%-62.8%). The present study's aim was to determine the role of personal opinions and experiences in compliance with MDA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/findings:\n        \n      \n      This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted between January and September 2009 in two districts based on December 2008 MDA round. In each district, one location with high and one with low compliance was selected. Through systematic sampling, nine villages were selected and interviewer-based questionnaires administered to 965 household heads or adult representatives also systematically sampled. The qualitative data were generated from opinion leaders, LF patients with clinical signs and community drug distributors (CDDs) all purposively selected and interviewed. Sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted with single-sex adult and youth male and female groups. Chi square test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in compliance with treatment based on the records reviewed. The house-to-house method of drug distribution influenced compliance. Over one-quarter (27%) in low compared to 15% in high compliance villages disliked this method. Problems related to size, number and taste of the drugs were more common in low (16.4%) than in high (14.4%) compliance villages. Reasons for failure to take the drugs were associated with compliance (p<0.001). The reasons given included: feeling that the drugs were not necessary, CDD not visiting to issue the drugs, being absent and thinking that the drugs were meant for only the patients with LF clinical signs. A dislike for modern medicine prevailed more in low (6.7%) than in high (1.2%) compliance villages. Experience of side effects influenced compliance (P<0.001). The common side effects experienced included giddiness, fever, headache and vomiting. Social support, alcohol and substance use were not associated with compliance in both types of villages (p>0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/significance:\n        \n      \n      Community sensitization on treatment, drugs used, their regimen and distribution method involving all leaders should be strengthened by the Programme Implementers.

Consenting adults (≥18 years) were interviewed using the WHO STEPS survey instrument, examined, and tested for HIV and diabetes mellitus (DM). Adjusting for survey design, we estimated population prevalences of hypertension, DM, obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac failure, epilepsy and HIV, and investigated factors associated with hypertension using logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Across strata, hypertension prevalence ranged from 16 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 12 % to 22 %) to 17 % (CI: 14 % to 22 %) in Tanzania, and from 19 % (CI: 14 % to 26 %) to 26 % (CI: 23 % to 30 %) in Uganda. It was high in both urban and rural areas, affecting many young participants. The prevalence of DM (1 % to 4 %) and other NCDs was generally low.

Problem drinking (defined by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test criteria) affected 6 % to 15 % men and 1 % to 6 % women. Up to 46 % of participants were overweight, affecting women more than men and urban more than rural areas.

However, the association between AUD and childhood adversity and effects on the developing adolescent brain are less clear, due in part to the confound of psychiatric comorbidity. Here we examine early life adversity and its association with brain volume in a unique sample of 116 South African adolescents (aged 12-16) with AUD but without psychiatric comorbidity. Participants were 58 adolescents with DSM-IV alcohol dependence and with no other psychiatric comorbidities, and 58 age-, gender- and protocol-matched light/non-drinking controls (HC). Assessments included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). MR images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Allegra scanner. Volumes of global and regional structures were estimated using SPM8 Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM), with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and regression analyses. In whole brain ANCOVA analyses, a main effect of group when examining the AUD effect after covarying out CTQ was observed on brain volume in bilateral superior temporal gyrus. Subsequent regression analyses to examine how childhood trauma scores are linked to brain volumes in the total cohort revealed a negative correlation in the left hippocampus and right precentral gyrus. Furthermore, bilateral (but most significantly left) hippocampal volume was negatively associated with sub-scores on the CTQ in the total cohort. These findings support our view that some alterations found in brain volumes in studies of adolescent AUD may reflect the impact of confounding factors such as psychiatric comorbidity rather than the effects of alcohol per se. In particular, early life adversity may influence the developing adolescent brain in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus."

            "abstract": "In the HIV and AIDS sphere, children remain on the margins with respect to advocacy, prevention, treatment and care. Moreover, concern is generally limited to specific categories of children, most especially children living with HIV, orphaned children and child-headed households. Excluded from view are the very large numbers of children affected by generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics, now in advanced stages, in already impoverished countries in southern Africa. In this paper, we use information from comparable national household surveys in South Africa, in five waves between 1995 and 2005, to examine the impact of HIV and AIDS on children and on the structure of the households in which they find themselves. The question posed is whether it is appropriate to target orphans and child-headed households in this context. The data indicate that orphaning, particularly loss of a mother, tripled during this period, as is to be expected from rising adult mortality. Though they remain a small proportion, child-only households also rose markedly during this time. However, difficult as their situation is, neither orphans nor child-only households appear to be the worst-off children, at least from the point of view of reported sources of financial support and per capita monthly expenditure. Households headed by single adults and young adults are economically vulnerable groups not yet included in efforts to support affected children and families. Poverty is a pitiless backdrop to the AIDS epidemic and needs to be at the heart of strategies to address the needs of all vulnerable children in hard-hit communities."

Currently, the most frequent transmission category is sexual transmission, particularly among MSM, and immigrants are an important part of the epidemic. Heterogeneous trends for the three main transmission categories were observed from 2004 to 2009."

They completed questionnaire measures assessing demographic characteristics; self, peer and parental drug use; self and peer delinquency; parental child-centredness and rules; and community drug availability and exposure to violence on television. A measure of multiple victimisation assessed whether or not the respondents had experienced two or more different types of violence in their lifetime. There was a significant association between frequency of tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use and multiple victimisation. Significant predictors of multiple victimisation in multiple logistic regression analyses were variables within intra-personal, peer, parental and environmental domains.

We assessed these factors in a cohort of Kenyan female sex workers (FSW). Women who reported exchanging sex for money/gifts at least three times in the past month and who were HIV uninfected were enrolled and followed for 6 months. STI prevalence and HIV incidence were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, controlling for demographic and behavioral factors. Thirty-seven percent (74/200) reported having had anal sex. Frequency of anal sex was higher with regular and casual partners than with primary partners. Women were less likely to use condoms for anal sex than for vaginal sex with regular or casual partners. Vaginal washing was universal (100%). HIV incidence was 5.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI 1.62, 11.67). HIV incidence was not associated with any demographic or risk behavior.

Boys and girls with sexual debut at less than age 15 were more likely to report alcohol, tobacco and drug use, truancy, poor parental or guardian connectedness, sedentary behaviour, having been in a physical fight and seriously injured, while for girls, mental distress and poor economic status and for boys, bullied and poor parental or guardian supervision were associated with early coital debut. In multivariable analysis, early sexual debut was among boys associated with currently smoking (OR = 4.45, p = 0.002) and truancy (OR = 2.02, p = 0.007) and, among girls, associated with lower education (OR = 0.22, p = 0.004), ever drunk (OR = 3.94, p = 0.016), having no close friends (OR = 3.36, p = 0.014) and poor parental connectedness (OR = 2.43, p = 0.037).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The study found a high prevalence of early sexual debut among 15-year-olds in eight African countries. Risk factors identified were consistent with problem behaviour theory in which early onset of adolescent sexual behaviour is shared with other problem behaviours. Prevention programmes should broaden sexual health promotion including problem behaviour such as substance use and mental distress for boys and girls in the preteen years, before sexual debut."

            "abstract": "This review presents data on end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetes (ESRD-DM) from populations of several racial/ethnic groups and regions; it also identifies factors that may explain differences in risk of ESRD-DM among these groups. Diabetes is a major cause of ESRD in several developed countries, including the United States, England, and Australia. However, in these countries, the incidence is much higher for some groups, such as Blacks and Native Americans in the United States, Blacks and Indo-Asians in England, and indigenous populations in Australia. Despite the worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes, in some regions such as South Africa and Brazil, the rates of ESRD attributed to hypertension and glomerulonephritis are even higher than rates attributed to diabetes. High prevalence of accelerated/ malignant hypertension and infection-related glomerulonephritis in addition to a higher risk of early death from diabetes might partially explain the predominance of ESRD attributed to hypertensive nephropathy and glomerulonephitis in South Africa and Brazil. These data call attention to the need to develop more effective strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes and thereby reduce the racial/ethnic gap in ESRD-DM. A greater emphasis on hypertension and diabetes control, particularly in racially and economically disadvantaged populations, is also necessary."

Prevalence of receipt of tobacco cessation counseling from a health care professional as well as self-reported knowledge about NRT was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with interest in using NRT if provided for free.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      About 26.1% of current smokers reported ever receiving tobacco cessation counselling from a health care professional.

After adjusting for potential confounders, smokers' interest in using NRT was inversely associated with interest in harm-reduction switching to snuff (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14-0.80) and also reduced with each unit increase in lifetime duration of smoking (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.88-0.99).

The first part of the book describes why alcohol is not an ordinary commodity, and reviews epidemiological data that establish alcohol as a major contributor to the global burden of disease, disability and death in high-, middle- and low-income countries. This section also documents how international beer and spirits production has been consolidated recently by a small number of global corporations that are expanding their operations in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the second part of the book, the scientific evidence for strategies and interventions that can prevent or minimize alcohol-related harm is reviewed critically in seven key areas: pricing and taxation, regulating the physical availability of alcohol, modifying the drinking context, drink-driving countermeasures, restrictions on marketing, education and persuasion strategies, and treatment and early intervention services. Finally, the book addresses the policy-making process at the local, national and international levels and provides ratings of the effectiveness of strategies and interventions from a public health perspective. Overall, the strongest, most cost-effective strategies include taxation that increases prices, restrictions on the physical availability of alcohol, drink-driving countermeasures, brief interventions with at risk drinkers and treatment of drinkers with alcohol dependence."

Data from 3538 patients attending an HIV clinic in Kenya, Tanzania, or Namibia were captured through interview and medical record abstraction. Participants were categorized into three drinking categories: nondrinkers, nonharmful drinkers, and harmful/likely dependent drinkers. A proportional odds model was used to identify correlates associated with categories of alcohol use. Overall, 20% of participants reported alcohol use in the past 6 months; 15% were categorized as nonharmful drinkers and 5% as harmful/likely dependent drinkers. Participants who reported missing a dose of their HIV medications [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67, 2.49]; inconsistent condom use (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.79); exchanging sex for food, money, gifts, or a place to stay (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.32); and having a sexually transmitted infection symptom (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.77) were more likely to be categorized in the higher risk drinking categories. This research highlights the need to integrate alcohol screening and counseling into the adherence and risk reduction counseling offered to HIV-positive patients as part of their routine care. Moreover, given the numerous intersections between alcohol and HIV, policies that focus on reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related risk behavior should be integrated into HIV prevention, care, and treatment strategies."

Using a framework of social construction, a qualitative comparative analysis examines how the national disability systems of eight countries - Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the US - address issues of substance abuse. The US is the only country among the focal countries that does not currently allow disability benefits to be awarded to those with primary conditions of substance use disorders.

Twenty percent of control mothers drank during pregnancy, a rate that declined to 12.7% by the third trimester. The percentage who smoked during pregnancy was higher for case mothers than for control mothers (75.5% vs 30.3%), but the number of cigarettes smoked was low among case mothers.

Based on surveillance data, in the past decade the yearly number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in MSM increased more than threefold, from 101 cases diagnosed in 1999 to 332 cases in 2008. During this period, the majority of new HIV infections in MSM were diagnosed among Belgian citizens (72%), followed by other European nationalities (13%). The increase in HIV diagnoses does not reflect an increase in HIV testing since the number of tests performed nationwide remained remarkably stable over time. The steady increase in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among MSM, and the high proportion of MSM among HIV-positive patients co-infected with other sexually transmitted infections (STI) (95.6% in 2008) indicate increases in unsafe sex practices in this group. Development of behavioural surveillance and more qualitative research on reasons for unsafe sex are needed in order to develop more effective prevention strategies."

South Africa is among one of the sub-Saharan African countries with the highest prevalence and number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. Although recent evidence suggests that the epidemic has stabilised, infection rates remain unacceptably high. Alcohol use is on the increase, particularly in the groups most susceptible to HIV infection, namely women and young adults, and informs poor choices with respect to safer sexual practices. This paper reviews the association between alcohol and HIV. More specifically, however, it aims to explore the potential socio-politico-biological and cultural explanations as to the factors that intersect to drive these two epidemic diseases: alcoholism and HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Understanding some of the underlying factors will provide a framework to implement public health measures to curb HIV."

Four NSPs showed estimated HIV prevalence among MSM, and one included incidence. Two-thirds of the NSPs proposed government-led HIV interventions that address MSM. Those that did plan to intervene planned to do so through policy interventions, social interventions, HIV-prevention interventions, HIV-treatment interventions and monitoring activities. Overall, the governments of the countries included in the study exhibited little knowledge of HIV disease dynamics among MSM and little knowledge of the social dynamics behind MSM's HIV risk.

One of the well-known triggers of SCD is drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval, such as that caused by Domperidone (D).

The present paper reports a case of SCD that occurred some hours after D self-administration in a 47-year-old female subject with mitral valve prolapse, thus, predisposed to both VA and SCD. Despite the risks related to D administration, to the best of our knowledge, this particular issue has not been discussed in the medico-legal literature. For this reason, the forensic implications of D administration are discussed focusing on issues related to the self-administration as an OTC drug (as seen in this case), administration to incapacitated subjects, prescription to patients with contraindications and the off-label drug use of D at high and hazardous concentrations to stimulate lactation."

Our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials.

However, the epidemiology of infection in these populations is not well established. To determine the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and its association with cervical cytology and other correlates, we recruited 350 female sex workers (FSW) who were 18 to 50 years old in Nairobi, Kenya, for a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was administered at baseline to obtain information on sociodemographics and sexual behaviors. Women underwent a pelvic exam, during which a physician collected cervical-exfoliation samples for conventional cytology and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. Samples were tested for M. genitalium and other STI organisms (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis) and the E6/E7 mRNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) by Aptima nucleic amplification assays. The prevalence of M. genitalium was 12.9%. FSW who engaged in sexual intercourse during menses were less likely to have M. genitalium infection than those who did not (odds ratio [OR], 0.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1, 0.9). M. genitalium was also less prevalent among FSW who had worked in prostitution for >5 years (6.2%) than among those who had worked for <3 years (17.6%) (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1, 0.8). FSW who reported more frequent condom use were more likely to be infected with M. genitalium than those who reported less frequent use (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2, 11.6). These correlates differ from those found in M. genitalium studies conducted with FSW from West Africa and China. Further longitudinal analyses assessing associations with persistent M. genitalium infection are needed."

Multi-level logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of sustained 3- and 6-month abstinence and 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 1 month, with the facility as a random effect. The intervention was ineffective among smokers with high nicotine-dependence at 1 month, but was effective for all smokers over longer periods. Higher baseline self-efficacy predicted the 1-month 7-day PPA, but not sustained abstinence. HIV-positive participants' odds of sustained abstinence were about three times higher than those of their HIV-negative counterparts.

Very often the orphaned children become destitute, and young girls in particular become more vulnerable to HIV and AIDS as they try to fend for the rest of the family. This paper reports on the number of orphans in Kariba, Zimbabwe, describing their problems, coping strategies and wishes. The study was carried out in Nyamhunga and Mahombekombe high-density residential areas of Kariba, Zimbabwe. All households in the study area were visited, and a semi-structured questionnaire aimed at enumerating orphans and obtaining information regarding general problems of orphans was administered to heads of households present. In addition, information on the plight, coping strategies and survival wishes of orphans were collected through 15 focus group discussions held with orphans, care givers, community leaders and stakeholders. The prevalence of orphans in Kariba, based on a sample of 3 976 households, was found to be very high (56%) with most of the orphans in the age group 6-12 years. The majority of the orphans were paternal and under maternal care. Over 30% of the orphans of school-going age were not in school, and some young girl orphans became involved in commercial sex work. The survival wish list of the orphans included school fees, accommodation, health care provision, adequate food and income-generating projects. However, suggestions on orphan care and needs given by community members were somewhat divergent from the orphans' wish list, indicating that community interventions may not be sensitive to the wishes of those affected. Although the study did not categorise orphans according to cause of death of parents, there are indications that most of the orphans are accounted for by HIV and AIDS."

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the local computerized database and medical records. We applied our HCV prevalence rates in the different HIV transmission groups to the estimated number of HIV-infected persons in these groups in the UK, to obtain a national estimate of the level of HIV-HCV co-infection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 1017 HIV-1-infected patients, 407 (40%) were white men, 158 (15.5%) were black African men, 268 (26.3%) were black African women, and 61 (6%) and 26 (2.6%) were black Caribbean men and women, respectively. Heterosexual exposure was the most common route of HIV acquisition (53.5%), followed by men having sex with men (36.9%), and current or previous injecting drug use (IDU) (7.2%). The overall prevalence of HCV co-infection was 90/1017 (8.9%), but this varied substantially according to route of transmission, from 82.2% among those with a history of IDU (which accounted for 67% of all HCV infections), to 31.8% in those who had received blood products, to 3.5% and 1.8% in those with homosexually and heterosexually acquired infection, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified several independent risk factors for HCV infection: a history of IDU [odds ratio (OR) = 107.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 38.5-298.4], having received blood products (OR = 16.5; 95% CI = 5.1-53.7), and either being from a white ethnic group (OR = 4.3; 95% CI = 1.5-12.0) or being born in Southern Europe (OR = 6.7; 95% CI = 1.5-30.7). Based on the 35,473 known HIV-1-infected persons in the UK and the 10 997 estimated to be unaware of their status, we projected that there are at least 4136 HIV-HCV co-infected individuals in the UK and 979 who are unaware of their status.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 9% of our cohort was HIV-HCV co-infected.

Few studies focus on adolescents' substance use in relation to mental distress and protective factors in African countries. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates (mental distress and protective factors) of substance use among school-going adolescents in six African countries. The sample included 20,765 students aged from 13 to 15 years from six African countries (Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe), chosen by a two-stage cluster sample design to represent all students in grades 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in each country. The measure used was part of the Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaire, including various domains of health behaviour. Results indicate a prevalence of 12.6% tobacco use (past month), 6.6% risky alcohol use (two or more per day for at least 20 days or more in the past month), and 10.5% of illicit drug use (three or more times ever) in school-going adolescents in six African countries. School truancy, loneliness, sleeping problems, sadness, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and poverty were associated with substance use (tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs), while school attendance and parental supervision and connectedness were protective factors for substance use, and peer support protective for tobacco use. It is concluded that tobacco use, risky drinking and illicit drug use were common, clustered together and were associated with school truancy, mental distress, and lack of parental and peer support among adolescent African school children. These findings stress the need for early and integrated prevention programmes."

Our objective was to describe the long-term virological, immunological and mortality outcomes of providing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with strong adherence support to HIV-infected female sex workers (FSWs) in Burkina Faso and contrast outcomes with those obtained in a cohort of regular HIV-infected women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Prospective study of FSWs and non-FSWs initiated on HAART between August 2004 and October 2007. Patients were followed monthly for drug adherence (interview and pill count), and at 6-monthly intervals for monitoring CD4 counts and HIV-1 plasma viral loads (PVLs) and clinical events.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      95 women, including 47 FSWs, were followed for a median of 32 months (interquartile range [IQR], 20-41). At HAART initiation, the median CD4 count was 147 cells/μl (IQR, 79-183) and 144 cells/μl (100-197), and the mean PVLs were 4.94 log10 copies/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.70-5.18) and 5.15 log10 copies/ml (4.97-5.33), in FSWs and non-FSWs, respectively. Four FSWs died during follow-up (mortality rate: 1.7 per 100 person-years) and none among other women. At 36 months, the median CD4 count increase was 230 cells/μl (IQR, 90-400) in FSWs vs. 284 cells/μl (193-420) in non-FSWs; PVL was undetectable in 81.8% (95% CI, 59.7-94.8) of FSWs vs. 100% (83.9-100) of non-FSWs; and high adherence to HAART (> 95% pills taken) was reported by 83.3% (95% CI, 67.2-93.6), 92.1% (95% CI, 78.6-98.3), and 100% (95% CI, 54.1-100) of FSWs at 6, 12, and 36 months after HAART initiation, respectively, with no statistical difference compared to the pattern observed among non-FSWs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical and biological benefits of HAART can be maintained over the long-term among FSWs in Africa and could also lead to important public health benefits."

Suicide attempt and completed suicide increase during the adolescent period. One in 5 adolescents considers attempting suicide, but statistics are frequently unreliable.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data for this study were derived from the 2002 and 2008 South African Youth Risk Behaviour Surveys (YRBS). The study population comprised grades 8, 9, 10 and 11 students in governmental schools in the nine provinces of SA (N = 10,699 in 2002 and 10,270 in 2008). Key outcome measures were suicide ideation and suicide attempts.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the total sample, 18% of the students in 2002 and 19% in 2008 reported to have seriously considered and/or made a plan to commit suicide during the past six months (Suicide ideation), whereas 18.5% of students in 2002 and 21.8% in 2008 reported that they had attempted suicide at least 1 time during the past six months. On both suicide measures girls have higher prevalence scores than boys, and older school learners score higher than younger learners. In addition, 32% of the learners reported feelings of sadness or hopelessness. These feelings contributed significantly to the explanation of suicide ideation and suicide attempt next to being the victim or actor in violent acts and illegal substance use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempts among South African adolescents is high and seems to be influenced by a wide spectrum of factors at the demographic, psychological and behavioural level.

We report (1) mortality (using survival analysis); (2) retention in the programme (to 09/2009); and (3) virological suppression at six and 12 months (<400 copies/ml) following ART initiation. In total, 404 started ART (median age 33 years; 91.3% men; median baseline CD4 cell count 152 cells/µl [interquartile range 85-225]). Among 299 starting ART for the first time (ART-naïve), 23 deaths occurred during 252 person-years (median follow-up nine months). Mortality rates were 17.2 at 0-6 months (95% confidence interval 10.9-26.9) and 2.8 at >6 months (95% confidence interval 1.1-7.5)/100 person-years; p < 0.001. At 09/2009, 35.6% (144/404) remained in the correctional facility, with 94.4% (136/144) retained in the programme; 38.4% (155/404) were released; and 20.0% (81/404) transferred to another facility. ART-naïve patients in care six and 12 months after ART initiation, 94.7% (124/131) and 92.5% (74/80) were virologically suppressed, respectively. High early mortality warrants the early identification and management of HIV-positive inmates. The high mobility of inmates necessitates systems for facilitating continuity of care. Good virological responses and retention supports decentralising HIV care to correctional facilities."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe small size of previous studies of mortality in opioid dependent people has prevented an assessment of the extent to which elevated mortality risks are consistent across time, clinical and/or patient groups. The current study examines reductions in mortality related to treatment in an entire treatment population.\n## METHODS\nData from the New South Wales (NSW) Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, recording every \"authority to dispense\" methadone or buprenorphine as opioid replacement therapy, 1985-2006, was linked with data from the National Deaths Index, a record of all deaths in Australia. Crude mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated according to age, sex, calendar year, period in- or out-of-treatment, medication type, previous treatment exposure and cause of death.\n## RESULTS\nMortality among 42,676 people entering opioid pharmacotherapy was elevated compared to age and sex peers. Drug overdose and trauma were the major contributors. Mortality was higher out of treatment, particularly during the first weeks, and it was elevated during induction onto methadone but not buprenorphine. Mortality during these risky periods changed across time and treatment episodes. Overall, mortality was similarly reduced (compared to out-of-treatment) whether patients were receiving methadone or buprenorphine. It was estimated that the program produced a 29% reduction in mortality across the entire cohort.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMortality among treatment-seeking opioid-dependent persons is dynamic across time, patient and treatment variables. The comparative reduction in mortality during buprenorphine induction may be offset by the increased risk of longer out-of-treatment time periods. Despite periods of elevated risk, this large-scale provision of pharmacotherapy is estimated to have resulted in significant reductions in mortality.\n"

The sample included 5,331 children ages 6-17 from 1,697 households. Generalized linear mixed models were specified to predict OVC health vulnerability (child chronic illness and disability) and social protection (birth registration and 90% school attendance). Models included child-level risk factors (age, orphan status); household risk factors (adults with chronic illnesses and disabilities, greater household size); and household protective factors (including asset-holding). Interactions were systematically tested.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Orphan status was associated with decreased likelihood for birth registration, and paternal orphans and children for whom both parents' survival status was unknown were less likely to attend school. In the UCT arm, paternal orphans fared better in likelihood of birth registration compared with non-paternal orphans. Effects of study arms on outcomes were not moderated by any other risk or protective factors. High household asset-holding was associated with decreased likelihood of child's chronic illness and increased birth registration and school attendance, but household assets did not moderate the effects of cash transfers on risk or protective factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Orphaned children are at higher risk for poor social protection outcomes even when cared for in family-based settings.

The effects of UCT and CCT are not moderated by asset-holding, but greater household assets predict greater social protection outcomes. Intervention efforts need to focus on ameliorating the additional risk burden carried by orphaned children. These efforts might include caregiver education, and additional incentives based on efforts made specifically for orphaned children."

            "abstract": "The use of alcohol and other drugs (AODs) is an important driver of gender disparities in HIV prevalence. Consequently, there is a need for women-specific HIV interventions that are conceptualized to address (1) women's risk behavior, their roles in sexual relationships, and gender power dynamics and (2) other issues commonly faced by women who use AODs, such as gender-based violence and victimization. This article presents the evolution of HIV prevention intervention research with women who use AODs. It looks at 3 generations of women-focused HIV research interventions, including first-generation projects that started in the 1990s, second-generation efforts where projects expanded in scope and included adaptions of evidence-based interventions for global relevance, and finally third-generation projects currently underway that combine biobehavioral methods and are being implemented in real-world settings. Because women who use AODs continue to report risk behaviors related to HIV, emphasis should be placed on training scientists to conduct gender-specific studies, increasing funding for new studies, and advocating to ensure that stigma-free services are available for these at-risk women."

As substance use during adolescence can lead to adverse and often long-term health and social consequences, it is important to intervene early on in order to prevent progression to more severe problems. Brief interventions have been shown to reduce problematic substance use among adolescents and are especially useful for individuals who have moderately risky patterns of substance use. Such interventions can be conducted in school settings. This review set out to evaluate the effectiveness of brief school-based interventions for adolescent substance use.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effectiveness of brief school-based interventions on reducing substance use and other behavioural outcomes among adolescents compared to another intervention or assessment-only conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched 10 electronic databases and six websites on evidence-based interventions, and the reference lists of included studies and reviews, from 1966 to March 2013.

The secondary outcomes were engagement in criminal activity and engagement in delinquent or problem behaviours related to substance use.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used the standard methodological procedures outlined by The Cochrane Collaboration, including the GRADE approach for evaluating the quality of evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Six studies involving 1139 participants were included in this review. Overall the quality of evidence was moderate in the information provision comparison, and low or very low in the assessment only comparison. Reasons for downgrading the quality included risk of bias of the included studies, imprecision and inconsistency. Our findings suggested that compared to information provision only, brief interventions (BIs) did not have a significant effect on any substance use (three studies, 732 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to 0.09) or delinquent-type behaviour outcomes among adolescents (two studies, 531 participants, SMD -0.26; 95% CI -0.54 to 0.02). When compared to assessment-only controls, BIs had some significant effects on substance use and delinquent-type or problem behaviours, but high levels of heterogeneity existed between studies and it was not always possible to pool the results. When the comparison was with assessment-only conditions, studies of individual interventions that measured BI effectiveness reported significantly reduced substance use in general and in two studies reduced frequency of alcohol use specifically. When the data were pooled, BIs reduced cannabis frequency (SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.45 to -0.02) across three studies (n = 407). Cannabis quantity was also reduced by BIs in comparison to assessment only (SMD -60.27; 95% CI -66.59 to -53.95) in one study (n = 179). However, the evidence for studies that compared brief interventions to assessment-only conditions was generally of low quality. Brief interventions also had mixed effects on participants' delinquent or problem behaviours.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was limited quality evidence that brief school-based interventions were more effective in reducing substance use than the assessment-only condition, but were similar to information provision. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of BI in reducing adolescent substance use, particularly cannabis, when compared to assessment only. However, it is premature to make definitive statements about the effectiveness of brief school-based interventions for reducing adolescent substance use. Further high quality studies examining the relative effectiveness of BIs for substance use and other problem behaviours need to be conducted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries."

Meta-analyses of prospective studies of smokeless tobacco users in Europe reported a relative risk for fatal coronary heart disease of 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.06-1.21) and fatal stroke of 1.40 (1.28-1.54) while in Asian countries it was 1.26 (1.12-1.40). Case-control studies reported significantly greater risk for acute coronary events in smokeless tobacco users (odds ratio 2.23, 1.41-3.52), which was lower than smokers (2.89, 2.11-3.96), and subjects who both chewed and smoked, had the greatest risk (4.09, 2.98-5.61). There is a greater prevalence of hypertension and metabolic syndrome in users of smokeless tobacco. Smokeless tobacco use leads to accelerated atherothrombosis similar to smoking. There is an urgent need for public health and clinical interventions to reduce smokeless tobacco addiction."

            "title": "The prevalence of Hymenolepis nana among preschool children of displacement communities in Khartoum state, Sudan: a cross-sectional study.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Hymenolepis nana is among the most common intestinal parasitic infections causing a public health threat in poor communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence of H. nana infections and associated risk factors among preschool children of displacement communities in Khartoum state, Sudan.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional survey was conducted in May 2013 in displacement camps, Khartoum state, Sudan. A simple random sample of preschool children from the displacement camps, aged between 1 and 5 years, were included. Information was collected by presenting a questionnaire and taking 500 fresh stool specimens which were examined microscopically for the presence of eggs, using direct saline and formal-ether concentration techniques.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of H. nana was determined to be 32.6% (163/500), 95% CI (28.5%-36.9%). Infections of H. nana were more prevalent among males than females, and this association was statistically significant (P < 0.001, OR = 2.125, 95% CI = 1.452-3.108). H. nana infections were significantly prevalent among the older age group (2.6-5.0 years) (P < 0.001, OR = 2.909, 95% CI = 1.914-4.420). Approximately 76.7% of infected preschool children had diarrhea and it was significantly associated with H. nana infection (P < 0.001, OR = 9.45, 95% CI = 6.10-14.64). None of the preschool children had access to a clean water supply. No significant association was found between use of latrines and infections of H. nana (P = 0.56, OR = 0.880, 95% CI = 0.73-1.763).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was a high prevalence rate of H. nana infection among preschool children of displacement camps in Khartoum state, Sudan. Being male, aged between 2.6 and 5.0 years, and having diarrhea were identified as important risk factors for H. nana infection. Measures including health education, environmental hygiene, water supply and treatment should be taken into account to reduce the high prevalence of H. nana."

            "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) is a major public health concern. It is important to know the current burden of HCV infection among IDUs for targeted public health interventions in this high risk population. We systematically reviewed the published literature on prevalence of HCV infections among IDUs between January 1989 and April 2014. Sixty studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and subsequent analysis. Among the selected studies 26,311 IDUs were assessed for HCV infection of which 16,231 were positive, giving an overall prevalence of 61.7% (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 61.1-62.3%). Of the selected studies, 21 were from Asia, 20 from Europe, 13 from Americas, 5 from Australia and one from Africa. Combined regional estimates of HCV prevalence among IDUs showed that Africa has the highest mean prevalence of HCV among IDUs (97.3%, 95% CI 95.5-98.4%), however, this estimate was based only on one study from Mauritius. Europe has the second highest mean prevalence (65.9%, 95% CI 64.9-66.9%) followed by Australia (56.5%, 95% CI 53.8-59.2%). Our review suggests that the prevalence of HCV among IDUs is significantly high. There are very limited data from African nations. More comprehensive understanding of HCV epidemiology among IDUs including the risk behaviours are needed for this high risk group."

            "title": "Khat and synthetic cathinones: a review.",
            "abstract": "For centuries, 'khat sessions' have played a key role in the social and cultural traditions among several communities around Saudi Arabia and most East African countries. The identification of cathinone as the main psychoactive compound of khat leaves, exhibiting amphetamine-like pharmacological properties, resulted in the synthesis of several derivatives structurally similar to this so-called natural amphetamine. Synthetic cathinones were primarily developed for therapeutic purposes, but promptly started being misused and extensively abused for their euphoric effects. In the mid-2000's, synthetic cathinones emerged in the recreational drug markets as legal alternatives ('legal highs') to amphetamine, 'ecstasy', or cocaine. Currently, they are sold as 'bath salts' or 'plant food', under ambiguous labels lacking information about their true contents. Cathinone derivatives are conveniently available online or at 'smartshops' and are much more affordable than the traditional illicit drugs. Despite the scarcity of scientific data on these 'legal highs', synthetic cathinones use became an increasingly popular practice worldwide. Additionally, criminalization of these derivatives is often useless since for each specific substance that gets legally controlled, one or more structurally modified analogs are introduced into the legal market. Chemically, these substances are structurally related to amphetamine. For this reason, cathinone derivatives share with this drug both central nervous system stimulating and sympathomimetic features. Reports of intoxication and deaths related to the use of 'bath salts' have been frequently described over the last years, and several attempts to apply a legislative control on synthetic cathinones have been made. However, further research on their pharmacological and toxicological properties is fully required in order to access the actual potential harm of synthetic cathinones to general public health. The present work provides a review on khat and synthetic cathinones, concerning their historical background, prevalence, patterns of use, legal status, chemistry, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and their physiological and toxicological effects on animals and humans."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Country-level evidence from Africa on the prevalence of tobacco use and the role played by both demographic and socioeconomic factors, as influences on the use of tobacco products, is sparse. This paper analyzes the determinants of tobacco use in Ghana and explores the association between tobacco use and poverty in the country.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative survey of households (n = 12,323), were used to generate descriptive statistics and characterize tobacco use in the country. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationships between tobacco use and age, place of residence, region, education status, wealth, marital status, alcohol use, and whether the person has children. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for tobacco users and nonusers on the likelihood of their purchase of selected commodities indicative of living standards.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Tobacco use was significantly higher among those living in poverty stricken regions, those with less education, lower levels of wealth, parents, and alcohol users. Tobacco use was significantly higher among men (7%) than women (0.4%), and it increased to a peak age of 41.4 years before it declined. Using tobacco was also associated with a lower likelihood of purchasing health insurance.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Tobacco use is inextricably related to poverty in Ghana. Policies should be formulated to target populations and regions with higher tobacco prevalence to combat both poverty and tobacco use simultaneously."
