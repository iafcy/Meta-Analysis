            "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      The gingival architecture is determined by the spatial orientation of the gingival zenith (GZ) and the inter-dental papillae (IP). Among the factors commonly associated with the presence and morphology of the IP, the contact point (CP) and the inter-dental distance relationships have been considered the most important. The objective of the present controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the role of the CP in determining the clinical and morphometric parameters of the inter-dental papilla.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The inter-dental papillae of sixty patients with unilateral diastemas were evaluated by means of periodontal probing, transgingival probing, the papilla presence index and morphometric measurement with a digital calliper and were analysed with a paired t-test, with significance set at alpha value of 0.05 or lower.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All the papillae exhibited PPI score = 1. Papillary measurements were significantly increased in the experimental (diastema) group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In patients with gingival health, the dimensions of the IP are significantly increased in teeth without a contact point in comparison with their contra-lateral controls with a contact point. The contact point does not determine the presence and size of the inter-dental papilla, in patients with a healthy gingiva and without periodontal attachment loss."

After local anaesthesia and before treatment, submucosal injections were administered into the mucobuccal fold adjacent to the mandibular molars, and a routine single-visit root canal treatment procedure was performed in all groups. After the root canal treatments, the patients were asked to score their pain level using the Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (0-170 mm) at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The experimental groups were compared using one-way anova or Kruskal-Wallis H-test. The groups that were significantly different were compared pairwise using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test.

            "abstract": "Bruxism is a repetitive jaw-muscle activity characterized by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or bracing or thrusting of the mandible. Recent advances have clarified the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep bruxism (SB). However, the influence of pharmacological elimination of gastric acid secretion on SB has not been confirmed. The authors aimed to assess the efficacy of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on SB and to examine the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and endoscopic findings of the upper GI tract in SB patients. The authors performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study at Kagoshima University Hospital. Twelve patients with polysomnography (PSG)-diagnosed SB underwent an assessment of GI symptoms using the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (FSSG) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. At baseline (i.e., before interventions), the mean frequencies of electromyography (EMG) bursts and rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes were 65.4 ± 49.0 bursts/h and 7.0 ± 4.8 episodes/h, respectively, and at least 1 RMMA episode with grinding noise was confirmed in all participants. The mean FSSG score was 8.4 ± 5.6, and 41.7% of patients were diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Mild reflux esophagitis was confirmed in 6 patients. PSG, including EMG of the left masseter muscle and audio-video recording, was performed on days 4 and 5 of administration of 10 mg of the PPI (rabeprazole) or placebo. PPI administration yielded a significant reduction in the frequency of EMG bursts, RMMA episodes, and grinding noise. No significant differences were observed regarding the swallowing events and sleep variables. Since the clinical application of PPI for SB treatment should remain on hold at present, the results of this trial highlight the potential application of pharmacological gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment for SB patients. Larger scale studies are warranted to corroborate these findings. (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: UMIN000004577)."

The inclusion criteria were availability of clinical history and owner permission. Cats with known oral disease were not excluded from the study. All cats received ultrasonic scaling and polishing of the teeth, a thorough oral examination, and full-mouth radiographs. A strong statistical relation was found between age and TR. The age group of 10 to 15-years showed an increased risk of 6.56 times for TR occurrence compared with the group 0 to 4-years of age. Presence of gingivitis in all index levels was related to an increased risk for TR. No relation was found between age or gingivitis index and lesion type. Mandibular third premolar and molar teeth were most commonly affected by TR, especially for type 1 lesions. Canine teeth were statistically more likely to have type 2 lesions. The trend for the canine teeth to be more affected with type 2 lesions needs further verification."

Although these molecules are present in periodontopathogenic bacteria, their role in periodontitis is not known. In this study, we used Pam2CSK4 (PAM2), a synthetic molecule that mimics bacterial lipoprotein, to investigate the effects of lipoproteins on periodontitis in mice. C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: 1) Negative control group: animals received vehicle injection; 2) Positive control group: animals received injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS); 3) PAM2 group: animals received PAM2 injection. All the injections were performed bilaterally every other day into the palatal mucosa between first and second molars. After twenty-four days, the animals were euthanized to assess alveolar bone volume (micro-CT), cellular and extracellular composition in the gingiva (stereometric analysis), and osteoclast numbers (TRAP staining). Treatment with either PAM2 or LPS induced gingival inflammation, as demonstrated by increased infiltration of inflammatory cells and enhanced angiogenesis, associated with a smaller number of fibroblasts and decreased extracellular matrix. Importantly, treatment not only with LPS but also with PAM2 resulted in a larger number of TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts and significant loss of alveolar bone. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PAM2 can induce gingival inflammation and bone loss in mice, broadening the avenues of investigation into the role of lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease."

Salivary cortisol levels were determined using the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. The data were analysed by bivariate tests and multivariate analysis of variance (5% level). Salivary cortisol levels were lower in the MS group than in the PS group at the time of anaesthesia (p = 0.004), but did not vary during the appointment within sedation (p = 0.319) or placebo (p = 0.080) groups. Children's behaviour was negative most of the time and did not differ between MS and PS; however, the behaviour (OSUBRS) did not correlate with salivary cortisol levels. Oral midazolam is able to control salivary cortisol levels during dental treatment of pre-schoolers, which might not lead to better clinical behaviour."

            "abstract": "Dental records play an important role in forensic identification. To this end, postmortem dental findings and teeth conditions are recorded in a dental chart and compared with those of antemortem records. However, most dentists are inexperienced at recording the dental chart for corpses, and it is a physically and mentally laborious task, especially in large scale disasters. Our goal is to automate the dental filing process by using dental x-ray images. In this study, we investigated the application of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for classifying tooth types on dental cone-beam computed tomography (CT) images. Regions of interest (ROIs) including single teeth were extracted from CT slices. Fifty two CT volumes were randomly divided into 42 training and 10 test cases, and the ROIs obtained from the training cases were used for training the DCNN. For examining the sampling effect, random sampling was performed 3 times, and training and testing were repeated. We used the AlexNet network architecture provided in the Caffe framework, which consists of 5 convolution layers, 3 pooling layers, and 2 full connection layers. For reducing the overtraining effect, we augmented the data by image rotation and intensity transformation. The test ROIs were classified into 7 tooth types by the trained network. The average classification accuracy using the augmented training data by image rotation and intensity transformation was 88.8%. Compared with the result without data augmentation, data augmentation resulted in an approximately 5% improvement in classification accuracy. This indicates that the further improvement can be expected by expanding the CT dataset. Unlike the conventional methods, the proposed method is advantageous in obtaining high classification accuracy without the need for precise tooth segmentation. The proposed tooth classification method can be useful in automatic filing of dental charts for forensic identification."

This scale was utilized in a randomized, split mouth study of healthy children ages 2-7 years old requiring extraction of at least 2 primary maxillary incisors under general anesthesia. One extraction site was randomly assigned to receive HP and the other had no hemostatic measures. Post-operative bleeding was rated at 2, 10, and 15 minutes post-extraction. Other variables recorded included age, sex, periapical radiolucency, presence of fistula, swelling, discoloration, intraoral stabilization device used, and vital signs at two time intervals. Pre-operative radiographs were reviewed for root resorption and periapical radiolucency.\n    \n\n\n          Results and conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-five patients provided 50 teeth. Hemostatic pack had a significant effect on reducing bleeding at each time point and that effect did not change over time. Age, sex, tooth pain, post-extraction heart rate, blood pressure, discoloration, amount of resorption, and presence of a periapical radiolucency had no significant effect on bleeding. The proposed bleeding scale had good intra-rater reliability and could be useful in future studies, once validated."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to joint damage, deformity, and pain. It affects approximately 1% of adults in developed countries. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection, caused by inflammatory reactions to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and affecting about 35 to 50% of adults. If left untreated, periodontitis can lead to tooth loss. A significant association has been shown to exist between periodontitis and RA in observational studies. Some intervention studies have suggested that periodontal treatment can reduce serum inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We hypothesize that periodontitis could be an aggravating factor in patients with RA, and that its treatment would improve RA outcomes. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on the biological and clinical parameters of patients with RA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The ESPERA (Experimental Study of Periodontitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis) study is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects with both RA and periodontitis will be recruited at two university hospitals in southwestern France. In total, 40 subjects will be randomized into two arms (intervention and control groups), and will be followed up for 3 months. Intervention will consist of full-mouth supra-gingival and sub-gingival non-surgical scaling and root planing, followed by systemic antibiotic therapy, local antiseptics, and oral hygiene instructions. After the 3-month follow-up period, the same intervention will be applied to the subjects randomized to the control group.The primary outcome will be change of in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) at the end of the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will be the percentages of subjects with 20%, 50%, and 70% improvement in disease according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Health-related quality of life assessments (the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index) will also be compared between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Evidence-based management of potential aggravating factors in subjects with active RA could be of clinical importance, yet there are few randomized controlled trials on the effect of periodontal treatment on the clinical parameters of RA.

            "abstract": "Curcumin is a turmeric-contained active ingredient that has been proven to be effective in treating pain and inflammation due to its analgesic as well as anti-inflammation potential. Odontectomy, on the other hand, has been well known for its post-procedure acute inflammation pain. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcuminoid in treating acute inflammation post-operative pain in the post-surgical removal of impacted third molars patients. Ninety (44 males; 46 females) participants were recruited in this randomised controlled trial and randomly assigned to the control group (those who consumed mefenamic acid) or the experimental group (those who consumed curcumin). Numeric rating scale (NRS) was used as an evaluation tool to evaluate the intensity of the pain experienced by the participants. Pain evaluation was performed immediately after anaesthesia effect disappeared (T0 ) and an hour after participant took their first (T1 ), second (T2 ) and third (T3 ) course of drugs. All data were collected and analysed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The current study showed that participants in both groups experienced significantly (P < .01) less pain compared to their initial pain level. In addition, when the two groups were compared, it was revealed that those in the treatment group experienced even significantly (P < .01) less pain compared to those in the control group. It can be concluded that curcumin is effective in treating acute inflammation pain in the post-surgical removal of impacted third molars patients."

Teeth were excluded if clinical or radiographic evidence of pulpal inflammation or necrosis or clinical mobility were observed. Pre-cooperative children were also excluded.Clinical procedures and success criteria Following a coin toss, 120 teeth were randomly assigned to two groups: 55 in the total caries removal (TCR) group and 65 in the selective caries removal (SCR) group. Procedures were carried out by three paediatric dentists under local anaesthesia and restored, using a layering technique, with composite under rubber dam. Restorations were evaluated at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, using the US Public Health Service (USPHS) scale, by a single-blinded and calibrated examiner. A Charlie or Delta score, on the USPHS scale, at the margins of the restorations was considered as restoration failure. Gingival bleeding score, type of cavity (one or two surfaces) and presence of caries (active or inactive) were recorded as secondary outcomes; however, presence alone did not constitute restoration failure.Results Average survival rate of restorations across all teeth was 68% after 36 months, with SCR statistically significantly lower at 57% compared to TCR at 81% (p = 0.004). Annual failure rates for SCR and TCR were 17.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Two-surface restorations had lower survival rates (58%) compared to single-surface restorations (87%) (p = 0.02). Type of cavity and gingival bleeding statistically influenced the chance of restoration failure at 36 months.Conclusions Composite restorations placed after SCR in primary molars were found to fail more often compared to those restored after TCR. Two-surface cavities and poor gingival health negatively impacted restoration success."

The clinical healing and extra-oral swelling were scored two weeks post-operatively. Samples of wound exudate were cultivated for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and β-haemolytic streptococci. Salivary oxytocin concentrations were analysed from pre- and post-surgery samples using ELISA technique. Compliance and the subjective perception of swelling, pain and discomfort were reported daily through visual analogue scales in a logbook. All patients except three completed the protocol and the postoperative course was uneventful in most cases. Minor extra-oral swellings were noted in five patients, but none required antibiotic treatment. At the 2-week follow-up, there were no significant differences in clinical wound healing index, extra-oral swelling, bacterial growth or salivary oxytocin levels between the groups. The self-reported data unveiled, however, a significantly reduced sense of swelling, in particular during the second week after surgery in the probiotic test group (P<0.05). Likewise, significantly fewer nights with disturbed sleep and fewer days with sick-leave from work were reported among the participants in the test group (P<0.05). No differences were found in the post-operative use of analgesics. In conclusion, we found no significant influence of probiotic supplements on objective wound healing after surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. However, since the patients' perceived significant post-operative ameliorations, further studies are needed to explore the patient's value of the intervention."

All the individuals underwent surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars under strict aseptic techniques, with minimal trauma to the surrounding tissues. Mouth opening in millimeters was recorded postoperatively using Vernier calipers on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th days. A 4-point visual analog scale (VAS) was used for assessing postoperative pain.

The agents discussed are bisguanide antiseptics, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolic antiseptics, hexetidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, delmopinol, salifluor, metal ions, sanguinarine, propolis and oxygenating agents. The plaque inhibitory, anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis properties of these agents are considered along with their substantivity, safety and possible clinical usefulness. Clinical trials of these agents that have been published are also reported. The possible clinical uses of antiseptic mouthwashes are finally considered along with some advice about assessing manufacturers claims. Throughout this review the terms plaque inhibitory, anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis have been used according to the clarification of terminology suggested by the European Federation of Periodontology at its second workshop. This defines a plaque inhibitory effect as one reducing plaque to levels insufficient to prevent the development of gingivitis; an anti-plaque effect as one which produces a prolonged and profound reduction in plaque sufficient to prevent the development of gingivitis; and anti-gingivitis as an anti-inflammatory effect on the gingival health not necessarily mediated through an effect on plaque."

They were then fitted with dentures. Two and six weeks later, although both groups expressed favourable expectations of their dentures, the control group deteriorated continually on all measures, correlated with a decline in self-reported dental functioning. The video group improved on all measures except Satisfaction with Life. Therefore, our study is unique in showing that appropriate management of patients can arrest (1) clinically significant distress which can be occasioned by the replacement of teeth by dentures and (2) the development of complaints which may be seen as spurious.

They are not procedures exempt from the appearance of complications. Most publications refer to postoperative complications, and there is limited literature regarding the development of late complications (weeks or months). Our working group carried out a study to describe the development of late complications associated with the use of DFGG in comparison with CTG, providing an incidence rate and a classification. Sixty-eight patients with mucogingival problems were selected, and divided into two groups: the Test Group, for which we used DFGG + Coronal Advancement Flap (CAF), and the Control Group (CTG + CAF). All patients were treated at the University of Seville's dental school to solve mucogingival problems for aesthetic and/or functional reasons. A classification is proposed based on its severity; Major and Minor. Major complications included reepithelialization of the graft, epithelial bands, cul-de-sac, epithelial cysts, and bone exostoses. Minor complications included the graft´s color changes and superficial revascularization. Late major complications were only associated with the use of the DFGG, and the late minor complications developed with the use of the DFGG were much higher than those associated with CTG. CTG appears to be a safer procedure than DFGG in terms of late complications."

A total of 407 selected patients were randomly allocated into the ORCT group (n = 202) or the PCEM group (n = 205). Numerical Rating Scale questionnaires were used to record pain intensity (PI) by the patients during the first 7 days after treatment. While there was no statistically significant difference in the mean PI at baseline between the two study groups (P = 0.45), changes in mean PI were significantly different between them (P < 0.001). In the ORCT group, pain relief was achieved after 36 h [95% confidence interval (CI), 27.00-45.00], compared to 18 h in the PCEM group (95% CI, 15.00-21.00), a significant difference (P < 0.01). Comparison of the mean PI sum recorded over 7 days showed that patients in the ORCT group experienced significantly more pain than those in the PCEM group (P < 0.001); a similar difference was observed for pain in response to percussion tests (P < 0.001). Treatment with PCEM thus had the better pain-reducing effects than ORCT in irreversible pulpitis cases."

A majority of the subjects (76%) claimed to brush their teeth at least twice a day, while interdental hygiene means were used daily by 4%. The subjects showed a mean plaque score of 47% and a gingivitis score of 56%. Forty-six % of the adolescents had a plaque score of > or = 50%, whereas the corresponding figure for gingivitis was 62%. The subjects had on average 5.5 teeth with facial gingival recession. The mean prevalence of sites with probing depth (PPD) of > or = 4 mm was 8, out of which 99% were located at proximal sites. A radiographic bone level of > 2 mm was observed at on average 0.4 teeth per subject. Logistic regression analyses revealed that gender (males) and county area (Fyrbodal) were significant factors for a high plaque and gingivitis score. There was no significant difference in periodontal conditions in relation to socio-economic grouping. In conclusion, the survey revealed higher prevalence of plaque and gingivitis among male than female adolescents, but no differences between socioeconomic groups."

The primary efficacy endpoint was change in KT width (∆KT) from surgery to 6 months post-surgery. Secondary endpoints included traditional periodontal measures, such as clinical attachment level, recession, and bleeding on probing. Patient-reported pain, discomfort, and esthetic satisfaction were also recorded. Biopsies were obtained at 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Surgery and postoperative sequelae were uneventful, with normal healing observed at both test and control sites. The primary outcome, ∆KT width at 6 months, did not establish non-inferiority of CM compared to FGG (P = 0.9992), with the FGG sites averaging 1.5 mm more KT width than CM sites. However, the amount of new KT generated for both therapies averaged ≥2 mm. Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between test and control sites. All site biopsies appeared as normal mucoperiosteum with keratinized epithelium. CM sites achieved better texture and color matches, and more than two-thirds of patients preferred the appearance of their CM sites.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      With the proviso of sufficient KT (≈2 mm in width) and study goals of lower morbidity, unlimited supply, and patient satisfaction, CM appears to be a suitable substitute for FGG in vestibuloplasty procedures designed to increase KT around teeth."

We performed a randomized clinical trial to test our hypothesis that adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) plus SRP has significant effect compared with SRP alone, which can last for 1 year. The study included 136 sites in 16 patients with previously untreated chronic periodontitis, at least one premolar and one molar in every quadrant (minimum, four teeth/quadrant) and at least one tooth with attachment loss of ≥4 mm in every quadrant. In all patients, two randomly assigned quadrants were treated with SRP and the other two were treated with SRP + aPDT. The clinical parameters of probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline. PPD and BOP showed significant reduction, and CAL showed significant gain from baseline for all three time points in both groups. In addition, there were significantly greater reduction and gain for SRP + aPDT than for SRP at all three time points. No adverse effects of aPDT were observed. These data demonstrate significant improvement in all evaluated clinical parameters for at least 1 year and suggest that aPDT as an adjunctive therapy to SRP represents a promising therapeutic concept for persistent periodontitis."

            "abstract": "Locally delivered antibiotics are used to treat periodontitis and these agents are found to be effective in improving the treatment result. Microencapsulated minocycline hydrochloride (Arestin) has been tested and reported to provide significantly greater probing depth reduction in conjunction with scaling and root-planing than scaling and root-planing alone. Thus, it was suggested that the use of locally delivered antimicrobial agents should be incorporated as part of an optimal non-surgical therapeutic regimen. This paper evaluates the efficacy of the minocycline microspheres in patients with moderate to severe periodontitis in a model, which is a randomised, evaluator-blinded study with an open-label; four arm parallel design. The patients were selected based upon 'active' disease, as determined by at least two teeth having one site each with pocket depth (PD) > or = 6 mm and with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels > 66.2 ng/ml in gingival crevicular fluid. The trial was of 6 months duration and used a formulation of minocycline microspheres containing 1 mg minocycline. Responses of groups receiving SRP followed by one dose per pocket of the minocycline microspheres (SRP + MPTS) were compared to SRP alone, MPTS alone or no treatment. There were substantially greater reductions in PD and gains in clinical attachment level (CAL) at each post-treatment time point in the SRP + MPTS group compared to the other treatment groups. PD reduction and gain in CAL at month 3 in the SRP + MPTS group vs. SRP alone was statistically significant. These data further support the adjunctive use of minocycline in a slow release vehicle for the treatment of periodontitis with SRP."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Chronic periodontitis, the most common periodontal disease, is the destruction of tooth supporting structures and alveolar bone which may result in teeth exfoliation. Conventionally, treatment aims at decreasing bacterial load by mechanical debridement and systemic or local delivery of antibiotics. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a safe alternative adjunct therapy for elimination of pathogenic bacteria in periodontal pocket. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aPDT with 660 nm diode laser and methylene blue as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) on clinical periodontal parameters.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In this clinical trial, we assessed aPDT as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) in chronic periodontitis treatment.

Materials and methods: A randomized controlled trial with an ID no. NCT03423329 in Clinical-Trials.gov was conducted in the outpatient clinic of Paediatric Dentistry Department at Ain Shams University. The study was designed with two test arms where either ibuprofen or acetaminophen was administered to children whereas in the control arm a multivitamin placebo was used. Children's self-reported pain responses were recorded using Wong-Baker FACES pain scale. For statistical analysis, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare between the three groups whereas Friedman's test was used to study changes within each group. Results: In a sample of 60 children, a significant decrease in the mean pain rating scores was detected in all groups where success rates ranged from 40% with ibuprofen to 55% and 65% with acetaminophen and placebo, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups regarding severity of pain during access cavity preparation. Conclusions: Both analgesics have no clinical advantage over the placebo in increasing the efficacy of buccal infiltration during pulp therapy in mandibular primary molars."

Twenty healthy adult patients each of whom had at least two dental implants, a modified gingival index > 1.5, and a modified Quigley-Hein plaque index score > 1.7 were enrolled into the study. After a thorough oral prophylaxis, patients were randomly assigned to either the antiseptic mouthrinse or a 5% hydroalcohol placebo mouthrinse group and instructed to rinse twice daily for 30 seconds with 20 ml of their assigned mouthrinse as an adjunct to their usual oral hygiene procedures. The baseline examination included plaque index, gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth measurement, and attachment level measurements. The plaque and gingival indices were rescored at 1, 2, and 3 months. Probing depths, attachment levels, and bleeding index were determined again at 3 months only. At the end of 3 months, the antiseptic mouthrinse group had statistically significant reductions in plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding index compared to the placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups in probing depth or attachment level.

The emergence of a permanent tooth was scored on a scale from 1 to 3, depending on the eruptive level of the tooth from cutting through the gingiva (1) to reaching the occlusal table (3). Specifically, emergence of the second premolars (PM2) and permanent second molars (M2), the most adjacent teeth to the first molars, was evaluated as it interacted with the development of the sagittal occlusion. Treatment of the distocclusion was as effective in late childhood as in mid-childhood. Within each appliance group, the emergence of PM2 and M2 did not affect the amount of progress toward Class I significantly (p > 0.05), indicating that improvement from distocclusion to neutrocclusion with each appliance is not influenced by the timing of emergence of these teeth. Although these findings support a one-phase treatment starting in the late mixed dentition, earlier intervention in mid-childhood may be required in the presence of several developmental conditions, or when the dental and skeletal development deviate significantly in the individual patient."

            "abstract": "The clinical efficacy regarding bleaching sensitivity and tooth shade lightening using a standard hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) bleaching gel was compared with the additional use of ozone either before or after application of H2O2. Using computer-generated tables, 45 participants were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 15 each) in this investigator-driven, single-centre trial. In Group 1, upper anterior teeth were bleached using ozone (produced via a healOzone X4 device) for 60 seconds, then 38% H2O2 for 20 minutes; in Group 2, 38% H2O2 application (20 min) was followed by ozone (60 s); air produced by the healOzone machine (60 s) followed by 38% H2O2 (20 min) was used in Group 3 (control). Bleaching sensitivity was evaluated via visual analogue scales, and a treatment-blinded reader objectively recorded tooth shades using a colorimeter before and 24 hours after bleaching (at α = 0.05). The H2O2/ozone combination did not result in pain sensations, while both ozone/H2O2 and H2O2 alone increased bleaching sensitivity (p < 0.001). Teeth achieved lighter shades (higher L*/lower b* values) after bleaching in all groups (p < 0.001), while Ozone boosted lighter tooth shades, irrespective of its use before or after H2O2 (p < 0.05). Due to the complimentary effects, applying ozone after H2O2 seems preferable for bleaching."

One of the most discussed topics is socket healing after extraction. The Benex system allows extraction without causing unnecessary socket expansion by removing the tooth vertically, preserving both bone and soft tissue.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To assess postoperative healing signs, symptoms, and complications using the Benex extraction system and compare it with conventional extraction among patients at Umm Al-Qura University.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-eight patients with hopeless single-rooted teeth were included. They were divided into two equal groups: one in which teeth were extracted using the conventional method and one in which extractions were performed by Benex. The Benex system for tooth extraction was performed by drilling into the root canal, followed by screw insertion. Once the extractor was properly positioned, extraction was accomplished by turning the hand screw clockwise. At baseline, the wound size was evaluated. On days 1, 3, and 7 after extraction, telephone interviews were conducted to evaluate pain and post-extraction complications using a pain scale and questionnaire. Socket healing and wound size were evaluated after 2 and 4 weeks of extraction using the healing index and H2O2 epithelization test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Benex extraction system accelerated early soft-tissue healing and decreased pain and wound size compared with the control group. Conclusion. The Benex system is relatively safe and easy to use, but this does not eliminate the need for a degree of education and training. Proper selection of the case, knowledge of using the device, and implementation of that knowledge in the treatment planning are important factors in ensuring success with this system."

One hundred and forty-eight teeth will be randomly distributed in two experimental groups: (1) Selective removal of carious tissue and RCR; or (2) NRCC through cavity enlargement using a metallic sandpaper. The primary outcome will be tooth survival after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The duration and the cost of dental treatments will be considered for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the evaluated treatments. The discomfort reported by the participants will be measured after each treatment using the FIS scale. The participants' satisfaction and perception of the parents/legal guardians will be evaluated through questionnaires. For the primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier's survival and Long-Rank test will be used for comparison between the two groups. All the variables will be modeled by Cox regression with shared fragility. Significance will be considered at 5%.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The NRCC could be an option to manage carious lesions on proximal surfaces of primary teeth, and the approach could be well accepted by the children and parents/legal guardians.

Using an experimental gingivitis model, twelve subjects between 19 and 28 years old, with a healthy gingival status, refrained from brushing and flossing one randomly selected half of the mandibular arch for two weeks. At baseline and during six subsequent appointments, gingival inflammation (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and sulfide levels (SUL) were measured using the Gingival Index and the Diamond Probe/Perio 2000 System. The Spearman correlation was used to compare the relationships between SUL, GI, and BOP on the brushing (B) and non-brushing (NB) sides. Data on the NB side revealed a stronger correlation than on the B side. Wilcoxon rank sum was used to evaluate the differences between mean SUL, GI, and BOP scores on the B and NB sides over time. Results indicate that SUL were the first periodontal parameter to show a significant difference between sides. SUL were significantly higher on the NB side at 4 of the 6 data collection intervals; therefore, SUL may be associated with the initiation and progression of early plaque-induced gingivitis."

One hundred and seventeen mentally retarded subjects aged between 10-17 years resident in an institution were divided into two groups. One group was assigned daily brushing with the 1% chlorhexidine gel, the other group a placebo quinine sulfate-containing gel. No other form of oral hygiene was used during the experimental period. Assessment of dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis was made at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. An assessment was also made 2 months after the gel was withdrawn from use and normal toothbrushing procedures resumed. No clinical or statistical advantage was noted in plaque or gingivitis scores in the group receiving chlorhexidine treatment during the 6-month period. This group showed a higher prevalence of tooth staining. It was concluded that periodontal severity and poor oral hygiene exceeded the plaque- and gingivitis-preventing potential of chlorhexidine."

The active compound was available as a powder; the rinse consisted of 1.7 g powder dissolved in 30 ml hot tap water. Fourteen dental students participated in the trial. The students were examined during two consecutive periods, each consisting of one preparatory (during which active tooth cleaning measures were carefully practiced) and one main test period (during which mouth rinsings were the only plaque control measure). Each of the two test periods was initiated by a baseline examination following which the participants rinsed either with the active or the placebo mouthwash. The rinsings were performed immediately after breakfast, after lunch and after dinner. Measurements of Plaque and Gingival Index scores were performed 4, 7 and 14 days after the start of the no-toothbrushing period. Bacteria were sampled and examined after 7 and 14 days of trial. The results demonstrated that a mouthwash which released hydrogen peroxide effectively prevented the colonization of filaments, fusiforms, motile and curved rods as well as spirochetes in developing plaque. The mouthwash which was used as the only oral hygiene measure during a 2-week period furthermore markedly reduced the amount of plaque formed and significantly retarded gingivitis development. It is suggested that H202 released by mouthwashes during rinsing may prevent or retard the colonization and multiplication of anaerobic bacteria."

When the volume of alveolar bone in the posterior maxillary region is less than 4 mm, maxillary sinus floor elevation (MSFE) with the lateral approach is an effective option. Traditionally, this standard approach is usually conducted at 4-6 months after tooth extraction (standard MSFE). However, defective dentition due to extraction can impair mastication during the period of bone remodeling, especially if the molars on both sides are severely compromised and must be extracted. MSFE before extraction (modified MSFE) can take full advantage of residual tooth strength. However, the effectiveness and practicability of the modified MSFE procedure remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of modified vs. standard MSFE, in order to provide references to periodontists.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study cohort included 25 adult patients (50 surgery sites) recruited from Peking University Hospital and School of Stomatology who met the inclusion criteria. The two sides of each patient will be randomly divided into two groups: a test group-modified MSFE or a control group-standard MSFE. The surgical duration and patient-reported outcomes (visual analog scale for discomfort) will be documented. Clinical indicators, including implant survival rates, mucosal conditions, and complications, will be recorded every 6 months during the 5-year follow-up period. The volume of the alveolar bone and marginal bone level will be assessed radiographically (cone-beam CT and periapical films) every 6 months. Histological analysis of biopsy samples retrieved from both sides will be performed to evaluate the biological features of the bone.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The current study will explore the implant survival rates, safety, reliability, effectiveness, and practicability of the modified MSFE procedure.

            "abstract": "Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) shows effects in orthodontic pain relief and periodontal inflammation control. The aim of this article is to investigate the analgesic and inflammation-modulatory effects of low-level laser irradiation among orthodontic patients with compromised periodontium. A randomised controlled trial with split-mouth design was conducted in 27 adults with treated and controlled chronic periodontitis over 6 months. One side of the dental arch underwent repeated treatment under a 940-nm diode laser (EZlase; Biolase Technology Inc.) with a beam size of 2.8 cm2 for 60 seconds at 8.6 J/cm2, whilst the other side received pseudo-laser treatment. Laser irradiation was applied repeatedly for 8 times during the first 6 weeks after bracket bonding and monthly thereafter until the end of orthodontic treatment. Subjective pain (assessed by visual analogue scale in pain diary and by chairside archwire activation), periodontal status (assessed by periodontal clinical parameters), cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (interleukin 1β, prostaglandin E2, substance P) and periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola) in supragingival plaque were assessed. The intensity of pain was lower on the laser-irradiated side at multiple follow-up visits (P < 0.05). The pain subsided 1 day earlier on the laser side, with a lower peak value during the first week after initial archwire placement (P < 0.05). The laser side exhibited a smaller reduction in bite force during the first month (mean difference = 3.17, 95% CI: 2.36-3.98, P < 0.05 at 1-week interval; mean difference = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.87-4.32, P < 0.05 at 1-month interval). A smaller increase was observed in the plaque index scores on the laser side at 1-month (mean difference = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.13-0.24, P < 0.05) and in the gingival index scores at the 3-month follow-up visit (mean difference = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14-0.21, P < 0.05). Laser irradiation inhibited the elevation of interleukin-1β, prostaglandin E2 and substance P levels during the first month (P < 0.05). However, no intergroup difference was detected in the bacteria levels. Low-level laser irradiation exhibits benefits in pain relief and inflammation control during the early stage of adjunctive orthodontic treatment in periodontally compromised individuals."

The Silness & Löe GI, Quigley-Hein PI, Eastman Bleeding Index (BI) and trauma were assessed at baseline, 15 and 30 days for each treatment period. After the initial 30-day treatment phase, patients were instructed to cease all flossing during a 14-day \"washout\" period. Subjects were then assigned to the opposite treatment group during the 2nd treatment phase. A 3-factor repeated measures ANOVA analyzed data for differences within and between groups over time. Results revealed statistically significant (p < 0.01) within group improvement in PI, GI, and BI for both treatment groups over time. No statistically significant between group differences were found for either group at any time period. In addition, no significant gingival trauma was recorded and no differences were found between groups. Quik Floss was as effective as finger flossing. Subjects preferred (55%) Quik Floss over finger flossing. In conclusion, Quik Floss is a safe and effective oral hygiene measure for reducing plaque, inflammation and bleeding over time."

Half of the patient's mouth was randomly assigned to AMY-101 (0.1 mg/site) or placebo injections at sites of inflammation, administered on days 0, 7, and 14, and then evaluated for safety and efficacy outcomes on days 28, 60, and 90. The primary efficacy outcome was a change in gingival inflammation, measured by a modified gingival index (MGI), and secondary outcomes included changes in bleeding on probing (BOP), the amount of plaque, pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and gingival crevicular fluid levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) over 90 days.ResultsA once-weekly intragingival injection of AMY-101 for 3 weeks was safe and well tolerated in all participants and resulted in significant (P < 0.001) reductions in clinical indices measuring gingival inflammation (MGI and BOP).

Pain was evaluated weekly, using a visual analog scale (VAS) during first month postoperative.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both groups were effective in reducing GR (ΔGR: MECAF 2.28 mm; TUN 1.93 mm), without significant differences. The % of root coverage was numerically superior favoring MECAF (MECAF 61.24%; TUN 56.07%), without significant differences between groups. VAS scale failed to provide differences between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both treatment were effective in root coverage and might be valuable for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions. The use of vertical releasing incisions and a flap design including the papillae did not hamper root coverage.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      This study compared two techniques for use of ADM in large multiple gingival recessions. Within its limitations, both treatments successfully achieved root coverage and were able to reduce gingival recession. It is expected a partial root coverage when using these techniques in large gingival recessions. The study failed to provide significant differences between groups. The use of modified extended coronally advanced flap may be advisable for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions, specially involving large defects when using ADM, to avoid early matrix exposure."

In the control period, a placebo gel was used. Each treatment period lasted for 4 weeks. This was subsequently followed by 4 weeks of ordinary toothbrushing. Any toothbrushing additional to the therapeutic brushing was performed with a standard commercial dentifrice without abrasives. In addition to the treatment groups, containing a total of 24 subjects, another group of 12 subjects received standardized oral hygiene instruction. Oral hygiene and gingival condition were assessed in all groups throughout the study. The chlorhexidine-containing gel seemed to have no effect on gingivitis and only a slight inhibitory effect on plaque formation. Furthermore, an increase in the degree and frequency of staining of the tooth surfaces related to the use of active gel were observed."

Treatment with levamisole promoted the development of gingivitis and aggravated the severity of established gingivitis, although the amount of bacterial plaque at the gingival margin was not significantly increased. This effect was short-lasting, as the gingival indices returned almost to base-line values by the end of the fifth month after treatment with levamisole. The development of gingivitis was associated with increased in vitro lymphocyte stimulation by antigens from oral bacteria.

Methodology Sixty patients with impacted mandibular third molar were included in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. After surgical extraction of the impacted tooth, patients were allocated into three groups (20 patients each): group 1 received KT (kinesio), group 2 received placebo taping (placebo), and group 3 received no taping (control). The groups were compared regarding facial swelling, pain and trismus. Swelling was evaluated using a tape measuring method. Pain was assessed by a visual analog scale and the number of analgesic tablets taken. Trismus was determined by measuring maximum mouth opening. Results In the KT group, all parameters reduced significantly on 2nd and 4th postoperative days compared to other groups; however, placebo and control groups revealed comparable outcomes. On 7th day, all groups showed comparable results. Conclusions The KT application is an effective method for reducing morbidity after impacted mandibular third molar surgery.

However, there are no published randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the success of supplemental buccal infiltration (BI) in mandibular first versus second molars with IP. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to compare the efficacy of 4% articaine with 2% lidocaine for supplemental BIs in mandibular first versus second molars with IP after a failed inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). This study's sample was combined with data from a previous trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred ninety-nine emergency subjects diagnosed with IP of a mandibular molar were selected and received an IANB with 4% articaine. Subjects who failed to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia, determined by a positive response to cold or pain upon access, randomly received 4% articaine or 2% lidocaine as a supplemental BI.

            "title": "Treating periodontal disease for preventing adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women.",
            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPeriodontal disease has been linked with a number of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and adverse pregnancy outcomes, all likely through systemic inflammatory pathways. It is common in women of reproductive age and gum conditions tend to worsen during pregnancy. Some evidence from observational studies suggests that periodontal intervention may reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is need for a comprehensive Cochrane review of randomised trials to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on perinatal and maternal health.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of treating periodontal disease in pregnant women in order to prevent or reduce perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.\n## SEARCH METHODS\nCochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 6 October 2016), Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (to 7 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 9) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 6 October 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 6 October 2016), and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 6 October 2016). ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 6 October 2016. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of periodontal treatment in preventing or reducing perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. We excluded studies where obstetric outcomes were not reported.\n## DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data using a prepiloted data extraction form. Missing data were obtained by contacting authors and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Where appropriate, results of comparable trials were pooled and expressed as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) . The random-effects model was used for pooling except where there was an insufficient number of studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.\n## MAIN RESULTS\nThere were 15 RCTs (n = 7161 participants) meeting our inclusion criteria. All the included studies were at high risk of bias mostly due to lack of blinding and imbalance in baseline characteristics of participants. The studies recruited pregnant women from prenatal care facilities who had periodontitis (14 studies) or gingivitis (1 study).The two main comparisons were: periodontal treatment versus no treatment during pregnancy and periodontal treatment versus alternative periodontal treatment. The head-to-head comparison between periodontal treatments assessed a more intensive treatment versus a less intensive one.Eleven studies compared periodontal treatment with no treatment during pregnancy. The meta-analysis shows no clear difference in preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10; 5671 participants; 11 studies; low-quality evidence) between periodontal treatment and no treatment. There is low-quality evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight < 2500 g (9.70% with periodontal treatment versus 12.60% without treatment; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; 3470 participants; 7 studies).It is unclear whether periodontal treatment leads to a difference in preterm birth < 35 weeks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.76; 2557 participants; 2 studies; ) and < 32 weeks (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.32; 2755 participants; 3 studies), low birth weight < 1500 g (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.70; 2550 participants; 2 studies), perinatal mortality (including fetal and neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.43; 5320 participants; 7 studies; very low-quality evidence), and pre-eclampsia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62; 2946 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence). There is no evidence of a difference in small for gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 3610 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence) when periodontal treatment is compared with no treatment.Four studies compared periodontal treatment with alternative periodontal treatment. Data pooling was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity. The outcomes reported were preterm birth < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g and perinatal mortality (very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g and perinatal mortality when different periodontal treatments are compared because the quality of evidence is very low.Maternal mortality and adverse effects of the intervention did not occur in any of the studies that reported on either of the outcomes.\n## AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nIt is not clear if periodontal treatment during pregnancy has an impact on preterm birth (low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight (< 2500 g), however, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. There is insufficient evidence to determine which periodontal treatment is better in preventing adverse obstetric outcomes. Future research should aim to report periodontal outcomes alongside obstetric outcomes.\n"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Periodontitis, which progressively destroys tooth-supporting structures, is one of the most widespread infectious diseases and the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Evidence from preclinical trials and small-scale pilot clinical studies indicates that stem cells derived from periodontal ligament tissues are a promising therapy for the regeneration of lost/damaged periodontal tissue. This study assessed the safety and feasibility of using autologous periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) as an adjuvant to grafting materials in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) to treat periodontal intrabony defects. Our data provide primary clinical evidence for the efficacy of cell transplantation in regenerative dentistry.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a single-center, randomized trial that used autologous PDLSCs in combination with bovine-derived bone mineral materials to treat periodontal intrabony defects. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to either the Cell group (treatment with GTR and PDLSC sheets in combination with Bio-oss(®)) or the Control group (treatment with GTR and Bio-oss(®) without stem cells). During a 12-month follow-up study, we evaluated the frequency and extent of adverse events. For the assessment of treatment efficacy, the primary outcome was based on the magnitude of alveolar bone regeneration following the surgical procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 30 periodontitis patients aged 18 to 65 years (48 testing teeth with periodontal intrabony defects) who satisfied our inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the Cell group or the Control group. A total of 21 teeth were treated in the Control group and 20 teeth were treated in the Cell group. All patients received surgery and a clinical evaluation. No clinical safety problems that could be attributed to the investigational PDLSCs were identified. Each group showed a significant increase in the alveolar bone height (decrease in the bone-defect depth) over time (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were detected between the Cell group and the Control group (p > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrates that using autologous PDLSCs to treat periodontal intrabony defects is safe and does not produce significant adverse effects. The efficacy of cell-based periodontal therapy requires further validation by multicenter, randomized controlled studies with an increased sample size.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \nNCT01357785 Date registered: 18 May 2011."

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate whether treating periodontal disease prevents preterm birth and other major complications of pregnancy.\n## METHODS\nThis single-center trial was conducted across six obstetric sites in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Pregnant women identified by history to be at risk (n=3,737) were examined for periodontal disease. Approximately 1,000 women with periodontal disease were allocated at random to receive periodontal treatment commencing around 20 weeks of gestation (n=542) or 6 weeks after the pregnancy was completed (controls; n=540). The treatment included mechanical removal of oral biofilms together with oral hygiene instruction and motivation at a minimum of three weekly visits, with further visits if required.\n## RESULTS\nThere were no differences between the control and treatment groups in preterm birth (9.3% compared with 9.7%, odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI 0.7-1.58], P=.81), birth weight (3,450 compared with 3,410 g, P=.12), preeclampsia (4.1% compared with 3.4%, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44-1.56, P=.55), or other obstetric endpoints. There were four unexplained stillbirths in the control group and no pregnancy losses in the treated group (P=.12). Measures of fetal and neonatal well-being were similar in the two groups, including abnormalities in fetal heart rate recordings (P=.26), umbilical artery flow studies (P=.96), and umbilical artery blood gas values (P=.37). The periodontal treatment was highly successful in improving health of the gums (P<.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nThe evidence provided by the present study does not support the hypothesis that treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy in this population prevents preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, or preeclampsia.

Seventy-eight healthy adults were enrolled in a modified experimental gingivitis clinical trial. Four weeks before the baseline visit, subjects received a prophylaxis and were instructed to brush twice daily in a manner to approach optimum gingival health. At the end of the 4-week period, subjects were randomly assigned to treatment and instructed to use 20 ml of their assigned product for 30 seconds after brushing twice daily during a 21-day treatment phase. Plaque removal by brushing was prevented during the treatment phase for one mandibular quadrant (experimental gingivitis region) by means of a specially-manufactured tooth shield. Safety and efficacy measurements were obtained at baseline and at the end-of-treatment using the Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), and Modified Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (MQH). At all visits, an oral soft tissue examination was performed for each subject.

Studies in the late 1990s associated periodontitis with preterm low birth weight (PLBW) deliveries, and this may have similar pathogenic mechanisms as other maternal infections. This study determined the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on pregnancy outcome.\n## METHODS\nA total of 200 pregnant women with periodontitis were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Detailed data about previous and current pregnancies were obtained. All women received a full-mouth periodontal examination, including oral hygiene index-simplified, bleeding index, and clinical attachment level. The women in the treatment group received non-surgical periodontal therapy during the gestational period, and those in the control group received periodontal treatment after delivery. Periodontal therapy included plaque control instructions and scaling and root planing performed under local anesthesia. The outcome measures assessed were gestational age and birth weight of the infant. PTB was recorded when delivery occurred at <37 weeks of gestation, and low birth weight (LBW) was recorded when the infant weighed<2,500 g.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 53 PTBs in the treatment group and 68 PTBs in the control group. Twenty-six LBW infants were recorded in the treatment group, and 48 LBW infants were noted in the control group. The mean gestational ages were 33.8+/-2.8 weeks and 32.7+/-2.8 weeks in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The difference was statistically significant at P<0.006. The mean birth weight was 2,565.3+/-331.2 g in the treatment group and 2,459.6+/-380.7 g in the control group, with the difference being statistically significant at P<0.044. A multiple regression model showed a significant effect of periodontal treatment on birth outcomes.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nNon-surgical periodontal therapy can reduce the risk for preterm births in mothers who are affected by periodontitis. Additional multicentered, randomized, controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this link between periodontitis and PLBW.\n"

            "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate if different periods of supervised oral hygiene prior to the experimental gingivitis trial have an effect on the amount of inflammation which develops in the 'toothshield' model. Two groups were compared. One group (Group A) was supervised over a 5-month period before experimental gingivitis. Six months later Group A participated in a second trial, this time receiving only a 1-month pretrial. A second group (Group B) which served as a control was supervised over a pre-trial period of 1-month prior to the start of the experimental gingivitis phase. During the pre-trial period all subjects undertook a regime of vigorous oral hygiene which included polishing of the test quadrant in the upper jaw and supervised subgingival brushing, interdental taping or the use of toothpicks. The presence of plaque and bleeding were assessed. Following the pre-trial period all plaque control measures in the experimental area were prevented during oral hygiene periods by the temporary placement of soft, loosely fitting vinyl toothshield guard. During this period they accumulated plaque rapidly and developed a generalized gingivitis. The results of this study indicate that, irrespective of the length of the pretrial period, subjects by group develop a comparable mean level of plaque and gingival bleeding. However, the extent to which gingivitis develops differs among individuals and was for a number of subjects not consistent. Therefore, in designing an experimental gingivitis trial care should be taken to include a sufficient number of subjects to account for individual variation."

No systemic side effects were observed, but an asymptomatic brown tongue stain was observed in about half of the subjects. There was no evidence to suggest that alexidine disturbed the relative composition of the microorganisms in plague, but there was a suggestion that it decreased the number of microorganisms almost 2-fold when compared with the placebo group."

Thirty-four subjects, randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, took part in this randomized double-blind parallel study.

One group also received an active dentifrice and oral rinse containing sanguinaria extract (an antiplaque agent) and zinc chloride. The other group received a placebo dentifrice and oral rinse. The gingival index (GI), plaque index (PLI) and probing pocket depths (PD) were recorded at six sites per tooth at baseline, two weeks after initial therapy and six weeks after initial therapy. There was no significant difference between the groups for any of the parameters at the baseline examination. Two weeks following initial therapy both groups showed a statistically significant increase in the number of sites with PLI of 0 or 1 (p < 0.0001) and a statistically significant increase in the number of sites with a GI of 0 or 1 (that is, no bleeding on probing), (p < 0.0001).

These changes were maintained through to six weeks post therapy. There was no significant advantage to the sanguinaria group. Results demonstrate that initial therapy in the form of oral hygiene instruction, scaling and root planing leads to a significant improvement in periodontal status which is maintained at least in the short term. Further, use of a dentifrice and oral rinse containing sanguinaria did not improve the efficacy of initial therapy."

Nine young male beagle dogs were divided into three groups as determined by clinical status of the gingiva following implementation of a protocol designed to produce gingival health and disease. An electromechanical device was used to advance 0.6 mm diameter probes into the facial gingival crevices of selected teeth and to obtain force-displacement curves. The instrument stopped the probe at pressure of either 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, or 2560 kPa which were randomly allocated to 12 test teeth in each dog. After the probe came to rest, it was attached to the tooth. When all 12 probes were attached, the animal was sacrificed. Blocks consisting of gingiva, probe, and tooth were processed to obtain two buccolingual sections, one containing the probe and the other immediately adjacent to it. Clinical and histometric measurements were performed and the data evaluated. Although three groups of animals were discernable by clinical criteria, only two groups, health and disease, could be formulated based on the degree of histologic inflammation. The histologic grouping was used in data analysis. Histometric distances from the cemento-enamel junction to the base of the crevice (cJ), to most coronal connective tissue attachment (cC) and to the probe tip (cP) all increased with change from health to disease.

Each patient was randomly assigned with regard to the sequence of interdental product used and recalled.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both groups showed statistically significant decreases of plaque after a single usage, respectively. Bleeding was statistically significantly reduced after 4 weeks, with no statistically significant differences concerning between the two tested interdental brushes. Rubber interdental bristles reached significantly higher scores with regard to patient acceptance in overall assessment and in sub-items for less pain during usage, comfort of brushing, and willingness to buy the product.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Rubber interdental bristles were similarly effective compared to the interdental brushes. In addition, rubber interdental bristles were significantly more comfortable for participants than metal-core brushes.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      Rubber interdental bristles can be used as an alternative interdental cleaning product which may be more accepted by patients."

Participants randomized to the \"frequent therapy\" (FT) protocol received scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instructions at two-month intervals and were provided a 0.12% chlorhexidine rinse for home use twice daily. Neither systemic nor local antibiotics were provided to either group. Subjects were asked to report any changes in diabetic medications, nutrition, and physical activity. Data analyses (ANOVA, t-test, Mann-Whitney) grouped subjects according to baseline HbA1c (>7 and < 9%, or > 9%), treatment protocol (minimal or frequent), and +/- medication change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In both MT and FT groups the clinical attachment level (CAL) remained unchanged but the other measures [gingival index (GI) and pocket dept (PD)] of periodontal health improved.

At six months, the largest reduction of HbA1c was 3.7; experienced by a subject receiving FT but no changes in diabetic medication. Among the MT and no medication change subjects, the maximum reduction was 1.6. Overall mean reduction in HbA1c of 27 subjects with baseline HbA1c >9.0 and no medication change was 0.6 with no statistical difference between the MT and FT groups. Among the medication-change subjects with baseline HbA1c >9.0, mean reduction of 1.38 was seen with FT compared to 1.10 with MT.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overall, modest improvements in HbA1c were detected with a trend towards FT being better than MT. Although this pilot trial was under-powered to detect small between-group differences, the magnitude of our findings (0.6 mean improvement in HbA1c) matches closely findings from the only meta-analysis conducted on this topic to date.

Both mouthrinses have been shown to control dental plaque and gingivitis in short and longer term studies. The aim of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of these two mouthrinses using a 2-week experimental gingivitis model. Qualified subjects were randomly assigned to one of three mouthrinse groups: a fixed combination of EOs, 0.07% CPC, or negative control (C) rinse. Following baseline clinical assessments and a dental prophylaxis, subjects began a two-week period in which they rinsed twice daily with their assigned rinse and abstained from any mechanical oral hygiene procedures or other oral care products. Subjects were reassessed at the end of the two-week period. One hundred and forty-seven subjects were randomized and 142 completed this study. After two weeks use, the EOs rinse was superior (p < 0.011) to the CPC rinse in inhibiting the development of gingivitis, plaque, and bleeding, with 9.4% and 6.6% reductions compared to CPC for gingivitis and plaque, respectively. Both rinses were superior to the negative control rinse (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that the essential oil-containing mouthrinse has superior antiplaque/antigingivitis effectiveness compared to the 0.07% CPC-containing mouthrinse without mechanical oral hygiene influence."

A total of 60 extracted human mandibular molar teeth had artificial calculus applied to the furcations, then were randomly treated with either sharp universal Gracey curettes (HAND), a plain ultrasonic TFI-10 tip in a cavitron instrument (CAV), or one of 2 diamond-coated cavitron instruments (TFI-10 fine-grit (FIN) and TFI-10 medium-grit (MED)) When the time needed to completely clean the furcations was evaluated, MED was the fastest, followed by FIN, CAV, and HAND, respectively. All of the powered instruments were faster than hand curettes with regard to effective in vitro calculus removal in furcations. The use of these types of instruments would reduce the time required to perform periodontal surgery and might improve regenerative therapy."

The present study evaluated periodontal wound healing after scaling and root planing (SRP) with subgingival application of EMD for treatment of experimental periodontitis. Periodontal breakdown was induced by applying silk ligatures around mandibular third and fourth premolars of six beagle dogs until radiographic bone loss progressed to approximately half of the root length. Probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were proximally measured 2 weeks after ligature removal (baseline). Mesial and distal surfaces of the experimental teeth were subjected to SRP and randomized using a split-mouth design to subgingival application of EMD (test) or normal saline (control). PPD and CAL were re-evaluated at 11 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks for histological analyses. No significant differences were observed in PPD and CAL between both groups at baseline and at 11 weeks. Histologically, test sites exhibited a greater amount of new cementum than that did the control sites (p < 0.01). Moreover, the control sites revealed increased epithelial downgrowth compared with the test sites: (p < 0.05). On the other hand, no intergroup differences were detected in terms of bone position, connective tissue attachment, gingival recession, and planed root length.

            "abstract": "This study was aimed to verify the debridement potential of the Caridex system against radicular cervical caries. 14 freshly extracted teeth with cervical caries were split and the fragments were freed from the dentinal caries using three methods: root planning (with a white stone), conventional excavation with a bur (tungsten) and the Caridex system. The results show that the Caridex system can partially dissolve the decayed dentin but leaves behind smeared surfaces as well as part of dentin infiltrated by bacteria. The root planning treatment smears the dentinal surface and thus blocks the tubules which also appeared to be infiltrated with bacteria. The excavation method allowed for a complete elimination of the decayed dentinal tissue down to the hypermineralized zone."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to examine the anti-malodor, anti-gingivitis, and plaque reducing properties of a 2 phase oil:water mouthrinse compared with a control mouthrinse. Fifty subjects rinsed with one of the two rinses for 30 seconds twice a day over 6 weeks, while continuing their normal oral hygiene habits. Measurements were made at time zero (prior to beginning the rinsing regimen), and > or = 9 hours following rinsing, at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 weeks. Malodor of whole mouth, as well as tongue dorsum anterior and posterior, was assessed on a 0 to 5 semi-integer scale by two odor judges. Volatile sulphide compounds (VSC) were determined using a sulphide monitor. Gingival, plaque, and bleeding indices were recorded for Ramfjord teeth. Oral microbial levels were assessed using the oratest. Salivary levels of diamines (putrescine and cadaverine) were analyzed by HPLC. Results were analyzed by 2-tailed covariant ANOVA, with the time zero value as covariant. Dramatic improvements were observed in parameters associated with malodor, periodontal health, plaque accumulation, and microbial levels in both groups. As compared to time zero scores, whole mouth odor, tongue dorsum anterior and posterior odors decreased continuously over time, attaining 80%, 79% and 70%, reductions, respectively following 6 weeks, in the 2-phase mouthrinse group, versus 70%, 77% and 59% for the control group. For whole mouth and tongue dorsum posterior, the reductions observed in the 2-phase mouthrinse group were significantly greater than those obtained with the control mouthrinse (P = 0.026 and P = 0.025, respectively), suggesting that the 2-phase mouthrinse is superior to the control mouthrinse in long-term reduction of oral malodor. For bleeding index, gingival index, oral microbial levels, and VSC, differences between the groups were not significant. Diamine levels were not significantly reduced in either group. The control mouthrinse reduced plaque index more significantly than the 2-phase mouthrinse (P < 0.005). The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that the 2-phase oil:water mouthrinse formulation is superior to the control mouthrinse in long-term reduction of oral malodor."

Cavitated primary molars of 302 children 6-7 years of age were treated according to the CRT, ART and UCT protocols at the school compound. Children's parents completed the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) at baseline and one year later. Paired t-test, Chi-square test and ANOVA were applied in analysing the data. Questionnaires from 277 and 160 children were collected at baseline and after 1 year, respectively. A statistically significant difference in B-ECOHIS scores over the 1-year period was found for domains 'child symptoms' (P = 0.03) and 'child psychology' (P = 0.02). Treatment protocols did not statistically significantly influence the changes in B-ECOHIS scores over the 1-year period (P = 0.78).

For pockets initially greater than or equal to 7 mm there was no difference between pocket depth on molar and nonmolar teeth following scaling and root planing alone. However, there was less overall pocket depth on nonmolars than molars following the flap procedure, indicating a greater effect of pocket reduction on nonmolar than molar teeth with the flap procedure.

The study was a double-blind controlled, parallel, balanced group design, extending over 6 months. A total of 297 volunteers commenced the study after screening for a minimum acceptance level of gingivitis. At baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, stain, gingival, bleeding and plaque indices were recorded, together with a calculus index at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. After a baseline prophylaxis, volunteers used the allocated product 2 x per day, with no other oral hygiene instructions given. Plaque, gingival and bleeding scores improved in all 3 groups, but to an overall significantly greater extent in the active groups. However, staining and calculus indices were significantly increased in the active compared to the control group. If the local side-effects of chlorhexidine are considered to be acceptable, these chlorhexidine toothpastes could be recommended for the same clinical applications as other chlorhexidine products. The apparent compatibility of fluoride with chlorhexidine in the one product may be pertinent to caries prevention."

In both groups, the M3 was extracted using a piezosurgical device, and the distal root surface of M2 was scaled and root planned. In addition, the removed alveolar bone was grinded to particles and grafted to the distal osseous defect of M2 in the test group. The primary outcome variable was the osseous defect depth (ODD), the secondary outcome variables were probing pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) on the disto-buccal aspect of the M2 during a 12-month follow-up period. Postoperative symptom at 7-day postoperatively and adverse events were also recorded and analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The patient characteristics were homogeneous between the 2 groups. Six and 12 months after surgery, there were statistically significant bone fill in both groups (P ＜ .01). Moreover, the ODD and CAL in the test group were significantly lower than the control group at every postoperative re-entry (P ＜ .01). The postoperative symptom was more severe in the test group than the control group, but the difference was not significant (P > .05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The result of this study demonstrated that scaling and root planning was beneficial to periodontal healing of M2 after impacted M3 extraction.

Thirteen volunteers were selected with one pair of or more intrabony defects and probing pocket depth (PPD) > or = 5 mm. All individuals received instructions regarding oral hygiene and were submitted to scaling and root planing. Each participant received the two treatment modalities: test sites were treated with OFD and EMP, and control sites received only OFD.

Accumulation of microbial dental plaque is the primary aetiological factor for both periodontal disease and caries. Effective self-care (tooth brushing and interdental aids) for plaque control and removal of risk factors such as calculus, which can only be removed by periodontal instrumentation (PI), are considered necessary to prevent and treat periodontal disease thereby maintaining periodontal health. Despite evidence of an association between sustained, good oral hygiene and a low incidence of periodontal disease and caries in adults there is a lack of strong and reliable evidence to inform clinicians of the relative effectiveness (if any) of different types of Oral Hygiene Advice (OHA).

Following active treatment patients were maintained with prophylaxis done every 3 months and scored annually. For the analysis of this two-year data, a repeated measures analysis of variance was performed using attachment level change and pocket depths as outcome indicators. There was significantly greater gain of clinical periodontal attachment in patients who received an OA compared to those who did not.

Patients who met the exclusion criteria consented to enter the study in the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) or the closed (MMF) study group. Six to 8 MMF screws were used to obtain intermaxillary fixation (IMF) in the 2 groups. Screw failure was documented. All screws were removed at 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Insertional torque (IT) was measured at time of screw placement to assess primary stability. Clinical and photographic documentation was performed to assess fracture healing, occlusion, and gingival health. Ten-centimeter visual analog scales were used to assess patient-centered outcomes. Cone-beam computed tomography was performed to assess the long-term effects on the periodontium and roots. A cost comparison was performed to determine whether the use of screws was cost effective compared with arch bars.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen men and 5 women (mean age, 25.2 yr) entered the study. All patients displayed adequate fracture healing based on clinical examination. All patients had acceptable occlusion at 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Total screw failure was 27 of 106 screws (25.5%). Forty percent of screws placed in the MMF group failed compared with only 6% in the ORIF group. Gingival health scores were favorable. Factors that had a significant effect on screw failure included a lower IT (P = .002), use in closed (MMF) treatment (P < .001), and use in the posterior jaw (P = .012). Minimal pain was associated with the MMF screws and pre-existing occlusion was re-established based on patients' subjective responses. The MMF group reported a statistically significant lower quality of life (P < .001) compared with the ORIF group. There was only 1 screw site that had a facial cortical bone defect noted at 6-month follow-up CBCT examination. There were no discernible long-term root defects. Cost analysis showed that the use of MMF screws saved around $600 per patient in operating room usage cost alone compared with the estimated use of arch bars.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Uncomplicated mandible fractures were successfully treated using MMF screws in open and closed treatments. However, the utility in closed treatment was decreased because of significant screw failure and patient noncompliance. The screws were well tolerated by the patients. There was minimal long-term damage to the periodontium and dental roots. The cost of screws was more than offset by time savings."

Twenty generally healthy volunteers with an average age of 36.6 years underwent a KD for 6 weeks. Their compliance was monitored by measuring their urinary ketones daily and by keeping 7-day food records. Clinical oral parameters included plaque (PI), gingival inflammation (GI), a complete periodontal status (probing depths, bleeding on probing), and general physical and serologic parameters at baseline and after 6 weeks. The results showed a trend towards lower plaque values, but with no significant changes from baseline to the end of the study with regard to the clinical periodontal parameters. However, their body weight and BMI measurements showed a significant decrease. The regression analyses showed that the fat mass and the BMI were significantly positively correlated to periodontal inflammation, while HDL, fiber, and protein intake were negatively correlated to periodontal inflammation. The KD change did not lead to clinical changes in periodontal parameters in healthy participants under continued oral hygiene, but it did lead to a significant weight loss."

Fifty to 70% of patients treated with braces encounter these problems. Their care in the USA represents an annual cost of five hundred million dollars. Initial education and motivation for oral hygiene depend on two categories of factors: firstly, practical prophylactic measures (instruments and medication, professional care) and secondly, the educational component: choice of communication technique, frequency, and nature of hygiene instructions. This trial aims to study this last component. Its main objective is to compare three methods' effectiveness of oral hygiene education in adolescent patients treated with braces in terms of biofilm (plaque) control. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of these methods' effectiveness regarding gingival inflammation and the maintenance of hygiene during the first 6 months of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial of superiority.

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine clinical and microbiological features in subjects who showed different levels of attachment change post-therapy. 40 subjects were subset into 3 groups based on mean attachment level change post-therapy. 10 poor response subjects showed mean attachment loss; 19 moderate response subjects showed mean attachment gain between 0.02-0.5 mm and 11 good response subjects showed a mean gain of attachment > 0.5 mm. Clinical parameters were measured at 6 sites per tooth both pre- and post-therapy. Microbiological samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and evaluated individually for their content of 14 subgingival taxa using a colony lift method and DNA probes. % of sites colonized by each species was computed for each subject both pre- and post-therapy. Significant differences were observed among treatment response groups for mean probing pocket depth, attachment level and % of sites with plaque pre-therapy. The poor response subjects had the lowest mean probing pocket depth and attachment level, but the highest plaque levels.

From the 2-week postoperative visit to 1 year postloading, the mean MBL change in the PSRC group was 0.21 ± 0.56 mm and in the PMSC group it was 0.74 ± 0.47 mm. Soft tissue profiles were stable over time, with no significant differences between groups. There were no significant differences between groups in the number of microbial species seen. Patients in both groups were highly satisfied with postoperative and postprosthetic experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this study, the PSRC method preserved marginal bone by a mean of 0.53 mm more than the standard PMSC protocol. Within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that the PSRC protocol may be beneficial in marginal bone preservation. Longitudinal studies are needed to verify the long-term effects of this approach."

The haemoglobin levels in saliva/toothpaste slurry (TPS) were analysed, followed by a full-mouth periodontal examination. Periodontal diagnoses were made based on the 2017 classification of periodontal diseases. Gingival inflammation was defined as presence of at least 10% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP). Logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses were applied to assess the accuracy of GBoB.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 37.1% of the subjects claimed self-reported GBoB, and they had higher values of BOP (median: 25.0%; interquartile range (IQR): 16.0%-37.5%) than those without GBoB (median: 13.5%; IQR: 8.0%-24.8%, p < .001). The concentration/total amount of haemoglobin in TPS was positively correlated with the number of bleeding sites (r = .409/r = .520, p < .001). Haemoglobin concentration of 90.58 μg/ml or 0.51 μl blood volume enabled visual detection of GBoB with an AUROC of 0.848. Self-reported GBoB exhibited significantly increased values of diagnostic odds ratios (3-8) for varying degrees of gingival inflammation and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). It showed low to moderate accuracy for discriminating periodontitis and gingivitis from periodontal health, with a sensitivity of 37.1% and 61.3% and a specificity of 84.8% and 84.4%, respectively. Absence of self-reported GBoB and low levels of haemoglobin had 93%-98% predictive values for periodontal health.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite its low sensitivity for the discrimination of periodontitis, self-reported GBoB is a promising sentinel sign for periodontal health and disease, and gingival inflammation in particular.

Results showed that acupuncture reduced the preoperative and percussion pain levels significantly more than placebo group at all day intervals (P < .05). For postoperative pain at the 7-day follow-up, the pain ranged from \"mild\" to \"no pain\" in G1, compared with \"moderate\" to \"minimal\" in G2. Only one patient required postoperative analgesics in the acupuncture group compared to eight patients for placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative acupuncture can be beneficial in reducing postoperative pain in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis."

At baseline, subjects received a complete oral soft tissue examination and scoring of the Loe-Silness gingival index (GI), Quigley-Hein plaque index (PI), Volpe-Manhold calculus index (CI), and Lobene extrinsic tooth stain index (SI). Following a complete dental prophylaxis, subjects started rinsing twice daily with their respective mouthrinse as an adjunct to their usual mechanical oral hygiene procedures. One of the rinses on each weekday was supervised. Subjects were reexamined at 3 and 6 months. The treatment groups were compared with respect to baseline demographic and clinical variables. The primary efficacy variables were GI and PI.

Four study groups were examined: (i) minocycline-scaled, (ii) minocycline-unscaled, (iii) placebo-scaled, and (iv) placebo-unscaled. The minocycline-scaled group responded most favorably, with improved gingival health for at least 49 days and with marked reductions in total bacterial counts and proportions of spirochetes for at least 70 days (termination of the study). Minocycline administration with no periodontal scaling and root planing also resulted major, long-lasting shifts in the subgingival microflora. Scaling alone was least effective in changing the microflora. The data indicated that minocycline may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of periodontal disease.

We studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment on preterm birth.\n## METHODS\nWe randomly assigned women between 13 and 17 weeks of gestation to undergo scaling and root planing either before 21 weeks (413 patients in the treatment group) or after delivery (410 patients in the control group). Patients in the treatment group also underwent monthly tooth polishing and received instruction in oral hygiene. The gestational age at the end of pregnancy was the prespecified primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were birth weight and the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age.\n## RESULTS\nIn the follow-up analysis, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) occurred in 49 of 407 women (12.0%) in the treatment group (resulting in 44 live births) and in 52 of 405 women (12.8%) in the control group (resulting in 38 live births). Although periodontal treatment improved periodontitis measures (P<0.001), it did not significantly alter the risk of preterm delivery (P=0.70; hazard ratio for treatment group vs. control group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.37). There were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups in birth weight (3239 g vs. 3258 g, P=0.64) or in the rate of delivery of infants that were small for gestational age (12.7% vs. 12.3%; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.58). There were 5 spontaneous abortions or stillbirths in the treatment group, as compared with 14 in the control group (P=0.08).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of periodontitis in pregnant women improves periodontal disease and is safe but does not significantly alter rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, or fetal growth restriction.

Any side effects that were noted and the patients' acceptance of the method were recorded by a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10. Moreover, epoxy casts from the study teeth were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy in order to detect any potential changes in the enamel surface due to treatments. Thirty-nine volunteers participated in the study and were allocated randomly to one of three different bleaching treatments: Group A (n=13) used Whitestrips (over-the-counter technique; one cycle=30 minutes), Group B (n=13) used Opalescence PF 10% (at-home bleaching technique; one cycle=8 hours) and Group C (n=13) used Opalescence Xtra Boost (in-office bleaching technique; one cycle=15 minutes) until a defined whitening of six tabs compared to the baseline were reached (assessed by the VITA shade guide). All three methods achieved six grades of whitening. The mean treatment time required to reach the defined level of whitening was 31.85 +/- 6.63 cycles in Group A, 7.15 +/- 1.86 cycles in Group B and 3.15 +/- 0.55 cycles in Group C. All products differed significantly from each other in terms of treatment cycles and required treatment time (p<0.001 by ANOVA and Mann-Whitney-U-test). Using the VA scale, side effects noted within the three groups were minimal. Tooth hypersensitivity ranged from 2.62 (Whitestrips) to 3.38 (Opalescence PF), and gingival irritation ranged between 0.23 (Opalescence Xtra Boost) and 0.85 (Whitestrips). The most accepted method was the at-home bleaching technique. None of the teeth studied showed detectable enamel surface changes in the subsequent SEM analysis using 200x and 2000x magnification."

Based upon the age of the patients and the location of the diseased sites, the patients were divided into 2 groups; a juvenile periodontitis group (JP) and a post-juvenile periodontitis group (post-JP). The patients in the JP group had periodontal lesions only at first molars and incisors. All 16 subjects were in excellent general health and none had been treated with antibiotics during a period of at least 12 months prior to the 1st examination. At a baseline examination and 6, 24 and 60 months after active therapy, the diseased sites were examined regarding plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depths, probing attachment level, recession of the gingival margin and marginal alveolar bone level. Following a case presentation and instruction in proper oral hygiene measures, the 16 subjects were subjected to periodontal treatment, utilizing a split mouth design. By random selection, the diseased sites in one side of the jaws were treated by scaling and root planing in conjunction with a \"modified Widman flap\" procedure, while in the contralateral jaw quadrants treatment was restricted to scaling and root planing. During the 1st 6 months following active therapy, the patients were subjected to professional tooth cleaning once every 4 weeks. Subsequently, the interval between the recall appointment was 3 months. 2 years after treatment, this maintenance care program was terminated. A final examination was performed 5 years after therapy. None of the patients involved in the trial received antibiotic treatment during the 5 years of observation. The findings of the present study revealed that the response of the periodontal tissues to therapy, both in the JP and the post-JP group of patients, was almost identical to that found for similar types of treatment in patients with adult periodontitis. The re-examinations performed after 6, 24 and 60 months following active therapy of JP and post-JP lesions revealed that excision of the granulation tissue in conjunction with flap elevation did not enhance the degree of probing pocket depth reduction, probing attachment gain and bone fill that occurred following meticulous root surface instrumentation."

The present study assessed the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Two hundred forty-six eligible women were randomly divided into two groups: periodontitis intervention (n = 122; undergoing non-surgical treatment during gestation) and periodontitis control (n = 124; not treated during gestation). Univariate analysis was performed and estimates of relative risk were reported. Data from 225 women were analyzed. No differences for preterm birth (p = 0.721), low birth weight (p = 0.198), and preterm low birth weight (p = 0.732) rates were observed. Relative risk estimates for preterm birth, low birth weight, and preterm low birth weight in the periodontitis intervention group were 0.915 (95% CI 0.561-1.493), 0.735 (95% CI 0.459-1.179), and 0.927 (0.601-1.431), respectively.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was introduced in periodontology as an adjunctive approach to non-surgical periodontal treatment (NPT) in periodontitis patients. In this trial, the aim was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of adjunctive PDT to NPT in patients with GAgP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective controlled clinical study, 24 systemically healthy, non-smoking subjects with GAgP were enrolled. Subjects were randomly assigned into a control group (n = 12) treated with NPT only or to a test group (n = 12) treated with NPT and PDT. Plaque index, sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing depth (PD), relative attachment level, gingival recession, and tooth mobility were recorded at baseline and on day 63. Microbiological samples were obtained from the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm at both time periods and evaluated for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola via micro-IDent® test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Clinical and microbial parameters declined significantly in both groups after the treatments (P < 0.01). The comparisons between the groups showed that only the full mouth SBI score of the test group was significantly lower than the control group on day 63 (P < 0.05). Although the reduction in periodontopathogens of the test group was greater than the control group, there was no significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Within the limits of this study, it can be concluded that in the treatment of GAgP, usage of PDT as an adjunct to NPT does not lead to any beneficial effects on the investigated clinical and microbiological parameters except for SBI. Nevertheless, the statistically significant difference for the SBI score demonstrates that PDT may have additional effect on the reduction in gingival bleeding. Lasers Surg.

Postoperative pain intensity was self-recorded by subjects at 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours after extraction, using visual analogue scale (VAS). Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, 2-sample Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis rank test. Statistical analysis was done using intention-to-treat analysis.

Following a period of stringent oral hygiene, 103 dental students were scored for plaque and gingival bleeding assessed by 4 methods. From this group, 41 volunteers were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups. Dental students with clean teeth and healthy gingivae were asked to abolish all mechanical tooth cleaning in the lower jaw for a period of 3-weeks. During the 21-day experimental period, chlorhexidine (Peridex) or a placebo mouthrinse was applied to the lower jaw. Subjects brushed the upper jaw with a standard toothpaste. In principal, 2 different methods were employed to provoke bleeding: (1) at the marginal gingival tissue by running a probe along the soft tissue wall at the orifice of the pocket, and (2) by probing to the \"bottom\" of the pocket. Variations in the methods were based on angulation (AngBI, ParBI) of the probe in relation to the tooth surface and to the probing force (PPBI.25N, PPBI.75N). 1 randomly selected quadrant in the lower jaw was scored using the AngBI. The opposing quadrant was scored with a randomly-allocated bleeding index, either ParBI, PPBI.25N or PPBI.75N. The results of this study confirm earlier findings that the angulation of the probe determines the number of sites with bleeding observed. It also indicates that bleeding as elicited by probing to the bottom of the pocket is a poor indicator of early gingivitis. It is recommended that gingivitis should be assessed by probing the marginal gingiva."

They were randomized to one of the following four groups: control group, aPDT group, LLLT group, and aPDT and LLLT group. Patients were blinded to the group assigned. The outcome variables were postoperative pain and edema. Pain intensity was measured on a visual analog scale (recorded every day for 7 days after tooth extraction). Facial edema was assessed by measuring the perimeter between the tragus, base of the jaw, and labial commissure, which was recorded once before surgery and then on the third and seventh days after surgery. Other variables were age, sex, ethnicity, decayed/missing/filled teeth, and tooth types. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed and statistical significance was set at a value of P < .05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The sample was composed of 40 patients with a mean age of 41.25 ± 13.97 years and 25 (62.5%) of them were women. There were 10 subjects in each treatment group. The mean of postoperative pain within the groups was associated with a significant continuous decrease over time (P < .05). Postoperative pain was lowest in the aPDT + LLLT group in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th day after tooth extraction (P < .05).

When they had less than 20% approximal bleeding sites, they entered a 14-day trial period of 'experimental gingivitis'. Subjects returned 30 days later, after resuming normal oral hygiene procedures, for a final gingival assessment. A split-mouth design was chosen using 2 contra-lateral quadrants for each index (being either BOMP or BOPP). A consistently higher bleeding score of approximately 10% was observed by probing to the bottom of the pocket. At day 14 with both indices, a significant difference between smokers and non-smokers was detected (BOMP: sm=15%, nsm=30%; BOPP: sm=27%, nsm=44%). The increment between gingival health and experimental gingivitis was significantly higher in non-smokers than in smokers but comparable for both indices (BOMP: sm=8%, nsm=23%; BOPP: sm=9%, nsm=26%). Probing to the bottom of the pocket results in significantly more bleeding in gingival health and gingivitis as compared to probing of the marginal gingiva. This shows that evaluation of the gingival condition with BOMP, the method of choice with respect to gingivitis, can be used as a parameter for inflammation when comparing smokers and non-smokers. The suppressed inflammatory response to plaque accumulation, as observed in smokers, indicates that they should be identified as a separate group when they participate as panelists in (experimentally induced) gingivitis studies."

Oral health assessments were performed at baseline, at 3 months and 6 months post-intervention. Within- and between-group changes in dental plaque were assessed over time. Regression analyses were conducted on dental plaque levels at 6 months controlling for OHP group, medical, dental and socio-demographic status. The retention rate was 62.7% (54 of 86 subjects). Significant within-group changes of dental plaque levels were evident among the test group (P < .001) and the control group (P < .001).

Regression analyses identified that baseline plaque levels (adjusted ß = 0.79, P < .001) and baseline functional dependency level (adjusted ß = -0.34, P < .05) were associated with dental plaques levels at the end of the trial (6 months). Both, \"Conventional\" and \"Intense\" oral health promotion programmes may successfully reduce dental plaque during stroke rehabilitation and are of comparable effectiveness.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a dentifrice containing Eugenia uniflora Linn. (Surinam cherry) extract versus a triclosan-based comparator in treating gingivitis in children aged 10-12 years. The in vitro antibacterial potential of the dentifrice was tested against oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei). Then a phase-II clinical trial was conducted with 50 subjects aged 10-12 years, with clinical signs of gingivitis. The subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=25) and control group (n=25), in which participants used the experimental dentifrice and a triclosan-based fluoridated dentifrice (Colgate Total 12(r)), respectively. Clinical examinations assessed the presence of gingivitis (primary outcome) and biofilm accumulation (secondary outcome) using the Gingival-Bleeding Index (GBI) and Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), respectively, at baseline and after seven days of tooth brushing 3x/day. The data were analyzed using paired and unpaired t-test (GBI) and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney (OHI-S), with p≤0.05. The experimental dentifrice showed efficient antibacterial activity in vitro. In the clinical trial, a significant reduction in gingival bleeding was observed in both experimental and control groups (p<0.0001), with no statistical difference between them (p=0.178), although a small size effect was observed. Biofilm accumulation was only reduced in the control group (p=0.0039). In conclusion, E. uniflora dentifrice showed anti-gingivitis properties in children aged 10-12 years. Thus, it may be a potentially efficient and safe product to be used alternatively in preventive dental practice."

            "abstract": "The objective of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of 3 surgical approaches in the treatment of deep recession type defects. Fifty-four (54) gingival recessions > or = 5 mm were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups by blocking the prognostic variables. The first group was treated with a guided tissue regeneration (GTR) procedure using a bioabsorbable membrane, the second with non-resorbable membrane, and the third with a mucogingival surgical approach consisting of a connective tissue graft combined with a coronally advanced flap (bilaminar technique). No differences, in terms of baseline oral hygiene and defect characteristics, were observed among the 3 groups showing an effective blocking approach. The 1-year results indicated that 1) all treatment approaches resulted in clinically significant root coverage and attachment gain; 2) a statistically significant treatment effect (P = 0.012, ANOVA) was observed comparing the bioabsorbable (4.9+/-0.3 mm), the non-resorbable (4.5+/-0.8 mm), and the bilaminar (5.3+/-0.7 mm) groups, in terms of root coverage; 3) the difference in terms of root coverage between the bilaminar and the non-resorbable membrane groups was statistically significant while differences between the 2 GTR groups or between the bilaminar and the bioabsorbable membrane groups did not reach statistical value; 4) the 95% confidence intervals for the proportions of complete successes showed a similar pattern; 5) no statistical difference was demonstrated in the amount of attachment gain among the 3 groups (P=0.73, ANOVA). A regression model showed that the amount of root coverage was significantly affected by the initial recession depth, the procedure and smoking habits: a poorer root coverage result is expected in case of shallow recession type defects, when either bioabsorbable (P < 0.05) or non-resorbable (P < 0.001) membranes are used instead of a bilaminar technique and if the patient smokes (P < 0.01). It was concluded that the mucogingival bilaminar technique is at least as effective as GTR procedures in the treatment of gingival recession > or = 4 mm and thus recession depth is not the parameter which influences the selection of the surgical procedure."

I1-1beta is thought to play a predominant role in periodontal tissue destruction. 13 medical students participating in a major medical exam (exam group) and 13 medical students not participating in any exam throughout the study period (control group) volunteered for the study. In a split-mouth-design, they refrained from any oral hygiene procedures in two opposite quadrants for 21 days (experimental gingivitis) while they maintained perfect hygiene levels at the remaining sites. Crevicular fluid was sampled for further I1-1beta analysis at teeth 5 and 6 of the upper jaw at days 1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 18 and 21 of the experimental gingivitis period. Exam students showed significantly higher I1-1beta levels than controls both at experimental gingivitis sites (area under the curve, exam group: 1240.64+/-140.07; control group: 697.61+/-111.30; p=0.004) and at sites of perfect oral hygiene (exam group: 290.42+/-63.19; control group: 143.98+/-42.71; p = 0.04).

In each subject, two anterior teeth were treated and a 10-day wash-out period separated the two treatments. Periodontal indices were evaluated before (baseline) and 1 and 10 days after GD. Interleukin 1β, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor α concentrations in gingival crevicular fluid were measured before and 1 day after GD. Subjective parameters (pain, unpleasant taste and stress) were also evaluated. Data were analysed by one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey's test (immunological factors), the Friedman test (periodontal parameters) and Fisher's exact or chi-squared test (subjective parameters), with a significance level of 95%. Gingival bleeding index, probing depth and plaque index values did not differ significantly between groups at any timepoint. Neither technique resulted in worse periodontal indices. Both techniques yielded similar results for pain and unpleasant taste, but conventional GD was significantly more stressful than cordless GD for volunteers. Both treatments significantly increased mean concentrations of the three cytokines, with the conventional technique producing the highest cytokine levels. Cordless GD is less stressful for patients and results in lower post-treatment levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with conventional GD."

Photobiomodulation (PBM) has been used in dentistry due to its anti-inflammatory properties and regenerative effects. This study evaluates the effects of PBM in the depth of anesthesia in inferior alveolar nerve block. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 44 patients requiring endodontic treatment in lower molar, left or right were selected, half of them were randomly treated with PBM therapy. Laser irradiation by 980 nm diode laser with a single dose (15 J/cm2, for 20 seconds) before anesthesia was performed at the buccal aspect. Inferior alveolar nerve block was performed once. Success was defined as no or mild pain (no need for any supplemental injection), based on the visual analogue scale during access cavity preparation. Results were evaluated using SPSS software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study showed that the necessity for supplemental injection was lower in the group receiving laser than in the group without laser (P = 0.033).

Also, the mean pain intensity during pulp dropping was lower in the group receiving laser, than the group without laser (P = 0.021). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the application of PBM before anesthesia is effective on increasing depth of anesthesia."

Seventy-three first-year dental students (response rate 81 percent) participated in this randomized single blind trial, in which faculty graders were blinded to student group assignment. There were no statistical differences, as determined by the Wilcoxon non-parametric test and a t-test, between the faculty grades on the wax carving from the two teaching methods the students experienced. The student self-assessments revealed higher mean grades (3.0 for the DVD-only group and 3.1 for the traditional group) than the faculty actual mean grades (2.2 for both the DVD-only group and the traditional group) by almost one grade level on a 4.0 grade scale. Similar percentages of students in the traditional group had either favorable or unfavorable perceptions of their learning experience, while more students in the DVD-only group reported favorable perceptions. Students from both groups said they wanted more faculty feedback in the course.

The study was also designed to assess whether granulation tissue removal is a determining factor for proper healing in the treatment of periodontal disease. 15 patients with advanced periodontal disease were included in the study. Each patient had at least 4 sites in each quadrant of the jaws with probing depths exceeding 6 mm. A baseline examination was performed to assess the following parameters: the oral hygiene status, the gingival conditions, the probing pocket depths and the probing attachment levels. In addition, in each quadrant, 3 approximal sites were selected for analysis of the subgingival microbiota. All of these sites showed signs of gingivitis. One site had a probing depth of less than 4 mm, another a probing depth between 4 and 6 mm and the third site had a probing depth exceeding 6 mm. The subgingival bacterial samples were studied by dark-field microscopy and the % of spirochetes and motile rods was assessed. By random selection the 4 jaw quadrants in each patient were treated for periodontal disease by the use of (1) the modified Widman flap procedure, (2) the modified Kirkland flap procedure or by (3) nonsurgical scaling and root planing. In all, 20 quadrants were treated with each of the 3 procedures. After the termination of active periodontal treatment, all patients were recalled for professional tooth cleaning once every 2 weeks during a 12-week period. Subsequently, they were recalled for prophylaxis every 3 months. The patients were examined 6 and 12 months after treatment using the same parameters as used at baseline. The data from the examinations demonstrated that subgingival scaling is an effective measure in the treatment of periodontal disease. Both in terms of average gingivitis resolution and average probing depth reduction, non-surgical therapy appeared to be equally effective as a surgical approach to treatment. It was also observed, however, that following non-surgical treatment, a larger number of sites with pockets exceeding 6 mm remained than following surgical therapy. Most of these deep pockets in non-surgically treated quadrants bled on probing to the base of the pocket. In addition, the subgingival microbiota of such sites were found to harbor more than 20% spirochetes and motile rods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Sixteen similar bilateral recession defects--Miller's class I and II--in eight patients were treated using coronally advanced flap and connective tissue graft harvested from the palate. The defects in each patient were randomly allocated to P-teeth or P-flap groups with the periosteum contacting the tooth surface or the flap, respectively. After initial scaling and root planing, acrylic templates of the treatment sites were generated. Recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), gingival sulcular depth, clinical attachment level, length of keratinized tissue, papilla width, and percentage of root coverage were measured at baseline, 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for analyzing the data. The reduction in RD averaged 3.68 mm in P-teeth and 3.25 mm in P-flap. RW decreased 2.68 and 2.6 mm in P-teeth and P-flap, respectively. Keratinized tissue increased an average of 1.25 mm in P-teeth and 1.31 mm in P-flap. Clinical attachment gain equaled 3.87 mm for P-teeth and 3.32 mm for P-flap. All variables exhibited significant improvement compared to baseline (P < 0.0001), but between-group differences were negligible (P > 0.05). It could be concluded that while the application of connective tissue graft with coronally advanced flap is efficient for coverage of Miller's class I and II gingival recession defects, the short-term clinical outcome of this surgical method is not affected by orientation of connective tissue graft."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dental calculus is one of the major problems in dentistry, which is characterized by calcified mass that forms on and adheres to the surface of teeth resulting in bad breath, receding gums and chronically inflamed gingiva. It can be correlated with Dantasharkara (dental calculus), which is characterized by the collection of hardened accumulation of Mala (tartar) at the junction of teeth and gums. Ultrasonic scalars are used for the removal of dental calculus for convenience. In texts, Laksha Churna (powder of Laccifer lacca Kerr) has been mentioned as Vranaropaka (wound healing) and indicated for the eliminating plaque through cleaning and polishing tooth surfaces.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of local application of Laksha Churna and Madhu (honey) Pratisarana after Dantasharkara Nirharana (scaling of dental calculus) in the management of Dantasharkara (dental calculus).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients having calculus deposition, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected. In group A, Pratisarana with Laksha Churna (powder) 1 g and Madhu as per requirement was given, whereas in group B, chlor-hexidine gluconate 0.2% for gargling was given for 2 weeks. Ultrasonic scaling was done in both groups before given trial drugs. The outcomes were calculated on the base on changes in score of the subjective parameters like pain, inflammation of gum, bleeding gums, halitosis as well as objective parameters like oral hygiene index, debris index, calculus index, gingival index, and periodontal index. For analysing the effect of the result, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonparametric paired data and paired t-test for quantitative parametric paired data was applied.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After analysing the data, it was found that Ultrasonic scaling of dental calculus followed by Pratisaraņa of honey with Laksha Churna provided statistically significant improvement in calculus index (97.77%) in debris index (84.44%), in oral hygiene index(96.66%), in gingival index (83.33%)and showed 96.15% improvement in periodontal index, whereas Ultrasonic scaling of dental calculus followed by gargling with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% provided 80% improvement in calculus index, 70% in debris index, 90% in oral hygiene index, in gingival index by 73.06%, and 93.75% improvement periodontal index which was statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The present study indicates Dantasharkara Nirharana followed by Pratisarana of Laksha Churna and Madhu is comparatively more effective than conventional standard treatment protocol (ultrasonic scaling and chlorhexidine gluconate mouth wash) in the management of dental calculus."

The upper left canine and bicuspid area had to be brushed for 30 seconds with cut toothbrush bristles (CP) and with round ended toothbrush bristles (RP) respectively. A two week interval separated the two brushing sessions. Traumatic lesions of the attached gingiva were stained with a disclosing solution, photographed and evaluated planimetrically. The \"cut bristles\" caused gingival abrasions 30% greater in extent than the round end bristles. The difference was not due to single brushing strokes accidentally greater for the \"cut bristles\". The size of the lesions was not sex dependent. To prevent gingival damage it is desirable to either round the bristles in production or to rid the bristle ends at least of sharp edges."

Clinical measurements of GAL and microbiological culture of subgingival bacteria were made at intervals between 1 week and 7 months after completion of the drug regime. Within 7 months, 15 out of 19 patients on placebo exhibited recurrent disease compared to 13 out of 29 patients on Doxycycline, a relative risk reduction of 43% (p less than 0.05) for Doxycycline compared to placebo. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of Doxycycline for subgingival plaque samples from active sites ranged between 25-100 micrograms/ml, which are several fold higher than reported crevicular fluid concentrations for this drug.

DI-S values (P < 0.001) and frequency of toothbrushing (P < 0.001) had a statistically significant impact on OHRQoL of the children. Children's OHRQoL was also significantly associated with parents' attitude towards the importance of brushing deciduous teeth (P = 0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Oral health status of preschool children in Shiraz was less than optimal and had a significant impact on their OHRQoL.

            "abstract": "Objective: The main purpose of this study was to investigate short-term effects of nicotine gum on facial detection. Methods: Fourteen participants (mean age = 26.8 years, SD = 2.5 years; eight males) were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled trial of nicotine gum administration (placebo, 2-mg and 4-mg doses). The participants were instructed to detect the location of a face when it was presented in a face/nonface pair on the screen. A repeated multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to analyze the results for reaction time and discrimination index. Demographics were used to explore significant association on facial detection. Bayesian analyses were also carried out considering maximum robustness to avoid bias. Results: The results indicated that the 2-mg dose resulted in faster reaction time and better discrimination than the 4-mg dose (p < 0.001). The 4-mg dose resulted in slower reaction time and lower discrimination index compared to both placebo (p < 0.01) and 2-mg doses (p < 0.001). Demographic data were not related to the outcomes. Conclusions: The results indicate that nicotine improved facial detection, but only at low doses (i.e., 2-mg), following a U-shaped curve. We trust future studies will continue to advance this research field, and if further work supports these preliminary findings, nicotine can act as therapeutic target in populations such as those with low vision."

The inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the most frequently used mandibular injection technique for achieving local anesthesia for endodontic treatment. However, the IANB does not always result in successful pulpal anesthesia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of preoperative administration of both ibuprofen and ketorolac on the efficacy of the IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Methods A total of 60 patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpits of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received identical capsules of either 400 mg ibuprofen or 20 mg ketorolac or a placebo 1 hour before the administration of a conventional IANB. Access was initiated after profound lip numbness was achieved. Success was defined as no, mild, moderate, or severe pain (verbal rating scale recordings) on accessing the dentin, pulp, and debridement. Results Ketorolac was associated with superior efficacy in pain reduction when compared with ibuprofen and placebo in all parameters, namely the dentin, pulp, and canal debridement. Interpretation and conclusion In conclusion, for mandibular posterior teeth, a preoperative dose of 400 mg of ibuprofen or 20 mg of ketorolac showed a statistically significant increase in the success of the IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis."

This study investigates and compares the efficacy of two different techniques to remove gingival clefts with respect to periodontal health and patient tolerance. Twenty-two patients (mean age, 15.7 years) with bilateral gingival clefts participated in this study. In each patient, the gingival invaginations were removed by gingivectomy using electrosurgery on one side and conventional surgery on the contralateral side. The length and depth of the invaginations, the gingival index of the adjacent teeth, and the changes in visual analogue scale scores were recorded before and after the operation for both groups. Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze the data statistically. The results showed significant improvement in invagination depth and length and gingival index scores for both techniques. There were no statistical differences between the two gingivectomy techniques with respect to gingival health and patient tolerance.

The trial will examine serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (primary outcome) as a biomarker of inflammation as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6), F2 isofurans and F2 isoprostanes (secondary outcomes) and compare their difference between groups from baseline to 6 months. The trial will also compare the difference between groups in patient-centered and clinical oral outcomes from baseline to 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The trial follows a rigorous and transparent study design capturing elements such as pre-specified eligibility criteria, pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes, detailed intervention description to allow replication, intervention random allocation and concealment, blinding in outcome assessment, appropriate sample size calculations, explanation of interim analysis, as per CONSORT Guidelines. Further, gender diversity is secured not only at recruitment but also throughout the trial and during the analysis. Therefore, treatment response outcomes will be examined per gender category. In order to manage anticipated problems, the protocol has included alternative approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03241511 .

At the one week follow-up visit, subjects in group A had a mean (SD) color change of 5.9 (1.83) (teeth were lighter) immediately after cessation of treatment (p<0.01). Subjects in groups B and C experienced a greater change in mean (SD) shade immediately following their respective in-office treatments of 5.1 (1.53) and 5.4 (1.55). However, within one week, the shade of these teeth regressed to a similar degree to that achieved by subjects treated in group A. Overall, no significant difference in shade change or sensitivity was produced between the three groups.

Statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. The next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. Person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. The floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. Analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. Variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial."

Twenty adult patients scheduled for tooth replacement with dental implants were accepted for participation. Following implant placement into the extraction site, subjects were assigned to one of two treatment alternatives for the remaining bone defect around the implant: (1) Bio-Oss + Bio-Gide membrane (test); or (2) Bio-Gide membrane (control). The treatment outcome was evaluated after 6 months by the use of clinical and radiographic variables. The null hypothesis of no treatment group differences was tested by ANOVA. At 6 months, the radiographic bone level remained unchanged compared to baseline in the test and control groups. No differences were observed between test and control groups in terms of mean probing attachment level. At proximal sites, the soft tissue margin was located 2.6 mm more coronal than the shoulder of the implant in the test group, compared to 1.3 mm in the control group. The corresponding figures for the lingual aspect were 2.3 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively, and at buccal sites 2.1 mm and 0.9 mm, respectively. The use of deproteinized bovine bone mineral as a membrane support at immediately placed transmucosal implants may offer an advantage in areas with high esthetic demands in terms of soft tissue support."

Baseline PPDs were deeper interproximally, in the maxilla and at premolars compared to buccal/oral sites, mandibular, and anterior teeth. At 6 months, PPD reduction and RAL-V gain were significantly greater at sites receiving SRP and AF as compared to untreated sites (p < 0.001). PPD reduction and RAL-V gain were significantly less (p < 0.005) in smokers as compared to nosmokers and at interproximal sites (p < 0.0001) as compared to buccal/oral sites. RAL-V gain was less in aggressive periodontitis, and PPD reduction was less in the maxilla (p < 0.001). In sites with greater bone loss and infrabony defects, a poorer response was observed regarding RAL-V gain or PPD reduction, respectively. The conclusions of the study are the following: (1) Nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapies are effective in single-rooted teeth; (2) severe interproximal bone loss and infrabony defects deteriorate clinical results; and (3) there seem to be more defect-associated (tooth, site) factors influencing treatment outcome than patient-associated factors."

Because pain, swelling and muscle spasm are complications found in virtually all patients following oral surgery for the removal of impacted teeth, this model has been widely used to evaluate the effects of LLLT on the inflammatory process involving bone and, connective tissue and the muscles involved in mastication.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      After meeting the eligibility criteria, 60 patients treated at a Specialty Dental Center for the removal of impacted lower third molars will be randomly divided into five groups according to the type of laser therapy used at the end of surgery (intraoral irradiation with 660 nm laser; extraoral irradiation with 660 nm laser; intraoral irradiation with 808 nm laser; extraoral irradiation with 808 nm laser and no irradiation). To ensure that patients are blinded to the type of treatment they are receiving, the hand piece of the laser apparatus will be applied both intraorally and extraorally to all participants, but the device will be turned on only at the appropriate time, as determined by the randomization process. At 2 and 7 days after surgery, the patients will be evaluated by three blinded evaluators who will measure of swelling, mouth opening (muscle spasm evaluation) and pain (using two different pain scales). The 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) will be used to assess QOL. All data will be analyzed with respect to the normality of distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistically significant differences between the experimental groups will be determined using analysis of variance, followed by a suitable post hoc test, when necessary.

Oral self-care is thus of crucial importance to achieve and maintain oral health. There is a scarcity of scientific evidence on the most effective models for behavioural change aimed to improve oral hygiene. There is a need for randomized-controlled trials, based on behavioural sciences and performed with great methodological rigour, to investigate the usefulness of these proposed behavioural changes. Oral hygiene regimens for patients with natural teeth as well as dental implants should include brushing twice daily, inter-dental cleaning once daily and rinsing with efficient rinses as an adjunct to mechanical infection control. Power toothbrushes are preferable as they are more effective than manual toothbrushes. Inter-dental brushes seem to be most effective and useful for inter-dental cleaning.

While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in relation to dental caries, little research has been undertaken of its possible significance in relation to gingivitis and periodontitis. This study aimed to investigate any possible correlations between pH and gingivitis and periodontal pocketing. Forty-two subjects with gingivitis and periodontitis were included in this study. Strips of pH indicator paper were placed on the floor of the mouth, soft palate, healthy gingival margins, sites of superficial gingivitis, and in periodontal pockets. It was shown that pH varies in different sites in the mouth. Statistically significant correlations between pH and gingivitis were not identified, but significant correlations between pH and periodontal pocketing were evident, although wide variations were observed between pockets. Randomly distributed pH readings ranging from 2-9 were observed within a single periodontal pocket. This implies that the physiology of processes taking place within periodontal pockets is wide ranging and complex. Different levels of pH indicate different chemical environments which may imply that different disease and reparative processes are occurring simultaneously within each periodontal pocket. The limitations of the assessment technique used in this study were highlighted and compared in relation to results obtained from other studies using more sophisticated techniques and it was found that the results obtained using this unsophisticated technique were in agreement with most of these other studies. Therefore, this technique may have applications in screening for disease activity in clinical practice. However, the need for further work to confirm the observations of this study is necessary to corroborate these associations."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to assess the visual effects of pink-neck implants and pink abutments with respect to the color of natural gingiva. The distribution pattern and magnitude of CIELAB color difference coordinates were studied.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty subjects with a tooth in the maxillary esthetic zone deemed hopeless were recruited. Patients were randomized to either a conventional gray implant or a pink-neck implant. The hopeless tooth was removed and patients received an immediate implant along with an immediate customized provisional prosthesis. The provisional was maintained for 3 months to allow for complete healing of the implants. Two identical CAD/CAM titanium abutments only differing in color (gray and pink) were fabricated along with an all-ceramic zirconia crown. The gray abutment was delivered first with a zirconia crown, and it was replaced with the pink abutment 3 weeks later. Three weeks after insertion of each abutment with the zirconia crown, a spectrophotometer was used to collect the color of the peri-implant mucosa and natural gingiva, so the difference between the two sites could be calculated (ΔL* [difference in lightness], Δa* [difference in green-red axis], Δb* [difference in blue-yellow axis]). The natural gingiva measured was the gingiva of a contralateral or adjacent unrestored tooth. The effect of implant color and abutment on the color difference between peri-implant mucosa and natural gingiva was investigated with a linear regression model using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Raw data demonstrated statistically insignificant smaller ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* between peri-implant soft tissue and natural gingiva when the implant was pink versus gray. Further, there were statistically insignificant smaller ΔL* and Δb* between peri-implant soft tissue and natural gingiva when the abutment was pink versus gray. Δa* between peri-implant soft tissue and natural gingiva was significantly smaller when using a pink abutment regardless of the implant type (P < .05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Using an anodized pink abutment and/or a pink-neck implant minimizes the color difference observed between the peri-implant mucosa and the natural gingiva in the redness spectrum. These advances in technology assist in helping the peri-implant mucosa appear more natural by minimizing the color variance."

Fifteen recessions in the test group received a tetracycline hydrochloride (50 mg/ml) root treatment for 5 minutes (TTC-HCl group); the remaining 15 recessions composed the control group and received a citric acid root treatment for 3 minutes (CA group). Clinical assessments were taken at baseline and at 6 months. The differences between treatments were not statistically significant. In the central area of the recession, the mean percentage of root coverage was 81.7% corresponding to a mean percentage of 79.3% and 84.0% for the TTC-HCl and the CA group, respectively. In the test group, 6 of the 15 recessions exhibited complete root coverage; the gingival augmentation was 57.8%. In the control group, 8 of the 15 recessions exhibited complete root coverage; the gingival augmentation was 43.6%. The mean surface area of root exposure was reduced from 11.53 mm2 and 13.30 mm2 to 0.34 mm2 and 0.29 mm2 for the TTC-HCl group and the CA group, respectively. This reduction corresponds to a mean percentage of 97.4% root coverage for both groups. Within the limits of this study, the results indicate that tetracycline hydrochloride and citric acid root conditioning have comparable clinical effects in root coverage surgical therapy. The data also suggest that the measurement of the surface area of the recession is a more accurate criterion in the evaluation of the mean percentage of root coverage than a single central vertical linear measurement."

Clinical and microbiological examination were performed for up to 12 weeks following treatment. Probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BoP) were improved after each treatment session. At 12 weeks, Group 1 had achieved significantly lower PPDs than the other groups, though there were no significant differences in BoP between Group 1 and the other groups. Counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a known periodontal pathogen, in Group 1 were significantly lower than those in Group 3, and were comparable to those in Group 2.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dental plaque associated gingivitis is a reversible inflammatory condition caused by accumulation and persistence of microbial biofilms (dental plaque) on the teeth. It is characterised by redness and swelling of the gingivae (gums) and a tendency for the gingivae to bleed easily. In susceptible individuals, gingivitis may lead to periodontitis and loss of the soft tissue and bony support for the tooth. It is thought that chlorhexidine mouthrinse may reduce the build-up of plaque thereby reducing gingivitis.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for the control of gingivitis and plaque compared to mechanical oral hygiene procedures alone or mechanical oral hygiene procedures plus placebo/control mouthrinse. Mechanical oral hygiene procedures were toothbrushing with/without the use of dental floss or interdental cleaning aids and could include professional tooth cleaning/periodontal treatment.To determine whether the effect of chlorhexidine mouthrinse is influenced by chlorhexidine concentration, or frequency of rinsing (once/day versus twice/day).To report and describe any adverse effects associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use from included trials.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 28 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (searched 28 September 2016); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 28 September 2016); Embase Ovid (1980 to 28 September 2016); and CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 28 September 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for at least 4 weeks on gingivitis in children and adults. Mechanical oral hygiene procedures were toothbrushing with/without use of dental floss or interdental cleaning aids and could include professional tooth cleaning/periodontal treatment. We included trials where participants had gingivitis or periodontitis, where participants were healthy and where some or all participants had medical conditions or special care needs.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently screened the search results extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. For continuous outcomes, we used means and standard deviations to obtain the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined MDs where studies used the same scale and standardised mean differences (SMDs) where studies used different scales. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. Due to anticipated heterogeneity we used random-effects models for all meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 51 studies that analysed a total of 5345 participants. One study was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining 50 being at high risk of bias, however, this did not affect the quality assessments for gingivitis and plaque as we believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Gingivitis After 4 to 6 weeks of use, chlorhexidine mouthrinse reduced gingivitis (Gingival Index (GI) 0 to 3 scale) by 0.21 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31) compared to placebo, control or no mouthrinse (10 trials, 805 participants with mild gingival inflammation (mean score 1 on the GI scale) analysed, high-quality evidence). A similar effect size was found for reducing gingivitis at 6 months. There were insufficient data to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 (moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation). Plaque Plaque was measured by different indices and the SMD at 4 to 6 weeks was 1.45 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.90) standard deviations lower in the chlorhexidine group (12 trials, 950 participants analysed, high-quality evidence), indicating a large reduction in plaque. A similar large reduction was found for chlorhexidine mouthrinse use at 6 months. Extrinsic tooth staining There was a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 4 to 6 weeks. The SMD was 1.07 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.34) standard deviations higher (eight trials, 415 participants analysed, moderate-quality evidence) in the chlorhexidine mouthrinse group. There was also a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 7 to 12 weeks and 6 months. Calculus Results for the effect of chlorhexidine mouthrinse on calculus formation were inconclusive. Effect of concentration and frequency of rinsing There were insufficient data to determine whether there was a difference in effect for either chlorhexidine concentration or frequency of rinsing. Other adverse effects The adverse effects most commonly reported in the included studies were taste disturbance/alteration (reported in 11 studies), effects on the oral mucosa including soreness, irritation, mild desquamation and mucosal ulceration/erosions (reported in 13 studies) and a general burning sensation or a burning tongue or both (reported in nine studies).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is high-quality evidence from studies that reported the Löe and Silness Gingival Index of a reduction in gingivitis in individuals with mild gingival inflammation on average (mean score of 1 on the 0 to 3 GI scale) that was not considered to be clinically relevant. There is high-quality evidence of a large reduction in dental plaque with chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months. There is no evidence that one concentration of chlorhexidine rinse is more effective than another. There is insufficient evidence to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 indicating moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation. Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinse for 4 weeks or longer causes extrinsic tooth staining. In addition, other adverse effects such as calculus build up, transient taste disturbance and effects on the oral mucosa were reported in the included studies."

            "abstract": "All 9-10-year-old children in one Finnish county were screened with a standardized set of tasks for their mental performance. 58 verified mentally retarded and 58 randomly selected healthy children were examined for dental and gingival status and level of oral hygiene. Comparisons were made between the retarded and the healthy, as well as between subgroups of the retarded. Similar DFS-values, higher DS-values and an inferior level of oral hygiene in terms of VPI were found in mentally retarded when compared with healthy children. No evident difference was found in gingival status (by GBI) between the retarded and the healthy. The mildly or moderately retarded found by the screening and not yet included in special welfare had the highest DFS-scores, the highest prevalence of untreated caries and the poorest gingival health among the retarded."

            "abstract": "Between February 1986 and November 1989, 166 patients who were candidates for a bone marrow transplantation entered a randomised controlled clinical trial to compare limited oral hygiene care (LIM) and intensive oral hygiene care (INT) in the prevention of mucositis. Randomisation was stratified on the initial oral status (good vs. bad IOS). Intensive oral hygiene care included an initial treatment of dental lesions and tooth and gum brushing during aplasia. Limited oral hygiene care excluded preventive dental treatment and gingival and tooth brushing. Mucositis was classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, according to the clinical aspects of the different sites in the mouth and to two scales of pain evaluation. Of the 150 evaluable patients (75 in each group), 134 developed moderate/severe mucositis (64 in the INT group and 70 in the LIM group) (log-rank test P < 0.02). The superiority of intensive oral care was observed both in patients with and without total body irradiation (TBI) and in patients with a good or bad IOS; the observed risk of mucositis was reduced by 70% in each of these four subgroups. Duration of moderate/severe mucositis was, although not significantly, lower in the INT group (17 days, S.D. = 12) than in the LIM group (19 days, S.D. = 13). The median time of mucositis occurrence was 11 days in the INT group and 9 days in the LIM group. Contrary to a widespread belief, the percentage of documented septicaemia was not higher in patients who underwent intensive oral care. We conclude that, although statistically significant, the superiority of intensive oral hygiene care is not clinically impressive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce periodontitis in animals. We aimed to determine whether DHA supplementation with low-dose aspirin would reduce periodontitis in humans. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial lasting 3 mo. Fifty-five adults with moderate periodontitis were randomized to 2,000 mg of DHA or identical soy/corn oil capsules. All participants received 81 mg of aspirin but received no other treatments. We analyzed the primary outcome of per-pocket change in pocket depth using mixed models among teeth with pocket depth ≥5 mm. Secondary outcomes assessed with generalized estimating equations included gingival index, plaque index, and bleeding on probing. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were analyzed for changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukins 6 and 1β (IL-6 and IL-1β). Plasma was analyzed for changes in systemic inflammatory markers, including hsCRP. We confirmed adherence with erythrocyte fatty acid measurement. Forty-six participants completed the trial. While similar at baseline, the proportion of DHA in red blood cell plasma membranes increased from 3.6% ± 0.9% to 6.2% ± 1.6% in the intervention group but did not change among controls. DHA supplementation decreased mean pocket depth (-0.29 ± 0.13; p = .03) and gingival index (-0.26 ± 0.13; p = .04). Plaque index and bleeding on probing did not change. Significant adjusted differences were found between DHA and control for both gingival crevicular fluid hsCRP (-5.3 ng/mL, standard error [SE] = 2.4, p = .03) and IL-1β (-20.1 pg/mL, SE = 8.2, p = .02) but not IL-6 (0.02 pg/mL, SE = 0.71, p = .98) or systemic hsCRP (-1.19 mg/L, SE = 0.90, p = .20).

The onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief was significantly faster in all DPSGC groups than in the placebo group, including the DPSGC 25-mg group (25 minutes [P = .0002] and 52 minutes [P < .0001] for perceptible and meaningful pain relief, respectively). Significantly fewer patients in the DPSGC groups required rescue medication compared with those in the placebo group (P < .0001). The global evaluation scores were significantly greater for the patients who received DPSGC than for those who received placebo (P < .0001), and more than 65% of DPSGC-treated patients rated the medication as good, very good, or excellent compared with 18% of the placebo-treated patients. DPSGC was generally well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results from the present single-dose study of postoperative dental pain suggest that DPSGC offers significant pain relief compared with placebo and that the study medication provided was well tolerated by patients who required pain relief after third molar extraction."

We evaluated the tooth sensitivity (TS) and bleaching efficacy (BE) of two HP concentrations in this study. Gels containing 35% and 20% HP (HP35 and HP20, respectively) were applied on teeth of 60 caries-free patients. Color was recorded at baseline and one week after the first and second bleaching sessions using the Vita Classical shade guide. TS was recorded on a 0-4 scale. BE at each weekly recall was evaluated by Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α=0.05). Absolute risk of TS and its intensity was evaluated by Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively (α=0.05). After two bleaching sessions, color change of approximately eight tabs was obtained with HP35; whereas, with HP20 it was six tabs (p<0.05). Only 26.7% (HP35) and 16.7% (HP20) of the participants reported TS, and no statistical differences were detected among them. Both in-office bleaching gels showed similar TS intensity, but the 35% HP agent produced faster bleaching."

Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Irrigator use was measured by timers built into the irrigator units. Results at 6 months showed that both supragingival irrigation with buffered 0.3% ASA and supragingival irrigation with water significantly reduced gingival index scores (median 0.1 and 0.35, respectively) and pocket probing depths (both median 0.26 mm) compared to the control group. In addition, irrigation with water resulted in a significant reduction in bleeding on probing (median 0.13), whereas irrigation with buffered 0.3% ASA had no significant effect on bleeding on probing compared to the control group. The clinical efficacy of irrigation with either ASA or water was found to be positively correlated to initial disease severity and irrigator use. Thus, frequent supragingival irrigation with either 0.3% ASA or water in addition to regular oral hygiene appears to be a beneficial adjunct to periodontal supportive therapy in patients with moderate to severe signs of periodontitis. However, the use of buffered 0.3% ASA as an irrigant does not seem to enhance the clinical efficacy of supragingival irrigation on periodontal health."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The beneficial effects of the one-stage, full-mouth disinfection remain controversial in the scientific literature. This might be due to the fact that an entire mouth disinfection with the use of antiseptics has been confused with a full-mouth scaling and root planing. This parallel, single blind RCT study aimed to compare several full-mouth treatment strategies with each other.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-one patients with moderate periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment strategies: scaling and root planing, quadrant by quadrant, at two-week intervals (negative control, NC), full-mouth scaling and root planing within 2 consecutive days (FRP), or three one-stage, full-mouth disinfection (FM) protocols within 2 consecutive days applying antiseptics to all intra-oral niches for periopathogens using as antiseptics: chlorhexidine (FMCHX) for 2 months, amine fluoride/stannous fluoride for 2 months (FMF), or chlorhexidine for 2 months followed by amine fluoride/stannous fluoride for another 6 months (FMCHX+F). At baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 a series of periodontal parameters were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All treatment strategies resulted in significant (p<0.05) improvements of all clinical parameters over the entire duration of the study. Inter-treatment differences were often encountered. The NC group nearly always showed significant smaller improvements than the two CHX groups. The differences between the FRP or FM groups, and the two CHX groups only sporadically reached a statistical significance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These observations indicate that the benefits of the \"OSFMD\" protocol are partially due to the use of the antiseptics and partially to the completion of the therapy in a short time."

Patients were evaluated for intra- and postoperative pain and bleeding at 3 and 7 days. Clinical parameters including clinical crown length, probing depth, plaque index, bleeding on probing, and clinical attachment level were recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. A gradual reduction in postoperative pain was recorded for both sides with no statistically significant difference at 3 (scalpel: 4.4 ± 1.33, laser: 4.8 ± 1.34; p = 0.088) and 7 days (scalpel: 1.8 ± 0.94, laser: 1.8 ± 1.10; p = 0.655). A statistically significant gain of coronal tooth structure was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Stability in the post-crown-lengthening level of the gingival margin was achieved one month following the procedure with no significant changes in the following months.

The plastic replicas were fixed in a dummy head without any replicated soft tissues. In the furcation area, an easily removable surface coating material was applied to the teeth to represent the \"plaque\" and a second, more stubborn lacquer layer representing \"calculus/cementum\". Following instrumentation, the following parameters were recorded to assess efficacy; time required for instrumentation, loss of weight, depth of substance removal at the furcation entrance, % of furcation area instrumented, whereby removal of these 2 layers was judged separately. Only minor differences were observed between hand instruments, conventional and budded sonic scaler inserts as to loss of weight, depth of substance loss and area instrumented. The plastic-coated sonic scaler inserts were just as effective in surface layer removal representing \"plaque\" as the 3 other instruments, but resulted in less loss of weight and less depth of substance removal. In conclusion, the more aggressive hand instruments, the conventional and budded sonic scaler insert, are preferably used for the surgical phase to increased ease of entry into the furcation dome. An effective debridement of the furcation roof seems only possible with an odontoplastic, for which a furcation is fitted to the instrument by means of an intensive instrumentation, thus leading to weight loss and pronounced substance removal. The plastic-coated sonic scaler inserts seems to be a reasonable choice for maintenance treatment within furcation, since this treatment phase is usually restricted to removal of soft bacterial deposits."

The authors explored the effects of listening to music during extraction of the impacted mandibular third molar on the autonomic nervous system and the psychological state and hypothesized that listening to music would suppress sympathetic nervous activity and decrease anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective study, 40 patients scheduled for extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar were randomized into 2 groups: extraction without music (control group) and extraction while listening to music (music group). Heart rate variability was recorded during the experiment, and Modified Dental Anxiety Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were recorded before and after the procedure. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed and the P value was set at .05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      An increased low-to-high frequency ratio was observed in the control group during incision and flap reflection, bone removal, and separation of the tooth crown; the ratio was significantly decreased in the music group during these time points (P < .05). Compared with the control group, the music group had a significantly greater decrease in postoperative STAI State Anxiety scores from preoperative levels (P < .05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggested that listening to music while undergoing extraction of the impacted mandibular third molar suppresses activity of the sympathetic nerves during incision, flap reflection, bone removal, and separation of the tooth crown and relieves anxiety after treatment.

The study model involved three weeks of stain induction followed by six weeks of unsupervised brushing to assess efficacy. To induce stain, 222 healthy adult volunteers received a dental prophylaxis, and then began a limited brushing regimen supplemented by three-times daily rinsing with tea and once daily rinsing with 15 ml of 0.12% chlorhexidine. This regimen was suspended, and 187 subjects with tooth stain were entered into a six-week clinical trial where they were randomized to either a silica-based tartar control whitening dentifrice or a marketed regular dentifrice control, balancing for stain levels and smoking status. At baseline, three and six weeks, stain area and stain intensity were measured on the 8 anterior teeth using the Lobene Index. After six weeks' use, composite Lobene means were 35% lower for the whitening dentifrice compared to the regular control. In addition to the overall reductions, there were statistically significant reductions in stain area (p < 0.015) and stain intensity (p < 0.01) at both three and six weeks. The tartar control whitening dentifrice was effective in removing stain on the gingival margins and elsewhere on the body of the tooth. Safety profiles for the two test dentifrices were generally similar. After three and six weeks' use, the tartar control whitening dentifrice reduced chlorhexidine and tea stain compared to the marketed control."

Losing some non-free-end teeth cause the original occluding tooth/teeth to supraerupt from the original upright position and causes neighboring tooth/teeth to shift in an angle, causing biomechanical imbalance on the mandible. Based on these sequelae, rehabilitation of missing teeth is the first step in managing TMD in edentulous patients.

Plaque scores were taken at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index. Gingival inflammation was assessed by the GI, bleeding tendency score, presence or absence of bleeding on probing, volumetric measurements of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in GCF. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance were used to detect time- and device-dependent differences for all clinical assessments between the 2 groups over the 5 visits. Both types of brush were effective in removing supragingival plaque. The sonic brush was statistically superior, on a percentage reduction basis, in removing supragingival plaque from the dentition taken as a whole (F-statistic; p = 0.012) and was particularly better in hard-to-reach areas such as posterior teeth (F-statistic; p = 0.003) and interproximal sites (F-statistic; p = 0.004).

An electronic search, complemented by a manual search, of articles published from 1999 to 2020 was conducted in the Medline (PubMed), EMBASE and Web of Science databases including human randomized controlled trials, prospective, and retrospective studies with at least 15 patients. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed either with the Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool or with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Every step of the review was performed independently and in duplicate. The initial electronic search recovered 2102 articles. After applying the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were included. For patient's perceived postoperative pain, TF and MTF frequently reported better results than EF. For swelling, the literature is divided, despite a trend favoring EF. For trismus, data showed that its occurrence is mostly associated with the duration of the surgery rather than with the chosen flap. For healing, the limited data is inconclusive. Finally, randomized studies showed a high risk of bias, whereas nonrandomized studies were mostly of good quality and low risk of bias. Although there was no clear consensus regarding the influence of different flap designs for third mandibular molar extraction on postoperative clinical morbidities; the surgeon's experience, estimated surgical difficulty, molar position and orientation, and surg ery duration should be considered when choosing among the different flap designs."

This study describes a protocol for the first randomised controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of the two methods.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Eighty patients will be divided into four groups: G1 violet LED; G2 violet LED +35% carbamide peroxide; G3 35% H2O2 and G4 violet LED +gingivoplasty. Colour will be measured at baseline, immediately after the first session and at the 15 and 180 days follow-up using the Vita Classical and the digital Easyshade V spectrophotometer (Vita, Zahnfabrik, Germany). Sensitivity after whitening will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale at baseline and at each session in all groups and in all follow-ups. The tissue removed during gingivoplasty (G4) will be submitted to immunohistochemical analysis for the determination of inflammatory changes caused by violet LED. The Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ) will be evaluated before, as well as at established time point controls. The results will be expressed as mean and SD values. After determining the normality of the data, a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance will be used for the comparison of data with normal distribution and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for data with non-normal distribution. A p<0.05 will be considered indicative of statistical significance. After determining the normality of the data, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for non-parametric data. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and the Wilcoxon test will be used for comparing data from the PIDAQ.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      This protocol has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of UniversidadeNove de Julho (certificate: 2.034.518).

            "abstract": "There are several incremental techniques for the placement of posterior composites in Class II cavities that were introduced to overcome clinical failures associated with these restorations. This study evaluated microleakage in Class II cavities restored with four different curing techniques. On 40 non-carious, freshly extracted human premolars, Class II cavities were prepared following a standard pattern in which the mesial cavities had a cervical margin 1.0 mm above the CEJ, and for distal cavities, 1.0 mm below the CEJ. The specimens were randomly divided into four groups. Each cavity surface was conditioned with 35% phosphoric acid and rinsed to remove the excess water, followed by a dental bonding agent (PQ1) being used for all the cavities. The teeth were then restored with a fiber reinforced resin-based composite (Neulite F), using four different techniques: Group 1, metal matrix with wooden wedge; Group 2, transparent matrix with reflective wedge; Group 3, metal matrix with wooden wedge and light tip and Group 4, metal matrix with wooden wedge and bio-glass cylinder. Then, the restorations were finished and polished, rebonded, thermocycled (2000 times, 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C, 30 second dwell time), stained, sectioned vertically and viewed under a stereomicroscope (40x). They were then scored on a 0-4 scale based on microleakage at the gingival margins. The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. The results showed that Group 1 demonstrated the most leakage, while the other three groups showed less leakage than Group 1. There was no significant difference between the enamel and dentin gingival margin groups. As a result of these findings, the authors concluded that restoration with metal matrices, using light conducting instruments, results in significantly less microleakage at the gingival margins of Class II resin composite restorations."

Local increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive nitrogen products have also been demonstrated in humans and animals with periodontal disease. This masked, randomized, placebo-controlled preclinical investigation examined the effect of two mercaptoalkylguanidines, mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) and guanidinoethyldisulfide (GED), which are iNOS inhibitors and reactive nitrogen scavenging compounds, on the development of experimental gingivitis in beagle dogs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen female, 1-year-old beagles first completed a 2-week dose-escalation experiment during which a maximum tolerated dose was determined for MEG and GED gels.

Since no statistical difference among PI scores was noted for any of the time points, neither mercaptoalkylguanidine appeared to affect supragingival plaque levels.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The data from this preclinical study indicate that mercaptoalkylguanidines, topically administered, may significantly reduce experimental gingivitis in the beagle dog."

            "abstract": "The effect of ascorbic acid megadoses on gingival clinical parameters and vitamin content of blood and gingival tissue was studied. 10 nondeficient individuals, carefully matched according to age, periodontal status, and oral hygiene level, were divided into 2 groups: one received 250 mg q.i.d. of ascorbic acid and the other a placebo. After 1 week on the tablet all patients were scaled and root planed and received oral hygiene instructions. Blood samples and clinical parameters were obtained at baseline and 2, 6, and 7 weeks after. A gingival biopsy was taken at week 6. Correlations between the clinical parameters and the ascorbic acid levels at the different time periods revealed no significant differences between the vitamin and the placebo groups, therefore suggesting that the use of megadoses of vitamin C in normal human subjects does not have a predictable or strong effect on the gingival response to initial therapy."

Sixty participants were randomly assigned to a treated or a placebo group (each group N = 30). Their anterior teeth were bleached with a photo-activated whitening gel, or subjected to a placebo. Lightness, chroma and the translucency of teeth were assessed before and 1 week after the procedure using a spectrophotometer. The Self-Esteem Scale, Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire, the Orofacial Aesthetic Scale and the Oral Health Impact Profile were administered to subjects. Changes in colour and chroma were greater in the treated than the placebo group (3.8 ± 1.5 vs. 1.7 ± 1.5 and - 3.2 ± 1.5 vs. 0.0 ± 1.1; p < 0.001). The treated group reported increased satisfaction with appearance and a decrease in psychological and social impacts (p < 0.05). In the placebo group there was no objective change in colour but the subjects reported an increase in satisfaction and dental self-confidence, as well as a decrease in psychological impact (p < 0.05). Self-esteem did not have a moderation nor a mediation effect. In conclusion, patients are not able to accurately detect the colour change induced by tooth whitening after 1 week, but they are also largely suggestible when evaluating the changes in quality of life.

Fifty-one patients requiring the removal of bilateral maxillary third molars were enrolled. Each patient acting as their own control received buccal infiltrations of lignocaine bilaterally, then 0.2 mL of lignocaine without vasoconstrictor was administered to one side of the palate and the same amount of normal saline administered to the other side. Sides were randomized as to the active ingredient and both the patient and operator were blinded. All extractions were performed by a single operator using a consistent technique and no additional sedative or anaesthetic agents were utilized. Data relating to the pain of the extractions and of the palatal injection were obtained on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Verbal Response Scale (VRS) data were obtained additionally for a subset of 21 patients. Statistical analysis confirmed clinical equivalence between saline and lignocaine to the palate (95% CI -1.7 to 6.2mm, equivalence range -6.75 to 6.75 mm). No patients requested additional lignocaine to the palate in order to ensure comfortable extraction.

The investigation demonstrated that active therapy including meticulous subgingival debridement resulted in a low frequency of gingival sites which bled on probing, a high frequency of sites with shallow pockets (less than 4 mm) and the disappearance of pockets with a probing depth of greater than 6 mm. Between the Baseline examination and the 6-month re-examination, the probing attachment level for initially shallow pockets remained basically unaltered, but with a tendency of a minor apical shift. This occurred in all 6 treatment groups. For sites with initial probing depths of 4-6 mm and greater than 6 mm, there was in all groups some gain of probing attachment. This gain was most pronounced in the initially deeper (greater than 6 mm) pockets. With the use of regression analysis, the \"critical probing depth\" (CPD) value (i.e. the initial probing depth value below which loss of attachment occurred as a result of treatment and above which gain of probing attachment level resulted) was calculated for each of the 6 methods of treatment used. A comparison of the CPD-values between the 6 treatment groups did not reveal any major differences."

The changes in gingival scores were measured at the period of 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd month. Gingivitis score changed in direct proportion to the dose of vitamin D supplementation. Group A mean gingival scores were 2.4 (baseline); 1.7 (1 st month), 0.8 (2 nd month) and 0.3 (3 rd month). The group B the mean baseline gingival score from 2.3 reduced to 2.0 (month), 1.1 (two months) and 0.5 (third month). Group C had baseline gingival scores of 2.2 and 1.9 (1 st month), 1.4 (2 nd month) and 0.8 (last visit). Comparing baseline gingivitis scores with later visit score by Wilcoxon paired test, the anti-inflammatory effect was significantly seen in group A after one month itself, group B at two months and group C at 3 rd month after oral vitamin D supplementation. However, Group D did not show any significant anti-inflammatory effect."

Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Poisson regression. A total of 451 preschool children participated in the study. The majority of carious lesions exhibited severe decay (60.6%) and were found in both anterior (incisors/canines) and posterior (molars) teeth. The final Poisson model revealed negative impacts on quality of life from more advanced stages of dental caries, both in incisors/canines and molars. Child's age and household income were also associated with impact on quality of life. Carious lesions in more advanced stages of progression in anterior and posterior teeth were associated with a negative impact on the quality of life of preschool children."

The authors' aim in this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the radiographic and clinical failure rates of a calcium silicate-based bioactive material (Biodentine, Septodont) with those of other root restoration materials such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), formocresol, and ferric sulfate.\n    \n\n\n          Types of studies reviewed:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of the determined study strategy, the authors performed a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials online databases. The authors considered only randomized controlled trials. In the included studies, the authors compared the clinical and radiographic failure rates at different follow-up times of the pulpotomy of primary teeth with extensive caries treated by using Biodentine and other root restoration materials.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All of the included studies had an unknown or high risk of bias. On the basis of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale, the quality of evidence for the comparison of MTA and Biodentine was moderate. Biodentine had a statically significantly higher radiographic failure rate than did MTA at 6 and at 9 through 12 months after pulpotomy. The authors found no substantial differences between the clinical failure rates of Biodentine and MTA and the radiographic or clinical failure rates of Biodentine and formocresol or of Biodentine and ferric sulfate.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and practical implications:\n        \n      \n      MTA has a significantly lower radiographic failure rate than does Biodentine but no difference in clinical failure rates. On the basis of this result, the dentist can weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using Biodentine, MTA, ferric sulfate, and formocresol and can make a more informed decision about using the proper root restoration material."

A randomized controlled trial was designed where 82 children requiring 102 primary molar extractions were given ILA of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine with either the conventional method or a CCLADS. Pain during injection and extraction was assessed using the Sound, Eye, Motor (SEM) scale and heart rate recording. Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS) scores were self-reported by patients. The Mann-Whitney test was used for evaluation of FPS and SEM scores and Student's t test for evaluation of heart rate readings. Heart rate values during injection were found to be higher, but not statistically significantly higher (p = .077), for conventional injection versus CCLADS; however, heart rate values during extraction were significantly higher for the conventional method (p = .009). Both FPS and SEM values were found to be significantly higher for conventional ILA technique (p < .05). ILA can be an effective alternative means of anesthesia for primary molar extractions, and CCLADS devices can make ILA more effective and less painful."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nOne hypothesis to explain the association between periodontal disease (PD) preterm/low birth weight (PT/LBW) is that PT/LBW may be indirectly mediated through translocation of bacteria or bacterial products in the systemic circulation. Transient bacteremias occur in subjects with marginal periodontitis or with gingivitis, and it is possible that bacteria and their products may reach the placental membranes hematogenously and provide the inflammatory effect to induce preterm labor. The effect of gingivitis as a potential risk factor for PT/LBW has still not been studied. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to determine the effect of routine plaque control and scaling on the pregnancy outcomes in women with gingivitis.\n## METHODS\nEight hundred seventy (870) pregnant women with gingivitis, aged 18 to 42, were enrolled while receiving prenatal care in Santiago, Chile. Women were randomly assigned in a two-to-one fashion to either a treatment group (N = 580), receiving periodontal treatment before 28 weeks of gestation or to a control group (N = 290), receiving periodontal treatment after delivery. Periodontal therapy consisted of plaque control, scaling, and daily rinsing with 0.12% clorhexidine. Maintenance therapy was provided every 2 to 3 weeks until delivery, and consisted of oral hygiene instruction and supragingival plaque removal by instrumentation, as needed. The primary outcomes assessed were delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation or an infant weighing less than 2,500 g.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 870 women enrolled, 36 women (27 in the treatment group and nine in the control group) were excluded from the analyses for different reasons. The incidence of PT/LBW in the treatment group was 2.14% (12/560) and in the control group, 6.71% (19/283) (odds ratio [OR] 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 6.83; P = 0.0009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for several known risk factors for PT/LBW, women with gingivitis were at a higher risk of PT/LBW than women who received periodontal treatment (OR 2.76; 95%CI 1.29 to 5.88; P = 0.008).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPeriodontal treatment significantly reduced the PT/LBW rate in this population of women with pregnancy-associated gingivitis. Within the limitations of this study, we conclude that gingivitis appears to be an independent risk factor for PT/LBW for this population.\n"

As secondary outcome measures, the number of patients with objective IAN injury, with long-term (>6 months) IAN injury, the occurrence of other postoperative complications, the Oral Health Related Quality of Life-14 (OHIP-14) questionnaire responses, postoperative pain (visual analogue scale score), duration of surgery, number of emergency visits, and number of missed days of work or study were scored.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 268 patients with 320 mandibular third molars were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

The teeth were bleached in two sessions, with a one-week interval between them, in a split-mouth design. The bleaching agent was applied in two 20-minute (2×20) applications or one 40-minute (1×40) application in each session according to the manufacturer's instructions. The color changes were evaluated by using subjective (Vita Classical and Vita Bleachedguide) and objective (Easyshade Spectrophotometer) methods at baseline and 30 days after the second session. Tooth sensitivity was recorded up to 48 hours with a 0-10 visual analog scale. Also, the pH values during the application of bleaching were recorded. Color change in shade guide units and ΔE were analyzed by using the Student t-test (α=0.05). The absolute risk and intensity of TS were evaluated with the McNemar test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Friedman test, respectively (α= 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Significant whitening was observed in both groups after 30 days of clinical evaluation. The use of a 40-minute application did not significantly influence the absolute risk of TS (68%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 53-80) as well as the intensity of TS compared with the acid bleaching gel (absolute risk of 82%, 95% CI = 68-91). The pH values did not differ significantly between groups and at the different assessment periods ( p=0.42).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of a 40-minute in-office bleaching agent gel application produced the same whitening degree and TS that the two 20-minute bleaching agent applications did. The former preferably should be applied because one 40-minute application does not require gel refreshing."

            "abstract": "The gingival thickness (GT) and keratinized tissue width (KTW) constitute the gingival phenotype, a concept that has received a great deal of appreciation in recent years. Gingival phenotype modification has been achieved via different surgical techniques and grafting materials. Despite the superiority of autogenous grafts, their increased patient morbidity and limited recourse has led to the development of graft substitutes. The human dermal matrix is a notable example that, depending on its processing method, can become freeze-dried or solvent-dehydrated acellular dermal matrix (FDADM and SDADM, respectively). This article reports the 9-year outcomes of a randomized clinical trial regarding gingival phenotype modification following root coverage with FDADM and SDADM. Twelve of the original 20 patients were available at the 9-year follow-up. Overall, the outcomes of gingival phenotype modification were maintained in both groups and at all sites after 9 years. For KTW, an incremental increase was observed over time in both groups, and minimal or no changes were noted in GT from the 1-year recall to the 9-year recall. However, the gingival margin level showed an apical shift for both groups."

After 4 months, during preparation for implant placement, bone and gingival tissues were collected for histological and biomolecular analysis. Clinically, the test and control groups showed mean gains of keratinized gingiva of 4.30±1.20mm and 2.50±2.20mm, respectively. A reduction in ridge width was observed in the control (2.90±2.70mm) and test (3.30±2.00mm) groups. The bone height alteration ranged from a reduction of 0.12±1.60mm to a gain of 0.60±3.60mm on average for both groups. Analysis of gene expression (OPG/RANKL) in gingival fibroblasts and osteoblasts revealed no difference between the two groups. Ridge preservation using the d-PTFE membrane increased the formation of keratinized tissue. A reduction in width and mild reduction/gain in height of the alveolar ridge was observed in both groups.

            "abstract": "The purpose of this report was to use a particular clinical trial, the Preventive Geriatric Trial (PGT), as a starting point to discuss whether treatment efficacy can be evaluated by means of tooth mortality. In the PGT, 296 subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to five treatment groups: (1) usual procedures (UP); (2) UP + a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CB); (3) UP + CB + weekly chlorhexidine rinse (CHX); (4) UP + CB + CHX + semi-annual fluoride varnish (F); and (5) UP + CB + CHX + F + semi-annual prophylaxis, including scaling (P). Exploratory analyses revealed that tooth mortality after the 1st year was lower in treatment groups 3, 4, and 5 than in groups 1 and 2. A one-year exposure resulted in a 45% reduction in tooth mortality (p < 0.05); a two-year exposure resulted in a 59% reduction (p-value < 0.04). The PGT findings suggested that it is possible to design trials based on clinically relevant endpoints, such as tooth mortality. For the detection of moderate treatment effects, such trials could take the form of Large, Simple Trials (LST), where many subjects are recruited with minimally restrictive entry criteria, and data are collected only on essential baseline characteristics and tooth mortality. LSTs have provided \"reliable answers to important clinical questions\" for other chronic diseases, and several arguments suggest that they could play a similar critical role in dental research: (1) Periodontitis and caries are among the most common and costly chronic diseases affecting humans, and the identification of even moderately effective treatments by LSTs can have a large socio-economic impact; (2) the identification of low-cost widely practicable treatments that lend themselves to be investigated in LSTs is likely to benefit more people than the identification of high-cost complex treatments; and (3) tooth mortality is simple to assess and more relevant than the unvalidated surrogate endpoints that have largely failed for more than 20 years to provide reliable answers to certain controversial issues regarding treatment efficacy. The cost of not reliably establishing the safety and the efficacy of treatments may be far greater than the cost of conducting LSTs."

Twenty-six students were randomly divided into two groups, and their skills were evaluated according to the following criteria: time spent on the dentine excavation procedure (in min), students' perceived confidence in conducting the procedure (graded assessed on a scale from 0 to 10), and the outcome of artificial carious tissue removal, evaluated by measuring the residual dyed artificial carious dentine layer (in μm). Statistical analyses were carried out using a t-test to compare the students' confidence and time spent on the procedure, and a two-way ANOVA was used to compare residual artificial decayed dentine with educational methods and tooth region (incisal, medium, and cervical thirds) as factors.

            "abstract": "The new generation of manual and powered toothbrushes that have been tested in recent years exhibit better plaque removal than do older brushes. Differences are most significant when individuals have been instructed in proper brushing technique. Comparisons of powered and manual brushes show the clear superiority of newer powered brushes, but there is no such effect with older powered brushes, which stop when force is applied. Newer powered brushes reduce gingivitis and gingival abrasions. In a limited 18-month trial, a powered oscillating toothbrush improved existing periodontal conditions, thus effecting a considerable savings in treatment costs. At present, under optimal conditions, improved designs of both manual and powered toothbrushes, which do not stop or break down in use, produce more significant plaque removal in critical sites. Long-term trials are needed to confirm these results."

It has been theorized that compression reduces pain intensity through vasoconstriction. The current research tests the veracity of this vasoconstriction hypothesis by testing the impact of local epinephrine (a local vasoconstrictor) versus a control on patients' pain ratings over 7 days following surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Method and materials:\n        \n      \n      Fifty patients scheduled for mandibular third molar surgery were randomly assigned to receive one cartridge of Ultracaine DS Forte (the treatment group) or one cartridge of Ultracaine DS (the control group) after surgical removal of the third molar.

Twenty-one extracted human upper central deciduous incisors were used in this in vitro study. The teeth were darkened with human blood for a period of 21 days. After preparing the teeth, they were randomly distributed into 2 groups, according to bleaching source of activation: (1) a diode laser (DL) group; and (2) a halogen lamp (HL) group. The bleaching process was performed, according to the manufacturer's guidelines, using Whiteness HP (FGM, Joinville, Brazil). The color was assessed by spectrophotometer (CIELab) and the VITA scale (3M) before and immediately after tooth whitening. The temperature increase in the radicular surface during the bleaching was registered with a thermographic camera ThermaCAM SC 3000 (Flir Systems, Danderyd, Sweden) at the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute, IPEN-CNEN (São Paulo, Brazil). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of color changes, but there was a statistically significant difference for temperature variation. The use of a diode laser and halogen lamp both promoted whitening in devitalized primary teeth in vitro. As a catalytic source of energy, the diode laser--with the applied parameters--promoted a smaller temperature increase compared to the halogen lamp during the bleaching procedure on nonvital primary teeth."

Prior to each procedure, either betamethasone 9 mg (Celeston Chronodose) or placebo was administered intramuscularly, in a randomized fashion. Objective and subjective assessments were recorded for paired comparison of the post-operative course, including swelling, pain, trismus, local temperature, bleeding, wound-healing and preference for treatment. In 23 patients, less swelling occurred when betamethasone was given pre-operatively. The mean reduction on the 3rd and 6th post-operative days was 55% (p less than 0.001) and 69% (p less than 0.001), respectively. Pain assessments (visual analogue scale) were significantly lower after the corticosteroid injection; mean response: 1st evening 17 vs 56 mm, 2nd evening 5 vs 37 mm, and 3rd evening 2 vs 13 mm. No significant correlation between the steroid-induced reduction in swelling and pain could be made. This may indicate that dissociation may exist between pain and other inflammatory events like swelling.

One-hundred and twenty nonvital anterior teeth with apical periodontitis were randomly treated using either a reciprocating single file followed by matching-taper single-cone filling or a hand file and lateral compaction filling. Postoperative pain was assessed during the 7 days after the treatment, using a visual analogue scale and a verbal rating scale. Apical healing was assessed using the periapical index score after a 12-month follow-up. The hypothesis tested was that both protocols were equivalent and present similar effectiveness in healing periapical lesions. Data were analyzed through two one-sided tests, t-tests, as well as Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests (α = 0.05). Logistic regression was used to investigate the association of clinical and demographic factors with the success of treatment. Regardless of the assessment time, no difference in incidence (38%-43% at first 24h), intensity of postoperative pain, and incidence of flare-up (≈ 3%) was observed between the two endodontic protocols. Both protocols resulted in a similar healing rate of apical periodontitis. After 12 months, the success rate ranged from 73% to 78% and the difference between the treatments fell within the pre-established equivalence margin (-0.1; -0.41 to 0.2).

The working length was determined to be 1 mm shorter than the '0.0' mark of the apex locator. Root canals were filled with gutta-percha and an epoxy resin-based root canal sealer using a lateral compaction technique. The teeth were restored using a resin composite material. A single operator performed the retreatments in a single visit. The incidence and intensity of postoperative pain were rated on a numeric rating scale by patients 24, 48 and 72 h after retreatment. The number of analgesic tablets (400 mg Ibuprofen) taken by patients was also recorded. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon and chi-square tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For the intensity of postoperative pain, the difference between the four groups was not significantly different (p > .05).

The pain levels during restorative treatment were assessed using a visual analogue scale. Heart rates and behavior were also recorded. A crossover design was used with each child acting as his/her own control. The results showed that overall, EDA was less effective than LA for cavity preparation. The reported pain scores for EDA were higher in permanent teeth for the deeper cavities, and with one of the operators. The pre- or post-treatment anxiety scores were not found to differ significantly between the two restorative appointments. However, children with the highest pretreatment scores were more likely to report higher pain scores with EDA. Despite this, 63% of the children preferred EDA to LA. Dental anxiety, cavity depth, the tooth being treated, and operator attitude may also be important factors in determining the success of EDA."

Two hundred and ninety-six six-to-twelve year olds were randomly selected from two schools, one private, the other public, located in the Municipality of Maracaibo, State of Zulia, Venezuela. The children assigned to each school were randomly distributed among the experimental and control groups. A general hypothesis was set up, stating that reinforcement and motivation generate changes in the gingival health of the children under study, but with different results for each, depending on their psycho-social characteristics. Two approaches were used: instruction/supervision and instruction/supervision/reinforcement/stimulation. These two approaches were then measured against a \"psycho-social profile\" which is based on material conditions and the developmental stages of the children. Instructions were given to the experimental group on how to brush their teeth. They were supervised, reinforced and stimulated for a period of six months, with a post-test assessment. The control group was only given instructions on how to brush their teeth and supervised. A scale based on Massler's classification was used to determine the developmental stages. Standardized indices were used to evaluate the dependent variable: Plaque Index and Gingival Index. The results showed that: the material living conditions and developmental stage of the child are elements that influence the assimilation of pre-established behavior, the basis of preventive programs."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Irreversible pulpitis is a highly painful inflammatory condition of the dental pulp which represents a common dental emergency. Recommended care is partial endodontic treatment. The dental literature reports major difficulties in achieving adequate analgesia to perform this emergency treatment, especially in the case of mandibular molars. In current practice, short-course, orally administered corticotherapy is used for the management of oral pain of inflammatory origin. The efficacy of intraosseous local steroid injections for irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars has already been demonstrated but resulted in local comorbidities. Oral administration of short-course prednisolone is simple and safe but its efficacy to manage pain caused by irreversible pulpitis has not yet been demonstrated. This trial aims to evaluate the noninferiority of short-course, orally administered corticotherapy versus partial endodontic treatment for the emergency care of irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This study is a noninferiority, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital. One hundred and twenty subjects will be randomized in two 1:1 parallel arms: the intervention arm will receive one oral dose of prednisolone (1 mg/kg) during the emergency visit, followed by one morning dose each day for 3 days and the reference arm will receive partial endodontic treatment. Both groups will receive planned complete endodontic treatment 72 h after enrollment. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with pain intensity below 5 on a Numeric Scale 24 h after the emergency visit. Secondary outcomes include comfort during care, the number of injected anesthetic cartridges when performing complete endodontic treatment, the number of antalgic drugs and the number of patients coming back for consultation after 72 h.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This randomized trial will assess the ability of short-term corticotherapy to reduce pain in irreversible pulpitis as a simple and rapid alternative to partial endodontic treatment and to enable planning of endodontic treatment in optimal analgesic conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02629042 .

Forty patients subjected to on session of in-office bleaching with 38% peroxide hydrogen. Subsequently, the patients were randomly allocated to receive a second session of in-office bleaching or to use a tray containing 10% carbamide peroxide delivered during 7 consecutive days. The worst TS score reported during or after each bleaching procedure was recorded using a verbal rating scale and TS risk (score different from 0) was calculated. Color changes were measured 7 days after each in-office session (for patients receiving in-office procedures only) or after the end of at-home bleaching (for the combined protocol), and 6 months after the last procedure for both bleaching protocols. Color was assessed by a spectrophotometer and by color match with the Vita Classical and Bleach guide scales. Statistical analyses were carried out to assess possible differences between the protocols regarding the outcomes and to analyze the effect of time of assessment on color changes. The bleaching protocol did not affect the risk for and the maximum level of TS reported, irrespective of the time of assessment. In the color evaluation, the bleaching protocol also did not affect the ultimate tooth color. In conclusion, after one in-office bleaching session, there was no difference in bleaching effectiveness and TS between performing a second in-office session and associating it with 1-week at-home bleaching."

The aim of this study was to determine predictors of clinical outcomes after non-surgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis. A total of 24 patients (aged 13-26 years) received oral hygiene instructions, as well as subgingival scaling and root planing. Twelve subjects received systemic azithromycin at random. Clinical variables were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Baseline microbiological assessment was performed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Multivariable models used generalized estimating equations. There were significant improvements in the entire sample in regard to pocket depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing. Significant predictors of a reduction in mean pocket depth were: use of azithromycin, non-molar teeth, generalized disease and baseline pocket depth. Absence of plaque predicted a 0.22 mm higher attachment gain, whereas a baseline pocket depth ≥7 mm predicted a 1.36 mm higher attachment loss. Azithromycin, plaque, and baseline pocket depth were significant predictors of bleeding on probing. The concomitant presence of all three red complex species predicted a 0.78 mm higher attachment loss. It may be concluded that dental plaque, tooth type, disease extent, baseline pocket depth, and use of azithromycin were significant predictors of the clinical response to treatment for aggressive periodontitis in young individuals. Moreover, the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens may predict challenges in achieving a favorable outcome for aggressive periodontitis."

Since both periodontitis and RA are complex and multifactorial chronic diseases, it is likely that patient-centred approaches involving both oral health professionals and rheumatologists will contribute to optimal patient care.

            "title": "Antibiotics to prevent complications following tooth extractions.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The most frequent indications for tooth extractions, generally performed by general dental practitioners, are dental caries and periodontal infections. Systemic antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevention of infectious complications following tooth extractions.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 16 April 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 April 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 April 2020), and LILACS (1982 to 16 April 2020). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      At least two review authors independently performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included studies. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for key outcomes as high, moderate, low, or very low, using the GRADE approach.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 23 trials that randomised approximately 3206 participants (2583 analysed) to prophylactic antibiotics or placebo. Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, only one of the trials evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in groups of patients affected by those clinical conditions. We assessed 16 trials as being at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and four as unclear. Compared to placebo, antibiotics may reduce the risk of postsurgical infectious complications in patients undergoing third molar extractions by approximately 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1728 participants; 12 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 19 people (95% CI 15 to 34) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. Antibiotics may also reduce the risk of dry socket by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; 1882 participants; 13 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 46 people (95% CI 29 to 62) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. The evidence for our other outcomes is uncertain: pain, whether measured dichotomously as presence or absence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.12; 675 participants; 3 studies) or continuously using a visual analogue scale (0-to-10-centimetre scale, where 0 is no pain) (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.07; 422 participants; 4 studies); fever (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.79; 475 participants; 4 studies); and adverse effects, which were mild and transient (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.64; 1277 participants; 8 studies) (very low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence that the timing of antibiotic administration (preoperative, postoperative, or both) was important. The included studies enrolled a subset of patients undergoing dental extractions, that is healthy people who had surgical extraction of third molars. Consequently, the results of this review may not be generalisable to all people undergoing tooth extractions.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The vast majority (21 out of 23) of the trials included in this review included only healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. None of the studies evaluated tooth extraction in immunocompromised patients. We found low-certainty evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket following third molar extraction when compared to placebo, and very low-certainty evidence of no increase in the risk of adverse effects. On average, treating 19 healthy patients with prophylactic antibiotics may stop one person from getting an infection. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to patients with concomitant illnesses or patients at a higher risk of infection. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic treatment, clinicians should evaluate if and when to prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy before a dental extraction for each patient on the basis of the patient's clinical conditions (healthy or affected by systemic pathology) and level of risk from infective complications. Immunocompromised patients, in particular, need an individualised approach in consultation with their treating medical specialist."

Pain intensity was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) three times a day for seven days. At day seven, overall pain reduction was scored on a global perceived effect (GPE) scale and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed. Ninety-five patients completed the trial. The VAS scores demonstrated a significant pain decrease in groups A and B three days postoperatively. No significant differences were observed between groups A and B.

The aim of this experimental, observational and randomized clinical control trial was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of amitriptyline on clinical parameters and on inflammatory biomarkers in patients of periodontal diseases by developing 1% oral gel and mouthwash formulations. 30 patients participated in the study were grouped in three categories, patients received standard conventional treatment, patients received gel treatment for four weeks after standard treatment, patients received mouthwash for four weeks after standard periodontal treatment. Results showed that amitriptyline gel and mouthwash in 1% formulation showed promising results by significantly reducing periodontal parameters and inflammatory biomarkers (p<0.001) as compared to standard treatment.

A total of 193 adults who smoked cigarettes volunteered with informed consent, were given routine dental prophylaxes, and were examined for the presence of plaque, stained pellicle, gingivitis, calculus, and general oral pathosis. The subjects were then randomly assigned to use either a nicotine-containing or a placebo chewing gum. After 15 weeks the subjects were recalled and re-examined. Smoking cessation was determined through questionnaire and analysis of the carbon monoxide content of alveolar air.

Aims of the explorative clinical trial were therefore to investigate whether the usage of an activated sonic toothbrush reduces plaque more effectively than an inactivated one used as a manual toothbrush, and to which extent the correct use of such toothbrush plays a role in its efficacy. The clinical trial was designed as a video-controlled interventional study. Thirty participants (mean (±SD) age 22.9 (±2.5) years) were included, areas of interest were the buccal surfaces of the upper premolars and the first molar (partial mouth recording). Toothbrushing was performed without toothpaste in a single brushing exercise under four different conditions: switched off, habitually used as manual toothbrush, no instruction; switched on, habitually used as powered toothbrush, no instruction; switched off, used as manual toothbrush, instruction in the Modified Bass Technique; switched on, used as powered toothbrush, instruction in a specific technique for sonic toothbrushes. Brushing performance was controlled by videotaping, plaque was assessed at baseline (after 4 days without toothbrushing) using the Rustogi modified Navy-Plaque-Index and planimetry. Main study results were that plaque decreased distinctly after habitual brushing regardless of using the sonic brush in ON or OFF mode (p for all comparisons < 0.001). After instruction, participants were able to use the sonic brush in ON mode as intended, with only minor impact on efficacy. Using the toothbrush in OFF mode with the Modified Bass Technique was significantly less effective than all other conditions (p for all comparisons < 0.001). Under the conditions used, the sonic toothbrush was not more effective when switched on than when switched off, and there was no evidence that the correct use of the toothbrush was more effective than the habitual use."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Protection of the palatal wound is an essential step following harvesting a palatal soft tissue graft. The aim of the current pilot randomized clinical study was to assess the efficacy of using propylene mesh as protective sheet when compared to conventional custom made acrylic stent after harvesting a palatal graft. The primary outcome of this study was bleeding postoperatively and secondary outcomes were pain, healing profile of the donor site as well as patient satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 24 patients with palatal defects. Two groups of 12 patients with 24 sites were included in this study and were treated with soft tissue grafting technique using free grafts harvested from the hard palate. The palatal wounds were protected with propylene mesh (test group) or custom-made acrylic palatal stent (control group). Participants were assessed for the amount and duration of bleeding, pain duration, and the risk of infection 2, 4, 6, 8, 14 days post-operatively. The trial had been registered in clinical trials.gov (NCT04348279).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Four sites were excluded from the study as dropouts. The polypropylene mesh was more effective at reducing bleeding by (2.4 ± 1.075) and pain by (1.600 ± 0.516), while the custom-made acrylic stent reduced the bleeding (5.8 ± 1.22) and pain (7.100 ± 0.316). The decline in amount of bleeding amount (P value = 0.021) and its duration (P value = 0.001) achieved by the propylene mesh was statistically significant. There was no statistical significant difference in patient satisfaction and the duration of healing process between the 2 groups. However, the healing profile of the test group was statistically significant when compared with the control group (P value = 0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Propylene mesh is a promising material for protection of the palatal wound due to its light weight, limited bacterial wicking, tissue compatibility. Further studies are required to adequally assess the benefits of this material in periodontal plastic surgeries."

The GCF collected was analysed with respect to the content of lactoferrin and albumin.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the experimental periods, it was observed that significantly less plaque formed and less gingivitis developed when the participants rinsed with the Listerine mouthwash than with saline solution. However, significantly more plaque formed during the Listerine than during the CHX rinse period, while there was no significant difference in the development of gingival bleeding between the Listerine and the CHX rinse regimens. Significantly smaller proportions of motile rods and fusiforms were found in the List and CHX groups than in the control (Ctrl) group. The increase of the lactoferrin/albumin ratio in the List group was significantly smaller than that in the Ctrl group but significantly larger than in the CHX group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      It was suggested that the effect of Listerine on gingivitis is more pronounced than on plaque formation. This indicates that the phenolic compound may have anti-inflammatory effects."

Nineteen participants (with isolated gingival recession) each treated by laterally closed tunnel technique were randomized to either add on treatment with control (sham laser application) or test group (photobiomodulation with 660 nm diode, 3.5 J/cm2 per point of application). The primary outcome variable was change in recession depth and secondary variables included recession width, width of keratinized gingiva, periodontal biotype, and VAS score for pain assessment and EHS index for early wound healing assessment. Analysis was performed using a linear mixed effects model. There were no significant differences in the gingival recession depth (p = 0.8324) and recession width (p-0.969) at 3-month follow-up. The VAS scores were significantly lower for the test (laterally closed tunnel technique + photobiomodulation) group as compared to control (laterally closed tunnel technique + sham laser) over time (p = < 0.0001) as well as per site (p = 0.0006) The Early Wound Healing Index scores were significantly higher in the test (laterally closed tunnel technique + photobiomodulation) group as compared to control (laterally closed tunnel technique + sham laser) group (p < 0.0001). The adjunctive use of photobiomodulation did not show a better outcome concerning recession depth but appears to provide faster healing of the surgical wounds and better patient comfort. The result needs further evaluation in particular with respect to long-term effect and due to limitation in sample size. Clinical Trial Registry of India: CTRI/2019/11/022012."

Both drugs were given at the same dose (1 g, thrice daily) during two days; from the third to the seventh day, the patients could freely take the same drug if necessary. The analgesic effect of drugs was measured by two means: an analog scale of pain during day 1 & 2 and the count of drugs units taken during days 3 to 7. The side effects were reported. We included 473 patients (167 men, 306 women) by means of a group of 54 general practitioners. 470 patients were stratified according to the site of pain: head (n = 113), joints (n = 80), back (n = 193), thorax (n = 11), teeth (n = 48), ENT (n = 25). The pain was either acute (73%) or chronic (27%) and scored an average +/- SD of 76 +/- 12 mm on an analog visual scale from 0 to 100 mm. Response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% of the pain score. Before intake of active drugs, all patients were given placebo. Only 14% responded. Under LAS or PAR, although the difference is not statistically significant, the number of responders was slightly higher with LAS than with PAR. Moreover, the study yields some interesting differences. During day 1 and day 2, the patients of the LAS group had less pain than those of the PAR group. This difference became statistically significant at D2 H12 (p < 0.05). LAS was significantly more effective than PAR in patients with back pain (p < 0.01), and there was a trend in favor of LAS in dental and ENT pain, and for intense pain. PAR never yielded better response levels than LAS. Among the placebo-unresponsive patients, the amount of drug taken from day 3 to day 7 was significantly lower in the LAS group than in the PAR group (p < 0.05). The side effects were comparable in both groups. According to the investigators' point of view both drugs were similarly well accepted by the patients (89.3% in LAS group, 94% in PAR group). The fact that LAS seems more effective than PAR in some kinds of pain is to bring near to the anti-inflammatory action of LAS and to its better bioavailability."

When comparing C+P with B+P and PA no significant differences were observed, adjusted incident rate ratio (97.5% CI): B+P vs C+P 0.95 (0.75, 1.21), PA vs C+P 1.18 (0.94, 1.48).Secondary outcomes:• Cost effectiveness, PA was the least costly but least effective for both co-primary outcomes with little evidence in this paper as to how and why B+P and C+P would provide greater benefits• COHRQOL, P-CPQ-16, anxiety showed no statistical differences• Parent reported anticipatory anxiety showed differences between PA vs C+P; 6% lower in the PA arm, adjusted risk difference -0.06 ((97.5% CI): -0.11 to -0.003)• Caries incidence showed no differences in the caries in primary or first permanent molars• Qualitative views showed that all three approaches were generally acceptable but trust in the dental professional played a significant role. Local anaesthesia and dental extractions were generally viewed more negatively.Conclusions There were no statistical differences between the three strategies for the co-primary outcomes, namely the incidence or number of episodes of dental pain and/or infection experienced by the study participants. The secondary outcomes suggest less anticipatory anxiety in the PA arm of the trial and that local anaesthesia and dental extractions were viewed negatively."

A total of 111 patients aged between 20 and 63 years, from a general population, with bleeding on probing at 30% or more of all sites examined were entered into the study. At baseline, immediately after periodontal examination, all volunteers received a thorough scaling of their teeth. Volunteers in both groups were told to brush their teeth for 2 min 2 x a day. Oral hygiene instruction was given at the start of the study and was not repeated. At 3, 6 and 12 months, assessments were carried out by a single clinician who was not aware which group the volunteers belonged to. Analysis of results demonstrated that over the 12 months of the study, the Braun Oral-B Plak Control was significantly more effective in improving gingival health than the manual toothbrush. There was, however, no difference between the 2 groups in terms of plaque removal, with the number of sites with visible plaque decreasing by a similar amount in both groups.

The purpose of this review was to describe restorative approaches applied to permanent first molars (PFM) with molar hypomineralization (MH). Methods: This review was registered (PROSPERO database CRD42017078336). Searches were conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, BBO, and Cochrane Library databases and grey literature. From a total of 1,751 studies, 12 that compared restorative treatments for PFM with MH were included. The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The success rate was the primary outcome. Results: The restorative treatment options were direct restorations with amalgam, glass ionomer cement, and resin-based composite as well as indirect restorations with stainless steel, porcelain, ceromer, and gold crowns. The restorative techniques, considering the type of isolation and the removal of caries and hypomineralization, vary between the study. There was also a lack of standard clinical criteria for restorative evaluation. The follow-up period ranged from six to 216 months. The success of direct restorations ranged from 86.3 to 100 percent. For indirect restorations, success ranged from 91.3 to 100 percent. Conclusions: There were multiple clinical protocols for MH. The studies presented heterogeneity in the restoration technique, time, and clinical criteria for restorative follow-up. Direct restorations with glass ionomer cement and resin-based composite could be the first choices for restoration. Further randomized clinical trials on a restorative treatment for MH are needed."

Demographics of the patient populations at the 3 locations are reported. As expected, therapy induced only negligible changes in the measures of disease at healthy sites in control subjects, and relatively minor improvement in healthy sites in patients. In contrast, statistically significant improvement relative to pretreatment baseline status in all 3 measures of disease was observed for diseased sites at all 3 study locations with all p-values less than 0.0002.

One hundred and twenty subjects were randomly assigned to study groups: test (0.075% CPC and 0.28% zinc lactate), positive control (0.07% CPC) and negative control mouthwash without CPC. All volunteers were examined by a calibrated examiner for the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (Turesky modification) and Löe-Silness Gingival Index (GI). Gingival severity was also measured by the percentage of sites with positive gingival bleeding. During six weeks, oral hygiene consisted of brushing twice daily with a toothbrush and toothpaste and rising with their assigned mouthwash. Plaque and gingival parameters were assessed at baseline, after four and six weeks of product use. Statistical analyses were performed separately for plaque and gingival indices, by ANOVA, paired t-test and ANCOVA (α < 0.05). After 4 and 6 weeks, all mouthwashes groups presented statistically significant reductions in plaque and gingival parameters as compared to baseline. In comparison to the positive control, the test group presented additional reductions in dental plaque of 19.8% and 16.8%, after 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. For GI, the additional reductions in the test group were 9.7% and 14.3%, at 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. The test group showed additional reduction of 35.3% and 54.5% in the gingival severity, at week 4 and 6, respectively. It is concluded that the mouthwash containing CPC and zinc lactate presents significant anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effects as compared to positive and negative control mouthwashes."

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a eutectic mixture containing 25 mg/g of lidocaine and 25 mg/g of prilocaine, injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2% benzocaine and a placebo substance on reducing pain during SRP. In this randomized, split-mouth, masked clinical trial, thirty-two patients presenting more than two teeth with probing depth and clinical attachment level ≥ 5 mm in at least 4 sextants were randomly allocated to four groups: EMLA(r); injectable 2% lidocaine; topical 2% benzocaine and placebo. Pain and discomfort were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and verbal scale (VS). Repeated-measures analysis of variance and Poisson regression were used for analysis. Patient satisfaction with the anesthesia was determined at the end of each treatment session. VAS and VS scores did not differ between injectable 2% lidocaine and EMLA (p > 0.05) and both substances showed significantly better pain control compared to 2% benzocaine and placebo (p < 0.05). 93.7% and 81.2% of the individuals were satisfied with the injectable anesthetic and EMLA, respectively (p = 0.158). Dissatisfaction with benzocaine and placebo was approximately 10 times greater than injectable anesthesia (p = 0.001). In conclusion, EMLA showed an equivalent effect on pain control when compared to the injectable anesthesia and performed better than 2% benzocaine in SRP. Thus, EMLA is a viable anesthetic option during scaling and root planning, despite the frequent need for second application."

            "abstract": "Dentifrices are a general term used to describe preparations that are used together with a toothbrush with the purpose to clean and/or polish the teeth. Active toothpastes were first formulated in the 1950s and included ingredients such as urea, enzymes, ammonium phosphate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate and stannous fluoride. Later, therapeutic agents were included. Today's toothpastes have two objectives: to help the toothbrush in cleaning the tooth surface and to provide a therapeutic effect. The therapeutic effect may have an antiplaque or anti-inflammatory basis when the nature of the agents is antimicrobial. Plaque inhibitory and antiplaque activity of toothpastes used for chemical plaque control is evaluated in distinct consecutive stages, the last being home use randomized clinical trials of at least 6 months' duration. In this chapter, the scientific evidence supporting the use of the most common antiplaque agents, included in toothpaste formulations, is reviewed, with a special emphasis on 6-month clinical trials, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses of the mentioned studies. Among the active agents, the following have been included in toothpastes: enzymes, amine alcohols, herbal or natural products, triclosan, bisbiguanides (chlorhexidine), quaternary ammonium compounds (cetylpyridinium chloride) and different metal salts (zinc salts, stannous fluoride, stannous fluoride with amine fluoride). Dentifrices are the ideal vehicles for any active ingredient used as an oral health preventive measure since they are used in combination with toothbrushing, which is the most frequently employed oral hygiene method. The most important indications of dentifrices with active ingredients are associated with long-term use to prevent bacterial biofilm formation, mostly in gingivitis patients or in patients on supportive periodontal therapy."

A half-mouth was scaled 2 weeks prior to therapy in all groups. Rinses were performed 2 times daily and irrigation was performed once a day by means of an oral irrigator with the tip directed at a right angle to the tooth. Subjects continued with routine oral hygiene without instruction. The active treatment period was 2 months. Parameters were recorded at baseline and at 60 days. At the conclusion, marginal plaque was cultured for predominant microbial types. CHX-rinse (0.12%) and CHX-irrigation (0.06%) significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) plaque. Gingival bleeding decreased by 26% in both scaled and unscaled sites following CHX (0.12%) rinses and by 40% at both types of sites following CHX (0.06%) irrigation. Bleeding was reduced with CHX-irrigation greater (p less than 0.05) than with the placebo-irrigation. The mean log of colony-forming units of Actinomyces species was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the CHX (0.12%) rinse and CHX (0.06%) irrigator groups than in the placebo groups.

The reliability of the average score per subject, maximum score per subject, and the % of affected sites per person are estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient. Procedures are presented that utilize various forms of the weighted kappa statistic for dissecting patterns in examiner agreement for specific sites, types of site, all sites, and for the individual components and categories of the index.

            "abstract": "The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether a Nance or Goshgarian palatal arch was most effective for prevention of mesial drift, distal tipping, prevention of mesio-palatal rotation of the upper first permanent molars, and patient comfort and ease of removal. Patients were recruited from a district general hospital and a specialist orthodontic practice and randomly allocated to a Goshgarian (n = 29) or a Nance (n = 28) group. Pre-treatment study models (T1) were taken followed by the placement of the palatal arch, premolar extractions, and upper and lower fixed appliances. The clinical end point was 6 months (T2), at which time, an impression for an upper study model was taken. The amount of upper first permanent molar mesial movement, distal tipping, and mesio-palatal rotation was measured by scanning T1 and T2 study models and then using a software program to calculate molar changes. In addition, the patients recorded their discomfort scores using a seven-point Likert scale at each recall visit. Forty-nine patients (86 per cent) completed the trial. t-tests were used to compare molar movements between the Goshgarian and Nance palatal arch groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the palatal arches in terms of prevention of mesial drift or distal tipping (P > 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of molar rotation between the arch types, with both exhibiting some disto-palatal rotation even though they were not activated for this movement. The Goshgarian palatal arch produced marginally more disto-palatal rotation than the Nance arch (P = 0.02), although this may not be considered clinically significant. A Mann-Whitney test revealed that there was also a statistically significant difference in pain scores between the Goshgarian and the Nance arch, with the latter being associated with more discomfort (P = 0.001). This trial did not support any preference in the use of the Goshgarian or Nance palatal arch, unless the slightly reduced patient discomfort with the Goshgarian arch is considered significant."

            "abstract": "Thirty (30) class I and class II recessions in 30 subjects were treated with a subepithelial connective tissue graft procedure. In one group (15 sites), the surgery was carried out in a traditional fashion: the epithelial collar of the graft was preserved and left exposed (CTG group). In the second group (15 sites), the epithelial collar of the graft was removed and the recession areas were conditioned with citric acid. The graft was then sutured and completely immersed under the facial flap which was coronally repositioned (CR group). Clinical assessments included probing depth, probing attachment level, surface area of the recession, and gingival width. These measurements were taken at baseline and at 6 months. In addition, an esthetic evaluation was done. The differences between treatments were not statistically significant except for the augmentation of gingiva (P < or = 0.05). Based on the midfacial measurements taken in the central area of the recession, the mean percentage of root coverage was 69.2%. In the CR group, 3 of the 15 recessions exhibited complete root coverage; the gingival augmentation was 65.5%. In the CTG group, 5 of the 15 recessions exhibited complete root coverage; the gingival augmentation was 94.4%. The mean surface area of root exposure was reduced from 13.82 mm2 and 13.67 mm2 to 2.15 mm2 and 2.34 mm2 for the CR group and the CTG group, respectively. One-hundred percent (100%) of good-to-moderate esthetic results were found by a panel of independent examiners; there was tendency toward better results in the CR group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the first experiment, 8 subjects were tested for the effect of hypnotic anesthesia on sensory detection and MIP at non-painful stimulus levels (mean = 42.1 microA) and painful levels (mean = 86.5 microA). The percentage of detection for non-painful stimuli changed from 94.3% to 14.1% and for painful stimuli from 100% to 28%; both changes were significant (P less than 0.001). Hypnotic anesthesia blocked sensation without interrupting the initiation of the early component of the MIP, but did suppress its late component. In the second experiment, 8 subjects were tested for the perceived intensity of 5 levels of electrical tooth-pulp stimulation under hypnotic anesthesia and placebo. Sensory intensity was measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). Hypnotic anesthesia was significantly more effective than placebo (P less than 0.001) in reducing sensation. The differential effect of hypnotic anesthesia on the early and late component of the MIP lends further support to the hypothesis that hypnotic anesthesia operates primarily at suprasegmental, higher levels in the brain."

The control group received normal saline and three experimental groups received a single dose of dexamethasone (8 mg/2 mL), or tramadol (100 mg/2 mL) or articaine (4% / 2 mL). The pre-operative pain levels of the patients were measured with the Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP VAS). All patients received standard IANB of 4% articaine with 1:200000 epinephrine. Following the observation of lip numbness, submucosal injections were administered into the mucobuccal fold adjacent to the mandibular molars. After 15 min, standard root canal treatment was initiated, and the pain intensity levels recorded from the access cavity preparation to pulp extirpation were measured with HP VAS. The duration of the anaesthesia was also evaluated. The experimental groups were compared using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H-test. The groups that were significantly different were compared pairwise using the Tukey Multiple Comparison test. The Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The submucosal administration of articaine significantly increased the success rate to 63% in comparison with the control group that received submucosal saline (p < .05). The success rate of pulpal anaesthesia was 37% in the control group, 57% in the tramadol group and 47% in the dexamethasone group, with no significant difference in the success rate among these groups. In the dexamethasone group, the duration of the anaesthetic effect of IANB was significantly longer than those in the other groups (p < .001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In patients with SIP, pre-operative submucosal administration of articaine increased the success rate of IANB, while administration of dexamethasone increased the duration of anaesthesia.

The patients rated their pain experience immediately after the insertion of the archwire, 4 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, and at each monthly visit using a visual analog scale (VAS). Results. The rate of upper dental alignment between T0 and T4 was significantly higher with the Damon3 compared to MBT brackets (P=0.015). Although significantly more changes in the lower LII scores were observed during the first three months with the Damon3 system, the rate of improvement in the irregularity of lower teeth over the 4-month period was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.50).

In this randomized controlled clinical trial we investigated the changes introduced in the oral ecosystem, during and after orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances in combination with or without a fluoride mouthwash, of 10-16.8 year old individuals (N = 91). We followed several clinical parameters in time, in combination with microbiome changes using next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. During the course of our study, the oral microbial community displayed remarkable resilience towards the disturbances it was presented with. The effects of the fluoride mouthwash on the microbial composition were trivial. More pronounced microbial changes were related to gingival health status, orthodontic treatment and time. Periodontal pathogens (e.g. Selenomonas and Porphyromonas) were highest in abundance during the orthodontic treatment, while the health associated Streptococcus, Rothia and Haemophilus gained abundance towards the end and after the orthodontic treatment. Only minor compositional changes remained in the oral microbiome after the end of treatment. We conclude that, provided proper oral hygiene is maintained, changes in the oral microbiome composition resulting from orthodontic treatment are minimal and do not negatively affect oral health."

Zinc as an active ingredient has shown additive and synergistic effect and when Sodium fluoride (NaF) was used it failed to show added effectiveness and the combined effect of NaF and Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) both as active ingredients has never been evaluated. The present study assessed the effectiveness of active ingredients and to compare the frequency of adverse events occurring with traditional CHX and CHX+NaF+ZnCl2.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      A randomized double blind crossover trial was executed with 24 subjects participating in two consecutive experimental phases of 21 days each with CHX and CHX+NaF+ZnCl2 mouth rinses. Each individual was assessed for gingivitis, plaque, supragingival calculus and extrinsic stains at baseline and after experimental phase and adverse events experienced were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a significant difference (p = 0.014) between the two experimental mouth rinses for their effectiveness on gingivitis. In the CHX group, the gingival score on D21 was significantly greater by 0.13 than DO while with CHX+NaF+ZnCl2 there was a decrease in gingival score by 0.09 which was insignificant. No significant difference was observed between the interventions for plaque accumulation and formation of extrinsic stains. The difference in the mean calculus score at baseline and after experimental phase was 1.47 for CHX+NaF+ZnCl2 in contrast to 1.93 among CHX group.

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare rectal sedation with diazepam and rectal sedation with midazolam with regard to sedative effect, treatment acceptance, and amnesia. Ninety children, 1.5-3.5 years of age, consecutively referred for extractions of traumatized primary incisors were randomly sedated with diazepam (0.7 mg/kg body weight) or midazolam (0.3 mg/kg body weight). The study design was randomized and double-blind. The level of sedation (state of mind) was assessed prior to and 10 and 60 min after administration of the drug by use of a behavioral scale (Wilton). The children's acceptance of procedures was assessed using another behavioral scale (Holst) during administration of the sedative, application of topical anesthesia, injection of a local anesthesia, and extraction. Amnesia was evaluated by the parents on the following day, with the child being asked standardized questions. Parental ratings of the child's and their own distress during and after treatment were made on a visual analog scale (VAS). No differences were found between the sedatives concerning level of sedation during treatment, acceptance of procedures, or amnesia. At discharge, 60 min after administration of the sedative, the children receiving diazepam were significantly more agitated (P=0.006). Parental rating on a VAS of the child's discomfort after treatment was significantly higher in the diazepam group (P=0.006). There was a tendency for children with poor acceptance of the rectal administration to display a more negative acceptance of the dental treatment. In conclusion, the present results, in combination with known pharmacological advantages, indicate that midazolam is preferable in outpatients when sedation is needed and amnesia is desirable."

This study evaluates two dental isolation systems for fluid leakage in conjunction with a sham treatment of scaling and root planing. Materials and methods: Eight volunteers were randomly assigned to wear a conventional rubber dam (RD) and a combined suction and isolation device (IsoLite® system [IL]) alternatively on contralateral maxillary and mandibular quadrants. RD was cut between the canine and the first molar and was fixed on the first molar with a rubber dam clamp and with a tissue adhesive (Histoacryl) on the gingiva. IL was applied as recommended by the manufacturer. Ultrasonic instrumentation with corresponding irrigation water was used for 5 min as sham treatment, i.e. no actual therapy. The irrigation liquid was collected and the difference between the amount of liquid applied and that collected during treatment was determined. The volunteers then reported on their comfort during treatment. Results: Neither of the devices offered complete isolation. Mean leakage with both systems was generally low, i.e. approximately 10% (of the applied irrigant). More leakage was recorded in the maxilla than in the mandible, for both systems. Both devices were deemed moderately comfortable to wear. Conclusion: RD and IL isolated the working field to a similar degree. Since RD represents the highest isolation standard currently available, the use of IL must also be considered sufficient to prevent noxious amounts of antiseptic rinses from leaking into the mouth."

Vital bleaching was performed as follows: (1) bleaching gel in a prefabricated mouthguard and (2) an ad-mix technique--bleaching gel and toothpaste in a 1:1 ratio. In addition a control group used a placebo in a prefabricated mouthguard. The at-home vital bleaching system produced no adverse gingival tissue responses. Furthermore, the at-home vital bleaching system helped produce a therapeutic effect on inflamed gingival tissues over the course of the study."

A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 40 patients during a 6 week period. Patients who had moderate periodontitis (AAP Class III) received osseous periodontal surgery in one quadrant. Each surgical site received periodontal dressing and patients were given a placebo or CHx mouthrinse to be used twice each day. Compared to placebo, CHx significantly reduced plaque at all examinations (54.4% reduction over placebo at 6 weeks, P less than 0.05). Visible plaque (PlI greater than 2) in the CHx group was reduced by 99% over the placebo group at 6 weeks and at 4 weeks post-surgical, gingival inflammation scores were significantly lower in the CHx group (17% reduction over the placebo at 4 weeks, P less than 0.05). Gingival bleeding scores (GI greater than 2) were significantly lower in the CHx group at 4 and 6 weeks (41% and 40% reduction over the placebo group, P less than 0.05). Probing pocket depth and attachment level changes were not significantly different between both groups. Epithelialization rates and pain assessment demonstrated consistently better results in the CHx group, although differences were not statistically significant. Use of 0.12% chlorhexidine immediately following periodontal surgery, for 6 weeks, has been shown to be a clinically effective adjunct providing enhancement of the post-surgical management of periodontal surgical patients."

Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). Data were analyzed using McNemar, chi-squared, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests (α=0.01). There was no significant difference in patient-reported tooth sensitivity between the preoperative phase and all other time points (p>0.01).

In a cross-sectional study of women's health in Göteborg (population 432,000), Sweden, 1016 women aged 38 to 84 years participated. This randomly selected population took part in a series of investigative procedures including medical and dental clinical examinations, interviews and questionnaires. Levels of dental anxiety were measured on the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS). The average DAS score obtained was 7.2. The study showed that older women were significantly less anxious than younger ones. Severe dental anxiety (DAS > or = 15) was experienced by 3.9% of the participants. This frequency corresponds well with findings by Hällström and Halling in their analysis of data from the first Göteborg study of women's health 24 years ago. High levels of dental anxiety were correlated with longer intervals between dental visits, poorer oral function and aesthetics and a higher frequency of oral symptoms. Headaches were more prevalent in the younger age groups and a correlation with dental anxiety was revealed. Our previous studies have shown that symptoms such as tension headaches are prevalent among dental phobic patients and that they are reported to be reduced by therapy for dental fear. The clinical and radiographical examinations revealed a generally poorer oral status, with a statistically significant higher number of decayed teeth among women with high dental anxiety."

It is an unpleasant experience for both the patient and the dentist.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this study was to assess the severity and duration of pain following the endodontic treatment of primary molars with the use of rotary and reciprocating preparation systems compared to the traditional manual method.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      The research sample consisted of 157 asymptomatic primary lower second molars with non-vital pulp that were indicated for root canal treatment. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: in the 1st group, the molars (n = 52) were prepared using the manual method; in the 2nd group (n = 53), a reciprocating automated preparation system (WaveOne®) was used; and in the 3rd group (n = 52), a rotary preparation system (ProTaper Next®) was used. Pain assessment was carried out after 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, and after 1 week, using a four-face facial pain scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The manual method provided a higher pain score through 6, 12 and 24 h (p < 0.05) as compared to the 2 automated preparation systems. The intensity of pain did not vary between the 2 machine preparation systems after 6, 12 , 24, and 48 h (p > 0.05).

A questionnaire was developed to assess the importance of 12 criteria for surgical readiness. Each criterion was rated on a 5-point scale (1 = Unimportant, 5 = Critical). This questionnaire was sent to 104 randomly selected, board-certified orthodontists in the United States and Puerto Rico. Usable questionnaires were returned by 57 respondents (55% response rate). The highest and most consistent ratings were given for Arch Compatibility in the transverse dimension (mean = 4.66, SD = 0.55), Crossbite (mean = 4.57, SD = 0.63), and Torque of the Anterior Teeth (mean = 4.38, SD = 0.73). Further analysis showed a correlation between surgical experience of the orthodontist and a higher rating of importance for Torque of the Mandibular Teeth (Spearman r = 0.38), Torque of the Maxillary Teeth (Spearman r = 0.37), and Torque of the Anterior Teeth (Spearman r = 0.28). These results suggest that as orthodontists gain surgical experience, they attribute more importance to correcting the torque of the teeth. Also, the relatively large differences in opinion regarding presurgery orthodontic setup support a need for further research and/or educational effort regarding what criteria are important before surgery."

The experimental solution was 0.2 percent aqueous chelorhexidine, and 0.1 percent quinine solution was used as the control. Prior to the commencement of the trial, plaque accumulation at the sites to be tested was recorded using the Plaque Index. Gingival condition was recorded using the Gingival Index. The surfaces were carefully scaled and cleaned to reduce the Plaque Index to 0. Subjects cleaned the selected tooth surfaces on a day using the interdental brush with the appropriate solution. After 28 days, the Plaque and Gingival Indices were recorded again. Normal oral hygiene was resumed during the rest period. The second trial followed the same format as the first, but with each subject using the alternative solution. Results were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for matched pairs. 1. The mean Plaque and Gingival Index scores were reduced over the 28-day trial period for both experimental and control groups. 2. Although the Plaque Index scores were slightly lower after treatment with chlorhexidine when compared with the control, the difference was not statistically significant. 3. The reduction in Gingival Index was significantly greater for the chlorhexidine group than for the control group. The results indicated that 0.2 percent aqueous chlorhexidine, applied with an interdental brush to tooth surfaces adjacent to edentulous spaces, produced a significantly greater improvement in gingival health than the interdental brush with a placebo quinine solution, but the reductions in plaque accumulation were similar with the two solutions."

            "abstract": "The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine the effect of the administration of sublingual triazolam on the success of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) block in patients experiencing irreversible pulpitis. Fifty-eight emergency patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received, in a double-blind manner, an identical sublingual tablet of either 0.25 mg of triazolam or a placebo 30 minutes before administration of a conventional IAN block. Access was begun 15 minutes after completion of the IAN block, and all patients had profound lip numbness. Success was defined as no or mild pain (visual analog scale recordings) on access or initial instrumentation. The success rate for the IAN block was 43% with triazolam and 57% with the placebo, with no significant difference (P = .43) between the 2 groups. For mandibular posterior teeth, triazolam in a sublingual dose of 0.25 mg did not result in an increase in success of the IAN block in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Therefore, when using conscious sedation, profound local anesthesia is still required to eliminate the sensation of pain during endodontic treatment for patients with irreversible pulpitis."

This study was performed to test (using a randomized controlled trial design) the hypothesis that young children's OHRQoL improves after oral rehabilitation under general anaesthesia (GA). A further aim of this study was to explore whether dental fear also changes. One-hundred and four children (54 boys; mean age 4.08 yr, standard deviation = 1.09), who had been referred to a specialized clinic in paediatric dentistry, were randomly assigned, based on a Solomon four-group design, to two treatment (GA) and two control conditions. The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) and the Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) were used to assess OHRQoL and dental fear, respectively, before and after the rehabilitation procedures. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance revealed that the total ECOHIS score after GA was more positive in the GA group than in the control group. There was no effect found of the pre-test and there was also no interaction between the pre-test and treatment. In the total CFSS-DS scores no effects were found. The results of this study showed that the child's OHRQoL improved after treatment under GA. Furthermore, children need guidance in reducing dental fear after treatment under GA."

At the conclusion of the pretreatment phase, the dogs were divided into 4 groups for the application of the test agents and were placed on a plaque promoting diet of Purina Dog Chow softened with water. Test agents included 100 micrograms/ml nisin and 300 micrograms/ml nisin formulated in a vehicle containing 1 mM NaEDTA; negative control comprised of exactly the same formulation but omitting nisin; and 0.12% chlorhexidine as Peridex. Throughout the treatment period, formulations were applied 2x daily to premolar teeth in each quadrant for 1 min using a Monojet syringe. The development of plaque and gingivitis was monitored at 15, 27, 39, 53, 74 and 88 days during the treatment phase using standard measurements of gingival index, plaque index, stain index and bleeding to probing. Throughout the treatment phase, plaque accumulation increased in all groups, but the rate of plaque build-up was less in groups treated with either nisin or chlorhexidine formulations compared with the placebo treated group. The gingival index of dogs in all groups increased throughout the study period. However, from day 27 onward, the groups receiving nisin had lower gingival index scores than did the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Immediately after the operation, pain scores were reduced to a similar extent in all groups, most likely due to the local anesthetic effect. Thereafter, pain scores and supplemental consumption of diclofenac were significantly lower in patients receiving 1 mg morphine into inflamed submucous tissue than in the control group for up to 24 h. Patients receiving 1 mg morphine into non-inflamed tissue or perineurally did not show any further reduction in pain scores compared to each control group. Our results show in patients undergoing dental surgery that injection of 1 mg of morphine into inflamed tissue results in significant and prolonged postoperative analgesia, whereas administration into non-inflamed tissue or perineurally is not effective. Thus, consistent with experimental studies, the requirement of an inflammatory process for the occurrence of peripheral opioid effects is also found in the clinical setting."

Twenty subjects had two contralateral teeth randomly assigned to receive SRP (SRP group) or SRP + a single episode of aPDT (SRP + aPDT group), with a diode laser and a phenothiazine photosensitizer. Plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession were recorded, and gingival crevicular fluid was collected for assay of IL-1β and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 levels. There was a significant PD reduction (SRP 1.81 ± 0.52 mm/SRP + aPDT 1.58 ± 1.28 mm; p < 0.001) and a significant CAL gain (SRP 1.60 ± 0.92 mm/SRP + aPDT 1.41 ± 1.58 mm; p < 0.001) for both groups. Significant differences were not observed in between-group comparisons. IL-1β level in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in SRP group after 1 week (SRP 24.65 ± 18.85 pg/μL/SRP + aPDT 34.07 ± 24.81 pg/μL; p = 0.048), and MMP-8 level was higher in SRP group after 12 weeks (SRP 303.31 ± 331.62 pg/μL/SRP + aPDT 534.23 ± 647.37 pg/μL; p = 0.024). There were no statistically significant differences in intragroup comparisons. The adjunctive effect of aPDT did not warrant improvements on clinical parameters in smokers.

In this randomized controlled trial, 70 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 35). Each patient in the control group received only a standard IANB injection of 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The injection was administered within 1 minute, using a standard aspirating dental cartridge fitted with a 27-gauge dental needle. In the intervention group, 15 minutes after injection of the standard IANB as described for the control group, each patient received a standard MINB injection of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine containing 1:100,000 epinephrine, administered by an operator not involved in assessing the outcomes. After the MINB injection, the patient applied firm finger pressure to the soft tissue of the mental foramen region for 1 minute using the hand on the side opposite to the injection. Objective assessment of tooth anesthesia was carried out with electric pulp tests (EPTs). In addition, the patients rated their pain during the initial steps of endodontic treatment based on a visual analog scale (VAS). The Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used for the analysis of data. Of the 35 patients in each group, 20.0% (7 patients) in the control group and 71.4% (25 patients) in the intervention group had no response to EPTs 15 minutes after injections; this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The VAS pain scores were significantly higher in the control group than in the intervention group (P = 0.001). The administration of MINB with pressure following IANB significantly improved the success of anesthesia in mandibular first molars with asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis."

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of increased probing depths. In general, in untreated and treated patients, when deep and shallow probing depths are compared, the data indicate that deep sites are associated with increased bleeding upon probing, elevated subgingival temperatures, higher levels of pathogens, more probing errors, a greater amount of infiltrated connective tissue, reduced ability to remove subgingival deposits with root planing, and diminished effectiveness of oral hygiene to alter the subgingival microbiota. Clinical trials demonstrate that probing depth is not a good predictor of future disease progression. However, deep sites are at greater risk of disease progression than shallow sites in untreated and treated patients. Furthermore, the deeper the probing depth, the greater the risk of future disease progression. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that it is advantageous, but not always necessary, for patients to have shallow probing depths. With regards to surgical reduction of probing depths beyond that attained with non-surgical therapy, clinicians need to consider the advantages (e.g., ease of maintenance, reduced risk of disease progression) and disadvantages (e.g., root sensitivity, cosmetic defects) of treatment procedures. Since numerous variables require consideration (e.g., response to root planing, goals of therapy, acceptable level of risk for future disease progression), treatment decisions will vary depending on the patient and the desired clinical outcome at specific sites."

Secondary aims were to test changes in satisfaction between and within the groups from baseline to 5 y and differences between the groups in implant survival and prosthodontic maintenance over 5 y. Each of the 86 participants (mean age, 67 y) was randomly allocated to receive either 1 implant in the midline (group 1) or 2 implants in the canine areas (group 2) attached to a mandibular overdenture opposing a maxillary complete denture. Satisfaction was self-assessed by participants on a visual analog scale at baseline prior to implants, as well as at 2 mo and 1, 3, and 5 y with implant overdentures, whereas implant survival and prosthodontic maintenance were assessed by clinical examination. After 5 y, 29 participants in group 1 and 33 in group 2 were available, with most dropouts due to death. Satisfaction with the implant denture after 5 y was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than at baseline in both groups and remained with no significant difference (P = 0.32) between the groups. No implants failed in group 1 but 5 failed before loading in 4 participants in group 2. Most participants required maintenance or occasionally denture replacement, and although differences between the groups were not statistically significant, group 1 experienced almost twice as many fractured dentures usually adjacent to the implant attachment. We conclude that there were no significant differences after 5 y in satisfaction or survival of implants with mandibular overdentures retained by 1 implant or 2 implants. Additional research is required to confirm long-term treatment effectiveness of single-implant dentures and the implications of prosthetic maintenance with implant overdentures (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02117856)."

Databases were searched manually and electronically up to and including May 2021 using different medical subject subheadings. Data screening and extraction were performed. The risk of bias within randomized controlled trials was assessed using the revised Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (RoB 2). The Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used for non-randomized controlled trials. Disagreements related to literature search and RoB evaluations were resolved via discussion. Six clinical studies were included. Four studies showed that Listerine® is effective in controlling gingivitis in patients undergoing fixed OT. One study reported that the use of 5% Fructus mume mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction in gingival bleeding. Two mouthwashes that contained 1% Matricaria chamomilla L. and 0.5% Zingiber officinale were also found to be efficient in controlling gingival bleeding. Four, one and one studies had a low, moderate and high RoB, respectively. In conclusion, EO-based mouthwashes seem to be effective for the management of gingivitis among patients undergoing fixed OT.

            "abstract": "It is most important that the proper design of a clinical trial be developed prior to the start of the study. Such a design is one that will not tend to find a treatment to be effective when it really is ineffective, and will not tend to miss a good treatment when it really is effective. The questions to be answered by a clinical trial must be decided in advance and will help determine the design. Trials should take into consideration how the agent is to be used: carefully controlled, ordinary use, subject or professionally applied, etc. The double-blind parallel randomized trial is preferred to the double blind cross-over design, except possibly for a professionally applied treatment which does not leach into the saliva or affect the oral microflora. Blocking or stratification tends to increase the efficiency of a clinical trial, and also may produce more information on the agent's effectiveness. Stratification is preferred to blocking, particularly when subjects enter the trial serially over time. Subjects should be stratified by age, sex and baseline level of plaque or gingivitis. Stratification permits a check on whether the effect of treatment is atypically strong or weak for certain types of patients. Where possible, the same examiner should examine the same patients throughout the study. Examiners should be self-calibrated to reduce intra-examiner error. Plaque and gingivitis trials should be at least of 6 months duration and may be preventive or therapeutic in nature. The preferred statistical analysis when 2 treatments are being compared is a comparison of mean changes in plaque or gingivitis scores by the independent sample t-test. An analysis of covariance using the baseline scores as the covariate may improve power somewhat. When pairwise t-tests are performed in comparing several treatments, multiple comparison criteria are indicated. Parametric rather than nonparametric tests are preferred since they usually have more power. The square root of whole mouth means in gingivitis clinical trials is the preferred transformation to obtain greater power and to produce approximately normal distributions."

            "abstract": "This randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficiency of maxillary infiltration anesthesia in carious teeth at two different injection sites and their impact on the laser Doppler recordings of pulpal blood flow (PBF) during a caries excavation procedure. The null hypothesis tested was that there are no differences in the efficiency of anesthesia and PBF reduction between maxillary infiltrations at the two injection sites. One hundred twenty patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of carious lesion of their maxillary left central incisors (moderate caries, deep caries, or no caries). Forty patients in each group randomly received infiltrations over the root apex of maxillary left central incisors (site X) or over the midpoint of the line connecting the root apexes of both maxillary left central and lateral incisors (site Y) using 0.9 mL 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline. Teeth were pulp tested at five-minute intervals after injection except for the period of cavity cutting, which was done 12 minutes after injection. The PBF changes after injection were monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry. The observation period in this study was 60 minutes. Success of anesthesia was defined as no or mild pain on cavity cutting by visual analog scale recordings. Deep caries group showed significantly higher baseline PBF ( p<0.05). All groups showed 100% success of anesthesia and similar duration time ( p>0.05). Subgroups that had the injection at site Y showed significantly less reduction of PBF ( p<0.05). Cavity-cutting procedures increased the amplitude of the PBF around the lowest value after injection. Independent of the cavity depth, carious anterior teeth anesthetized by infiltration further from the apex had significantly less reduction on the pulpal blood flow compared with teeth anesthetized by infiltration at the apex."

            "abstract": "Extraction of impacted mandibular third molars is one of the most common procedures in the oral cavity and often is followed by pain, swelling, and postextraction alveolitis and trismus. It has been suggested that postoperative discomfort is in relation to the type of surgical wound healing. The aim of this study was to compare pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening in two groups of patients with primary and secondary wound healing after impacted mandibular third molar surgery. Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into two equal groups, quantitatively and by gender. After the surgical procedures, 16 patients received primary wound closure, while the other 16 participants received secondary wound closure. A visual analog scale was used to collect pain data three days after the surgeries. A checklist was used to record data regarding swelling size and maximum mouth opening before, immediately following, three days after, and one week after surgery. Frequency tests and a t-test were used for statistical analysis and a P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Patients in the secondary wound healing group showed statistically significant lower discomfort regarding pain, swelling size, and maximal mouth opening compared to the primary wound healing group. The authors suggest the use of secondary wound healing closure to reduce postoperative complications such as pain, maximal mouth opening, and swelling size after impacted mandibular third molar extractions."

            "abstract": "Patients with nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia (GH) often require continued calcium channel blocker therapy. Switches to diltiazem and verapamil have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on nifedipine-induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine-induced GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). Intraoral photographs, study models, and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an equivalent dose of isradipine in a single-blind fashion. Biweekly periodontal parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (P < 0.05). No other measured parameter (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (P < 0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from baseline to week 12 (P < 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine-induced GH, switching hypertensive therapy to isradipine may result in a regression of GH. When coupled with aggressive oral hygiene treatment, this drug may provide a reasonable option for patients requiring dihydropyridine treatment."

Assessments were made on reduction in plaque (Pl), gingivitis (GI), pocket depth and gingival bleeding as measures of treatment benefit. All subjects had Class II, III or IV periodontal conditions. Following baseline examinations, subjects received a gross supragingival scaling and polishing. Subjects were separated by sex and periodontal classification, arrayed by GI scores, and randomly assigned to either the chlorhexidine rinse or a placebo rinse. Subjects were instructed to rinse with 1/2 ounce of their assigned products for 30 seconds twice daily. Following two weeks of product use, the clinical examinations were repeated and two randomly selected, opposing contralateral quadrants were scaled and root planed. After two more weeks of product use (week 4), clinical examinations were repeated and the remaining quadrants were scaled and root planed. At week 6, final clinical examinations were conducted. Since half-mouths were treated at different times and exposed to the treatment rinses for different periods, the data were analyzed for the half-mouths independently 2 and 4 weeks after gross scaling, and 2 and 4 weeks after root planing. A total of 94 subjects (47 in each treatment group) completed all phases of the trial. Gingival healing following scaling and root planing in subjects using a chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%) was significantly better than subjects using the placebo rinse as evidenced by less gingivitis (29%), fewer GI bleeding sites (48%) and less plaque (54%)."

            "abstract": "Cone beam CT (CBCT) for dentomaxillofacial paediatric assessment has been widely used despite the uncertainties of the risks of the low-dose radiation exposures. The aim of this work was to investigate the clinical performance of different CBCT acquisition protocols towards the optimization of paediatric exposures. Custom-made anthropomorphic phantoms were scanned using a CBCT unit in six protocols. CT slices were blinded, randomized and presented to three observers, who scored the image quality using a 4-point scale along with their level of confidence. Sharpness level was also measured using a test object containing an air/PMMA e,dge. The effective dose was calculated by means of a customized Monte Carlo (MC) framework using previously validated paediatric voxels models. The results have shown that the protocols set with smaller voxel size (180 µm), even when decreasing exposure parameters (kVp and mAs), showed high image quality scores and increased sharpness. The MC analysis showed a gradual decrease in effective dose when exposures parameters were reduced, with an emphasis on an average reduction of 45% for the protocol that combined 70 kVp, 16 mAs and 180 µm voxel size. In contrast, both \"ultra-low dose\" protocols that combined a larger voxel size (400 µm) with lower mAs (7.4 mAs) demonstrated the lowest scores with high levels of confidence unsuitable for an anatomical approach. In conclusion, a significant decrease in the effective dose can be achieved while maintaining the image quality required for paediatric CBCT."

During the 6 week study period, 7 of the 9 cats in the treatment group (77.8 %) showed a > 40 % improvement in SDAI score, while 1 of 7 cats in placebo group (14.3 %) showed a > 40 % improvement in SDAI score. This difference was statistically significant. Individual variability in the absorption of orally-administered cyclosporine was high. Trough whole-blood cyclosporine levels ranged firm 32.1 ng/ml to 1,576.2 ng/ml. At the end of the 6 week observation period, there was a statistically significant diference among cats with trough whole-blood cyclosporine levels >300 ng/ml (72.3 % improvement) compared with cats with cyclosporine levels < 300 ng/ml (28.2 % improvement). Whole-blood cyclosporine levels > 300 ng/ml were associated with significant improvement in oral inflammation in cats with chronic stomatitis that had previously undergone premolar-molar or fuill-mouth extraction."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and sodium fluoride (NaF) are widely used for caries management. The objectives of this study are (i) to compare the caries-arresting and caries-preventive effects of SDF and NaF in young children, (ii) to determine children's and parents' acceptance of these fluoride therapies and (iii) to investigate the short-term (1 day) and long-term (1 year) adverse effects of these fluoride therapies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial to be conducted in Hong Kong kindergartens. The study has received approval from the local institutional review board. Written consent will be obtained from the parents/guardians before the study. The study will recruit at least 688 healthy 3-year-old children. This sample size is sufficient for an appropriate statistical analysis. Stratified randomisation will be performed for intervention allocation. The two intervention groups are 38% SDF and 5% NaF varnish applied on six primary upper anterior teeth. At baseline, one trained examiner will perform clinical examinations of the children in the kindergartens. The caries experience and oral hygiene status of each child will be recorded using the decayed, missing (due to caries) and filled primary tooth index and visual plaque index, respectively. Then, an independent operator will apply the assigned fluoride after the dental examinations. The examiner, the children and their parents will be blinded to the intervention allocation. In addition, a research assistant will evaluate the child's acceptance using interval rating scales for children's uncooperative behaviour. The examiner will then visit the children the next day to study the short-term potential adverse effects of the fluoride therapies. The same examiner will perform a follow-up examination after 1 year to evaluate the children's caries experiences, their oral hygiene statuses and the adverse effects of the fluoride. Parental questionnaires will be used to assess parental satisfaction and concerns about the fluoride therapies.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study provides essential information about using SDF in an outreach kindergarten service for caries management from different aspects, which include the caries-arresting and caries-preventive effects, the adverse effects and children's and parents' acceptance.

Several studies have shown that NitrAdine (bonyf) induces a significant reduction of dental biofilm. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that 10-day use of PerioTabs (bonyf), a NitrAdine-based gingiva brushing solution, is effective in treating gingival inflammation of prosthodontic patients. Method and materials: Forty-nine subjects were instructed to brush their teeth, gingiva﻿e, and prostheses with the PerioTabs solution for 10 days (treatment group) and 49 with any toothpaste (control group). The initial and 11-day Plaque Index and Bleeding Index were recorded. A five-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the level of patient satisfaction. The Shapiro-Wilk statistical test was used to compare the results for the two groups. Results: Highly significant differences between the treatment and control group (P < .001) for the Plaque Index and Bleeding Index resulted. The treatment group patients' satisfaction was high: 31 (63.3%) reported the highest level, 5, on the Likert scale, and 18 (36.7%) declared they were satisfied (level 4). Conclusions: The use of a NitrAdine-based gingiva brushing solution (PerioTabs) was effective in reducing the gingival inflammation in periodontally affected patients treated with fixed partial dentures. Clinical relevance: The NitrAdine-based gingiva brushing solution (PerioTabs) was highly accepted by the patients and seems to be a promising alternative to the solutions widely used."

            "abstract": "The bovine derived polypeptide, aprotinin, inhibits the activation of certain chemical mediators of acute inflammation. These mediators are responsible for causing pain and swelling in traumatised tissue. The properties of aprotinin were assessed in patients requiring surgical removal of third molars, a procedure which often results in considerable postoperative pain and swelling. A double blind clinical trial compared the effects of local infiltration of 1 ml of saline on one side of the mouth and aprotinin (10,000 international units) on the other, in patients requiring extraction of both mandibular third molars. Pain scores were assessed with a visual analogue scale, and swelling was subjectively assessed. The results, when analysed statistically, showed that aprotinin significantly reduced postoperative pain and swelling on the side of the mouth on which it was used, as compared to the control side (0.01% significance)."

While a considerable volume of literature attributes several beneficial properties and glorifies the role of dentifrice, a small body of researchers questions its efficacy.

Visual analog scale pain scores obtained immediately after surgical extraction were primarily evaluated for the 2 groups receiving different epinephrine concentrations. Visual analog scale pain scores were obtained 2, 4, and 6 hours after administering an anesthetic.

Pain was evaluated on a visual analogue scale. Patients given naloxone reported significantly greater pain than those given placebo. Patients given placebo as their first drug was either placebo responders, whose pain was reduced or unchanged, or nonresponders whose pain increased. Naloxone given as a second drug produced no additional increase in pain levels in nonresponders but did increase pain levels of placebo responders. Nonresponders had a final mean pain rating identical to that of responders who received naloxone as their second drug. Thus the enhancement of reported pain produced by naloxone can be entirely accounted for by its effect on placebo responders.

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To compare the efficacy of caries removal, time taken and to evaluate the pain threshold experienced by the patient during various caries removal methods.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Eighty patients between the age groups of 5-9 years were selected and caries removal was done by hand instruments, airotor, carisolv and papacarie. The efficacy, time taken and the pain threshold was evaluated during the caries removal by Ericson D et al scale, visual analogue scale respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Highly significant relation (< 0.05) was observed when intergroup comparison was made using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      It was concluded that chemomechanical removal of caries with Papacarie and Carisolv were found to be effective measures of caries removal and could be considered as viable alternatives to painful procedures like Airotor in management of dental caries especially in children."
