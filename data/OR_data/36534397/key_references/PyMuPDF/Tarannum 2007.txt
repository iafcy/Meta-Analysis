Effect of Periodontal Therapy on
Pregnancy Outcome in Women
Affected by Periodontitis
Fouzia Tarannum* and Mohamed Faizuddin*
Background: There is convincing evidence to suggest that infections
affecting the mother during pregnancy may produce alterations in the
normal cytokine- and hormone-regulated gestation, which could result
in preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth
(PTB). Studies in the late 1990s associated periodontitis with preterm
low birth weight (PLBW) deliveries, and this may have similar patho-
genic mechanisms as other maternal infections. This study determined
the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on pregnancy outcome.
Methods: A total of 200 pregnant women with periodontitis were ran-
domly assigned to treatment and control groups. Detailed data about
previous and current pregnancies were obtained. All women received
a full-mouth periodontal examination, including oral hygiene index-
simpliﬁed, bleeding index, and clinical attachment level. The women
in the treatment group received non-surgical periodontal therapy dur-
ing the gestational period, and those in the control group received peri-
odontal treatment after delivery. Periodontal therapy included plaque
control instructions and scaling and root planing performed under local
anesthesia. The outcome measures assessed were gestational age and
birth weight of the infant. PTB was recorded when delivery occurred at
<37 weeks of gestation, and low birth weight (LBW) was recorded when
the infant weighed <2,500 g.
Results: There were 53 PTBs in the treatment group and 68 PTBs in
the control group. Twenty-six LBW infants were recorded in the treat-
ment group, and 48 LBW infants were noted in the control group. The
mean gestational ages were 33.8 – 2.8 weeks and 32.7 – 2.8 weeks
in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The difference was
statistically signiﬁcant at P <0.006. The mean birth weight was
2,565.3 – 331.2 g in the treatment group and 2,459.6 – 380.7 g in
the control group, with the difference being statistically signiﬁcant at
P <0.044. A multiple regression model showed a signiﬁcant effect of
periodontal treatment on birth outcomes.
Conclusions: Non-surgical periodontal therapy can reduce the risk
for preterm births in mothers who are affected by periodontitis. Addi-
tional multicentered, randomized, controlled clinical trials are required
to conﬁrm this link between periodontitis and PLBW. J Periodontol

KEY WORDS
Low birth weight; periodontitis; preterm; randomized controlled
clinical trial.
P
reterm birth (PTB) is a
major medical, social, and
economic
problem
that
accounts for a large proportion
of maternal, and especially neo-
natal,
mortality
and
acute
morbidity.1,2 Preterm low birth
weight (PLBW) infants have a
tremendous impact on the health
care systems and affected fam-
ilies in developed and develop-
ing countries. Thus, there is a
continuous search for risk fac-
tors for PLBW deliveries that
are amenable to prevention.
Various factors have been as-
sociated with the delivery of pre-
term and/or low birth weight
(LBW) infants. Maternal risk fac-
tors include age, height, weight,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
smoking, alcohol consumption,
nutritional status, and stress.3,4
In addition, parity, birth interval,
previous complications, pre- and
antenatal care, maternal hyper-
tension, infections, and cervical
incompetence also may be im-
portant.5,6
In recent years, infection has
received attention as a risk fac-
tor for preterm deliveries. PLBW
may be an indirect result of in-
fection as a consequence of the
production of increased level of
inﬂammatory mediators, which
shorten gestational age. The

hypothesis that infection remote from the fetal–
placental unit may inﬂuence PLBW has led to an in-
creased awareness of the potential role of chronic
bacterial infections elsewhere in the body.7-9
Periodontitis is an infectious disease caused by pre-
dominantly Gram-negative anaerobic and microaero-
philic bacteria that colonize the subgingival area. This
results in long-term local elevation of proinﬂamma-
tory mediators such as prostaglandins, interleukin-
1b and -6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This local
elevation can inﬂuence the systemic levels of some of
these mediators.10,11 The above facts suggest that
periodontitis has the potential to inﬂuence PLBW
through an indirect mechanism, involving inﬂam-
matory mediators, or a direct bacterial assault on the
amnion.
Offenbacher et al.12 suggested that maternal peri-
odontal disease could lead to PLBW infants. It has
been observed in animal models that infection with
Gram-negative periodontitis-associated microorgan-
isms may adversely affect pregnancy outcomes.
Collins et al.13 reported a 25% reduction in birth
weight in pregnant hamsters challenged subcutane-
ously in the dorsal region with the periodontal patho-
gen Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to normal,
healthy, pregnant hamsters.
Results of a case-control study and a concurrent
cohort study showed that periodontitis may be an in-
dependent risk factor for PTB and LBW after adjusting
for several known risk factors.14,15
In a randomized controlled trial, Lopez et al.16 sug-
gested that non-surgical periodontal therapy signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the rate of PLBW in women with
periodontitis. In light of the ﬁndings cited above, the
present study was designed to assess the relationship
between periodontal disease and PLBW and to evalu-
ate the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on
pregnancy outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed
on 200 pregnant women with periodontitis selected
from outpatients at the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Medical College
and Hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The sub-
jects were enrolled in the study from August 2004
to August 2005. After obtaining institutional approval
and consent of the subjects, they were assigned ran-
domly to treatment and control groups. Ethical clear-
ance was obtained from the ethical committee for
periodontal intervention.
Inclusion criteria were: healthy pregnant women
aged 18 to 35 years; single gestation between 9 and
21 weeks; subjects with ‡20 completely erupted teeth,
excluding the third molars; and subjects with ‡2 mm
attachment loss at ‡50% of examined sites.
Exclusion criteria were: current use of tobacco
(smoking/smokeless) or alcohol; history of congeni-
tal heart disease; current use of corticosteroids; diabe-
tes, asthma, glomerulonephritis, or hyperthyroidism;
mothers with twin pregnancy and Rh factor isoim-
munity; current antibiotic treatment; and clinically
evident systemic infection.
Obstetric and Maternal Data
Demographic factors such as age, marital status, and
educational level as well as detailed data about previ-
ous and current pregnancies were obtained from the
subjects’ medical records and from interviews during
prenatal visits. The information regarding pregnancy
history included number carried to full term, number
of previous preterm deliveries, number of LBW deliv-
eries, number of previous pregnancies aborted, and
number of live births. Maternal age at the time of entry
into the study, onset of prenatal care, number of pre-
natal visits, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death,
gestational age, and birth weight were recorded.
Prenatal care included blood pressure measure-
ments,routineurineandbloodinvestigations,recording
of maternal weight, and physical and pelvic examina-
tions. Blood investigations for hepatitis B, HIV, and
hematocrit were done. All women underwent ultraso-
nographic examination between 9 and 32 weeks for
gestational age determination and to rule out congen-
ital anomalies. Prenatal care was assessed as ade-
quate or inadequate; fewer than six prenatal visits
were considered inadequate. Mothers with inadequate
prenatal care were excluded from the study.
Because all subjects included in the study were
housewives, the socioeconomic status was classiﬁed
according to the husband’s occupation3 as follows:
class I (professionals), class II (intermediate), class
III (skilled worker), class IV (partly skilled worker),
and class V (unskilled worker). Information about
alcohol consumption, tobacco use (smoking/non-
smoking), and pan chewing was obtained through
personal interview.
Prenatal Care
The women in our study had free access to a well-
designed prenatal care program, Reproductive and
Child Health and Safe (RCH), which is administered
by the government of India. Neonatal care is empha-
sized in the RCH program. The following are under-
taken in the program: immunization against tetanus,
anemia prophylaxis and oral therapy, antenatal
checkup at least three times during pregnancy, referral
of those with complications, care at birth – promotion
of clean delivery, and pregnancy planning.
Measurement of Periodontal Status
Information regarding oral hygiene practices was re-
corded. All women received a full-mouth periodontal

examination. Oral hygiene index-simpliﬁed (OHI-S)17
and bleeding index (BI)18 were recorded.Probingdepth
and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at
six sites per tooth with a manual probe (UNC-15 grad-
uated probe), using the cemento-enamel junction as a
reference point.
Periodontal Therapy
A total of 100 subjects were assigned randomly, by
the ﬂip of a coin, to the treatment group. Women in
the treatment group received non-surgical periodon-
tal therapy by the periodontist during the gestational
period, whereas those in the control group received
plaque-control (brushing) instructions only. The sub-
jects in the control group received periodontal therapy
after the delivery but had regular checkups at 4- to
5-week intervals. Periodontal therapy included pla-
que control instructions (rinsing twice daily with 0.2%
chlorhexidine until periodontal therapy was com-
pleted) and scaling and root planing performed under
local anesthesia. Full-mouth scaling and root planing
was performed by the periodontist over four to ﬁve
appointments, with a 1-week interval between each
appointment. Periodontal therapy was completed be-
fore 28 weeks of gestation, and maintenance therapy
was provided. Maintenance therapy, which included
oral prophylaxis and reinforcement of oral hygiene
instructions, was provided every 3 to 4 weeks until
delivery.
Assessment of Pregnancy Outcomes
Primary outcome measures recorded were PTB and
LBW. PTB was deﬁned as spontaneous delivery at
less than 37 completed weeks of gestation that fol-
lowed spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture
of membranes. LBW was recorded when the infant
weighed <2,500 g. Birth outcome that occurred after
37 weeks of gestation or the birth of an infant with a
weight ‡2,500 g was deﬁned as normal. Estimation
of gestational age was based on the last menstrual
period, ultrasound examinations, sequential physical
examinations, and postnatal examinations.
Statistical Methods
The chi-square test was used to evaluate the sig-
niﬁcance of differences in percentages. The Student
t test (two tailed) was used to ﬁnd the signiﬁcance
of periodontal characteristics between the study and
control groups and between LBW and normal birth
weight (NBW). Methods to determine the difference
between birth outcomes in the treatment and control
groups included the intention-to-treat analysis and
the protocol analysis. The intention-to-treat analysis
involved all of the subjects who were assigned ran-
domly to the treatment group, even if they did not un-
dergo the prescribed treatment. Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient was used to ﬁnd the association between
the periodontal characteristics (OHI and CAL) and
the birth outcomes. OHI and CAL follow the interval
scale, and BI does not follow the interval scale; hence,
the Spearman rank correlation was used for BI. The
difference between the correlation coefﬁcient of treat-
ment and the control group was evaluated using the
Fisher r-to-z transformation of the coefﬁcient. Multiple
linear regression was used to identify the signiﬁcance
of the linear relationship between birth outcomes and
the other variables.
RESULTS
Among the 100 subjects in the control group, nine
were excluded because they did not follow up and
two had spontaneous abortion. In the treatment group,
two subjects had spontaneous abortion and seven
were lost to follow-up. Eight subjects from the treat-
ment group refused to undergo intervention but were
followed up until their delivery. These eight subjects
were included in the treatment group as per intent-
to-treat analysis. Figure 1 shows the consort ﬂow
chart of the progress through the phases of the study.
The mean age of the women in the treatment group
was 23 – 3.3 years, and the mean age in the control
group was 22.9 – 3.6 years (Table 1). The socioeco-
nomic status of the individuals is shown in Table 2.
There were 42 (42%) primiparous individuals in the
treatment group and 41 (41%) primiparous individ-
uals in the control group. The number of previous
pregnancies varied from zero to four (Table 3). There
was no signiﬁcant difference in the distribution by age,
socioeconomic status, and number of previous preg-
nancies between the two groups.
Periodontal characteristics of the treatment and
control groups are shown in Table 4. Women in both
groups had mild to moderate periodontitis with a
mean CAL of 1.99 – 0.61 mm in the control group
and a mean CAL of 1.99 – 0.51 mm in the treatment
group; the difference was not signiﬁcant. Mean BI and
mean OHI-S did not differ signiﬁcantly between the
control and treatment groups.
The outcome measures were gestational age and
birth weight of the infant. The prevalence of PTB
and LBW is shown in Table 5 using the intention-to-
treat analysis and per-protocol analysis. Both analy-
ses showed that the prevalence of PTB and LBW
was higher in the control group. There were 53 PTBs
in the treatment group and 68 PTBs in the control
group. There were 26 cases of LBW in the treatment
group and 48 in the control group. The overall preva-
lence of PTB was 64.4% (53.5% in the treatment group
and 76.4% in the control group). The overall preva-
lence of LBW was 39.4% (26.3% in the treatment
group and 53.9% in the control group). The difference
between the treatment and control groups was statis-
tically signiﬁcant at P <0.001 for PTB and at P <0.002

for LBW. The mean gestational age and birth weight
for the treatment and control groups are shown in Ta-
ble 6 for intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol
analysis. Infants in the treatment group had a higher
mean gestational age and a higher mean birth weight.
Mean gestational age was 33.8 – 2.8 weeks in the
treatment group and 32.7 – 2.8 weeks in the control
group. The difference was statistically signiﬁcant at
P <0.006. Mean birth weight was 2,565.3 – 331.2 g
in the treatment group and 2,459.6 – 380.7 g in the
control group, with the difference being statistically
signiﬁcant at P <0.044.
The periodontal characteristics were compared in
the treatment and control groups in relation to the
birth weight of the infant (Table 7). OHI-S did not
vary signiﬁcantly between the LBW and NBW groups
among the controls, but showed a signiﬁcant differ-
ence (P <0.004) in the treatment group (LBW: 3.23 –
0.64; NBW: 2.56 – 0.55). BI did not vary signiﬁcantly,
as related to LBW and NBW, between the treatment
and control groups. CAL showed no signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the treatment group between subjects who de-
livered LBW infants (2.00 – 0.46 mm) and those who
delivered NBW infants (2.00 – 0.33 mm). In the con-
trol group, CAL was 2.09 – 0.531 mm among women
who delivered LBW infants and 1.67 – 0.28 mm
among those who delivered NBW infants.
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient was used to ﬁnd an
association between birth outcomes and periodontal
characteristics (OHI and CAL). OHI and CAL follow
the interval scale, and BI does not follow the interval
scale; hence, the Spearman rank correlation was used
for BI. The Fisher r-to-z transformation of coefﬁcient
was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the difference
for the correlation coefﬁcient for the treatment and

the control group; the difference in coefﬁcients be-
tween the treatment and control groups was sig-
niﬁcant (P <0.0169). An inverse correlation in the
control group suggested that higher CAL values were
associated with lower birth weights. Table 9 shows the
coefﬁcients for the correlation between gestational
age and periodontal characteristics and P value for
the Fisher test. There was an inverse correlation be-
tween gestational age and periodontal characteristics
in both groups, which suggested that shorter gesta-
tional ages were associated with higher values among
periodontal parameters. The difference in the correla-
tion coefﬁcients between the treatment and control
groups was signiﬁcant for the association between
CAL and gestational age (P <0.0114).
Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the
joint effects of the variables on the birth outcomes per
intention-to-treat analysis. Table 10 shows the P
values for multiple linear regression of the gestational
age in relation to other variables (age, OHI, BI, and
CAL) in the treatment and control groups. Table 11
shows multiple linear regression of the birth weight
in relation to other variables (age, OHI, BI, and CAL)
in the treatment and control groups. There was a signi-
ﬁcant linear relationship between birth outcomes and
OHI in the presence of other variables in the treatment
group. The linear relationship between CAL and birth
outcomes was signiﬁcant in the control group.
Table 12 shows a single multiple regression model
including both groups. This model included the two-
factor interaction terms for each main effect with
group. This provides a way to speciﬁcally test whether
the effect of each variable differs by group.
Multiple linear regression was carried out to assess
the treatment effect for gestational age. Two-factor

effect were included in the regression model. There
was a signiﬁcant treatment effect on gestational age
(P = 0.006), and the interaction of OHI and treat-
ment effect correlated inversely with the outcome
(P = 0.041). This indicated that OHI had a negative
inﬂuence on the gestational age, whereas BI and
CAL did not inﬂuence the gestational age signiﬁcantly
in the treatment group.
Multiple linear regression was carried out to assess
the treatment effect for birth weight. Two-factor inter-
action terms for OHI, BI, and CAL with treatment effect
were included in the regression model. There was a
signiﬁcant treatment effect on birth weight (P =
0.004), and the interaction of OHI and treatment
effect was related inversely to the outcome (P =
0.001). This indicated that OHI had a negative inﬂu-
ence on the birth weight, whereas BI and CAL did
not inﬂuence the birth weight signiﬁcantly in the treat-
ment group.
DISCUSSION
Maternal infections have been associated with preg-
nancy complications for many years.19 There is in-
creasing evidence to suggest that the presence of
periodontal infection may present a systemic chal-
lenge sufﬁcient to initiate the onset of premature labor
as a source of lipopolysaccharide and/or through
stimulation of inﬂammatory mediators such as pros-
taglandin E2 (PGE2).20 A randomized, controlled clin-
ical trial is the best method by which to establish a
cause-and-effect relationship between exposure and
disease. The present study was designed to determine
whether non-surgical periodontal therapy reduced the
risk for PLBW infants in women affected by periodon-
titis.
Subjects in our study were relatively homogenous
based on the social and demographic factors reported
as related to PLBW. The distribution of known risk
factors for PLBW was similar in the experimental
and control groups. Women aged 18 to 35 years were
selected because maternal age <18 years or >35 years
is a risk factor for PLBW. Subjects with only singleton
gestation were included because the relationship be-
tween multiple gestations and preterm labor is well es-
tablished.21 The study population was drawn from a
community pool belonging to the same socioeco-
nomic stratum; subjects had a similar education level
and similar oral hygiene practices and awareness. In
Indian women, the prevalence of smoking, one of
the known risk factors for PLBW,22 is low; however,
the use of tobacco as an ingredient in pan chewing
is common. The use of alcohol is not uncommon
among groups with a low socioeconomic status. Par-
ticular attention was paid to this aspect in the present
investigation, and subjects with a history of or current
use of tobacco (smoking and non-smoking) and alco-
hol were excluded from the study.
Convincing evidence has associated PTB with in-
fection, especially genitourinary tract infections, which
seem to be an important factor in the premature rup-
ture of membranes.6 Thus, to have control over this
important risk factor, subjects who developed symp-
toms of any systemic infection or who were on any
antibiotic administration during the pregnancy were
excluded from the study.
An increase in parity is associated with an increased
risk for PTB.23 In our study, there was no signiﬁcant
differenceinthedistributionofparitybetweenthe treat-
ment and control groups. Low maternal weight gain
and inadequate prenatal care are reported to be asso-
ciated weakly with PTB.24 Inadequate prenatal care
is cited often as a risk factor for poor pregnancy out-
comes among women with a low socioeconomic
status or those who are poorly educated. Several
studies5,24 showed that adequate prenatal care is
associated with improved birth weights and a lower
risk for PTB.
The women enrolled in the study had adequate pre-
natal care and adequate weight gain through their
pregnancy. Severe anemia is one of the known risk
factors for PTB.25 Subjects enrolled in the present
study were evaluated periodically for hematocrit, and
those with any signiﬁcant decrease in hemoglobin
levels were administered iron supplements.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the periodon-
tal characteristics between the treatment and control
groups at baseline. Non-surgical mechanical debride-
ment was provided to the subjects in the treatment
group. Periodontal treatment included plaque control
instructions and scaling and root planing. PTB caused
by periodontal disease may result from an increase in
systemic levels of inﬂammatory mediators. Studies26
showed that non-surgical periodontal therapy de-
creases the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines. There
is evidence that PGE2 levels also decrease in gingival
crevicular ﬂuid after scaling and root planing.27
The prevalence of PTB was 53.5% in the treatment
group and 76.4% in the control group. The prevalence
of LBW (<2,500 g) was 26.3% in the treatment group
and 53.9% in the control group. The lower prevalence
of preterm and LBW infants in the treatment group
could be attributed to periodontal intervention. The
results of our study are in agreement with those of a
study conducted by Mitchell-Lewis et al.,28 which in-
cluded 164 subjects, 74 of whom received periodontal
therapy during their pregnancy. They found that the
prevalence of PLBW was 13.5% in the treatment group
and 18.9% in the control group.
The prevalence of PLBW in the Indian population is
estimated to be around 40%, and about 76% of these
are PTBs.29 The prevalence of PLBW was higher in our

study, and this can be attributed to various factors.
The study population belonged to lower socioeco-
nomic strata and had lower literacy levels. Women
who reported physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
during pregnancy were more likely than non-abused
women to give birth to a baby with PLBW,30 and the
prevalence of abuse is higher in lower socioeconomic
groups.
Mean gestational age and birth weight were signiﬁ-
cantlyhigherinthetreatmentgroup(33.8–2.8weeks,
2,565.3 – 331.2 g) compared to the control group
(32.7 – 2.8 weeks, 2,459.6 – 380.7 g). A study by
Lopez16 also showed increases in gestational age
(34.4 – 2.4 weeks versus 33.6 – 4 weeks) and birth
weight (2,353 – 112 g versus 2,156 – 562 g) in the
treatment group compared to the control group.
Our study showed an inverse correlation between
gestational age and periodontal characteristics in
the treatment and control groups. The correlation co-
efﬁcient was signiﬁcantly higher in the treatment
group. There was a positive correlation between birth
weight and CAL in the treatment group, but the corre-
lation was inverse in the control group. This can be at-
tributed to the non-surgical therapy provided to the
subjects in the treatment group.
The relationship between birth weight and peri-
odontal characteristics also was analyzed. BI was not
signiﬁcantly different in the treatment and control
group between NBW and LBW groups. OHI-S was sig-
niﬁcantly different between LBW and NBW in the
treatment group but was not different in the control
group. However, CAL exhibited a signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the control group between NBW (1.67 –
0.28 mm) and LBW mothers (2.09 – 0.53 mm). The
results are in agreement with those from a study con-
ducted by Offenbacher et al.12 which showed that
CAL was signiﬁcantly worse in mothers of PLBW
(3.10 – 0.74) infants compared to mothers of NBW
(2.80 – 0.61 mm) infants.
The mechanism by which periodontitis causes
PLBW is still unclear. There is some evidence that
women with severe periodontitis during pregnancy
are more prone to experience a PTB, even after con-
sidering shared risk factors. Periodontitis and preterm
delivery have been associated with certain character-
istic polymorphisms in genes that code for cyto-
kines.31 One hypothesis is that persons with the
mutant or polymorphic genotypes produce more of
the inﬂammatory cytokines in the presence of inﬂam-
matory stimuli, such as the bacteria associated with
periodontitis and preterm labor. This suggests that
the enhanced host response may mediate and link
both conditions. The role of prostaglandins in human
labor has been well documented. Amniotic ﬂuid levels
of PGE2 increase steadily throughout pregnancy until
a critical threshold level is reached to induce labor.
There are studies regarding preterm delivery caused
by a premature increase in PGE2. It has been sug-
gested that periodontal infections, which serve as
a reservoir of inﬂammatory mediators, including
PGE2, may pose a threat to the fetal–placental unit.15
The limitations of our study include: 1) classiﬁca-
tion of socioeconomic status was based only on oc-
cupation; 2) the exclusion of subjects with systemic
infections was based on clinical presentation; hence,
subjects with subclinical infection must have been in-
cluded; and 3) subjects with a history of alcohol/to-
bacco use were excluded from the study. Hence, the
results of the study do not apply to the entire Indian
population.
Our study provides further evidence that non-surgi-
cal periodontal therapy can reduce the risk for PLBW
signiﬁcantly. From the results of this study, it seems
likely that periodontitis can inﬂuence pregnancy out-
comes adversely. Non-surgical periodontal therapy
aimed at reducing the microbial load, and thereby de-
creasing the inﬂammatory response, may help to re-
duce the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The
potential relationship between periodontitis and birth
outcomes, if proven to be causative, could be signiﬁ-
cant for public health improvement, given that peri-
odontitis affects a considerable proportion of the
general population and is preventable and treatable.
Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials are
required to conﬁrm this link between periodontitis
and PLBW and to determine whether non-surgical
periodontal therapy can reduce this risk.
