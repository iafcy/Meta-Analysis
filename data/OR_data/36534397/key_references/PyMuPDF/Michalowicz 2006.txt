Background
Maternal periodontal disease has been associated with an increased risk of preterm 
birth and low birth weight. We studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment 
on preterm birth.
Methods
We randomly assigned women between 13 and 17 weeks of gestation to undergo scal-
ing and root planing either before 21 weeks (413 patients in the treatment group) or 
after delivery (410 patients in the control group). Patients in the treatment group also 
underwent monthly tooth polishing and received instruction in oral hygiene. The ges-
tational age at the end of pregnancy was the prespecified primary outcome. Second-
ary outcomes were birth weight and the proportion of infants who were small for ges-
tational age.
Results
In the follow-up analysis, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) occurred in 49 
of 407 women (12.0%) in the treatment group (resulting in 44 live births) and in 52 
of 405 women (12.8%) in the control group (resulting in 38 live births). Although peri-
odontal treatment improved periodontitis measures (P<0.001), it did not significantly 
alter the risk of preterm delivery (P = 0.70; hazard ratio for treatment group vs. con-
trol group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.37). There were no signifi-
cant differences between the treatment and control groups in birth weight (3239 g 
vs. 3258 g, P = 0.64) or in the rate of delivery of infants that were small for gestational 
age (12.7% vs. 12.3%; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.58). There were 5 spontane-
ous abortions or stillbirths in the treatment group, as compared with 14 in the con-
trol group (P = 0.08).
Conclusions
Treatment of periodontitis in pregnant women improves periodontal disease and is 
safe but does not significantly alter rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, or fetal 
growth restriction. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00066131.)

A 
bout 11% of singleton births in the 
United States occur before 37 weeks of ges-
tation,1 and the rate of premature delivery 
has increased during the past 15 years. Preterm and 
low-birth-weight infants are at elevated risk for 
death, neurodevelopmental disabilities, cognitive 
impairment, and behavioral disorders.2-4 About 
half of mothers delivering preterm infants have no 
known risk factors.5 Recent studies suggest that 
periodontitis, an inflammatory disease caused pri-
marily by gram-negative bacteria that destroy tooth-
supporting connective tissue and bone, is associ-
ated with an increased risk of preterm birth, as well 
as low birth weight and preeclampsia.6-8
In rodents, subcutaneous inoculations with 
periodontal pathogens cause dose-dependent de-
creases in litter weight and elicit the production 
of cytokines and prostaglandins that signal pre-
term labor when present in amniotic fluid.9,10 
However, in humans, no causal link has been es-
tablished between periodontitis and prematurity 
or low birth weight, and several epidemiologic 
studies have found no association.11-13
Data from two single-center clinical trials sug-
gest that periodontal treatment during pregnancy 
may reduce the rate of preterm births,14,15 al-
though a recent study found no association be-
tween periodontal care during pregnancy and low 
birth weight.16 We designed the present trial to 
assess whether nonsurgical periodontal treatment 
in pregnant women reduces the risk of delivery 
before 37 weeks and results in a greater birth 
weight and a reduced proportion of infants who 
are small for gestational age.
Methods
The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) 
Study was a randomized, blinded, controlled trial 
of the effects of nonsurgical periodontal treatment 
during pregnancy on gestational age at birth and 
on birth weight. An independent data and safety 
monitoring board met semiannually to review the 
interim results. The institutional review board at 
each participating center approved the study; all 
participants provided written informed consent.
Study Population
We enrolled patients at Hennepin County Medical 
Center (MN), the University of Kentucky, the Uni­
versity of Mississippi Medical Center, and Harlem 
Hospital (NY). Potential participants were referred 
by health care providers. Pregnant women who 
were at least 16 years of age and who were at less 
than 16 weeks and 6 days of gestation underwent 
screenings for periodontal disease in obstetrics 
clinics. Unlike gingivitis, periodontitis cannot be 
assessed by visual examination alone; it is diag-
nosed with the use of a probe that is inserted into 
the gingival crevice between the teeth and gums. 
Clinical attachment loss (in millimeters) is a mea-
sure of the severity of destruction of tooth-support-
ing connective tissue and alveolar bone. Attach-
ment loss is typically accompanied by a deepening 
of the gingival crevice, the depth of which is termed 
probing depth. Women who had multiple probing 
depths of more than 4 mm and evidence of clini-
cal attachment loss were referred for baseline ex-
amination.
To be eligible for the trial, women had to have 
at least 20 natural teeth and the presence of peri-
odontal disease, which we defined as 4 or more 
teeth with a probing depth of at least 4 mm and 
a clinical attachment loss of at least 2 mm, as well 
as bleeding on probing at 35% or more of tooth 
sites. Women were ineligible if they had multiple 
fetuses, required antibiotic prophylaxis for peri-
odontal procedures, had a medical condition that 
precluded elective dental treatment, had extensive 
tooth decay, or were likely to have fewer than 20 
teeth after initial treatment.
Study Intervention
We randomly assigned participants to receive peri-
odontal treatment either before 21 weeks or after 
delivery. Randomization, stratified by center with 
the use of permuted randomized blocks of 2 and 
4, was made by a telephone call to the coordinat-
ing center.
Treatment consisted of periodontal scaling and 
root planing (i.e., removal of dental plaque and 
calculus from the tooth enamel and root) with the 
use of ultrasonic and hand instruments and local 
anesthesia as needed; up to four visits for treat-
ment were allowed. Treatment participants also 
received instruction in oral hygiene; they then had 
monthly tooth polishing and reinstruction in oral 
hygiene and underwent scaling and planing as 
needed until delivery. Control patients received 
only a brief oral examination at monthly follow-
ups but attended the same number of these visits 
as the treatment group. Patients in the control 
group were offered the same periodontal therapy 
after delivery as those in the treatment group re-

ceived. All patients received a $20 gift certificate 
and an infant’s toy after each visit.
Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was the gesta-
tional age at the end of pregnancy. Gestational age 
was determined at randomization on the basis of 
the last menstrual period or the results of ultra-
sonography, as described elsewhere.17 Secondary 
outcomes included birth weight, the proportion 
of infants who were small for gestational age, Ap-
gar scores, and admissions to a neonatal intensive 
care unit.
Clinical Assessments, Data Collection,  
and Safety Monitoring
Before the study began, periodontal examiners 
were trained by a single clinician (Dr. Michalo­wicz), 
and their techniques were standardized with the 
use of criteria described previously.18 The stan-
dardization of the techniques of the examiners 
was reassessed during the study with the use of 
the same criteria, and we assessed the reproduc-
ibility of the results among examiners by having 
the examiners remeasure selected teeth in 5% of 
the participants; the average agreement for prob-
ing depth and measures of attachment loss (with-
in 1 mm) was 98%.
At baseline, patients reported their pregnancy 
history and any medications they were taking. 
Examiners measured probing depth, clinical at-
tachment loss, and bleeding on probing at six sites 
on each tooth; they also evaluated dental plaque19 
and calculus20 on selected teeth. Bleeding on prob-
ing was scored as present or absent. Patients were 
referred to a dentist for treatment of teeth that 
were abscessed, fractured, or likely to become 
symptomatic during the study. Full-mouth peri-
odontal assessments were repeated at 21 to 24 
weeks of gestation and again at 29 to 32 weeks.
An obstetrical nurse abstracted data regarding 
delivery and postnatal status and risk factors for 
prematurity from medical records. Obstetrical ad-
verse events were identified by a review of medi-
cal records and reports from patients. Examiners 
and nurses were not aware of the study-group as-
signments.
Patients were monitored for oral adverse events 
and the progression of periodontitis, which was 
defined as any increase in clinical attachment loss 
of 3 mm or more.21 Treatment of progressive dis-
ease was not delayed until after delivery in either 
group unless treatment was contraindicated be-
cause of advanced gestational age (middle-to-late 
third trimester). All patients with progressive dis-
ease at fewer than six tooth sites received root 
planing at those sites. Patients with six or more 
affected sites were referred to a consulting perio-
dontist for treatment; affected patients in the con-
trol group received full-mouth scaling and root 
planing, whereas those in the treatment group 
could receive root planing, systemic antibiotics, 
and subgingival irrigation with antimicrobial so-
lutions. For patients with progressive disease, the 
last periodontal measures before rescue treatment 
were carried forward.
Statistical Analysis
We performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat 
basis unless stated otherwise. To emphasize differ-
ences in lower gestational ages, gestational ages 
were censored at 37 weeks.
Our primary analysis compared groups accord-
ing to gestational age at delivery with the use of 
the log-rank test stratified by center. To calculate 
power, we estimated the time-to-event distribution 
of the control group with the use of pilot data from 
two enrollment centers. To estimate the desired 
distribution of gestational ages of the treatment 
group, we added to the gestational-age distribution 
of the control group 5, 3, and 2 weeks for gesta-
tion of 20, 25, and 30 to 35 weeks, respectively, 
interpolating for intermediate gestational ages. We 
computed power by simulating data from these 
distributions. With a one-sided type I error of 0.05 
and allowing for a 30% loss to follow-up, calcu-
lations showed that 405 patients per group would 
be required to show statistical significance with 
a power of 90%. Adjusted analyses with the use of 
Cox regression added baseline risk factors, includ-
ing self-reported use of alcohol or drugs, race or 
ethnic group, maternal age, the time since a pre-
vious pregnancy (in months), and the occurrence 
of selected infections.
The study’s first seven birth outcomes were 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Consequently, 
with the monitoring board’s approval, we added 
a competing-risks analysis22 with two event types 
— live birth and spontaneous abortion or still-
birth. In the competing-risks analysis, we treat-
ed these first seven events as hypothesis gener-
ating and used only later events for hypothesis 
testing.
All periodontal measures were analyzed with

the use of linear mixed models, with the change 
from baseline to either the 2-month or 4-month 
follow-up visit as the dependent variable. Initial 
analyses accounted only for study design factors 
(the center, the treatment group, the follow-up 
visit, and interactions); adjusted analyses used de-
sign factors plus baseline risk factors.
We performed four semiannual interim anal-
yses for monitoring-board meetings with the use 
of the Lan–DeMets method and the O’Brien–Flem-
ing alpha-spending function.23 All reported P val-
ues are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple 
testing.
Results
We randomly assigned 823 patients to two groups 
— 413 to the treatment group and 410 to the con-
trol group — between March 2003 and June 2005 
(Fig. 1). Eleven patients in the treatment group and 
eight patients in the control group were errone-
ously assigned after 16 weeks and 6 days but were 
included in the analyses. Follow-up concluded in 
December 2005.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteris-
tics of the two groups. Of 531 patients who had 
a previous pregnancy ending with a live birth, 77 
(14.5%) had had a previous live preterm birth. On 
the basis of clinical periodontal measures, most 
patients were judged to have generalized early-to-
moderate periodontitis.
During their study pregnancy, 22% of patients 
were diagnosed with urinary tract infections, 12% 
with bacterial vaginosis, 6% with gestational dia-
betes, and 16% with group B streptococcal coloni-
zation. Thirteen percent reported the use of to-
bacco. The frequency of these findings did not 
differ significantly between groups.
Birth Outcomes
The gestational age at the end of pregnancy was 
available for 814 of 823 women (98.9%) (Fig. 1). 
Eleven patients in the treatment group and eight 
in the control group had labor induced before 37 
weeks because of hypertension, diabetes, or pre-
eclampsia and were included in the primary anal-
ysis. In the time-to-event analysis, the groups did 
not differ significantly in gestational age at the 
end of pregnancy, which was censored at 37 weeks 
(hazard ratio for women in the treatment group 
vs. those in the control group, 0.93; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.37; P = 0.70) (Fig. 2). Results 
did not change when women with spontaneous 
abortions were excluded or when indicated deliver-
ies before 37 weeks of gestation were treated as 
losses to follow-up at the time of induced delivery.

The groups did not differ significantly after adjust-
ment for baseline characteristics (hazard ratio, 
0.85; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.30; P = 0.45). The effects of 
treatment on preterm birth did not differ signifi-
cantly between centers (P = 0.30 for the interaction 
between groups according to center) or according 
to race or ethnic group (P = 0.76 for the compari-
son of black patients with those of all other races; 
P = 0.52 for the comparison of Hispanic patients 
with those of all other ethnic groups).
A total of 2 patients in the treatment group and 
4 in the control group had a spontaneous abortion 
(loss before 20 weeks); 3 patients in the treatment 
group and 10 in the control group had a stillbirth 
(loss from 20 weeks to 36 weeks and 6 days). Three

in the control group had either a spontaneous 
abortion or stillbirth after the decision was made 
to consider the events as separate study outcomes. 
In the competing-risks analysis, neither the risk of 
live preterm birth (P = 0.51) nor of spontaneous 
abortion or stillbirth (P = 0.08) differed signifi-
cantly between groups. When all spontaneous 
abortions or stillbirths (5 in the treatment group 
and 14 in the control group) were included in a 
competing-risks analysis, the P value was 0.04. The 
groups did not differ significantly in the rates of 
any secondary outcomes, including preeclampsia 
(Table 2).
Compliance and Clinical Periodontal 
Outcomes
Overall, 630 patients (77%) missed no more than 
one of the six follow-up study visits. Among par-
ticipants in the treatment group, 395 (96%) received 
periodontal treatment, which lasted an average of 
127 minutes. Periodontal treatment improved all 
clinical measures of disease (Table 2).
Adverse Events
Treatment and control groups had a similar num-
ber of serious medical adverse events, which in-
cluded hospitalization for more than 24 hours for 
labor pains, hospitalization for any other reason, 
a congenital anomaly in the infant, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death (37 patients 
[9.0%] in the treatment group and 41 [10%] in the 
control group, P = 0.64). Twenty-two events were 
hospitalizations in which the participant was dis-
charged without having delivered. Infants with 
congenital anomalies were born to 13 women in 
the treatment group and 7 women in the control 
group. No women died; the infants of one moth-
er in the treatment group and two in the control 
group died of complications from extreme prema-
turity.
A total of 3 patients in the treatment group 
and 6 in the control group had generalized clini-
cal attachment loss, and 48 patients in the treat-
ment group and 45 in the control group had lo-
calized clinical attachment loss after the baseline 
examination. Patients with generalized progres-
sion in periodontal disease were treated before 
delivery with the following therapies: one patient 
in the treatment group and two patients in the 
control group underwent full-mouth scaling and 
root planing, one patient in the control group un-
derwent root planing and received systemic anti-
biotics, and one patient in the treatment group 
received systemic antibiotics alone. Three other

patients were treated after delivery and one de-
clined treatment. Overall, only a small fraction of 
all tooth sites lost clinical attachment (0.17% in 
the treatment group and 0.28% in the control 
group, P = 0.17).
Additional Analyses of Birth Outcomes
We also conducted several post hoc analyses (Fig. 
3). Because it is possible that treatment may im-
prove the outcomes of pregnancy only in women 
with more severe disease, we performed analyses

that were limited to women with extensive gingi-
val bleeding (the highest one third or two thirds 
of patients in terms of the percentage of bleeding 
on probing at baseline) or periodontal pocketing 
(the highest third of patients in terms of the per-
centage of sites with a probing depth ≥4 mm). In 
these subgroups, the risk of preterm delivery did 
not differ significantly between the treatment and 
control groups (Fig. 3). Although preterm births 
were more frequent in our study than in earlier tri-
als of periodontal treatment,14,15 we also performed 
analyses that were limited to women with previous 
preterm births or with a previous preterm birth, 
spontaneous or induced abortion, or stillbirth, and 
found similar results (Fig. 3).
Noncompliance with study treatment may have 
diluted a treatment effect. Yet we found no sig-
nificant effect of periodontal treatment on the risk 
of preterm delivery at the two sites (Minnesota and 
Kentucky) with the highest compliance and the 
largest periodontal treatment effects or among the 
subgroup of patients who had four or more follow-
up visits (Fig. 3).
Another possibility is that the periodontal treat-
ment did not affect periodontitis sufficiently to 
affect birth outcomes. However, we also found no 
significant effects of treatment on preterm births 
in analyses comparing all patients in the control 
group with only the “best responders” to treat-
ment, as defined by the highest third of propor-
tional reduction in the percentage of bleeding on 
probing (i.e., a reduction of at least 40%; P = 0.59) 
(Fig. 3); the lowest residual percentage of bleeding 
on probing after treatment (35.7% or less, P = 0.26); 
or periodontal condition after treatment that did 
not meet the eligibility criteria of the study, which 
occurred among 178 women in the treatment 
group (P = 0.48).
Discussion
We found that scaling and root planing before 21 
weeks of gestation plus monthly tooth polishing 
thereafter did not significantly alter the risk of 
preterm delivery before 37 weeks, increase birth 
weight, improve Apgar scores, or reduce either the 
rate of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit 
or the proportion of infants who were small for 
gestational age. Treatment improved clinical mea-
sures of periodontal disease and was not associated 
with adverse medical events.
These results are inconsistent with reports of 
two previous randomized trials of periodontal 
treatment during pregnancy. Jeffcoat et al.14 ran-
domly assigned 366 pregnant women to one of 
three groups. One group underwent scaling and 
planing and received metronidazole, the second 
group underwent simple cleaning and received 
placebo, and the third group underwent scaling 
and planing and received placebo for 7 days. Pre-
term birth rates (before 35 weeks and before 37 
weeks of gestation) were lowest in the group that 
underwent root planing and received placebo but 
did not differ significantly among the groups.

periodontal treatment and preterm birth

Because no data were reported on the effective-
ness of periodontal treatment per se, we cannot 
compare the effect of such treatment in this study 
with that in ours.
In a study of Chilean women mostly from low 
socioeconomic strata,15 periodontal therapy sig-
nificantly reduced the rate of preterm birth (1.1% 
in the treated group vs. 6.4% in the control group, 
P = 0.02). Several differences between this study 
and ours deserve mention. Whereas the Chilean 
study included subjects of Spanish and Aborigi-
nal descent, we recruited a more diverse sample 
from four locations in the United States. The Chil-
ean group also had a greater average response to 
periodontal treatment than did patients in our 
study, a finding that could be associated with the 
use of chlorhexidine mouth rinses and systemic 
antibiotics (18% of patients received amoxicillin 
and metronidazole) in the Chilean study. Our 
study, by contrast, used neither agent, for the fol-
lowing reasons. Although chlorhexidine reduces 
gingival bleeding,24 its effect on periodontitis is 
slight,25 and it causes tooth staining that can un-
mask treatment. Systemic antibiotics, although 
useful adjuncts in severe periodontitis,26 may re-
solve nonoral infections and confound the effects 
of local periodontal therapy on the outcomes of 
pregnancy. Also, the study by Jeffcoat et al. sug-
gests that the use of systemic antibiotics after root 
planing does not significantly improve birth out-
comes. Finally, although antibiotics that are deliv-
ered into the periodontal pocket enhance the re-
sponse to root planing,27 all the products that are 
available in the United States are tetracycline de-
rivatives and are contraindicated during pregnancy. 
Nonetheless, our treatment response, in terms of 
mean reductions in the probing depth and attach-
ment loss, is consistent with improvements after 
scaling and root planing reported in persons who 
are not pregnant.28,29
It is possible that we delivered periodontal care 
too late in pregnancy to affect birth outcomes. 
The timing of our care, however, was consistent 
with that in the two previous randomized trials. 
Additional studies would be needed to determine 
whether the provision of periodontal treatment 
even earlier in pregnancy or before conception 
might improve birth outcomes.
One theory linking periodontitis to pregnancy 
outcomes posits that oral bacteria seed the pla-
centa, membranes, or amniotic fluid through 
blood-borne routes, eliciting an inflammatory cas-
cade that precipitates preterm labor.30 We did not 
assess bacteremia, but recent reports cast doubt 
on this theory. For example, although one report 
showed that periodontal disease was more prev-
alent in mothers who delivered preterm than in 
those who delivered full term,7 periodontal patho-
gens were detected in placentas of only 2 of 59 
mothers who delivered preterm and of only 3 of 
44 mothers delivering full term. Another study 
failed to detect periodontal bacteria in the amni-
otic fluid of women with periodontitis who de-
livered preterm, even though these microorgan-
isms were frequently found in dental plaque.31 
Moreover, the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum 
in dental plaque and vaginal-swab samples was not 
associated with the presence of the bacteria in 
amniotic fluid.32
Given the 95% CI of the hazard ratio for pre-
term delivery for patients in the treatment group, 
as compared with those in the control group (0.63 
to 1.37), we cannot rule out a modest increase or 
decrease in the risk of preterm delivery with peri-
odontal treatment. We observed a nonsignificant 
reduction in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth 
with periodontal treatment. Other reports have 
linked periodontal disease12,33 and other nonuter-
ine maternal infections34,35 with an increased risk 
of miscarriage. However, we view this finding with 
particular caution because only 19 patients in our 
study had either a spontaneous abortion or still-
birth and because we began evaluating rates of 
earlier pregnancy losses (using a competing-risks 
analysis) only after seven such events had occurred.
In summary, the treatment of periodontitis in 
pregnant women was safe and effective in im-
proving periodontal disease. However, it did not 
significantly alter the rates of preterm birth, low 
birth weight, fetal growth restriction, or pre-
eclampsia.
