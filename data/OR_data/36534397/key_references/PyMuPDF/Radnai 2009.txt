Abstract
There is growing evidence that chronic periodontitis 
may be a risk factor for pre-term birth. The goal of 
this intervention study was to determine the effect 
of periodontal treatment on the pregnancy outcome 
in women with threatening pre-term birth and initial 
localized chronic periodontitis. Forty-one women 
with a singleton pregnancy were enrolled in the 
study. For this treatment group, oral hygiene instruc-
tion and periodontal therapy were provided in the 
third trimester, while those in the control group (42 
persons) did not receive any periodontal treatment. 
In the treatment group, the mean weight of new-
borns was 3079.0 g, compared with the control 
group mean of 2602.4 g. The incidence of pre-term 
birth and low birthweight in the treatment group 
was significantly less than in the control group (p = 
0.015). Periodontal treatment completed before the 
35th week appeared to have a beneficial effect on 
birth weight and time of delivery.

Benefits of Periodontal Therapy 
When Preterm Birth Threatens
INTRODUCTION
T
he hypothesis that there is a possible connection between pre-term delivery 
and periodontal disease in pregnant women emerged in the early 1990s. 
However, there is still controversy as to whether there is a true correlation 
among periodontal infection, pre-term delivery, and restriction of fetal growth. 
Study designs have varied—some epidemiological (Offenbacher et al., 1996; 
Farrell et al., 2006), some microbiological (Madianos et al., 2001; Urbán 
et al., 2006), and others interventional (Jeffcoat et al., 2003; Sadatmansouri 
et al., 2006). A positive correlation between periodontitis and pre-term 
delivery (Dasanayake, 1998; Bosnjak et al., 2006; Radnai et al., 2006) was 
shown in a majority of these studies, although some epidemiological (Moore 
et al.,2004; Skuldbøl et al., 2006) and interventional (Mitchell-Lewis et al., 
2001; Michalowicz et al., 2006) studies showed no significant relationship 
between maternal periodontitis and pre-term delivery. Hence, conclusive evi-
dence appears to be lacking. An intervention study could provide further evidence 
of a possible causal effect of periodontitis on pre-term delivery. Thus, the aim of 
our investigation was to assess the potential beneficial effects of periodontal treat-
ment during pregnancy on the birthweight and the time of delivery.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of 83 systemically healthy Caucasian women who were 
hospitalized due to threatened pre-term delivery at the University of Szeged, Department 
of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The women were screened, and those with periodontal 
disease were randomized to either a periodontal treatment or a no-treatment protocol. 
After being informed of the aims and methods of the study, they agreed to participate. 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the protection of human 
study participants.
Women with any systemic medical problem, undergoing a multiple (twins, triplets, 
etc.) pregnancy, or with a history of previous pre-term birth or miscarriage were 
excluded. Mothers who smoked, consumed alcoholic drinks in a great amount, took 
drugs, or suffered malnutrition were also excluded, as were those who would require 
antibiotics for invasive procedures.
Sample Size
Before the study, a sample size calculation was performed which related birthweight 
assessment and time of gestation. Hence, assuming a 500 g birthweight difference at a 
95% test power for a two-sample t test, N  =  39 was the necessary minimum case 
number. To show a two-week difference in delivery time, at 2.5 SD and 95% power, 
the desired minimum sample size was N = 42.
Treatment and Control Group Enrollment
The study was carried out in 2005 and 2006. During the two study years, there were 
4167 deliveries at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in Szeged. Among

those women who delivered during that time-span, 429 women were 
admitted to the hospital because of threatened pre-term birth, and 
were treated as in-patients. More than half did not meet inclusion 
criteria, or refused to participate (281 women). The periodontal status 
of 148 women was examined, and those who were periodontally 
healthy were identified. Initial localized chronic periodontitis was 
found in 89 women. For the allocation of the participants for 
periodontal treatment, we used a block randomization with blocks of 
two. We generated a random sequence of 1’s and 2’s, and the treatment 
was allocated accordingly to the 1st or 2nd person in the blocks, 
leaving the other for the control group. There were 43 women in the 
treatment and 46 in the control group. Finally, data pertaining to 83 
women were analyzed (Fig.), since six women were not available for 
follow-up (two in the treatment, four in the control groups). The 
dentist who examined and treated the women was blind to the 
pregnancy outcome.
Collection of Demographic and Socioeconomic Data
A questionnaire was used to record demographic data, and actual and 
previous general medical and obstetric histories, including information 
regarding the socio-cultural status and educational levels of both the 
mother and the father. Educational levels were defined as follows: 
primary school (8 yrs), technical school (3 yrs post-primary school), 
grammar school (4 yrs after primary school), and higher education 
(university or college). The parents’ occupations were categorized as 
manual worker, intellectuals/professionals, or ‘other occupation,’ e.g., 
taxi driver, housewife, office worker. Place of residence was defined as 
being either in a city or in a village.
Periodontal Status Measurements
Periodontal examinations were completed at the Department of 
Obstetrics & Gynecology, where a dental unit with an ultrasonic scaler 
was installed. This area was suitable for dental examinations and the 
undertaking of professional oral hygiene treatment and periodontal 
status measurements. Examinations and periodontal treatment were 
carried out by the same dental clinician.
To measure probing depth, the clinician used a disposable periodon-
tal probe with a tip diameter of 0.5 mm. The depth was taken from 
the gingival margin to the most apical point of the sulcus/pocket, at 
6 sites per tooth, i.e., mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, 
mid-lingual, and distolingual. Bleeding on probing was regarded as 
positive if it occurred within 15 sec after the probing depth was mea-
sured at any tooth site, and was recorded dichotomously.
Examinations were completed by the same team member, and the 
examiner, who was an experienced periodontologist, re-examined 20 
women after a 30-minute time period had elapsed, to test reproducibility.
Definition of Preterm Delivery 
and Threatened Preterm Birth
Premature delivery (WHO, 1950) implies labor that occurs at fewer 
than 37 complete wks of gestation, and is generally accompanied by 
low birthweight, i.e., a birthweight < 2500 g.
Gestational age at delivery and periodontal treatment were calcu-
lated from the first day of the last menstrual period, or based on the 
results of ultrasonic examination, which was provided in the first tri-
mester of pregnancy. Threatened pre-term birth, between the completed 
24th and 37th wks, includes obstetric events during pregnancy, such as 
premature rupture of the membranes, or necessity of treatment for pre-
mature uterine activity and/or cervical dilation. Women with this condi-
tion received special obstetric treatment to maintain their pregnancy as 
long as possible. The therapy consisted of, first, bed rest, then tocolytic 
agents (intravenous MgSO4/Gynipral), and antibiotic administration for 
the prevention of genito-urinary infection (based on the antibiogram). 
Before the 35th wk of pregnancy, where pre-term birth is threatened, an 
intramuscular steroid was given to prevent infantile respiratory distress 
syndrome. As a result of such treatments, labor could possibly be 
delayed until after the 37th wk of gestation.
Initial Localized Chronic Periodontitis Criteria
A pregnant woman was regarded as having periodontitis if she had ≥ 4 mm 
probing depth, at least at one site, and bleeding on probing (BOP) for 
≥ 50% of teeth. Participants having no ≥ 4 mm pockets or BOP occurring 
at less than 50% of teeth were regarded as periodontally healthy.
Periodontal Treatment
The participants underwent periodontal examination within two days after 
being admitted as in-patients at the hospital due to a threatened pre-term 
delivery. The periodontal treatment was carried out in the third trimester, 
around the 32nd wk of pregnancy, and consisted of oral hygiene instruction, 
supra- and subgingival scaling carried out with hand instruments and/or an 
ultrasonic scaler, and finished by polishing of the teeth with a fluoride-
containing polishing paste. For those who received no periodontal 
treatment during pregnancy, it was suggested post-delivery.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to assess the demographic and socio-
economic data. For comparison of mean values, Student’s t test was 
used, as well as Mann-Whitney tests where non-normality was 
determined. Normal distribution of samples was tested by the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Association of treatment with categorical 
data was analyzed by the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test, 
including the calculation of unadjusted odds ratios. The significance 
level was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
The effect of periodontal treatment on the birthweight of the 
newborn and the dates of delivery of 83 women (Table 1) was 
analyzed statistically in the present study. With respect to cali-
bration of the periodontal examinations, the intra-class correla-
tion coefficient was 0.94 or greater for the different periodontal 
scores and indices.

There were 41 women in the treatment group and 42 control 
individuals (not receiving periodontal treatment). The mean age 
was 29.0 yrs, and the age distribution was found to be normal, with 
no significant difference between the mean age of the treatment 
(29.1 yrs) and control (28.9 yrs) groups (p = 0.888). The youngest 
mother was 16.2 yrs old and the oldest 43.1 yrs old (Table 1). 
Participants had different educational levels and occupations and 
came from all social strata. With respect to socio-economic 
(education, occupation, residency) data, there was no significant 
difference between treatment and control groups. The number of 
pregnancies was also very similar in both treatment and in the 
control groups (p = 0.072), with most of the mothers having their 
first or second pregnancy during the study (Table 1).
Signs of threatened pre-term birth 
started around the 32nd gestational wk in 
both groups (Table 1). There was no 
significant difference concerning the 
times of hospitalization between treat­
ment and control groups (p = 0.822).
The current periodontal status of 
the women was described by probing 
depth (mean 2.15 mm in the treatment 
group, 2.11 mm in control individuals) 
and frequency of bleeding on probing 
(63.1% in the treatment group, 70.8% 
in the control group), showing no 
significant difference between these 
parameters (p = 0.316 and p = 0.051, 
respectively) (Table 1).
The mean weight (Table 2) of 
newborns of treated women was 
3079.0  g, while it was much less for 
control individuals, at 2602.4  g, the 
difference being highly significant 
(p = 0.001). The length of pregnancy 
(Table 2) also differed significantly 
between groups, at 37.5 wks in the 
treatment, and 36.1 wks in the control 
group (p = 0.013).
The incidence of deliveries at ≤ 37 
weeks’ gestation (Table 3) was 24.3% 
in the periodontally treated group, but 
significantly greater at 52.4% in control 
individuals (p = 0.013). Regarding low 
birthweight (< 2500 g), it was 14.6% 
for the treated, and 42.9% for control 
individuals (p = 0.007). Both pre-term 
birth and low birthweight occurred in 
only four women (9.8%) in the 
treatment group, and in 14 control 
individuals (33.3%) (p = 0.015).
The calculated odds ratios showed 
that periodontal therapy increased the 
chance of normal delivery, being 3.4 
times more likely than in control 
individuals, while for infant birthweight 
of ≥ 2500 g, it was 4.3 times higher in 
the treatment group than in control 
individuals (Table 3). Furthermore, normal gestation, coupled 
with a normal birthweight, was 4.6 times more likely in mothers 
who underwent periodontal treatment.
DISCUSSION
As far as the authors are aware, this was the first study to report 
the possible effects of periodontal therapy on the incidence of 
pre-term birth and low birthweight in a demographically homog-
enous Caucasian European population. The study concentrated 
on the potential effects of periodontal treatment on the outcome 
of the pregnancy. Here, significant differences were found 
between treatment and control groups relative to each new-

born’s birthweight and time of deliv-
ery. The mean weight of the newborns 
was significantly greater (on average, 
476.6 g) for women who received peri-
odontal treatment, and their gestation 
times were longer (on average, 1.4 
wks), than those of the control individ-
uals—both factors of great clinical 
importance in the developmental status 
of the newborn. Although the peri-
odontal treatment was provided only in 
the third trimester, it is probable that 
this treatment played a part in the posi-
tive outcome of the pregnancy.
In this study, initial localized chronic 
periodontitis (Armitage, 1999) was 
determined by measurement of critical 
probing depth (Lindhe et al., 1982) and 
frequency of bleeding on probing, since 
these periodontal status parameters 
reflect mainly on the current inflam­
matory burden. These criteria for initial 
localized chronic periodontitis were 
chosen because a probing depth of less 
than 4  mm can be regarded as within 
normal limits (Lindhe and Nyman, 
2003). Bleeding on probing was the 
other criterion for chronic periodontitis, 
since many studies have shown it as a 
reliable inflammatory sign (Davenport 
et al., 1982; Lang et al., 1986). 
Additionally, it has been stated that 
these two parameters should also be 
taken into consideration as important 
factors in a woman’s risk assessment for 
the recurrence of periodontitis (Lang 
and Tonetti, 2003).
Alveolar bone level was not 
assessed 
radiographically, 
because 
radiographic evaluation is not always 
reliable in the early stage of periodon­-
titis. Additionally, the size of the surface area of the pocket 
(Slots, 2003), through which bacteria and their products can 
invade the periodontal tissues, has been found to be more 
important than bone levels per se, since these indicate the 
outcome of only previous inflammation.
The suggestion from the first interventional study (Mitchell-
Lewis et al., 2001) was that periodontal therapy is a possible 
means of reducing the incidence of pre-term birth. It has been 
found that pre-term birth at < 35 wks occurred in 0.8% women 
who received scaling and root planing during pregnancy, while 
it was 6.3% in their non-treated counterparts (Jeffcoat et al., 
2003). In another study, it was found that periodontal treatment 
significantly reduced the pre-term low-birthweight rate in a 
study population of women with pregnancy-associated gingivitis 
(Lopez et al., 2005), while in a more recent publication, a 
positive effect of periodontal treatment during pregnancy was 
reported (Sadatmansouri et al., 2006). However, in these studies, 
most or all of the women were African-American, Hispanic, or 
Indian and/or had low socio-economic status, characteristics 
which are significant risk factors for periodontal disease and 
pre-term low birthweight (Bobetsis et al., 2006). In contrast, not 
all intervention studies showed a beneficial effect of oral health 
measures on pregnancy outcomes (Huojel et al., 2006; 
Michalowicz et al., 2006).
The above studies and the present investigation may not 
provide definitive scientific evidence of a causal effect of 
periodontitis on pre-term delivery; therefore, larger multi-center 
trials would be required to prove or disprove this hypothesis. 
These findings are the first to suggest that incorporating 
periodontal care as an integral component of antenatal obstetric 
management of threatened pre-term deliveries may result in 
improved pregnancy outcomes.
In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that 
women with threatened pre-term delivery and initial localized 
chronic periodontitis had a significantly lower chance of adverse
