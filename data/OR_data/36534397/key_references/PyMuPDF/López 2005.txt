Periodontal Therapy Reduces the Rate
of Preterm Low Birth Weight in Women
With Pregnancy-Associated Gingivitis
Ne´stor J. Lo´pez,* Isabel Da Silva,† Joaquı´n Ipinza,† and Jorge Gutie´rrez‡
Background: One hypothesis to explain the association between periodontal disease (PD) preterm/low
birth weight (PT/LBW) is that PT/LBW may be indirectly mediated through translocation of bacteria or bac-
terial products in the systemic circulation. Transient bacteremias occur in subjects with marginal periodon-
titis or with gingivitis, and it is possible that bacteria and their products may reach the placental membranes
hematogenously and provide the inﬂammatory effect to induce preterm labor. The effect of gingivitis as
a potential risk factor for PT/LBW has still not been studied. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken
to determine the effect of routine plaque control and scaling on the pregnancy outcomes in women with
gingivitis.
Methods: Eight hundred seventy (870) pregnant women with gingivitis, aged 18 to 42, were enrolled
while receiving prenatal care in Santiago, Chile. Women were randomly assigned in a two-to-one fashion
to either a treatment group (N = 580), receiving periodontal treatment before 28 weeks of gestation or
to a control group (N = 290), receiving periodontal treatment after delivery. Periodontal therapy consisted
of plaque control, scaling, and daily rinsing with 0.12% clorhexidine. Maintenance therapy was provided ev-
ery 2 to 3 weeks until delivery, and consisted of oral hygiene instruction and supragingival plaque removal
by instrumentation, as needed. The primary outcomes assessed were delivery at less than 37 weeks of ges-
tation or an infant weighing less than 2,500 g.
Results: Of the 870 women enrolled, 36 women (27 in the treatment group and nine in the control group)
were excluded from the analyses for different reasons. The incidence of PT/LBW in the treatment group was
2.14% (12/560) and in the control group, 6.71% (19/283) (odds ratio [OR] 3.26; 95% conﬁdence interval
[CI] 1.56 to 6.83; P = 0.0009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for sev-
eral known risk factors for PT/LBW, women with gingivitis were at a higher risk of PT/LBW than women who
received periodontal treatment (OR 2.76; 95%CI 1.29 to 5.88; P = 0.008).
Conclusions: Periodontal treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the PT/LBW rate in this population of women
with pregnancy-associated gingivitis. Within the limitions of this study, we conclude that gingivitis appears
to be an independent risk factor for PT/LBW for this population. J Periodontol 2005;76:2144-2153.

O
ne of the main causes of perinatal morbidity
and mortality throughout the world is pre-
term delivery, and in about 50% of all
preterm deliveries, the etiology is unknown.1 In-
creasing evidence supports a relationship between
symptomatic nongenital maternal infections and pre-
term labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and
preterm delivery. Results from epidemiologic, molec-
ular,
microbiologic,
obstetric,
and
animal
model
studies, as well as from interventional studies, show
that infection and inﬂammation in the mother play
primary roles in about 50% of episodes of preterm
rupture of membranes and preterm birth (PT).2,3
Results of two case-control studies4,5 have sug-
gested that periodontal infections may be among
the maternal infections associated with adverse preg-
nancy outcomes. If periodontal infections are a cause
of preterm birth, it might be expected that eradication
of such infections would reduce the risk of preterm
birth. Randomized controlled trials testing interven-
tions are considered to be the strongest evidence that
the factor identiﬁed is in the causal chain. Results from
some intervention studies6-9 have demonstrated asig-
niﬁcant reduction of preterm births (PT) and of low
birth weight (LBW) infants in women with chronic
periodontitis who received periodontal therapy prepar-
tum, compared to women who did not receive peri-
odontal intervention. These preliminary intervention
studies provide initial evidence that periodontitis is
a risk factor for PT/LBW and that periodontal therapy
may reduce the risk of PT/LBW. One of the hypothe-
ses to explain the relation between periodontal dis-
ease and preterm birth is that periodontal infection
is a source of bacteria and bacterial products that
may spread from the infected periodontium to the am-
niotic cavity, as when transient bacteremia occurs in
patients with periodontitis.4,10 It has been demon-
strated that transient bacteremia commonly occurs
in subjects with periodontitis11 as well as in those with
gingival inﬂammation,12 and bacteria or their products
may conceivably reach the placental tissues providing
the inﬂammatory effect for labor induction.13
Plaque-induced gingivitis is an inﬂammation of
the gingiva resulting from bacterial infection, and this
disease is the most common periodontal disease
in pregnant women.14,15 During pregnancy, the prev-
alence and severity of gingivitis have been reported to
be elevated yet unrelated to the amount of plaque
present.16,17 However, the severity of gingivitis is
correlated with sex steroid hormone levels during
pregnancy.16 The characteristics of pregnancy-
associated gingivitis are similar to plaque-induced
gingivitis, but there is a tendency to a more severe
gingival inﬂammation.14,15 There is evidence that
some periodontal pathogens can cross the pla-
cental barrier and produce infection in the fetal
membranes. Prevotella intermedia can be found at
high concentrations in pregnancy-associated gingi-
vitis,18 and the prevalence of positive fetal anti-IgM
speciﬁc for P. intermedia was found to be signiﬁ-
cantly higher in preterm than in full-term neonates.
The fetal antibody seropositivity for P. intermedia, as
indexed by cord blood IgM, suggests in utero exposure
to the fetus to this bacterium or its products.10
Fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most com-
monly recovered organisms from sites with gingivi-
tis,19 and is the most frequently isolated species
from amniotic ﬂuid cultures obtained from pregnant
women with premature labor and intact placental
membranes.20 Recently, a study of pregnant mice
showed that F. nucleatum can cross the placenta
and spread to the amniotic ﬂuid producing premature
delivery and stillbirths.21 Thus, there is some basis to
support the hypothesis that gingivitis may be a poten-
tial risk factor for PT/LBW, but the association be-
tween pregnancy-associated gingivitis with preterm
birth has not been explored. A randomized controlled
trial in pregnant women with gingivitis was under-
taken to address the following questions: 1) Is preg-
nancy-associated gingivitis related to PT/LBW? and
2) Does periodontal therapy reduce the PT/LBW rate
in pregnant women with gingivitis? The multivariate
logistic analyses used in the current study determined
the effect of each intervention or risk factor on the out-
come.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The study population consisted of pregnant women
who received uniform prenatal care in a public health
clinic in Santiago, Chile. Routine prenatal care
included periodic examinations, screening for preg-
nancy complications, nutritional advice, stress reduc-
tion, education about symptoms of preterm labor,
correction of identiﬁed risk factors, and referral to
the high-risk obstetric clinic when appropriate.
Selection of Subjects
Criteria for inclusion were otherwise healthy pregnant
women over age 18, with a single gestation, 22 weeks
or less of gestation, gingival inﬂammation with ‡25%
of sites with bleeding on probing, and no sites with
clinical attachment loss >2 mm.
Exclusion criteria included fewer than 18 natural
teeth, indication of prophylactic antibiotics for inva-
sive procedures, diabetes previous to pregnancy,
and the intention to deliver at a hospital other than that
of the study.
Potential participants were identiﬁed by the mid-
wives who attended the prenatal care clinics. A total
of 1,296 women were screened, and 870 women with

gingivitis were selected. The study protocol was ap-
proved by the institutional ethics committee, and all
women who participated did so voluntarily and gave
their informed consent.
Sample Size
Assuming a probability of PT/LBW of 20% in the con-
trol group and of 10% in the treatment group, a sample
of 290 women in each group might detect a signiﬁcant
difference of PT/LBW between groups (P <0.05;
two-sided) with a power of 80%. In order to increase
the statistical power, it was decided to allocate un-
equal numbers of participants to each group. Thus,
for each woman allocated to the control group, two
women were placed in the treatment group.
Determining Periodontal Status
Upon entering the study, all women received a full-
mouth periodontal examination and the following
variables were measured: oral hygiene status, gingi-
val inﬂammation, probing depth (PD), and clinical
attachment level (CAL). Oral hygiene status was as-
sessed as the percentage of surfaces demonstrating
plaque. Dichotomous measures of supragingival
plaque accumulation were made by running a peri-
odontal probe at the cervical surface of each tooth.
The presence of plaque was positive when a continu-
ous band of plaque was found in contact with the gin-
gival tissue on the cervical portion of mesial, buccal,
distal, and lingual tooth surfaces. Plaque scores were
calculated as the percentage of surfaces examined
demonstrating plaque.
Probing depth and attachment level measurements
were made at the mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal,
disto-lingual, lingual, and mesio-lingual positions of
every tooth except third molars. CAL was measured
using the cemento-enamel junction as a reference
point. Bleeding on probing (BOP) was assessed on
the six sites at which probing depth measurements
were taken and deemed positive if bleeding occurred
within 15 seconds after probing. BOP was expressed
as the percentage of sites showing bleeding. Clinical
measurements were recorded to the nearest millime-
ter using a calibrated periodontal probe by a single
calibrated examiner.
Recording Maternal Characteristics
Demographic factors such as age, marital status, and
educational level and detailed data about previous
and current pregnancies were obtained from medical
records and interviews during prenatal visits. A med-
ical, obstetric, and social history was taken according
to the protocol of the prenatal care program for each
patient. Information on known risk factors and obstet-
ric factors were collected and included the following:
in relation to pregnancy history, the number carried to
full term, previous preterm deliveries, low weight
births, previous pregnancies aborted, and live births
were recorded. In relation to the current pregnancy,
maternal age at time of study entry, onset of prenatal
care, nutritional status, tobacco use, alcohol con-
sumption, use of illicit drugs, sexually transmitted dis-
eases, asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary infections,
vaginosis or any other maternal infectious disease,
number of prenatal visits, intrauterine growth restric-
tion, fetal death (the current pregnancy may end due
to fetal death), gestational age, and birth weight were
recorded.
Prenatal care included the following: blood pres-
sure measurements, urine tests, blood tests, record-
ing of maternal weight and height, and physical and
pelvic examinations. At each prenatal visit, an evalu-
ation of nutritional status was done to determine if
weight gain was adequate. A normal standard of the
weight-to-height proportion established for Chilean
women was used for the evaluation of nutritional
status. At every week of gestation, pregnant women
should gain weight within the recommended range
for her weight-to-height proportion. A nomogram for
Chilean women22 was used to assess whether weight
gain was adequate. Underweight women received
supplementary nutrition. Women with symptomatic
or asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine culture with
>100,000 CFU) were treated with nitrofurantoin for
10 days.
All women with vaginosis were treated with locally
applied antibiotics, either metronidazole, clotrima-
zole, or nistatine, according to the results of microbi-
ological examinations of vaginal swabs.
Randomization
Randomization was done equalizing gingivitis as the
relevant variable, and the percentage of BOP sites
was selected as the variable describing gingivitis. Pa-
tients were assigned to one of two categories: those
with <50% BOP sites and those with ‡50% BOP sites.
Three women with <50% BOP sites were grouped, and
another three women with ‡50% BOP sites were as-
signed to another group. Each one of the three women
in both groups was given two numbers, simply be-
cause a die has six numbers. The numbers given were
1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, and were given in the same order in
which the women were allocated to the group. One
woman of each group of three was selected by rolling
a die. The selected woman of each group was as-
signed to the control group, and the other two to the
treatment group.
Periodontal Intervention and Timing
For women in the treatment group, periodontal ther-
apy consisted of plaque control instructions, supra-
and subgingival scaling, and crown polishing. At the
beginning of treatment, each woman was provided
with toothbrushes and chlorhexidine and instructed

to rinse once a day with 0.12% chlorhexidine until de-
livery. Periodontal therapy was completed before 28
weeks of gestation, and maintenance therapy was
provided every 2 to 3 weeks until delivery. Mainte-
nance therapy was provided every 2 to 3 weeks until
delivery, and consisted of oral hygiene instruction and
supragingival plaque removal by instrumentation, as
needed. Carious lesions were treated, and all teeth
indicated for extraction were extracted from both
groups.
Women in the control group were monitored two to
three times during pregnancy, and repeated peri-
odontal examinations were performed after 30 weeks
of gestation to assess changes in periodontal status.
Pregnancy Outcome Measures
Primary outcomes measured were preterm birth and
low birth weight. Preterm birth was deﬁned as a deliv-
ery before 37 complete weeks of gestation of an infant
with a birth weight below 2,500 g which followed
spontaneous labor and/or spontaneous rupture of
the membranes, regardless of route of delivery. Pre-
term deliveries required for medical indications in
which there was no spontaneous labor or no rupture
of membranes were not included in preterm birth
deﬁnition.
An infant born at term (‡37 weeks of gestation) with
a birth weight less than 2,500 g was diagnosed as hav-
ing intrauterine growth restriction if the birth weight
was in the 10th percentile for gestational age as deter-
mined by the nomogram for Chilean newborn in-
fants.23 A birth outcome which occurred after 37
weeks of gestation or the birth of an infant with a
weight ‡2,500 g was deﬁned as normal.
The delivery date was calculated from the last men-
strual period and from ultrasound examination. Dates
obtained from ultrasound examination were used in
cases with unknown menstrual dates.
Labor and delivery management decisions were
made by the resident staff and attending physicians
at the hospital. They had no knowledge that the pa-
tients were participating in a research study. Infor-
mation concerning the pregnancy outcomes was
obtained from the hospital records by the obstetrician
researcher (JG) who did not work at the study hospital.
He was masked to the periodontal characteristics
of the patient and to the group to which the patient
belonged.
Statistical Methods
Women who had a preterm delivery or had a low birth
weight infant (LBW) were grouped in the preterm/low
birth weight group (PLBW) for the analyses of data
to identify the risk factors. The analyses included
descriptive statistics and both univariate and multi-
variate logistic regression analyses. Comparisons of
proportions were performed using the chi square test
or Fisher’s exact test and differences between contin-
uous variables by the unpaired t test. Data to calculate
the incidence and the odds ratios for PT, LBW, and
PT/LBW were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis,
regardless of compliance with the protocol, and all
women initially enrolled in the study were included ex-
cept three in the treatment group and two in the con-
trol group who quit coming to the clinic. Unadjusted
and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated with
95% conﬁdence interval (CI). Statistical signiﬁcance
was deﬁned as P <0.05. Statistical analysis was perfor-
med using a software program.§
RESULTS
Figure 1 presents a ﬂow diagram of participation and
follow-up. Of the 870 women enrolled, 36 women (27
in the treatment group and nine in the control group)
were excluded from the analyses. In the treatment
group, seven had spontaneous abortion; 10 had pre-
term delivery due to placenta previa or abruption (N =
4), polyhidramnios (N = 3), preeclampsia (N = 2), or
gestational diabetes (N = 1); seven women withdrew
from the study because they moved from the residen-
tial area, and three were lost to follow-up. In the con-
trol group, three had spontaneous abortion, one had
preterm delivery due to preeclampsia, and one had a
stillbirth due to severe malformations; two withdrew
from the study because they moved from the residen-
tial area, and two were lost to follow-up. The nine
women who withdrew from the study had a normal
parturition according to self-reported data, but their
periodontal status before delivery could not be as-
sessed. Thus, data of those women were not included
in the logistic regression analyses.
Eight hundred thirty-four women with live births
ﬁnished the study: 553 in the treatment group and
281 in the control group. The mean age of women
was 25.35 (SD – 5.1) years, 21.47% were unmarried,
78.77% had less than 12 years of education, 15.46%
smoked, 34.98% were primiparous, and 4.79% had
a history of previous PT/LBW. Table 1 shows the dis-
tribution of maternal characteristics in both groups at
baseline. The control group had a signiﬁcantly higher
percentage of women with a history of a previous
PT/LBW (7.47% versus 3.44%, P = 0.009). There were
no other significant differences between the groups.
Periodontal characteristics are shown in Table 2.
Women in both groups had poor oral hygiene status
and extensive gingival inﬂammation, with a mean per-
centage of BOP sites higher than 50%. There were no
signiﬁcant differences in the periodontal characteris-
tics at baseline.

therapy, and those in the control group after 30 weeks
of gestation. The characteristics of the treatment
group were compatible with periodontal health, and
all parameters were signiﬁcantly higher in the control
group. The periodontal characteristics of the control
group did not change signiﬁcantly throughout preg-
nancy, expect for mean probing depth which in-
creased from 2.22 – 0.46 mm at baseline to 2.33 –
0.57 mm (P = 0.012) after 30 weeks of gestation. Ma-
ternal characteristics of women in both groups after
delivery are shown in Table 4. There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences between the groups, although women
in the treatment group had a
higher mean gestational age
and a higher mean birth weight
than
women
in
the
control
group.
There were 31 PT/LBW in-
fants (3.67%) in the 843 live
births: 24 were due to preterm
birth (2.84%) and seven were
low birth weight infants (0.83%)
(Table 5). Women in the con-
trol group had a signiﬁcantly
higher incidence of PT (5.65%)
compared to women in the
treatment group (1.42%, P =
0.001). The rate of LBW was
also higher in the control group
(1.15%) than in the treatment
group (0.71%), but the dif-
ference
was
not
statistically
signiﬁcant. The incidence of
PT/LBW was more than three
times higher in control group
(6.71%) than in the treatment
group (2.14%, P = 0.002). Pre-
term prelabor rupture of the
membranes was found in three
of the eight women with PT in
the treatment group compared
to 8 of the 16 women in the
control group (non-signiﬁcant).
Two of the 16 preterm births in
the control group and three
of the eight preterm births in
the treatment group occurred
in women with a previous PT/
LBW. Four of the 16 preterm
deliveries in the control group
(1.41%) and four of the eight
preterm deliveries in the treat-
ment group (0.71%) occurred
at less than 34 weeks of gesta-
tion, but the difference was not
signiﬁcant.
Table 6 shows the OR for PT, LBW, and PT/LBW in
women in both groups. The OR for PT for women in the
control group was 4.11 (95% CI: 1.73 to 9.73), and for
PT/LBW 3.26 (95% CI: 1.56 to 6.83). However, the re-
lationship between gingivitis and LBW was not statis-
tically signiﬁcant (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 0.32 to 6.54). The
reduction in the incidence of PT/LBW in the treatment
group was 67.89%.
Table 7 shows the results of the univariate analysis
for risk factors for PT/LBW. PT/LBW was signiﬁcantly
associated with gingivitis (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 1.56 to
6.83), and to a previous PT/LBW (OR 4.22, 95% CI:

1.53 to 11.6). The other variables studied did not
inﬂuence the incidence of PT/LBW.
After multivariate adjustment, the only factor sig-
niﬁcantly associated with PT/LBW was gingivitis (OR
2.76, 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.88) (Table 8), and a previous
PT/LBW was no longer associated with PT/LBW.
DISCUSSION
The present randomized controlled trial was carried
out in an ethnically and demographically homoge-
nous population at low risk for PT/LBW (the total in-
cidence of PT/LBW was 3.17%, which is 40% lower
than in the total population of pregnant women in
Chile [6%] and 63% lower than in the U.S. [10%]), with
a historically low PT/LBW rate. In the present study,
women who received periodontal treatment had sig-
niﬁcantly fewer PT/LBW than women with untreated
gingivitis.
One of the essential characteristics of randomized
controlled trials is that the study groups must be sim-
ilar at the start of the trial.24 Women of the present
study were randomly allocated to each group equaliz-
ing gingivitis as the relevant variable. Since the
study sample was obtained from a homogenous pop-
ulation in relation to demographic characteristics and
known risk factors for PT/LBW, and all women were
receiving uniform prenatal care, it was assumed that
the distribution of the other relevant variables would
be similar in both groups of women. Although proper

randomization is aimed to prevent selection bias, it
does not always guarantee that the groups are totally
equivalent at baseline, especially when a high number
of risk factors may affect the outcome under study, as
occurs with PT/LBW. In the present study, there was
a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of women with a pre-
vious PT/LBW in the control group (Table1), and a
history of PT/LBW is an important risk factor for sub-
sequent pregnancies.25-28 In the present study, a pre-
vious PT/LBW showed to be a risk factor for PT/LBW
in the univariate logistic regression analysis, with an
unadjusted OR = 4.22. Thus, women in the control
group appeared to be at higher risk of PT/LBW than
women in the treatment group. However, the low rate
of PT/LBW in women with a previous PT/LBW in both
groups explains why, after multivariate adjustment,
a previous PT/LBW was no longer associated with
PT/LBW. The recurrence of PT/LBW may be associ-
ated with the presence of some conditions in the
mother that make her more susceptible to the effects
of infection and inﬂammation. The success of peri-
odontal treatment in reducing the risk of preterm birth
in women with a history of PT/LBW supports the hy-
pothesis that these women may have greater suscep-
tibility to the effect of periodontal infection. There
may be a variation between women in the activation
threshold at which periodontal infections trigger the
mechanisms of preterm labor. A genetic factor that
determines a low threshold to the effect of infection
or a hyper-inﬂammatory response could account for
the repeated occurrence of spontaneous preterm birth
in certain women. Results of some studies29,30 have
suggested that polymorphisms in proinﬂammatory
cytokine genes may be associated with spontaneous
preterm labor in some populations.
Urinary infections and vaginosis are well known
risk factors of PT/LBW. In the current study, there
was a similar proportion of women with urinary infec-
tion or with vaginosis in the treatment and control
groups (Table 4). All women with urinary infections
were treated with nitrofurantoin, and women with vag-
inosis were treated with locally applied antibiotics. As
women with vaginosis were treated with locally ap-
plied antibiotics, no effect of the antibiotics on the
progression of gingivitis can be expected.
No association was found between genitourinary
infections and PT/LBW, probably due to the fact that
the treatment given to women in the present study
was effective in controlling these infections. There
were 64 women in the treatment group (11.21%)
and 33 (11.39%) in the control group who were trea-
ted with systemic nitrofurantoin. There may be some
concern about the effect of nitrofurantoin as a con-
founding variable in gingivitis. In a previous study
in pregnant women,8 no differences were found in
patients with untreated periodontis who received ni-
trofurantoin when their baseline periodontal charac-
teristics were compared with those after receiving
the antibiotic and with patients who did not receive
nitrofurantoin. Additionally, in the current study, the
proportion of patients treated with nitrofurantoı´n
was similar both in the
treatment and
control
groups, and the logistic regression analyses found
no relationship between nitrofurantoin therapy and
PT/LBW.
A signiﬁcant association between gingivitis and
preterm birth was found after adjusting for the major
risk factors for preterm delivery, suggesting that gin-
givitis is an independent risk factor for PT/LBW. The
results of the present study showing that periodontal
therapy reduced PT/LBW rate by 68% in women with
pregnancy-associated gingivitis are in concordance
with two intervention studies7,8 in which periodontal
treatment reduced the incidence of PT/LBW between
71% and 84% in pregnant women with moderate to
severe chronic periodontitis.
In the present study, a higher number of medically
indicated preterm deliveries occurred in the treat-
ment group than in the control group, although the

difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. None of
the preterm deliveries in the present study were pre-
ceded by spontaneous labor or premature rupture of
membranes, and were associated with conditions
not related to maternal or fetal infections, such as
polyhidramnios, placenta previa or abruption, gesta-
tional diabetes, and preeclampsia.
Signiﬁcantly high health care costs are generated
by preterm birth, and any strategy that reduces the
preterm birth rate is likely to produce both health
and economic beneﬁts for mothers and infants. The
present study and other published controlled trials7,8
demonstrate that signiﬁcant reduction of preterm
births can be obtained in women considered to be at

normal or low risk for preterm birth by treating peri-
odontal infections. In the present study, as well as
in the two previous intervention studies,7,8 peri-
odontal therapy was ﬁnished before 28 weeks of ges-
tation in order to eliminate periodontal infection at
a similar early stage of the pregnancy in all women
in the treatment group. Because infection is more
likely to cause very early preterm birth, trials focusing
on women at later gestational ages may not show an
effect.31
Ideally, women should begin their pregnancy with-
out periodontal infections, and they should be edu-
cated and motivated to maintain a high level of oral
hygiene prior to and throughout pregnancy. However,
if a periodontal infection is diagnosed at any time dur-
ing pregnancy, the treatment should be administered
as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of PT/
LBW. Pregnancy-associated gingivitis is a prevent-
able and easy to treat disease, and any cost-beneﬁt
analysis of the administration of periodontal therapy
to pregnant women in order to reduce preterm birth
rates would show a high direct cost-beneﬁt saving.
However, the real cost saving of reduction in the rate
of preterm birth ascribable to periodontal treatment is
best represented by the lives of children saved from
premature death and biological, social, and economic
impairment.
The current knowledge of the pathologic mecha-
nism involved in the association between periodontal
diseases and PT/LBW supports this relationship, but
more investigations are still needed to determine if
periodontal infections have a causal role in adverse
pregnancy outcomes in other populations. Most cases
of preterm labor and preterm birth are multifaceted,
multiple-step, and interactive fetal and maternal
processes.3 It has been shown that some maternal
factors, such as short cervix, are more likely to be as-
sociated with preterm birth when the mother also has
a bacterial vaginosis.33 Thus, it is probable that ma-
ternal periodontal infection may interact synergisti-
cally with other maternal factors to trigger preterm
birth.
It is still not known what are the precise mecha-
nisms involved in the association between periodontal
infections and preterm birth. In the history of medicine
there are several examples of effective control or dis-
ease prevention before the precise mechanisms that
caused the disease had been established. The puer-
peral fever was controlled many years before bacteria
were discovered through the careful hand washing
of the midwives and obstetricians before assisting
women at delivery. The consumption of citric fruit
was used to prevent and to treat scurvy more than
200 years before vitamin C was discovered. In the
same
way, malaria was
controlled
by draining
marshes before knowing that mosquitoes transmitted
the disease.33 Results of intervention studies in preg-
nant women with periodontitis7-9 and the results of
the present study in women with gingivitis show that
eradication of periodontal infection signiﬁcantly re-
duces the risk of PT/LBW, and no harmful damaging
effect caused by periodontal intervention in pregnant
women has been reported.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, women with gingivitis who received peri-
odontal therapy before 28 weeks of gestation had a
signiﬁcantly lower incidence of PT/LBW than women
who did not receive periodontal therapy. Pregnancy-
associated gingivitis appeared to be an independent
risk factor for PT/LBW and affords more than a two-
fold increase in the risk for PT/LBW.
