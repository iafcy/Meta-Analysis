Periodontal disease has been linked with a number of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, all likely through systemic inflammatory pathways. It is common in women of reproductive age and gum conditions tend 
to worsen during pregnancy. Some evidence from observational studies suggests that periodontal intervention may reduce adverse 
pregnancy outcomes. There is need for a comprehensive Cochrane review of randomised trials to assess the effect of periodontal treatment 
on perinatal and maternal health. 

To assess the effects of treating periodontal disease in pregnant women in order to prevent or reduce perinatal and maternal morbidity 
and mortality. 

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 6 October 2016), 
Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (to 7 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, 
Issue 9) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 6 October 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 6 October 2016), and LILACS BIREME Virtual 
Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 6 October 2016). ClinicalTrials.gov and the 
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 6 October 2016. We placed no 
restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of periodontal treatment in preventing or reducing perinatal 
and maternal morbidity and mortality. We excluded studies where obstetric outcomes were not reported. 

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data using a prepiloted data extraction form. Missing data 
were obtained by contacting authors and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Where appropriate, results of

comparable trials were pooled and expressed as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) . The random- 
effects model was used for pooling except where there was an insufficient number of studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence 
using GRADE. 

There were 15 RCTs (n = 7161 participants) meeting our inclusion criteria. All the included studies were at high risk of bias mostly due 
to lack of blinding and imbalance in baseline characteristics of participants. The studies recruited pregnant women from prenatal care 
facilities who had periodontitis (14 studies) or gingivitis (1 study).The two main comparisons were: periodontal treatment versus no 
treatment during pregnancy and periodontal treatment versus alternative periodontal treatment. The head-to-head comparison between 
periodontal treatments assessed a more intensive treatment versus a less intensive one. 
Eleven studies compared periodontal treatment with no treatment during pregnancy. The meta-analysis shows no clear difference in 
preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10; 5671 participants; 11 studies; low-quality evidence) between periodontal treatment 
and no treatment. There is low-quality evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight < 2500 g (9.70% with periodontal 
treatment versus 12.60% without treatment; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; 3470 participants; 7 studies). 
It is unclear whether periodontal treatment leads to a difference in preterm birth < 35 weeks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.76; 2557 participants; 
2 studies; ) and < 32 weeks (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.32; 2755 participants; 3 studies), low birth weight < 1500 g (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38 to 
1.70; 2550 participants; 2 studies), perinatal mortality (including fetal and neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth) (RR 0.85, 95% 
CI 0.51 to 1.43; 5320 participants; 7 studies; very low-quality evidence), and pre-eclampsia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62; 2946 participants; 
3 studies; very low-quality evidence). There is no evidence of a difference in small for gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 3610 
participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence) when periodontal treatment is compared with no treatment. 
Four studies compared periodontal treatment with alternative periodontal treatment. Data pooling was not possible due to clinical 
heterogeneity. The outcomes reported were preterm birth < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g 
and perinatal mortality (very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth 
weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g and perinatal mortality when different periodontal treatments are compared because the quality 
of evidence is very low. 


It is not clear if periodontal treatment during pregnancy has an impact on preterm birth (low-quality evidence). There is low-quality 
evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight (< 2500 g), however, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. There 
is insufficient evidence to determine which periodontal treatment is better in preventing adverse obstetric outcomes. Future research 
should aim to report periodontal outcomes alongside obstetric outcomes. 



The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if treating gum disease can prevent adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women. Cochrane 
researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 15 relevant studies. 

There is no evidence that the treatment of gum disease reduces the number of babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, however, it may 
reduce the number of babies born weighing less than 2500 g. It is uncertain whether there is a difference in adverse birth outcomes when 
different methods of treating gum disease are compared. 

Gum health tends to worsen during pregnancy. There has been some research associating gum disease with adverse birth outcomes. The 
review assessed studies where pregnant women with gum disease were treated using a combination of different mechanical techniques 
with or without antibiotics. 

The review authors found 15 relevant studies. Five were from North America, four from South America, three from Europe, two from Asia 
and one from Austalia. Eleven studies compared either scaling and root planing or scale and polish with no treatment while the other four 
studies compared scaling and root planing with alternative mechanical treatments.

Periodontal disease is a disease of the supporting tissues of the 
teeth that may affect the gums, periodontal ligament membrane, 
cementum and bone around the tooth socket. It can present as two 
main types. 
1. Gingivitis - an inflammation of the gums (gingivae) around the 
teeth which does not cause loss of periodontal attachment (Int 
Workshop 1999). 
2. Periodontitis - in susceptible patients, gingivitis can progress to 
periodontal disease, with inflammation and destruction of the 
supporting tissues around the teeth. 
Periodontal disease is related to low socioeconomic status 
(OSG 2000) and lower educational achievement (Machuca 1999). 
Periodontal disease has been linked to microbial infections which 
lead to systemic increase in proinflammatory prostaglandins and 
cytokines (Kim 2006). These have been hypothesised, through 
systemic 
lead to a number of 
conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and 
adverse pregnancy outcomes (Papapanou 2015). While periodontal 
disease is common in women of reproductive age overall (e.g. 
19% of Australian females 15 and over (Chrisopoulos 2012)), it is 
believed that gum conditions tend to worsen during pregnancy due 
to hormonal changes (Figuero 2013; Krejci 2002). 

Observational studies 
in humans have shown associations 
between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes 
including preterm birth (Ide 2013; Jeffcoat 2001; Jeffcoat 2002; 
Offenbacher 1996a), preterm premature rupture of the membranes 
(PPROM) (Offenbacher 1996b), pre-eclampsia (Boggess 2003), 
pregnancy loss (Xiong 2007), and postcaesarean endometritis 
(Swamy 2002). 
Not all observational studies, however, have found an association 
between preterm birth or low birth weight and periodontal disease. 
Davenport and colleagues in London, UK, in a case-control study 
of 236 preterm infants and 507 term controls, using clinical 
periodontal indices measured on the labour ward, found the risk of 
preterm low birth weight decreased with increasing pocket depth 
(adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 
0.99). The authors concluded that their results did "not support a 
specific drive to improve periodontal health of pregnant women 
as a means of improving pregnancy outcomes" (Davenport 2002). 
Moore and colleagues failed to find an association between preterm 
birth and periodontal disease in a large prospective cohort study 
and a smaller case-control study (Moore 2004; Moore 2005). 

Periodontal treatment may involve nonsurgical and surgical 
therapies, used alone or in combination. The most common 
periodontal therapy involves counselling on oral hygiene to 
educate patients on how to prevent the accumulation of 
dental plaque and calculus. In nonsurgical approaches, a dental 
hygienist or dentist removes plaque and calculus by using either 
hand instruments (scalers and curettes), ultrasound equipment 
(mechanical debridement), or polishing (Worthington 2013). When 
patients do not respond favourably to the initial nonsurgical 
treatment, surgical intervention may be required. 

Antiseptic mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine can be used as 
a short-term adjunct to oral hygiene measures, particularly after 
surgery when the patient cannot brush the area that has been 
operated on. Sometimes patients are given gels aimed at reducing 
oral bacterial load, and oral or topical antimicrobials (doxycycline, 
metronidazole) (Ciancio 2002). Local or systemic antibiotics may be 
limited to severe or aggressive periodontitis cases where symptoms 
persist after debridement and where good oral hygiene is evident. 

The mechanism of action of periodontal treatment in preventing 
adverse birth outcomes is not fully understood. The general 
aims of treatment of periodontal disease are to resolve the 
inflammation by bringing the amount of plaque and calculus 
down to minimal levels; and to prevent or limit the tissue 
destruction to preserve dentition, maintain appearance and 
minimise discomfort (Pilot 1980; Sheiham 2002; Wennström 1990). 
Periodontal treatment must be followed by good oral hygiene in 
order for the inflammation to remain under control; resolution 
of this inflammation/infection may be an important outcome 
for preventing preterm birth. Thus instructing and motivating 
individuals to clean their teeth properly is an important component 
of periodontal treatment. 
Dental care providers may be concerned that commonly used 
drugs such as anaesthetics, antibiotics and analgesics may harm 
the foetus. There may also be concern that bacteraemia caused 
by some dental procedures may lead to uterine infections, 
spontaneous abortions or preterm labour (Michalowicz 2009). 
Experts have recommended that dental treatment be avoided early 
in pregnancy during organogenesis and also late in pregnancy to 
avoid supine hypotension although such advice is regarded to be 
overly cautious by some obstetricians (Michalowicz 2008). 

Adverse birth outcomes are traumatic and also have huge cost 
implications. Due to a World Health Organization (WHO) report 
showing that preterm birth is the second leading cause of death 
in children under five, addressing preterm birth has become a 
priority for achieving the Millennium Development Goal on infant 
mortality (WHO 2012). Some observational studies have stimulated 
interest in the treatment of women with periodontal disease in 
pregnancy for the possible prevention of preterm birth and other 
adverse birth outcomes. A systematic review of nine observational 
studies and three intervention studies concluded that there is some 
preliminary evidence to suggest that periodontal intervention may 
reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes (Scannapieco 2003). Many 
more recent reviews have since been published focusing mostly 
on foetal/neonatal outcomes (e.g. Fogacci 2011; Polyzos 2010). 
There is need for a comprehensive systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials assessing the effects of periodontal treatment on 
mothers as well as their babies. 

To assess the effects of treating periodontal disease in pregnant 
women in order to prevent or reduce perinatal and maternal 
morbidity and mortality.

All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled 
trials that compare treatments for periodontal disease during 
pregnancy with control treatment, or treatment with alternative 
interventions during pregnancy or no treatment. 

Pregnant women considered to have periodontal disease after 
dental examination. The types of periodontal disease included 
diagnoses of gingivitis and periodontitis (Int Workshop 1999). 

Treatment during pregnancy for periodontal disease, performed 
by a dentist, dental hygienist or therapist (including mechanical 
debridement using scaling and root planing, polishing, or surgery), 
either singly or in combination with counselling on oral hygiene, 
antiseptic oral agents, topical or systemic antimicrobial therapies 
compared with either placebo (for adjunctive treatment), no 
treatment or alternative treatments. 


Primary outcomes were chosen to be most representative of the 
clinically important measures of effectiveness and safety. 

1. gestational age at birth (preterm birth less than 37 weeks, very 
preterm birth less than 34 weeks, extremely preterm birth less than 
28 weeks); 
2. birth weight; 
3. small for gestational age (variously defined); 
4. perinatal mortality. 

5. mortality; 
6. pre-eclampsia (variously defined); 
7. adverse effects of therapy. 


therefore we excluded studies not reporting any of the primary 
outcomes. 
We collated and reported any other outcomes recorded in the 
studies in an appendix (Additional Table 1) to be used for 
developing a core outcome set in trials on pregnancy and 
childbirth. 


Cochrane Oral Health's 
Information Specialist conducted 
systematic searches in the following databases for randomised 
controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. There were no 
language, publication year or publication status restrictions: 




• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, 
Issue 9) in the Cochrane Library (searched 6 October 2016) 
(Appendix 3); 
• MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 6 October 2016) (Appendix 4); 
• Embase Ovid (1980 to 6 October 2016) (Appendix 5); 
• LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and 
Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 6 
October 2016) (Appendix 6). 
Subject strategies were modelled on the search strategy designed 
for MEDLINE Ovid. Where appropriate, they were combined with 
subject strategy adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy 
designed by Cochrane for identifying randomised controlled trials 
and controlled clinical trials as described in the Cochrane Handbook 
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Chapter 6 (Lefebvre 2011). 


• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register 
ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov; searched 6 October 2016) 
(Appendix 7); 
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch; searched 6 October 2016) 
(Appendix 7). 
These include other measures of effectiveness, complications, 
satisfaction with care and health service use. 
We searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant 
systematic reviews for further studies. 

1. plaque levels measured using any appropriate scale; 
2. gingival health measured using any appropriate scale; 
3. changes in probing depth; 
4. changes in clinical attachment levels. 
We have included periodontal outcomes as secondary outcomes to 
establish whether or not periodontal treatment in this population 
results in improvements in periodontal health. This is needed in 
order to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity and thus to 
interpret findings about preterm morbidity outcomes. However, 
periodontal outcomes are not the main focus of the review, 
We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of 
interventions used, we considered adverse effects described in 
included studies only. 

We carried out data collection and analysis according to the 
methods stated in the published protocol (Middleton 2015), which 
are based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions (Higgins 2011)

Two review authors independently screened the titles and 
abstracts identified from the literature search. We discarded studies 
not meeting the inclusion criteria. For studies appearing to meet 
the inclusion criteria, or where there was insufficient information 
to make a clear decision, we obtained full reports and two review 
authors independently assessed them to establish whether the 
studies met the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements by 
discussion, with a third review author consulted if resolution was 
not possible. We entered studies rejected at this or subsequent 
stages in Characteristics of excluded studies tables and recorded 
the main reason for exclusion. 

Data extraction was done independently and in duplicate into 
data extraction forms. We extracted relevant data from full-text 
articles that met the inclusion criteria. If reported, information was 
collected on. 
• Trial setting: country and number of trial centres. 
• Methods: study design, total study duration and date. 
• Participant characteristics: age, sociodemographics, ethnicity, 

• Eligibility criteria: inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
• Intervention and comparator. 
• Outcomes: outcome definition, unit of measurement and time 




We compared completed data extraction forms to check for 
discrepancies and made clarifications by referring to the relevant 
study paper. After checking data for accuracy, we entered them into 
the Characteristics of included studies tables. 

Two review authors independently assessed all studies meeting the 
inclusion criteria for their risk of bias using criteria outlined in the 
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 
2011). The following domains were assessed. 
• Sequence generation (selection bias). 
• Allocation concealment (selection bias). 
• Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). 
• Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias). 
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). 
• Selective reporting (reporting bias). 
• Other bias. 
We judged the studies to be at either low, high or unclear risk of bias 
for each domain assessed, based on the guidance in Higgins 2011. 
The different judgements on risk of bias were interpreted as follows. 


• Unclear risk of bias: plausible bias that raises some doubt about 
the results if one or more domains were at unclear risk of bias. 

• High risk of bias: plausible bias that seriously weakens 
confidence in the results if one or more domains were at high 
risk of bias. 

For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the treatment effect 
as risk ratios (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). For continuous outcomes, we expressed the treatment effect 
as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. However, if the studies 
assessed the same continuous outcome in different ways, we 
planned to estimate the treatment effect using the standardised 
mean difference (SMD). Time to birth was expressed as hazard ratio 
(HR) with corresponding 95% CI. 

The participant was the unit of analysis. For studies comparing 
more than two intervention groups, we made multiple pair-wise 
comparisons between all possible pairs of intervention groups. 

We contacted authors where there was missing data or studies 
had not reported data in sufficient detail. We attempted to 
derive the data using relevant statistical tools and calculators. 
Missing standard deviations would be estimated by calculating a 
correlation coefficient from a study reported in considerable detail 
using methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
Reviews of Interventions Section 16.1.3.2 (Higgins 2011). Where we 
were unable to get missing data from authors, we presented the 
study results only as a narrative summary. 

We tested for heterogeneity using a Chi2 test and P < 0.1 gave 
an indication of the presence of heterogeneity. Inconsistency was 
quantified and represented by the I2 statistic. The thresholds were 
interpreted as follows: 
• 0% to 40%: might not be important; 
• 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 
• 50% to 90%; may represent substantial heterogeneity; 
• 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. 
Where heterogeneity was detected, we investigated possible 
causes and addressed them using methods described in Higgins 
2011. 

Most reporting biases were avoided by not restricting the literature 
search to published literature or by language and date. We 
investigated publication bias for the preterm birth < 37 weeks 
outcome using a funnel plot. The magnitude of publication bias 
was to be determined by visual inspection of the asymmetry of 
the funnel plot. In addition, we were to test funnel plot asymmetry 
by performing a linear regression of intervention effect estimate 
against its standard error, weighted by the inverse of the variance 
of the intervention effect estimate (Egger 1997). 

We carried out a meta-analysis where there was sufficient number 
of studies that assessed similar populations, interventions and 
outcomes. Study data were synthesised using the random-effects

model if there were more than three studies in the meta-analysis; 
otherwise we used the fixed-effect model. The random-effects 
model gives wider confidence intervals for the intervention effects, 
resulting in a more conservative estimate of effect. We combined 
effect estimates of studies we considered appropriate for inclusion 
in the meta-analysis. We pooled RRs for dichotomous outcomes 
and MDs for continuous outcomes. The primary analyses were 
limited to the prespecified outcomes. Studies reporting mean birth 
weight and gestational age were not pooled. The skewness of the 
data due to the rarity of the events precluded our pooling the 
data in a meta-analysis. We presented study data not included in 
the meta-analyses in additional tables. We presented a narrative 
summary of the included studies where we were unable to carry out 
a meta-analysis. 

We planned to undertake subgroup analyses of potential effect 
modifiers to investigate their influence on the effect size of the 
intervention if there were 10 studies or more. We identified 
several potential modifiers of effect: the severity of periodontal 
disease; who gave the treatment (periodontist, dental hygienist 
or general dental practitioner); the number of treatment sessions 
given; the gestational age at which the treatment was started; 
and the following prognostic factors: maternal age, smokers versus 
nonsmokers, and socioeconomic class. However, we were unable 
to undertake these analyses due to the insufficient number of 
studies. 

We were to undertake a sensitivity analysis if we had a sufficient 
number of studies, to assess whether the findings of the review 
were robust to the decisions made during the review process. In 
particular, we planned to exclude studies at high or unclear risk 
of bias from analysis, as well as those with estimated standard 
deviations, to assess whether this affected the findings of the 
review. 


We presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
The main comparison (periodontal treatment versus no treatment) 
and primary outcomes were exported to GRADEprofiler software 
(GRADEpro GDT 2014) for quality assessment. Based on risk of 
bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias, 
we rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome as high, 
moderate, low or very low. These ratings have been defined as 
follows. 


• Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact 
on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the 
estimate. 
• Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact 
on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change 
the estimate. 



From the literature search, 786 records were retrieved after 
deduplication and 1 unpublished study was obtained from a study 
author. Titles and abstracts of these 787 records were screened 
by two members of the review team independently. After the 
screening, 752 records were discarded and we attempted to obtain 
35 full-text articles for further scrutiny. 15 studies (19 published 
articles) were included and nine studies (13 published articles) 
were excluded for different reasons. There are two trials awaiting 
classification and one ongoing trial. Data extraction of the 15 
studies was done and all 15 studies were included in the meta- 
analysis (Figure 1).

Fifteen studies (Farrell 2003; Herrera 2009; Jeffcoat 2003; López 
2002; López 2005; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 
2009; Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Pirie 
2013; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) were 
included in the review. The details of these studies are reported in 
the Characteristics of included studies section. 

The studies included 7161 pregnant women recruited from prenatal 
care facilities who had either periodontitis (mostly mild) or 
gingivitis. Participants were mostly in their first or second trimester 
except in two studies (Herrera 2009; Radnai 2009) where some 
women in the third trimester of their pregnancy were included. 
Mean gestational age (± standard deviation) of the participants at 
entry was between 14.0 ± 1.5 weeks to 39.6 ± 1.2 weeks in six studies 
(López 2002; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 2009; 
Pirie 2013; Radnai 2009). Seven studies reported gestational age 
ranging from 9 to 34 weeks (Farrell 2003; Herrera 2009; Jeffcoat 
2003; Macones 2010; Oliveira 2011; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 
2007). Two studies reportedly included women at ≤ 22 weeks (López 
2005) and < 22 weeks (Offenbacher 2006) gestation. Mean age of 
participants was reported in all but one study (Farrell 2003) and 
ranged between 22.2 ± 4.3 and 30.5 ± 5.5 years. 
Nine studies reported baseline data on the proportion of 
participants with previous history of various adverse obstetric 
outcomes and it ranged from 3% to 55% (Jeffcoat 2003; López 2002; 
López 2005; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; 
Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009; Pirie 2013). Adverse obstetric 
outcomes previously experienced by participants in these nine 
studies were preterm birth, preterm low birth weight, spontaneous 
abortion and stillbirth. However, there is no indication as to 
whether the estimates also account for participants who had 
experienced multiple adverse obstetric outcomes. In one study 
(Herrera 2009) all the participants had mild pre-eclampsia at 
recruitment stage. None of the studies excluded participants 
on the basis of previous history of adverse obstetric outcomes 
except Radnai 2009. Offenbacher 2009 excluded women with "any 
obstetric finding that precluded enrolment in the study", however, 
these obstetric findings referred to were not clearly stated and 
some participants had a history of preterm delivery. 
Severity of periodontitis ranged from moderate to severe and 
there was variation in definition of periodontitis across the studies. 
Periodontal disease was defined as four or more teeth with one 
or more sites with probing depth of 4 mm or more and clinical 
attachment level as 3 mm or more in three studies (López 2002; 
Oliveira 2011; Sadatmansouri 2006). In two studies (Jeffcoat 2003; 
Offenbacher 2009), periodontal disease was defined as three or 
more sites with attachment level of 3 mm or more. The other 
10 studies had no common definition for periodontal disease 
(Additional Table 2). 

All the included studies were published between 2003 and 
2013. The studies were single-centre (Farrell 2003; Herrera 2009; 
Jeffcoat 2003; López 2002; López 2005; Pirie 2013; Radnai 2009; 
Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) and multicentre (Macones 
2010; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 2006; 
Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011) randomised controlled trials 

(RCTs) conducted in either university hospitals, public hospitals, 
public health clinics, antenatal clinics, maternity hospitals or a 
combination of university and antenatal clinics (for the multicentre 
trials). 
Thirty-three per cent of the studies were conducted in North 
America 
(Jeffcoat 2003; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; 
Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009), 27% in South America 
(Herrera 2009; López 2002; López 2005; Oliveira 2011), 13% in 
Asia (Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007), 20% in Europe (Farrell 
2003; Pirie 2013; Radnai 2009), and 7% in Australia (Newnham 
2009). 
The source of funding was not stated in half of the studies (Farrell 
2003; Herrera 2009; Jeffcoat 2003; López 2005; Macones 2010; 
Newnham 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) while the 
other half were funded by research institutes (Michalowicz 2006; 
Offenbacher 2009), the government (Pirie 2013), scientific research 
fund (López 2002), a university (Oliveira 2011), "institutional 
support" (Radnai 2009), and a manufacturer of oral healthcare 
products (Offenbacher 2006). 

The intervention arm in all the studies included a combination 
of multiple subcomponents (Additional Table 3). Apart from two 
studies (López 2002; Sadatmansouri 2006), none of the studies had 
common intervention subcomponents. The studies were split into 
two comparisons. Eleven studies compared periodontal treatment 
provided during pregnancy with no treatment and four studies did 
a head-to-head comparison of different periodontal treatments. 


(any combination of mechanical 
treatment) versus no treatment (Farrell 2003; Herrera 2009; 
López 2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; 
Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 
2006; Tarannum 2007). 
• Periodontal treatment versus alternative periodontal treatment 
(Jeffcoat 2003; Macones 2010; Offenbacher 2006; Pirie 2013). 
For the head-to-head comparison, the least intensive or complex 
intervention was regarded as the control group or 'alternative 
periodontal treatment'. Participants received between 1 to 5 
periodontal treatment sessions. All studies except Pirie 2013 
indicated that maintenance therapy was provided till delivery 
and this involved chlorhexidine rinse, oral hygiene instructions 
or dental prophylaxis. The studies rarely provided sufficient 
details on the number of sessions, time of treatment and 
maintenance and these intervention regimens varied from study 
to study. Periodontal treatment was administered by periodontists 
in 
(Herrera 2009; Radnai 2009; Tarannum 
2007) and hygienists/therapists in two studies (Macones 2010; 
Offenbacher 2009). Four studies referred to the professionals as 
'clinicians' (Jeffcoat 2003), 'hygienists or periodontists' (Newnham 
2009), 'trained personnel' (Oliveira 2011), and in one study 
participants were examined by periodontists, but it is not 
clear whether periodontists also administered the intervention 
(Offenbacher 2006). Six studies made no reference to the expertise 
of the professional who administered the intervention (Farrell 
2003; López 2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Pirie 2013; 
Sadatmansouri 2006).

All the studies were two-arm trials involving an intervention and 
a control arm except for a three-arm trial (Jeffcoat 2003) which 
compared SRP (scaling and root planing) + placebo versus SRP + 
antimicrobial versus alternative mechanical treatment + placebo. 
The comparisons were divided as follows: 
Fetal deaths were reported in six studies (López 2002; López 
2005; Macones 2010; Oliveira 2011; Pirie 2013; Tarannum 
2007), however, the gestational age of pregnancy loss was 
rarely reported. Neonatal death was reported in three studies 
(Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 2009). 






All the studies had to report at least one obstetric outcome 
to be included in the review. Ten studies (Herrera 2009; López 
2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 
2006; Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Pirie 2013; Sadatmansouri 
2006) also reported periodontal outcomes. Obstetric outcomes not 
specified in our protocol were collated and reported in Additional 
Table 2. Outcomes of interest reported in the studies are as follows. 
• Gestational age - preterm birth < 37 weeks, < 35 weeks and 
< 32 weeks were reported. All 15 studies reported preterm 
birth < 37 weeks. Preterm birth < 35 weeks was reported in 
four studies (Jeffcoat 2003; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; 
Offenbacher 2009) and preterm birth < 32 weeks was reported 
in three studies (Farrell 2003; Michalowicz 2006; Offenbacher 
2009). Gestational age was reported as time-to-event data in 
two studies (Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009) and mean 
gestational age (weeks) was reported in six studies (López 2002; 
López 2005; Newnham 2009; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; 
Tarannum 2007). 
• Birth weight: low birth weight < 2500 g was reported in 
eight studies (López 2002; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; 
Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 
2006; Tarannum 2007) and low birth weight < 1500 g was 
reported in three studies (Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; 
Offenbacher 2009). Mean birth weight was reported in eight 
studies (López 2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 
2009; Offenbacher 2009; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; 
Tarannum 2007). 
• Small for gestational age (10th percentile) was reported in three 
studies (Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 2009). 
• Perinatal mortality (including fetal and neonatal deaths up 
to the first 28 days after birth) was reported in nine studies. 
• Maternal mortality was reported in one study (Michalowicz 2006) 
and data for three other studies (López 2002; López 2005; Radnai 
2009) were provided through personal communication with 
study authors. 
• Pre-eclampsia was reported in three studies (López 2002; 
Michalowicz 2006; Offenbacher 2009), however, one additional 
study (Herrera 2009) which recruited women who already had 
mild pre-eclampsia reported a "progression from mild to severe 
pre-eclampsia" as one of its outcomes. 
• Adverse effects of therapy: there were no adverse effects in 
López 2002; López 2005; Newnham 2009; Radnai 2009 (personal 
communication). 
• Periodontal outcomes: the periodontal outcomes probing 
depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, gingival 
index, and plaque index were reported in 10 studies (Herrera 
2009; López 2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 
2009; Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Pirie 
2013; Sadatmansouri 2006) and reported properly for inclusion 
in a meta-analysis in seven of the 10 studies. 

We excluded nine trials and stated the reasons for exclusion 
(Characteristics of excluded studies table). Studies were excluded 
due to non-randomisation (Gazolla 2007; Geisinger 2014), failure to 
report any obstetric outcome (Pack 1980; Thomson 1982), and the 
inclusion of participants regardless of periodontal status (Moreira 
2014; Weidlich 2013). Two studies seem to have assessed the same 
study populations as those assessed in some included studies and 
lacked additional information to supplement the primary studies 
(Jeffcoat 2011; Penova-Veselinovic 2015). One study assessed a 
single intervention which is not normally used as standalone 
treatment for periodontal disease (Jiang 2016). 

The risk of bias assessment within the included studies and across 
the domains is reported in the Characteristics of included studies 
table and summarised in Figure 2; Figure 3. All included studies 
were at high risk of bias.

The studies were assessed for selection bias based on the adequacy 
of randomisation as well as allocation concealment. Ten studies 
were all at unclear risk of bias and five studies were at low risk of 
bias for this domain (Herrera 2009; Jeffcoat 2003; Macones 2010; 
Michalowicz 2006; Pirie 2013). 
The studies at unclear risk of bias did not provide sufficient 
information on allocation concealment (Farrell 2003; López 2002; 
López 2005; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009; 
Oliveira 2011; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) 
or randomisation (Offenbacher 2006; Oliveira 2011; Sadatmansouri 
2006) or both. 
For the five studies at low risk of selection bias, randomisation 
code was centrally generated by a research pharmacist who 
also provided a double packet with coding information for each 
participant. Allocation was concealed in the second packet and 
was to be revealed only in the event of an emergency (Jeffcoat 
2003). Michalowicz 2006 used permuted randomised blocks made 
available by telephone call to the co-ordinating centre and for 
Macones 2010 permuted block randomisation was accomplished 
centrally. Herrera 2009 reportedly "randomised by block". This 
information was not sufficient but considered adequate given that 
allocation concealment was achieved using "...closed envelopes 
prepared by professionals external to the research group." One 
study (Pirie 2013) avoided selection bias by using computer 
generated allocations which were concealed by labelled opaque 
sealed envelopes. 


There was only one study (Jeffcoat 2003) at low risk of performance 
bias. It was placebo-controlled and code breaking seems to have 
occurred only at the end of the study. All the other studies did 
not state whether blinding was carried out, however, they were 
considered to be at high risk of performance bias as the mechanical 
nature of the interventions made the blinding of the participants 
impossible. 

Nine studies (Farrell 2003; Jeffcoat 2003; López 2002; López 2005; 
Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 
2009; Pirie 2013) clearly indicated that obstetric outcomes were 
assessed blindly or assessed independent of the caregiver. 
Given that obstetric outcomes are likely to have been assessed 
independent of the caregivers (dental professional), we had 
considered marking all studies 'low' for detection bias. However, 
there were concerns regarding whether independent assessment 
was sufficient to prevent detection bias, which led to marking 
the other six studies (Herrera 2009; Offenbacher 2006; Oliveira 
2011; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) with 
insufficient information 'unclear' . 
We were not concerned as to whether periodontal outcomes were 
assessed blindly or not as periodontal outcomes are not the 
primary focus of the review. 
Most of the studies had excluded participants who had experienced 
certain adverse pregnancy outcomes of relevance to this review 
such as eligible or indicated preterm birth (preterm births foreseen 
to occur due to complications), stillbirth and spontaneous abortion 
(pregnancy loss). These data were collected and added to the 
results of this review and the denominators were adjusted 
accordingly. 
Eleven studies judged to be at low risk of bias either reported that 
there was no attrition (Herrera 2009; Pirie 2013; Sadatmansouri 
2006) or had similarly low attrition rates across groups (Jeffcoat 
2003; López 2005; Macones 2010; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 
2009; Oliveira 2011; Radnai 2009; Tarannum 2007). 
Four studies were at high risk of bias due to high attrition rates 
of > 20% (Farrell 2003; Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009) and 
imbalance in attrition rates across groups (López 2002). 

Five studies were judged to be at high risk of reporting bias due to 
failure to report periodontal outcomes (Farrell 2003; Jeffcoat 2003; 
Macones 2010; Radnai 2009) and poor reporting of periodontal 
outcome follow-up data (Tarannum 2007). 
Ten studies were at low risk of reporting bias (Herrera 2009; López 
2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 
2006; Offenbacher 2009; Oliveira 2011; Pirie 2013; Sadatmansouri 
2006). 

Seven studies (Jeffcoat 2003; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; 
Pirie 2013; Radnai 2009; Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) with 
no other apparent source of bias were marked 'low'. Two studies 
reported an imbalance in the number of participants allocated 
to the groups (Farrell 2003), number of nulliparous women and 
alcohol use among participants (Offenbacher 2009) and were both 
marked 'unclear' as there was lack of clarity on whether these 
impacted on the validity of the results. Six studies (Herrera 2009; 
López 2002; López 2005; Macones 2010; Offenbacher 2006; Oliveira 
2011) were at high risk of other bias due to an imbalance in 
participant characteristics across groups.

Preterm birth < 37 weeks was reported in all 11 studies which 
compared periodontal treatment with no treatment. Three studies 
additionally reported on preterm birth < 35 weeks and < 32 weeks 
(Analysis 1.1). There is no clear difference in preterm birth < 37 
weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.10; 
participants = 5671; studies = 11; I2 = 66%) between periodontal 
treatment and no treatment. This is due to low-quality evidence 
downgraded for risk of bias and inconsistency. It is uncertain

whether periodontal treatment leads to a difference in preterm 
birth < 35 weeks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.76; participants = 2557; 
studies = 2; I2 = 0%) and < 32 weeks (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.32; 
participants = 2755; studies = 3; I2 = 0%) because the quality of 
evidence is very low. The evidence was downgraded due to high risk 
of bias and very serious imprecision. 
Some studies had excluded 'indicated preterm' births (preterm 
births foreseen to occur due to complications) from their analyses. 
We decided to include these data in the 'preterm birth' analysis of 
this review. Given that the studies had not specified the gestational 
age (in weeks) when these indicated preterm births had occurred, 
we included them in the < 37 weeks analyses only. Therefore 
the < 35 weeks and < 32 weeks preterm birth results could be 
underestimated. 
Six studies analysing 2573 participants reported on mean 
gestational age in weeks and presented sufficient data for inclusion 
in a meta-analysis. However, the data were not suitable for pooling 
in a meta-analysis due to the skewed nature of the data. Mean 
difference ranged between -0.1 and 1.4 weeks (Additional Table 
4). Two studies (Michalowicz 2006: hazard ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.63 
to 1.37; and Newnham 2009: hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 
1.15) which reported gestational age as time-to-event data both 
show that there is probably no clear difference in gestational age 
at delivery between periodontal treatment and no treatment. The 
evidence was downgraded for serious imprecision due to wide 
confidence intervals. 

Seven studies analysing 3470 participants reported on birth weight 
(low birth weight < 2500 g). Of the seven studies reporting on low 
birth weight < 2500 g, two studies (n = 2550) also reported on 
low birth weight < 1500 g. Periodontal treatment may reduce the 
incidence of low birth weight < 2500 g (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; 
I2 = 59%; Analysis 1.2). We downgraded the evidence from high 
to low as a result of high risk of bias and serious inconsistency. It 
is uncertain whether periodontal treatment leads to a difference 
in low birth weight < 1500 g (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.70; I2 = 
45%; Analysis 1.2) compared to no treatment. The evidence was 
downgraded to very low as a result of high risk of bias in the studies 
and very serious imprecision of the results. 
Eight studies analysing 5120 participants reported on birth weight 
(grams). However, data were not suitable for pooling in a meta- 
analysis due to the skewed nature of the data. Mean difference 
ranged between -52.8 and 476.6 grams (Additional Table 4). 

Three studies analysing 3610 participants reported outcome data 
on small for gestational age. Periodontal treatment may lead to no 
clear difference in births of babies which are small for gestational 
age when compared with no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 
1.16; Analysis 1.3). We used the fixed-effect model and moderate 
heterogeneity was evident (Chi2 = 4.39, degrees of freedom (df) = 2 
(P = 0.11); I2 = 54%). Due to risk of bias and serious inconsistency, 
we downgraded the evidence to low quality. 

Primary outcome 4: perinatal mortality (including fetal and 
neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth) 
Fetal (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths) and neonatal deaths 
were reported in seven studies (n = 5320 participants); only two 
studies reported the exact gestational age at which mortality 
occurred (Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009). It is uncertain 
whether periodontal treatment increases or decreases perinatal 
mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.43; I2 = 21%; Analysis 1.4) 
because the quality of the evidence is very low. The evidence 
was downgraded for very serious limitation and very serious 
imprecision. 

Four studies (López 2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Radnai 
2009) reported 0% maternal mortality rate. 

Three studies analysing 2946 participants reported on pre- 
eclampsia. It is uncertain whether periodontal treatment results in 
a difference in pre-eclampsia when compared to no treatment (RR 
1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62) because the quality of evidence is very low. 
We used the random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed 
as not important (Chi2 = 2.72, df = 2 (P = 0.26); I2 = 27%; Analysis 
1.5). The evidence was downgraded due to high risk of bias and 
very serious imprecision. An additional study which evaluated 60 
participants that had mild pre-eclampsia reported on progression 
to severe pre-eclampsia. Due to the quality of evidence (very low), 
it is uncertain whether periodontal treatment results in a difference 
in severe pre-eclampsia when compared to no treatment (RR 1.21, 
95% CI 0.77 to 1.92; very low quality - downgraded for high risk of 
bias and very serious imprecision). 

There were no adverse effects (0%) in four studies (López 2002; 
López 2005; Newnham 2009; Radnai 2009). 

Periodontal outcomes reported in the studies were probing 
depth, bleeding on probing, plaque index, and clinical attachment 
level. All the studies reported baseline and final scores except 
Offenbacher 2009 which reported mean change score. This study 
was included in the meta-analysis as a subgroup. All four 
periodontal indices showed a reduction in favour of periodontal 
treatment. However due to considerable heterogeneity (91% to 
100%), the results were not meta-analysed (Analysis 1.6; Analysis 
1.7; Analysis 1.8; Analysis 1.9). 
Periodontal indices were also reported in seven studies (López 
2002; López 2005; Michalowicz 2006; Newnham 2009; Offenbacher 
2009; Oliveira 2011; Sadatmansouri 2006) in various measures 
that could not be incorporated into a meta-analysis. Periodontal 
measures were improved in women who underwent periodontal 
treatment compared to no treatment in all the studies and all the 
outcome measures reported. These results are reported in detail in 
additional tables (Additional Table 5). 
Comparison 2: periodontal treatment versus alternative 
periodontal treatment 
For gestational age (preterm birth < 37 weeks and preterm birth 
< 35 weeks), we had three subcomparisons: SRP (scaling and

root planing) versus alternative mechanical treatment; SRP + 
antimicrobial versus SRP + placebo; and SRP + antimicrobial versus 
alternative mechanical treatment + placebo. We did not pool the 
data due to clinical heterogeneity. 

Preterm births < 37 weeks and < 35 weeks were reported in four 
studies. For all three subcomparisons made, it is uncertain whether 
there is a difference between periodontal treatment and alternative 
periodontal treatment in preterm birth < 37 weeks (Analysis 2.1) 
except for SRP + antimicrobials which may increase preterm births 
< 37 weeks compared to SRP + placebo (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.15 to 8.20; 
participants = 243; studies = 1). With the results there is very low 
certainty due to very serious imprecision and high risk of bias. 
• SRP versus alternative mechanical treatment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 
0.46 to 1.67; participants = 1168; studies = 4; I2 = 61%; very low 
quality). 
• SRP + antimicrobial versus alternative mechanical treatment + 
placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.92; participants = 243; studies 
= 1; very low quality). 
None of the subcomparisons showed a difference in preterm births 
< 35 weeks (Analysis 2.2) and the quality of evidence was similarly 
very low in all cases. 


• SRP + antimicrobial versus SRP + placebo. 
• SRP + antimicrobial versus alternative mechanical treatment + 

Mean gestational age (weeks) was reported in only two studies 
which analysed 855 participants. Mean gestational age ranged 
between -0.6 and -0.2 weeks (Additional Table 6). 

One study (Macones 2010) with 756 participants reported on low 
birth weight < 2500 g and < 1500 g. It is uncertain whether there is 
a difference in low birth weight < 2500 g (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.92 to 
2.09; participants = 756; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.3) and low birth weight 
< 1500 g (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.96; participants = 756; I2 = 0%; 
Analysis 2.3) between the periodontal treatments. In both cases we 
downgraded the evidence three levels to very low due to high risk 
of bias and very serious imprecision. 
One study (Pirie 2013) analysing 99 participants reported on mean 
birth weight (kilograms). The study reported a mean difference 
in birth weight between groups of -0.07 kilograms. An additional 
study (Macones 2010) analysing 756 participants reported on mean 
birth weight (grams). The study reported a difference in mean birth 
weight of -67.7 grams (Additional Table 6). 


Primary outcome 4: perinatal mortality (including fetal and 
neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth) 
This outcome was reported in two studies (n = 855 participants). 
It is uncertain whether there is a difference in perinatal mortality 
between the periodontal treatments (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.85; I2 

= 0%; Analysis 2.4). The evidence was downgraded to low as result 
of high risk of bias and very serious imprecision. 







Periodontal 
indices reported were probing depth, clinical 
attachment level, bleeding on probing and gingival index. SRP 
may slightly improve probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding on 
probing and gingival index (Analysis 2.5; Analysis 2.6; Analysis 2.7; 
Analysis 2.8). 








Periodontal indices were also reported in two studies (Offenbacher 
2006; Pirie 2013) 
in various measures that could not be 
incorporated in the meta-analysis. Offenbacher 2006 showed that 
SRP resulted in a reduction in plaque index and on the other 
hand an increase in extent of probing depth ≥ 4 mm (mean ± 
standard error) compared to the alternative periodontal treatment. 
Pirie 2013 made no comparison between the two groups rather it 
compared baseline and postintervention results in the SRP group 
which was not as important for this review. These results are 
reported in detail in additional tables (Additional Table 5). 


The main results of the primary outcomes are summarised in 
Summary of findings for the main comparison. Fifteen randomised 
controlled trials provided sufficient data for inclusion in the meta- 
analysis. The trials were grouped under two broad comparisons: 
periodontal treatment versus no treatment; periodontal treatment 
versus alternative periodontal treatment. 
• Eleven studies compared periodontal treatment and no 
treatment. There is no evidence of a difference in preterm birth 
< 37 weeks. 
• Periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight (< 2500 g) 
(33% reduction) in pregnant women. The quality of evidence is 
low. The broader literature suggests that most low birth weights 
in high-income countries are related to preterm births, however, 
this is unexpectedly not reflected in the results of this review 
(WHO 2012).

• For primary outcomes small for gestational age and pre- 
eclampsia there is no clear difference between periodontal 
treatment and no treatment. 
• It is not clear if there is a difference in perinatal mortality 
outcomes (including fetal and neonatal deaths up to the first 28 
days after birth) when periodontal treatment is compared with 
no treatment. 


• There were four studies comparing periodontal treatment with 
alternative periodontal treatment and it is uncertain whether 
there is a difference in adverse birth outcomes when periodontal 
treatments are compared. Periodontal data for this comparison 
were not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity. 
We were unable to pool data on mean gestational age (weeks), 
mean birth weight (grams/kilograms) and periodontal data due to 
the skewness of the data. 

The studies recruited pregnant women who had different severities 
of periodontal disease ranging from mild to severe (mostly mild). 
The participants were women at various stages of pregnancy, 
different ages, ethnicity and socioeconomic status except two 
studies (Sadatmansouri 2006; Tarannum 2007) which made 
no reference to ethnicity. There was variation in periodontal 
treatment procedures across studies. This correctly reflects current 
disagreements in clinical practice with regards to periodontal 
treatment planning (John 2013). The review compares the effect 
of periodontal treatment versus no treatment and goes further 
to compare different periodontal treatments. All but one study 
(Jeffcoat 2003) assessed a combination of mechanical treatments 
compared to no treatment or in a head-to-head comparison. The 
different interventions assessed cover the range of periodontal 
treatments that would be given to pregnant women in practice 
making the results generalisable. All the primary and secondary 
outcomes were mostly reported. Maternal mortality and adverse 
effects of the therapy were rarely reported and did not occur in 
any of the studies that reported them (personal communication 
with trial authors). Both outcomes may not have been reported 
due to the fact that no events occurred. Five studies (Farrell 
2003; Jeffcoat 2003; Macones 2010; Radnai 2009; Tarannum 2007) 
failed to report outcome data on periodontal health. We are 

aware of the fact that the efficacy of periodontal treatment on 
periodontal health is the basis of its theoretical effect on obstetric 
outcomes, therefore the absence of periodontal outcome data 
in the previously mentioned studies puts any potential benefits 
on obstetric outcomes in doubt. We also acknowledge that the 
Hawthorne effect (McCambridge 2014) may have resulted in an 
overestimation of the results by improving participant behaviour 
in response to their awareness of being part of the trial. This 
review covers a wide range of participants which would make 
the evidence applicable to similar population in low and middle- 
income countries except that standard antenatal care in these 
settings may not include an oral health component. 

The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low. This was due 
to high risk of bias, serious imprecision and serious inconsistency. 
All included studies were at high risk of bias due to the lack of 
blinding of participants in 13 studies (93%), imbalance in baseline 
characteristics in seven studies (46%), failure to report periodontal 
data at follow-up in four studies (26%) and attrition in four studies 
(26%). Imprecision was mostly due to very low number of events 
and for rare outcomes with insufficient sample sizes. 
For the main comparison (periodontal treatment versus no 
treatment), effect estimates were mostly inconsistent across 
studies. Therefore we downgraded once 
for moderate to 
substantial heterogeneity. Heterogeneity may have resulted 
from variations in the average risk of the outcome events in 
participants. Clinical heterogeneity due to differences in severities 
of periodontitis, gestational age and history of preterm birth was 
evident. The baseline risk of adverse birth outcomes is an aggregate 
measure of case-mix factors such as age, severity of periodontitis, 
previous history of adverse birth outcomes and participants' 
potential to benefit from an intervention would depend largely 
on their risk status. Periodontal treatment also varied greatly with 
studies including different combinations of interventions as part of 
a care package (Additional Table 3). 
The evidence is relevant to the review question and was not 
downgraded for indirectness. We generated a funnel plot (Figure 
4), however, due to the small number of studies we were unable to 
draw any meaningful conclusion on asymmetry. Since we had taken 
other measures to prevent publication bias, the evidence was not 
downgraded for it.

effect size change significantly. Therefore this was not considered 
a source of bias. Before the data synthesis, we assessed studies 
to assess whether there was sufficient homogeneity. Attempts 
to contact a study author (Macones 2010) that did not report 
standard deviation of birth weight were unsuccessful. This may 
have introduced reporting bias, however, bias was prevented by 
including the study results as a narrative summary. The studies 
were not assessed for periodontal outcome detection bias because 
periodontal outcomes were not the main focus of the review. Birth 
weight and perinatal mortality were not defined at the protocol 
stage. We acknowledge that the data analyses for these outcomes 
were mostly determined by the reporting in individual studies. 
We considered splitting outcome data on perinatal mortality into 
miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal mortality. Given that it was not 
in the original protocol to split these outcome data, this would 
have resulted in bias (it should be noted that only two studies 
reported data for gestational age at which mortality occurred). 
Three studies (López 2002; López 2005; Tarannum 2007) involved 
ongoing periodontal care, plaque control, and reinforcement of 
oral hygiene instructions throughout pregnancy while other studies 
involved periodontal therapy that occurred as a one-time (or 
over several appointments) event. There could be implications for 
reduction of inflammation that accompany ongoing therapy which 
may have implications for pregnancy outcomes. However, we did 
not assess whether duration of treatment influenced the results in 
a subgroup analysis. We intend to investigate this in future updates. 
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment had previously 
been carried out by a different set of review authors. To 
ensure consistency and avoid bias, Zipporah Iheozor-Ejiofor and 
Anne-Marie Glenny arbitrated the ratings. Studies not reporting 
pregnancy outcomes were excluded from the review. Studies would 
not normally be excluded on the basis of outcome (Higgins 2011). 
However, given that the primary aim of the review was to assess 
the efficacy of periodontal treatment in preventing adverse birth 
outcomes, the inclusion of studies that did not assess obstetric 
outcomes would have detracted from the focus of the review. 
Less than half of the included studies provided contact details 
of authors and most of the emails provided were not valid at 
the time we attempted to contact the authors. Only three study 
authors replied to our request for additional information. Therefore 
it was neither possible to obtain missing information nor clarify 
partially reported information from most of the study authors. 
One of the 15 included studies was not published and study 
data were retrieved from the author via email correspondence. 
The inclusion of this study meant that some study information 
remained unclear as we could only get partial information from 
one of the researchers before the research group was dissolved. 
This would have introduced reporting bias, however, we carried 
out a sensitivity analysis by removing this trial from the meta- 
analyses and this did not change the direction of effect nor did the

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or 
reviews 
We identified some previously published reviews that had aimed 
to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on adverse birth 
outcomes. These reviews used widely similar methodology with 
variations in study selection, choice of outcome and data analysis. 
We carried out two meta-analyses to compare periodontal 
treatment versus no treatment and periodontal treatment versus 
alternative periodontal treatment. Contrary to our approach all 
the published systematic reviews we identified combined all their 
studies in a single meta-analysis irrespective of study comparison. 
The three reviews (Fogacci 2011; Polyzos 2010; Schwendicke 
2015) we identified assessed the effect of periodontal treatment 
on preterm birth < 37 weeks of gestation, low birth weight 
and spontaneous abortion/stillbirths (perinatal mortality) and 
all concluded that periodontal treatment did not confer any 
advantage in pregnant women with periodontitis. 
Fogacci 2011 had evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on 
preterm birth and low birth weight. The results on preterm birth 
are in agreement with the results of our review. The authors had 
controlled for a number of confounding factors by carrying out 
separate meta-analyses. Obtaining similar results from a review 
with consistent results reinforces the validity of our findings. 
Another review published in 2010 (Polyzos 2010) had evaluated 
12 of the 14 studies included in this review. The review differed 
from our review in that it excluded participants whose pregnancies 
resulted in spontaneous abortions or stillbirths. These outcomes 
were considered important in our review and were extracted from 
the individual studies if the information was reported. For Polyzos 
2010, 'high' quality trials and 'low' quality trials were analysed 
separately for preterm birth < 37 weeks and low birth weight. Low 
quality trials, unlike the high quality trials, showed statistically 
significant results in favour of periodontal treatment. However, 
there are uncertainties regarding the validity of the overall risk 
of bias assessment. There was only one assessment for blinding 
but it is not clear whether this assessment was for performance 
bias, detection bias or both. Again, contrary to our risk of bias 
assessment, Polyzos 2010 had assessed all studies including López 
2002; Offenbacher 2006; Offenbacher 2009, which we had assessed 
as high risk, as being at low risk of attrition bias. Schwendicke 2015 
stratified the results using arbitrary cut-offs categorising studies 
based on high (≥ 20% for preterm birth, ≥ 20% for low birth 
weight, ≥ 1% for perinatal mortality) or moderate (< 20% preterm 
birth, < 20% low birth weight, < 1% for perinatal mortality) control 
group event proportions. Overall the combined results ('high' + 
'low' quality in Polyzos 2010; high + moderate control group event 
proportions in Schwendicke 2015) of all the trials for preterm 
birth < 37weeks of gestation and spontaneous abortions/stillbirths 
reported in Polyzos 2010 and Schwendicke 2015 are in agreement 
with our review. Our review found that periodontal treatment may 
reduce low birth weight, however, this finding is in disagreement 
with all three systematic reviews. This variation might have resulted 
from the reviews combining studies that compared periodontal 

treatment versus no treatment together with those that did a 
head-to-head comparison between periodontal treatment and 
alternative periodontal treatment, thereby shifting the results 
towards no effect. 


The impact of periodontal treatment on preterm birth is unclear. 
The quality of evidence was low. There is low-quality evidence 
that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight compared 
to no treatment. The GRADE meaning of 'low-certainty evidence' 
is that "our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true 
effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the 
effect." Additionally, "further research is very likely to have an 
important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and 
is likely to change the estimate." There is no evidence of effect on 
small for gestational age. It remains unclear whether periodontal 
treatment leads to a difference in perinatal mortality (including 
fetal and neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth), and pre- 
eclampsia in pregnant women with periodontal disease; the quality 
of evidence is very low. 
There is insufficient evidence to determine which periodontal 
treatment during pregnancy is better in preventing adverse birth 
outcomes. 

Considering 
the complexity and multifactorial nature of 
periodontal disease, future research should identify and target 
interventions at specific populations based on severity, ethnicity 
or socioeconomic status and also aim to administer treatment 
no later than the first trimester to increase the likelihood of 
success. Studies should fully report on periodontal outcomes 
alongside obstetric outcomes given that the benefits of periodontal 
treatment on obstetric outcomes are predicated on their efficacy. 
There was variation in diagnosis, measurement, treatment and 
reporting across the trials. Periodontal status was defined based on 
continuous variables such as probing depth, attachment loss and 
bleeding on probing. These measures have been criticised for not 
fully reflecting periodontal status where there is a low extent of the 
disease (Sanz 2013). Concerns have also been raised about the lack 
of consensus on periodontal treatment planning (John 2013). There 
is need for consensus on case definition of periodontitis and more 
standardised reporting of periodontal and perinatal outcomes.

A) Antenatal periodontal treatment - SRP + placebo capsule (n = 123): scaling and root planing was 
performed according to usual clinical procedures and clinicians were instructed to spend as much time 
and as many visits as needed 
B) Antenatal periodontal treatment - SRP + metronidazole capsule (n = 120): metronidazole was 
taken 250 mg 3 times a day for 1 week. Scaling and root planing was performed according to usual clin- 
ical procedures and clinicians were instructed to spend as much time and as many visits as needed 
C) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Dental prophylaxis + placebo capsule (n = 123): tooth cleaning 
and polish (supragingival scaling and rubber cup polish) + placebo capsule 3 times daily 
All women: received oral hygiene instructions from a dental hygienist and supplies of toothbrushes, 
dental floss and fluoride toothpaste 
Dental hygienists carried out examinations at baseline supervised by periodontists. SRP was adminis-

Intention-to-treat analysis was applied and the prevalence of preterm birth calculated for each of the 3 
randomised treatment groups 

Stratification by BMI (< 19.8 versus ≥ 19.8); presence of bacterial vaginosis as assessed by Gram stain; 
previous spontaneous birth prior to 35 weeks gestation

Inclusion criteria: healthy pregnant women with periodontal disease (≥ 4 teeth with ≥ 1 sites with PD ≥ 
4 mm and with CAL ≥ 3 mm at the same site) randomised, aged 18 to 35 years, singleton pregnancy, be- 
tween 9 and 21 weeks gestation; with fewer than 18 natural teeth 
Exclusion criteria: history of congenital heart disease requiring prophylactic antibiotics for invasive 
procedures, existing diabetes before pregnancy, current use of corticosteroids, chronic renal disease, 
and the intention to give birth at another hospital 

Mean gestational age (± standard deviation (weeks)): Group A = 39.6 ± 1.2; Group B = 39 ± 2 (P = 
0.002) 


Number evaluated: n = 351 (attrition n = 49: loss to follow-up n = 10, discontinuation of treatment n = 
18, spontaneous abortion n = 14, indicated preterm delivery n = 7) 
1) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 200): plaque control instructions, scaling and root plan- 
ing performed under local anaesthesia, each woman was instructed to rinse once a day with 0.12% 
chlorhexidine; periodontal therapy was completed before 28 weeks gestation and maintenance thera- 
py was provided every 2 to 3 weeks until birth 
2) Postnatal periodontal treatment (n = 200): monitoring every 4 to 6 weeks during pregnancy and 
treatment after birth 
All women: at study entry, all women received a full-mouth periodontal examination and the following 
were determined: oral hygiene status, gingival inflammation, probing depth, clinical attachment lev- 
el. Periodontal examination was given after 28 weeks of gestation. Carious lesions were treated and all 
teeth indicated for extraction were extracted from both groups 

Preterm birth < 37 weeks; low birth weight < 2500 g; preterm low birth weight; number of teeth after 28 
weeks gestational age; % of sites with plaque; bleeding on probing; redness; probing depth, clinical at- 
tachment loss; after 28 weeks gestational age

It was believed that 280 women in each group might detect a significant difference of preterm low birth 
weight between groups with a power of 80%. Data to determine the odds ratios for preterm birth, low 
birth weight and preterm low birth weight were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. 29 women in 
the treatment group had severe aggressive periodontitis and were given metronidazole and amoxicillin 
(3 times daily) for 7 days in addition to mechanical treatment

Antibiotics were always prescribed in women with severe periodontitis after they had completed at 
least 16 weeks of gestation

Quote: "Randomization was done equalizing periodontal disease as the rele- 
vant variable and probing depth was selected as the variable describing pe- 
riodontal disease. Patients were assigned to 1 of 2 categories: those with a 
mean probing depth < 2.5 mm and those with a mean probing depth ≥ 2.5 mm. 
Patients were matched on the basis of the mean probing depth. Each patient 
of the matched pair was allocated to the treatment or the control group by a 
coin toss"

Labour and delivery management decisions were made by personnel who had 
no knowledge that the patients were participating a research study. The obste- 
trician who reviewed records of patients with preterm or low birth weight was 
masked from the mother's periodontal data 
24/200 (12%) of women in the intervention group were lost to follow-up (n = 6) 
or withdrew (n = 18); 4/200 (2%) in the control group were lost to follow-up

The trial was stopped early due to benefit (preterm low birth weight) - 400 
women recruited from target sample size of 580, statistically significant differ- 
ence in maternal and gestational age between groups 







Inclusion criteria: healthy pregnant women with gingivitis aged 18 to 42; single gestation; ≤ 22 weeks

Number evaluated: n = 834 (attrition n = 36: loss to follow-up n = 5, withdrawal from treatment and 
study n = 9, spontaneous abortion n = 10, preterm delivery n = 11, stillbirth n = 1) 

A) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 580): plaque control instructions (toothbrushes and 
mouthrinse daily), supra and subgingival scaling, and crown polishing before 28 weeks of gestation + 
maintenance therapy (oral hygiene instruction and supragingival plaque removal by instrumentation) 
every 2 to 3 weeks until delivery 



Preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestational age with birth weight < 2500 g following spontaneous labour 
and/or rupture of the membranes, regardless of route of delivery); low birth weight; gestational age; in- 
fant birth weight; plaque; bleeding on probing; probing depth; clinical attachment loss 

290 women were required to detect a significant difference of preterm/low birth weight between 
groups with 80%. To increase statistical power a 2:1 allocation of participants to the treatment and 
control groups was adopted. Intention-to-treat principle was applied

Setting: Periodontal Infections and Prematurity Study (PIPS), a multicentre trial, was conducted in 3 
antenatal clinics in metropolitan Philadelphia, USA 


Inclusion criteria: women between 6 and 20 weeks gestation with periodontal disease who returned 
for the scheduled treatment visit 
Exclusion criteria: periodontal treatment during pregnancy, antibiotic use within 2 weeks; use of an- 
timicrobial mouthwash within 2 weeks, multiple gestation, and known mitral valve prolapse 



Periodontal characteristics: periodontal disease was defined as attachment loss ≥ 3 mm on ≥ 3 teeth. 
Moderate/severe - Group A = 54.8, Group B = 55.3 (P = 0.9) 




B) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Superficial tooth cleaning procedure (n = 380): superfi- 
cial tooth cleaning procedure involved using the rotating cup to remove stains and plaque from the 
supragingival portion of the tooth using minimally abrasive polishing past. No sharp instruments were 
used for the subgingival removal of calculus 

Spontaneous preterm birth (occurring < 35 weeks of gestation because of either idiopathic preterm 
labour or from preterm premature rupture of the amniotic membranes); < 37 weeks of gestational age, 
< 35 weeks gestational age; gestational age at delivery; birth weight; neonatal adverse outcomes (res- 
piratory distress syndrome, chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, grade III/IV intraventricular 
haemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, death), stillbirth, miscarriage 

For a prevalence of preterm birth at < 35 weeks of gestation of 7%, it was estimated that 636 partici- 
pants would be needed per treatment group and the goal was to recruit 700 subjects per treatment 
group. However, because of temporal restraints that were mandated by the mechanism of funding, en- 
rolment stopped after 3 years of recruitment, which was well before the target sample size was reached

Setting: the Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) Study, a multicentre trial, was conducted in 
Hennepin County Medical Centre (Minnesota), the University of Kentucky, the University of Mississippi 
Medical Center and Harlem Hospital (New York) 


Inclusion criteria: at least 16 years of age, less than 16 weeks 6 days gestation, at least 20 natural 
teeth, and the presence of periodontal disease (4 or more teeth with a probing depth of at least 4 mm 
and a clinical attachment loss of at least 2 mm, as well as bleeding on probing at 35% or more of tooth 
sites) 
Exclusion criteria: multiple pregnancy, required antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal procedures, 
medical condition that precluded elective dental treatment, had extensive tooth decay, or likely to 
have fewer than 20 teeth after treatment of moderate to severe caries, abscesses or other non-peri- 
odontal pathoses. Baseline assessments were conducted between 13 weeks 0 days and 16 weeks 6 
days gestation

Periodontal characteristics: tooth sites with probing depth ≥ 4 mm - Group A = 26.5 ± 16.6, Group B = 
24.8 ± 15.9 (P = 0.13). Most women were judged to have generalised early-moderate periodontitis 

Number evaluated: n = 823 (for gestational age); (attrition n = 11: lost to follow-up n = 7, withdrawal n 
= 2, elective abortion n = 2) 

A) Antenatal periodontal treatment; before 21 weeks gestation (n = 413): scaling and root planing un- 
til birth; removal of dental plaque and calculus from the tooth enamel and root (up to 4 treatment vis- 
its were allowed); instruction in oral hygiene, monthly tooth polishing and reinstruction in oral hygiene 
(actual treatment time = mean 127.7 minutes and 2.0 visits) 
B) Postnatal periodontal therapy (n = 410): brief oral examination at monthly follow-ups; attended 
the same number of visits as the treatment in pregnancy group; periodontal therapy after birth 
All women: topical or systemic antimicrobials were not used; at study entry, all women were screened 
for periodontal disease in the obstetric clinic (assessed attachment loss, probing depth, bleeding on 
probing on 6 sites on each tooth, evaluation of dental plaque and calculus on selected teeth). Women 
were referred to a dentist for treatment of teeth that were abscessed, fractured or likely to become 
symptomatic during the study. Full-mouth assessments were repeated at 21 to 24 weeks gestation and 
again at 29 to 32 weeks gestation 
Over half the women (59%) were judged to need essential dental care (239 (61%) in the treatment 
group and 244 (57%) in the control group) and 73% of these women (74% in the treatment group and 
71% in the control group) completed the recommended treatment. Control women with progressive 
periodontitis at 6 or more sites were offered full-mouth scaling and root planing. Treatment group par- 
ticipants with progressive disease at 6 or more tooth sites were referred to a consulting periodontist 
and could receive a second course of full-mouth scaling and root planing and/or systemic antibiotics, 
or subgingival irrigation with antimicrobial solutions 

Periodontitis progression (increase in clinical attachment loss from baseline of at least 3 mm); birth 
weight; gestational age at birth; labour induced before 37 weeks (due to hypertension, diabetes or pre- 
eclampsia); spontaneous abortion (loss before 20 weeks); stillbirth (loss from 20 weeks to 36 weeks and 
6 days); maternal death; bacteria from subgingival plaque sampled at 29 to 32 weeks gestation; child 
neurodevelopment 

Calculations showed that 405 patients per group would be required to show statistical significance 
with a power of 90% for gestational age

in the control group received monthly follow-ups and 407 and 405 women re- 
spectively, were included in the gestational age analysis (99% of women over- 
all). During pregnancy, 6 women in the treatment group withdrew (4 were lost 
to follow-up, 1 withdrew consent and 1 had an elective abortion). In the con- 
trol group 5 women withdrew (3 were lost to follow-up, 1 withdrew consent

Inclusion criteria: > 16 years of age; absence of maternal cardiac disease that would warrant the need 
for antibiotics for periodontal examination or treatment; not already received periodontal treatment 
during the current pregnancy; ≥ 20 natural teeth; single pregnancy of > 12 and < 20 weeks gestational 
age; did not have any known fetal anomalies or other risk factors such as hydramnios that would place 
the pregnancy at imminent risk of complications; able to attend regularly for periodontal treatment if 
required

3 occasions at weekly intervals commencing around 20 weeks of gestation.Those women in whom the 
treatment had not been successful (19.6%) were offered a further 3-week treatment regimen. In addi- 
tion to the baseline and 28-week examinations, examinations were also carried out at 32 and 36 weeks 
gestation 
B) Postnatal periodontal treatment (n = 540): periodontal care after birth commencing 6 weeks after 
delivery 
All women: examinations were carried out at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment (28 weeks gesta- 
tional age) in both groups 

Preterm birth; stillbirth; neonatal death; gestational age; onset of labour; birth weight; sepsis necessi- 
tating antibiotics; birth weight less than 10th percentile; sites with probing depth > 4 mm 

A sample size of 1082 women was required to detect a reduction in the preterm birth rate with 80% 
power. However the independent data safety monitoring committee recommended proceeding with- 
out an interim analysis after data on treatment safety and pregnancy outcomes from the trial conduct- 
ed by Michalowicz 2006 were published. Primary data analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat 
principle, however, the per-protocol analysis showed similar results as the intention-to-treat analysis

Inclusion criteria: initially pregnant women with a history of a previous preterm/low birth weight 
birth, but this was subsequently dropped due to very low eligibility rates. Pregnant women < 22 weeks 
gestation ≥ 18 years of age at time of scaling and root planing or supragingival polish, 2 or more sites 
measuring ≥ 5 mm probing depths plus periodontal attachment loss of 1 to 2 mm at 1 or more sites 
with probing depths ≥ 5 mm; ≥ 20 teeth 
Exclusion criteria: multiple births, a positive history of HIV, AIDS, diabetes (gestational diabetes was 
acceptable), any medical contraindication to periodontal probing (e.g. congenital heart disease), and 
use of phentermine and fenfluramine (phen-fen) for weight loss; currently undergoing periodontal 
treatment, chronic regimen of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chronic use of med- 
ications that cause gingival enlargement such as phenytoin, cyclosporin-A, or calcium channel antago- 
nists, 5 or more teeth requiring extraction, rampant decay or any other oral condition that, in the clini- 
cian's judgement, would place the woman at unacceptable risk if treatment was delayed, prescribed or 
using chlorhexidine or other mouthrinses with known antiplaque or anti-inflammatory effects 






A) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Scaling and root planing and polishing + oral health instruc-

Before randomisation, women could receive limited dental care to reduce the likelihood of an acute 
infectious event during pregnancy including the extraction of hopeless teeth and restoration of pulp- 
threatening caries. Sample size determination used data from the University of Alabama pilot trial and 
estimated a preterm (gestational age < 35 weeks) birth rate of 6% in the delayed periodontal therapy 
group compared with 2% in the periodontal therapy group. A sample size of 900 per treatment group 
would provide power of 91%, however, the primary outcome was changed due to advice from the mon- 
itoring board without change of sample size

Inclusion criteria: women with initial localised chronic periodontitis, and hospitalised due to threat- 
ening preterm birth, otherwise healthy with a singleton pregnancy 
Exclusion criteria: women with any systemic medical problem, multiple pregnancy, history of previ- 
ous preterm birth or miscarriage, smokers, high consumption of alcohol, drug use, malnourished or 
women requiring antibiotics for invasive procedures 

Mean gestational age (± standard deviation (weeks)): Group A = 31.63 ± 2.6, Group B = 31.45 ± 2.8 (P 
= 0.822) 

Periodontitis: it was defined as ≥ 4 mm probing depth, at least 1 site, and bleeding on probing for ≥ 
50% of teeth 



A) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 43 (41)): treatment around 32 weeks gestational age (oral hy- 
giene instruction), supra and subgingival scaling with hand instruments and/or ultrasonic scaler, teeth 
polishing with a fluoride paste. The women were examined and treated by a periodontist 








Power calculation was performed which related birth weight assessment and time of gestation. Assum- 
ing a 500 g birth weight difference at a 95% test power for a 2-sample t-test, n = 39 was the necessary 
minimum case number. To show a 2-week difference in delivery time, at 2.5 standard deviation and 
95% power, the desired minimum sample size was n = 42

Inclusion criteria: pregnant women 18-35 years of age, with moderate or advanced periodontitis, in 
13th to 20th week of pregnancy 
Exclusion criteria: women with a history of congenital heart disease requiring prophylactic antibiotics, 
diabetes, current use of corticosteroids, chronic renal disease, or with fetal congenital abnormality 
(evaluated by ultrasound until 20th week), obstetric disorders such as gestational diabetes, placenta 
previa, pre-eclampsia eclampsia and polyhydramnios 
Periodontal disease: it was defined as women with at least 4 teeth, with at least 1 site of pocket depth 
of at least 4 mm, and clinical attachment loss of at least 3 mm 






A) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 15): first phase - ultrasonic scaling and hand instrument root 
planing under local anaesthesia using lidocaine or mepivastesin, if needed; maintenance phase - oral 
hygiene instructions, use of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinse once a night for 1 week, and periodontal 
evaluation every fortnight before birth. No information on the expertise of the dental professional who 
administered intervention 

All women: repeated periodontal examination: 28th week of pregnancy for the control group and 2nd 
week after treatment in the intervention group (during the 30th week)

Number evaluated: n = 188 (attrition n = 32: loss to follow-up n = 16, spontaneous abortions n = 4, did 
not receive allocated intervention n = 12) 
A) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 120): plaque control instructions (rinsing twice daily with 
0.2% chlorhexidine until periodontal therapy was completed) + scaling and root planing performed un- 
der local anaesthesia. Full-mouth scaling and root planing was performed over 4 to 5 appointments, 
with a 1 week interval between appointments. Periondontal therapy was completed before 28 weeks 
gestation and maintenance therapy was provided (oral prophylaxis and reinforcement of oral hygiene 
instructions every 3 to 4 weeks until birth). Treatment was provided by a periodontist 
B) Control - Plaque control (brushing) instructions only + checkups at 4 to 5-week intervals (n = 
100) 
All women: full-mouth periodontal examination, including oral hygiene index (simplified); bleeding in- 
dex, and clinical attachment level 







The authors claim to have undertaken intention-to-treat analysis involving all of the subjects regard- 
less of whether they underwent the prescribed treatment, however, this is not reflected in the 'num-

The control group consisted of women who refused to participate and were classed as the 'non- 
treated' group. There was no randomisation 





Overlap with an included study (Jeffcoat 2003) and does not contain useful additional information 
to supplement the primary publication 
The study compared antimicrobial mouthrinse with toothbrushing. Antimicrobial mouthrinse 
alone is not considered a periodontal treatment, however, it can be used as an adjunct to a me- 
chanical periodontal treatment 
Population consisted of a subsample of participants included in a study (Weidlich 2013) which was 
excluded for the wrong study population. There is lack of clarity on whether the concerns we had 
about the primary study were addressed in this study and obstetric outcomes were not reported 
















34 pregnant women aged between 15 and 43 years who had at least 4 teeth with probing depth ≥ 4 
mm or clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm, with bleeding on probing in the same place 
Group 1 received supra and subgingival scaling associated with oral hygiene orientation (OHO) and 
Group 2 received only supragingival scaling with OHO 
Probing depth, clinical attachment level, hyperplasia, recession, bleeding, presence of plaque 
and tooth mobility on a standardized form. Quantitative parameters were evaluated at 6 sites per 
tooth: mesio/medium/distobuccal and mesio/medium/distolingual through millimetre periodontal 
probe-type Williams. The bleeding and the presence of plaque in dichotomous variables were mea- 
sured: present and absent. All patients received oral hygiene orientation

The production of Cochrane Oral Health reviews has been supported financially by our Global Alliance since 2011 
(oralhealth.cochrane.org/partnerships-alliances). Contributors over the past year have been the American Association of Public Health 
Dentistry, USA; the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry, UK; the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry, UK; the 
Canadian Dental Hygienists Association, Canada; the Centre for Dental Education and Research at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, 
India; the National Center for Dental Hygiene Research & Practice, USA; New York University College of Dentistry, USA; and NHS 
Education for Scotland, UK. 

Adverse effects of the therapy were previously considered a secondary outcome, however, due to their importance they were eventually 
listed as a primary outcome. 
We planned to report different measures of gestational age and birth weight. Mean gestational age (weeks) and mean birth weight (grams/ 
kilograms) were reported, however, the rarity of the outcomes and skewness of data precluded our pooling these data. We did not present 
these outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables. 

At protocol stage we stated our intention to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. We decided to generate a 'Summary 
of findings' table for the main comparison alone (periodontal treatment versus no treatment). 
We planned to report preterm birth < 34 weeks and < 28 weeks. Eventually we used the cut-offs that were reported in the included studies 
(preterm birth < 35 and < 32 weeks). 
Following editorial comments, we changed the 'Types of interventions' section to: "Treatment during pregnancy for periodontal disease, 
performed by a dentist, dental hygienist or therapist (including mechanical debridement using scaling and root planing, polishing, or 
surgery), either singly or in combination with counselling on oral hygiene, antiseptic oral agents, topical or systemic antimicrobial therapies 
compared with either placebo (for adjunctive treatment), no treatment or alternative treatments."
