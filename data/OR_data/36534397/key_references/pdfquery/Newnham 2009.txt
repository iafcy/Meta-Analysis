risk (n(cid:1)3,737) were examined for periodontal disease. 
Approximately 1,000 women with periodontal disease 
were allocated at random to receive periodontal treat- 
ment commencing around 20 weeks of gestation (n(cid:1)542) 
or 6 weeks after the pregnancy was completed (controls; 
n(cid:1)540). The treatment included mechanical removal of 
oral biofilms together with oral hygiene instruction and 
motivation at a minimum of three weekly visits, with 
further visits if required. 
RESULTS: There were no differences between the con- 
trol and treatment groups in preterm birth (9.3% com- 
pared with 9.7%, odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence 
interval [CI 0.7–1.58], P(cid:1).81), birth weight (3,450 com- 
pared with 3,410 g, P(cid:1).12), preeclampsia (4.1% com- 
pared with 3.4%, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 –1.56, P(cid:1).55), or 
other obstetric endpoints. There were four unexplained 
stillbirths in the control group and no pregnancy losses in 
the treated group (P(cid:1).12). Measures of fetal and neonatal 
well-being were similar in the two groups, 
including 
abnormalities in fetal heart rate recordings (P(cid:1).26), um- 
bilical artery flow studies (P(cid:1).96), and umbilical artery 
blood gas values (P(cid:1).37). The periodontal treatment was 
highly successful in improving health of the gums (P<.01). 
CONCLUSION: The evidence provided by the present 
study does not support the hypothesis that treatment of 
periodontal disease during pregnancy in this population 
prevents preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, or pre- 
eclampsia. Periodontal treatment was not hazardous to 
the women or their pregnancies.

diagnostic and therapeutic systems used in ante- 
natal care, the rates of many major complications of 
including preterm 
pregnancy are not decreasing, 


birth.1 A vital clue as to the origin of many cases of 
preterm birth has come from the discovery that inflam- 
matory pathways may be involved in a high proportion 
of early deliveries, suggesting the presence of infection.2 
Trials using antibiotics have in general failed to prevent 
preterm birth,3 suggesting that if the inflammation is of 
bacterial origin, the source may be a distant site, and one 
that will not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. 
Periodontal disease is one possibility.4 
Many case series and cohort studies have shown 
significant associations between periodontal disease 
and preterm birth,5 
fetal growth restriction,4 and 
preeclampsia.6 Experiments using animals have also 
shown strong associations between periodontal patho- 
gens and fetal death7–9 and growth restriction.7 The 
mechanisms by which an inflamed and infected peri- 
odontium could adversely affect the pregnant uterus 
and developing fetus are uncertain, although evi- 
dence suggests roles for translocation of periodonto- 
pathic organisms, and stimulation and release of 
inflammatory mediators and prostaglandins into the 
maternal circulation.10 
Evidence from seven trials of treatment during 
pregnancy are now available, but many of the find- 
ings are in conflict and inconclusive.11 The largest of 
these trials, the Obstetric and Periodontal Therapy 
(OPT) Study, observed no beneficial effect of peri- 
odontal treatment on preterm birth or birth weight, 
but did observe a possible effect of preventing still- 
birth, the certainty of which was unclear.12 
The purpose of the present study was to perform 
a randomized controlled trial of treatment of peri- 
odontal disease in midpregnancy to investigate whether 
such treatment may prevent preterm birth, fetal growth 
restriction, and preeclampsia. Our study was conducted 
by a single group of investigators operating from a major 
center, with screening and treatments at six additional 
sites within metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The Smile Study was a single-center randomized 
controlled trial of treatment for periodontal disease in 
midpregnancy conducted at seven sites in one city. 
The protocol was approved by the ethics committees 
responsible for each of 
the study sites. Pregnant 
women were invited to participate in public and 
private antenatal clinics and offices across metropol- 
itan Perth, Western Australia. Advertisements in the 
lay media and promotional material in clinical envi- 
ronments invited women who had concerns about the 
health of their gums, pain on biting, bleeding from the 
gums, or a history of preterm birth. We had observed 
in a previous study that these four items were predic- 
tive of periodontal disease (unpublished observations, 
2003). Women were eligible for recruitment if they 
were more than 16 years of age; did not have 
maternal cardiac disease that would warrant the need 
for antibiotics for periodontal examination or treat- 
ment; had not already received periodontal treatment 
during the current pregnancy; had no fewer than 20 
natural teeth; had a single pregnancy of more than 12 
and less than 20 weeks of gestational age; did not have 
any known fetal anomalies or other risk factors, such 
as hydramnios, that would place the pregnancy at 
imminent risk of complications; and were able to 
attend regularly for periodontal treatment if required. 
Periodontal screening studies were conducted at 
King Edward Memorial Hospital, the Oral Health 
Centre of Western Australia, Osborne Park Hospital, 
Swan Districts Hospital, Armadale Hospital, Rocking- 
ham Hospital, and Joondalup Hospital. The latter five 
hospitals are secondary level centers across metropol- 
itan Perth, whereas King Edward Memorial Hospital 
is the tertiary-level perinatal center for the state of 
Western Australia. Informed written consent to con- 
duct the screening study was obtained by a research 
midwife. These screening studies were performed by 
one of five research hygienists under the supervision 
of two specialist periodontists (I.N. and J.S.). The 
examinations were a modified Community Periodon- 
tal Index of Treatment Needs study conducted in a 
well-equipped dental environment.13 Each study took 
approximately 20 minutes to conduct. Periodontal 
disease was defined as presence of periodontal pockets 
of 4 mm or greater in depth at 12 or more probing sites 
in fully erupted teeth (typically excluding wisdom teeth). 
This definition was based on the results of a pilot study 
that showed that 15.4% of our general antenatal popu- 
lation had periodontal disease of this degree (unpub- 
lished observations, 2003). Periodontal pocketing was 
used to define the presence of periodontal disease rather 
than loss of clinical attachment because it better repre- 
sents the microbial challenge and is the most frequently 
used criterion of current disease. 
Pregnant women were invited to participate in 
the treatment study if the findings from the screening 
examination met the criteria for periodontal disease. 
Informed written consent for treatment was obtained 
by a research midwife or hygienist. A questionnaire was 
then administered to obtain data on demographic, den- 
tal, and medical aspects of the woman’s health. 
Randomization was conducted by a research 
midwife or hygienist using computer randomization 
software specifically designed to allocate each case at 
random with stratification for nulliparity, history of 
preterm birth, and current smoking. Women found to 



have a periodontal disease were randomly allocated 
to receive periodontal treatment in midpregnancy 
(treatment group; n(cid:1)542) or after the pregnancy was 
concluded (control group; n(cid:1)540). 
The women who were found to not have peri- 
odontal disease were provided with a written record 
of their examination but were not involved in the 
study thereafter. 
Treatment was preceded by full periodontal ex- 
amination, including precise measurement of peri- 
odontal pocket depth to 0.2 mm with a Florida probe 
(Florida Probe Corporation, FL). Data obtained by 
this system are recorded directly into a computer 
database.14 Examination also included measurement 
of clinical attachment loss, bleeding after probing 
across the full mouth, and calculation of a modified 
O’Leary Plaque Index.15 A treatment plan was then 
devised, often in consultation with a specialist peri- 
odontist, and discussed with the woman. 
The primary objective of the treatment was to 
remove or control various biofilms that act as reser- 
voirs for the bacterial load. Treatments were con- 
ducted either by the hygienists or periodontists and 
included nonsurgical de´ bridement of the subgingival 
and supragingival plaque, removal of local predispos- 
ing factors such as calculus, root planing, and adjust- 
ment of overhanging restorations. Comprehensive 
oral hygiene instructions and motivation were pro- 
vided at each visit. The advice included recommen- 
dations for tooth brushing and flossing after every 
meal and rinsing with 0.12% non–alcohol-based chlo- 
rhexidine mouthwash. Local anesthesia was used as 
required (1% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenalin up to 
a maximum dose of 4.4 mL per treatment visit). These 
treatment sessions were provided on three occasions 
at weekly intervals commencing around 20 weeks of 
gestation. Each woman was given $10 to reimburse 
for travel expenses at each treatment visit. 
Four weeks after the final treatment, typically at 
28 weeks of gestation, a further examination was 
conducted to provide a quantified assessment of the 
success of 
included a 
treatment. This assessment 
clinical examination and measurements with a Flor- 
ida probe. Those women in whom the treatment had 
not been successful were offered a further 3-week 
treatment regimen (107 [19.6%] women were found to 
require additional treatment visits). 
All women in the antenatal treatment arm of the 
study were examined again at 32 and 36 weeks of 
gestation. The success of treatment was again quanti- 
fied, and oral hygiene advice and motivation were 
provided. Systemic antibiotics were not provided for 
periodontal disease. 
Women allocated to the postnatal (control) group 
were offered periodontal care after the birth, com- 
mencing 6 weeks after delivery. They had no further

contact with any members of the research team until 
their pregnancy was concluded. The postnatal care 
involved the same 3-week treatment protocol as for 
women in the antenatal treatment group. A follow-up 
visit was then offered 4 weeks later to assess the 
effectiveness of the treatment. 
All medical, nursing, and perinatal pathology 
staff members were unaware of the treatment alloca- 
tion of each woman in the study, and health care was 
provided according to standard protocols within each 
clinic and hospital. Details of all medical, obstetric, 
and neonatal outcomes were extracted from the med- 
ical records by research midwives who were also 
blinded to the treatment allocation. Twenty-four 
women had moved interstate or overseas, and their 
obstetric and neonatal outcomes were obtained by 
telephone (nine in the control and 15 in the antenatal 
treatment group, respectively). Stillbirth in Australia 
the unborn fetus after 20 
is defined as death of 
completed weeks of gestation or more than 400 g 
birth weight. 
The primary hypothesis was that treatment of 
periodontal disease during pregnancy reduces the 
rate of preterm birth from 12% to 7%. A sample size 
of 1,082 women was required to detect this reduction 
in the preterm birth rate with 80% ((cid:1)(cid:1).20) power 
while using a two-sided test of proportions at 5% 
significance level ((cid:2)(cid:1).05). 
We initially planned a study with a sample size of 
1,094 women, which included an interim analysis to 
be conducted when 60% of the study pregnancies 
were completed. In August 2007, the independent 
data safety monitoring committee recommended pro- 
ceeding without an interim analysis after data on treat- 
ment safety and pregnancy outcomes from the trial 
conducted by Michalowicz et al12 were published. 
Continuous outcomes were summarized using 
means and standard deviations or medians and inter- 
quartile ranges, as appropriate. Categorical outcomes 
were summarized using frequency distributions. Uni- 
variable comparisons of pregnancy outcomes were 
based on the Mann-Whitney or t test for continuous 
data and the (cid:3)2 or Fisher exact test for categorical 
data. Comparison of the rate of preterm birth adjusted 
for parity, smoking, and history of preterm birth was 
performed using logistic regression analysis with odds 
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
used to summarize the treatment effect. Supplemen- 
tary univariate comparisons of gestational ages at 
delivery between groups were based on Kaplan- 
Meier survival curves and the log rank test, and a 
proportional hazards Cox regression model was used 
for adjusted analyses with hazard ratios and their CIs. 
Primary data analysis was performed on the inten- 
tion-to-treat principle. Secondary subgroup analyses 
of dose response effects to treatment compared preg- 
nancy outcomes according to the disease severity and 
treatment compliance during pregnancy (noncompli- 
ant women in the treatment group were excluded 
from this analysis). Results of 
this analysis were 
similar to those obtained when using the intention-to- 
treat approach and are not shown. SPSS (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago IL) statistical software was used for data analy- 
sis. P(cid:2).05 was considered statistically significant.

with the final pregnancy concluding in June 2008 (Fig. 
1). The women were approached either directly by 
research midwives within a clinical environment, or 
they responded by telephone to promotional material 
in the lay press. Of these, 3,737 women were re- 
cruited and received a screening examination of their 
periodontal status. These examinations identified 
1,087 women (29.1%) with periodontal disease, each 
of whom then provided consent to participate in the 
treatment arm of the study. Five hundred forty-one 
women were allocated at random to receive peri- 
odontal 
treatment commencing 6 weeks after the 
pregnancy was concluded (control group), and 546 
women were allocated at random to receive treatment 
commencing at 21 weeks of gestation (treatment group). 
Five women assigned to antenatal treatment withdrew 
their consent before treatment commenced. One 
woman was excluded when found at 19 weeks of 
gestation to have a multiple pregnancy. Two women 
had spontaneous abortions after recruitment and be- 
fore their first screening examination. Follow-up data 
were available for all women except one in the 
antenatal group, who was known to have left Australia 
to give birth in her country of origin. 
The two groups were similar in baseline mater- 
nal characteristics (Table 1): 71.6% of the women 
were Caucasian, 98.0% had received more than 9 
years of education, the mean prepregnancy body 
mass index was 24.9 kg/m2, and 45.1% had expe- 
rienced a previous spontaneous or induced preg- 
nancy loss. There were no differences between the 
two groups in rates of preeclampsia (P(cid:1).551, OR 
0.82, 95% CI 0.44 –1.56) or gestational hyperten- 
sion (P(cid:1).607, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 –1.31). 
Four fetuses in the control group were stillborn 
(Tables 2 and 3). All four were from pregnancies that 
were uncomplicated, and their mothers were all mar- 
ried, had more than 12 years of education, and were 
nonsmokers. In each case, the perinatal pathologist 
classified the cause of stillbirth as unknown, and there

All four pregnancies were uneventful, no abnormalities were found during postmortem examination, and all placentas were described 
as unremarkable. Oral health characteristics reported by women at recruitment and assessed during the screening examination are 
shown. 

were no features of 
inflammation in the fetus or 
placenta. All four mothers had given histories of daily 
occurrences of bleeding from their gums during tooth 
brushing, and on periodontal examination each had 
bleeding, inflammation, and plaque levels classified as 
moderate. There was a single neonatal death, occur- 
ring at 1 hour of age after preterm birth at 22 weeks of 
gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by 
antepartum hemorrhage and was in the control 
group. Except for a single case of loss to follow-up 
where the neonatal outcome was unknown, all re- 
maining 538 women allocated to the treatment group 
completed their pregnancies and were discharged to 
home with a live infant. 
The two groups were similar in duration of 
pregnancy, either when expressed as the rate of 
preterm birth (P(cid:1).812, OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.7–1.58) 
or when compared using estimated Kaplan-Meier 
cumulative probabilities of delivery (Figure 2) 
(P(cid:1).548, hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.91–1.15) and 
median gestational age at delivery (Table 2). Fac- 
tors simultaneously associated with an increased 
risk of preterm delivery included history of preterm 
delivery (P(cid:1).002, OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.42–5.17), pre- 
eclampsia (P(cid:2).001, OR 17.56, 95% CI 8.75–35.24), 
threatened abortion (P(cid:1).011, OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.26 – 
6.34), and antepartum hemorrhage (P(cid:2).001, OR 3.75, 
95% CI 1.91–7.36). Risk of preterm delivery for 
nulliparous women was similar to that of parous 
women who had no history of preterm delivery 
(P(cid:1).838, OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 –1.72). 
The type of onset of labor was similar for each 
group (P(cid:1).436). Birth weights were similar in the two 
groups when expressed either as mean birth weight 
(P(cid:1).117) or expected birth weight for gestational age 
using charts derived from the local population 
(P(cid:1).103). 
There were no differences between the two groups 
in measures of fetal welfare or health of the newborn 
(Table 4). These measures included incidence of 
nonreassuring fetal heart rate traces (P(cid:1).264), the 
need for delivery based on abnormal fetal heart rate 
patterns (P(cid:1).687), 
the presence of meconium in 
amniotic fluid (P(cid:1).522), cesarean delivery for fetal 
distress (P(cid:1).720), Apgar scores less than 7 at 1 or 5 
minutes (P(cid:1).403 and P(cid:1).988, respectively), the need 
for resuscitation of the newborn (P(cid:1).133), umbilical 
artery pH (P(cid:1).371), PCO2 (P(cid:1).867) and base excess 
(P(cid:1).864) values, or the need for admission to the

cumulative incidence of deliveries

were no differences between the

Four hundred seventy-six women (88.3%) in the 
treatment group completed their treatment (Fig. 1). 
Among the 63 women who did not complete their 
treatment, 35 did not attend any of their scheduled 
visits. The success of treatment was measured around 
28 weeks of gestation (Table 6). There were significant 
improvements in all clinical measures of disease afte

DISCUSSION 
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether 
treatment of periodontal disease during midpreg- 
nancy prevents complications of pregnancy. Peri- 
odontal treatment did not prevent, or cause, preterm 
birth, fetal growth restriction, or preeclampsia. All 
other measures of pregnancy outcome were similar in 
the two groups, with the possible exception of peri- 
natal death. There were four stillbirths and one neo- 
natal death in the control group and no pregnancy 
losses in the treatment group. 
Meta-analysis of the first seven trials of periodon- 
tal treatment during pregnancy revealed a possible 
reduction in preterm birth and incidence of low birth 
weight.11 These findings 
from randomized trials 
added to observations from observational studies4,16 
indicating associations between periodontal disease 
and preterm birth. The results of the present study 
and those of the next largest trial12 are not supportive

of the hypothesis, with both trials providing strong 
evidence that 
treatment of periodontal disease is 
ineffective in preventing early birth. There are many 
differences, however, between many of the random- 
ized controlled trials that have been reported.11 Only 
three of the seven trials reported adequate random- 
ization procedures, and only three trials were blinded. 
Within these various trials was a diversity of patient 
populations. 
The first reported trial involved women of Span- 
ish and local aboriginal descent who were of low 
socioeconomic status.17 Preterm birth was less fre- 
quent in those who had been allocated to receive 
periodontal therapy (1.1% in the treatment group, 
6.4% in the control group, P(cid:1).02). The second trial 
was a pilot study, conducted at the University of 
Alabama in Birmingham.18 Three hundred sixty-six 
women were randomly assigned to scaling and root 
planing, with or without metronidazole, or dental 
prophylaxis and placebo. Eighty-five percent of 
women in this trial were African-American. The trial 
provided some preliminary evidence that periodontal 
treatment may prevent preterm birth, and that ad- 
junctive treatment with metronidazole is not of ben- 
efit and may be harmful. The largest trial reported 
until now was the OPT Study conducted in the 
United States and reported in 2006, which observed 
preterm birth in 12% of women in the treatment 
group and 12.8% in the control group, a difference 
that was not statistically significant.12 
The finding in the present study of four stillbirths 
in the control group and none in the treatment group 
would not in itself be grounds to expect that the 
treatment was protective for the fetus because the 



numbers were relatively small, the difference did not 
achieve statistical significance, and this was not a 
primary endpoint of the study. There is, however, 
evidence from other sources suggesting that such a 
protective effect may be real. First, the finding is 
largest 
consistent with that observed in the next 
randomized controlled trial of periodontal treatment 
during pregnancy, 
the OPT Study, reported by 
Michalowicz et al.12 In that trial, 3 of 407 patients in 
the treatment group and 10 of 405 patients in the 
control group had a stillbirth. The authors viewed 
this finding with particular caution because the 
numbers were relatively small. If the numbers of 
stillbirths in the study by Michalowicz et al and the 
present study are combined by meta-analysis, the 
reduction in stillbirth after periodontal treatment is 
statistically significant (P(cid:1).02, OR 4.00, 95% CI 
1.22–13.10). These two randomized controlled tri- 
als have been chosen for this meta-analysis because 
they are the only ones that share similar study 
designs. 
Second, we have observed previously that women 
with a history of recent perinatal loss are more likely to 
have periodontal disease. In a case– control study of 53 
women whose pregnancy had resulted in perinatal 
death compared with 111 matched controls, those 
women who had experienced a perinatal loss were 
more likely to have periodontal disease (OR 2.34, 
95% CI 1.05–5.47).19 
Third, the lethal effects of periodontal pathogens 
in causing fetal death are well established in animal 
models, including both hamsters7,8 and sheep.9 
Stillbirth, however, was not a primary endpoint of 
the present study. Despite our previous observations 
that periodontal disease may increase the risk of fetal 
death, we were unable to design our study with 
stillbirth as a primary outcome. To perform such a 
study would require a sample size that is unachiev- 
able within the range of contemporary research 
funding and opportunity. Hence, the value of com- 
bining results from similar studies becomes evident. 
The OPT Study had design features generally similar 
to those of the present study,12 suggesting that results 
from the two trials can be combined with relative 
confidence. Meta-analysis of the first seven pub- 
lished randomized controlled trials of periodontal 
treatment during pregnancy, however, did not pro- 
vide reassurance that stillbirth may be prevented by 
such treatment.11 

the evidence provided by the 
present study does not support the hypothesis that 
treatment of periodontal disease in midpregnancy 
prevents preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, or 
preeclampsia. A possible beneficial effect in prevent- 
ing a proportion of stillbirths remains uncertain. 
Several other randomized controlled trials are cur- 
rently in progress, and meta-analyses of the results of 
all studies can be expected to provide conclusive 
evidence in the future. Studies also need to be 
performed to investigate any possible benefits from 
periodontal 
treatment before conception. In the 
meantime, the information available to us at this 
treatment during 
time suggests that periodontal 
pregnancy is safe for the woman and her preg- 
nancy, and that any beneficial effects for the child 
are either nonexistent or likely to be restricted to 
certain populations or subgroups that have yet to be 
defined with certainty.
