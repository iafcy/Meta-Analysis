Objective: To determine the efficacy of periodontal intervention on pregnancy outcome in mild preeclamptic women. 
Methods: A sample of 60 pregnant women with mild preeclampsia (blood pressure levels <160/110 mm and proteinuria 
>300 mg/l in 24 hours urine) from the Hospital Universitario del Valle (Cali, Colombia) was included to the study. Preeclamptic 
women were randomized in two groups, one with periodontal intervention (PIG, N=28) and another in which the periodontal 
intervention was practiced after childbirth (NPIG, N=32). Maternal socio-demographic, medical and periodontal data were 
obtained. PIG included patients in which supragingival and subgingival cleaning within ultrasonic and manual devices were 
performed after study inclusion. The progression from mild to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome, the number 
of days of clinical stability and the percentile of birth-weight adjusted for gestational age were evaluated in both groups. 
Results: Most of the patients (60%) were multigravids. Gestational age at inclusion was 31.8±1.6 weeks. Chronic 
periodontitis was a frequent finding (61.7%). Social, demographic, medical and periodontal conditions were similar between 
both groups. Disease progression to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome was also similar (89.2% PIG versus 
84.4%, p=0.65) (OR=1.06 IC 95% 0.87-1.29, p=0.65). Days of clinical stability were similar between the groups (median 10 days 
, range 1-46, PIG versus 12 days, range 1-59, p=0.57) and the percentile of birth weight adjusted with gestational age had no 
differences between the groups (median percentil 50 range 5-90 PIG versus percentil 55 range 5-95, p=0.73).

Métodos: En un ensayo clínico controlado se evaluaron 
60 mujeres embarazadas con diagnóstico de pre-eclampsia 
leve (presión arterial <160/110 mm Hg y proteinuria >300 mg/ 
l en orina de 24 horas), que se trataron en la unidad de alto 
riesgo obstétrico del Hospital Universitario del Valle (Cali, 
Colombia). Se evaluaron las características socio-demográfi- 
cas, así como los aspectos médicos y periodontales. De este 
conjunto 28 (46.7%) gestantes se incluyeron al azar en el 
grupo con intervención periodontal anteparto (GIP) y 32 
(53.3%) en el grupo sin intervención periodontal (GNIP). El 
análisis se hizo de acuerdo con la intención de tratamiento. La 
variable dependiente fue la proporción de mujeres que agra- 
varon su condición pre-eclámptica hacia pre-eclampsia seve- 
ra, eclampsia o síndrome de HELLP, el número de días de 
estabilidad clínica y el percentil de peso del recién nacido 
ajustado para la edad de la gestación. 
Resultados: De las pacientes 60% eran multíparas. La 
edad gestacional promedio de ingreso al estudio fue 31.8 
semanas. El diagnóstico periodontal más frecuente fue 
periodontitis crónica (61.7%). Las características socio-de- 
mográficas, obstétricas y periodontales fueron afines en 
ambos grupos. La pre-eclampsia se agravó de manera compa- 
rable en los dos grupos (GIP 89.2% versus GNIP 84.4%, 
p=0.65) (OR=1.06 IC 95% 0.87-1.29, p=0.65). La estabilidad 
clínica en días, fue parecida en ambos grupos (GIP mediana 
10 días, rango 1-46 versus GNIP 12 días, rango 1-59, p=0.57). 
La mediana del peso del recién nacido ajustado por la edad 
gestacional fue semejante en los dos grupos (GIP percentil 50, 
rango 5-90 versus GNIP percentil 53 rango 5-95, p=0.73). 
Conclusiones: El tratamiento periodontal en mujeres con 
pre-eclampsia no complicada no incrementa la severidad o 
frecuencia de las complicaciones maternas.

Preeclampsia (PE) is an exclusive illness of human 
gestation. It contributes with 42% of maternal and 
perinatal mortality, and is the first cause of intrauterine 
growth restriction, preterm birth, and low weight at 
birth1. It is known as a «the disease of several theories» 
because the aetiology is still unknown although some 
risk factors have been identified such as: first pregnancy/ 
null parity, chronic kidney disease, uterine malformations, 
none prenatal care, diabetes, familial predisposition, 
obesity, hypertension, low social-economical level, or 
non treated infections 2. 
Endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia is a constant 
event, but it is unknown if this dysfunction is cause or 
consequence of the illness. In pregnancy there is an 
inflammatory physiological state which is more accen- 
tuated in pregnant women developing preeclampsia, and 
has been associated to increased levels of proinfla- 
mmatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-? , reactive C protein)3,4 
and infections5, including periodontitis6,7. Changes have 
been observed in atherosclerosis at placental level in 
pregnant women with preeclampsia as well as bacterial 
translocation of oral pathogens to placenta8. Also, it was 
recently demonstrated that periodontal illness is related 
to increased levels of reactive C protein specifically in 
women with preeclampsia 3. 
Besides, a controlled clinical trial including males and 
none pregnant females demonstrated that periodontal 
treatment improves endothelial disfunction9. This may 
have implications on preeclampsia, since vascular stress 
generates vasoconstriction and platelet activation 
worsening the preeclampsia clinical course. 
A preliminary study determined the effect of 
periodontal intervention on pregnant women with preterm 
birth risk factors, which had decreased incidence of this 
event10,11, however, when intervention is done late there 
is no significant benefit12. Since preeclampsia is both 
associated and principal cause of induced preterm birth, 
the aim of this study was to evaluate periodontal 
intervention efficacy and safety on pregnancy outcome 
of women diagnosed with mild preeclampsia. 

A randomized controlled clinic trial was performed 
between March 2006 and December 2007, including 60 
pregnant women hospitalized in the Obstetric High Risk 
Unit at Hospital Universitario del Valle (HUV), Cali, 
Colombia. The study was estimated with ? =0.1 and 
? =0.2, one case by one control, complication expected 
frequency of 80% (progression to severe preeclampsia, 
eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or maternal fetal 
complications). Expected risk reduction due to periodontal 
intervention was taken into account in preterm birth 
studies and low weight at birth10,11 as this is the first 
research in which periodontal intervention is performed 
to preeclampsia patients. Sample size was estimated in 
60 patients. Pregnant women diagnosed with mild 
preeclampsia and gestational age between 26 and 34 
weeks were the inclusion criteria, without caring on 
parity, or patient age. 



Gestational age was calculated based on a trustable 
amenorrhea if this existed (regular menstrual cycle 
before pregnancy, null anovulatories use), or echography 
on first pregnancy trimester. 
This study was approved by two Institutional Ethics 
Committees (Facultad de Salud, Universidad del Valle 
and HUV). Patients agree or accept voluntary 
participation in research. Exclusion criteria were: 
pregnant women with history of chronic hypertension, 
kidney or cardiovascular disease previous to pregnancy, 
diabetes or past history of infections different to 
periodontal or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Included patients were randomized by blocks to 
avoid disparity in groups, in case of suspension of the 
study (severe adverse effects of periodontal treatment). 
Treatment intention was determined at random, in closed 
envelopes prepared by professionals external to the 
research group. Of the patients 28 (47%) were 
randomized to the periodontal intervention group (PIG, 
conventional medical treatment with periodontal 
treatment at day of inclusion) and 32 (53%) were 
randomized to the group without periodontal intervention 
(NPIG, conventional medical treatment, and periodontal 
treatment postpartum for ethical reasons). Patients 
were healthy before developing preeclampsia. Other 
data like educational level, smoking habits, and alcoholism, 
were obtained from clinic record and confirmed by 
interview. Patients had not received antibiotics or 
periodontal treatment 3 and 6 months before inclusion, 
respectively. 
Preeclampsia´s clinic diagnosis was done by attending 
doctors and confirmed by research group´s gynae- 
cologists and obstetricians, and was defined as pregnancy 
induced hypertension of >140/90 mm/Hg sitting down 
(confirmed with 2 tests separated by 4 hours each) and 
proteinuria >300 mg in 24 hours urine, without concomitant 
urine infection. 
Mild preeclampsia diagnosis was defined when 
patient had systolic blood pressure between 140-160 
mm/Hg and/or diastolic between 90-110 mm/Hg, without 
pre-convulsive symptoms (headache, blurred vision, 
epigastralgia, phosphene, tinnitus, normal osteo-tendinous 
reflex) and with no compromise of target organs (altered 
LFTs, altered LDH, thrombocytopenia) or fetal 
compromise (IGRU or oligohydramnios). 
Number of teeth and periodontal clinical parameters 
were measured on every patient. Third molars were 
excluded from evaluation since eruption is not proper 
and interfere with measurements. All measurements 
were practiced by trained periodontists with the same 
evaluation criteria and equipment. Measurements were 
registered on a periodontics chart and periodontal diag- 
nosis was confirmed by a second group of periodontists 
(JB, JS). Periodontists did not know the objectives of the 
research. Every tooth was evaluated to determine 
pocket depth (mm) and clinical attachment level (mm, 
six measurements per tooth -mesiobuccal, buccal, disto- 
buccal, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual using a 
periodontal probe UNC-Hu-Friedy). Pocket depth was 
determined measuring the distance between gingival 
margin to the bottom of periodontal pocket. Clinical 
attachment level was determined by measuring the 
distance between enamel-cemental line to the bottom 
of periodontal pocket. Gingival bleeding was determined 
on the same six sites, and was registered as positive if 
occurred 15 seconds after the periodontal probing. 
Bleeding at probing was determined as a percentage of 
the bleeding sites. Periodontal diagnosis was establish 
according to the report consensus criteria of the American 
Academy of Periodontology13. Dependent variable at 
medical assessment was outcome of pregnancy 
characterized by number of events of preeclampsia, 
eclampsia, or HELLP´s syndrome developed, new born 
percentile weight adjusted to gestational age and number 
of complete days of clinic stability after study inclusion. 
Independent variable was patients group (PIG or NPIG). 
Confusion variables were social and demographic va- 
riables. Periodontal treatment included oral health 
education, hygiene, dental plaque removal, scaling and 
root planning (if necessary), subgingival irrigation without 
antibiotic administration in one single session (one to two 
hours). Periodontal treatment was performed by 
periodontists. 

Statistical analysis was performed using univariate 
analysis to evaluate sample characteristics in both groups 
with measures of central tendency and dispersion. 
Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate periodontal 
treatment effect on pregnancy outcome. Differences 
between continue variables were evaluated using 
Student’s t test (two tailed) for data with normal 
distribution, and Kruskal-Wallis´ test for data with other

type of distribution. ? 2 or Fischer exact test (if the 
smallest value was under 5) was used to analyze 
differences in categorical variables. 
Analysis was performed with EPIINFO 6.0 (CDC, 
Atlanta) and Epistat 3.0 (Richardson, Texas, USA). 
p<0.05 was consider significant. 

Sixty five patients were identified of having mild 
preeclampsia and invited to participate in the study. 
Afterwards 5 patients were excluded, 3 (4,6%) that 
having a presumptive clinic diagnose of mild pre- 
eclampsia, also had less proteinuria <300 mg/dl in 24 
hours urine, which locates them as gestational 
hypertension; and 2 (3,1%) for whom was determined 
that hypertension condition corresponded to a chronic 
disease (Figure 1). 

and gestational age at entry of 31,8 weeks. Most of them 
(60%) were multiparae and had low socioeconomic 
level (83%, strata 1-2, ranks 1-6, National Administrative 
Department of Statistics classification DANE). Most 
frequent marital status was unmarried in law (60%), 
predominant race was mixed in ethnic backgrounds and 
urban procedence (Table 1). Obstetric sociodemographic 
(Table 1) and periodontal clinic characteristics (Table 2) 
were similar in both groups, except for age, where 
patients in PIG were younger than patients from the 
NPIG (24±6.5 years PIG vs. 27±7.6 years NPIG, 
p=0.01). Other difference found was mean gestational 
week at inclusion time (31.2% for PIG and 32.4% for 
NPIG, p=0.04). Patients did not inform of smoking or 
drinking habits. Most frequent periodontal diagnose was 
chronic periodontitis (61,7%) (Table 2). Patient belonging 
to PIG presented more mild chronic periodontitis when 
compared to NPIG (57% PIG vs. 37% NPIG) (p=0.001) 
(Table 2).

Twenty two (78,6%) of the patients included in the 
PIG worsen their preeclamptic condition to severe 
preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, 
liver enzyme rising, platelets consumption), or another 
kind of complication, while for the NPIG (56,3%) were 
eighteen patients (p=0.07) (OR=2.85, IC 95%, 0.91- 
8.92). Clinic stability was similar for both groups; for 
PIG was 10 days (ranging 1-46 days), while for NPIG 
was 12 days (ranging 1-59 days) (p=0.57). Preterm birth 
incidence was similar for both groups (PIG 26, 92,8% 
vs. NPIG 24,7%, p=0,06). For PIG, 9 (32,1%) of the 
new born needed neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) due 
to some complication, in contrast, 5 (15,6%) of the new 
born from the NPIG needed ICU (p=0.13). 
Neonates weight percentiles adjusted to gestational 
age were similar for both groups (PIG 50, rank 5-90 vs. 
NPIG 53, rank 5-95, p=0,73) (Table 3). Twenty-one of

kind of clinic complication during pregnancy, 17 (60,7%) 
patients developed severe preeclampsia, one (3,6%) 
developed HELLP´s syndrome, and three (10,7%) had 
some other kind of complication like premature rupture 
of membranes, oligohydramnios and polihydramnios, 
while 7 of this patients (25%) did not present any other 
complication during pregnancy, after being include in 
the research. For the NPIG, 18 patients (56,3%) 
presented complications during pregnancy, after being 
included in the research, 16 (50%) presented severe 
preeclampsia, 2 (6,3%) presented some kind of 
complication, respiratory and uteroplacental failure, and 
14 (43,8%) of them did not developed any complication 
(Table 3). Comparing statistically this results, there is no 
significant difference between PIG and NPIG (p=0,67), 
indicating that periodontal treatment was not associated 
with development of maternal clinical complications in 
women suffering mild preeclampsia. 

Preeclampsia is characterized by a systemic vascular 
dysfunction that affects placental circulation, as 
demonstrated by histopathology changes. Indeed of 
been considered a multifactorial illness, there is growing 
evidence of the presence of chronic infection2 as 
etiological/or triggering factor for systemic vascular 
dysfunction (endothelial dysfunction). Previous studies 
observed an association between periodontal illnesses 
and preeclampsia 3,6,14-17. Studies about the effect of 
periodontal intervention on pregnant women suffering 
preeclampsia are not reported in literature, however, 
diverse studies exist relating periodontal illness and 
adverse outcome of pregnancy in what concerns to low 
weight at birth, preterm birth, intrauterine growth 
restriction, low gestational age, and gestational diabe- 
tes18. Literature reports four studies about association 



between periodontal illness and preeclampsia (3 case- 
control studies, and one prospective study), with ORs 
from 2.4 and 3.5, however, a case-control study carried 
out in Argentina did not found association to an adjusted 
OR 0.99 (IC 0.70-1.40)4. 
A recent meta-analysis determined that urinary 
infection (N=104,927 OR=1.63 IC 95% 1.43-1.83) and 
periodontal illness (N=3,507 OR=1.76 IC 95% 1.39- 
2.17)1 are unique infections associated to preeclampsia 
development. 
For ethical reasons, and taking into account that 
preeclampsia is a serious and potentially fatal disease, 
and treatment consists on patient’s stabilization while 
pregnancy ends, were only included pregnant women 
diagnosed with mild preeclampsia. None patients with 
severe preeclampsia were included since pregnancy on 
this patients ends in 24-48 hours1 post diagnosis. Inclusion 
of these patients allowed following clinical evolution to 
determine periodontal intervention effect on women 
suffering preeclampsia. 
The present controlled clinic assay determined that 
severity and frequency of medical complications in mild 
preeclampsia are not significantly increased after 
periodontal intervention (Table 3). Mean new born 
weight was lower in PIG due to gestational age at birth 
since weight percentile adjusted to gestational age were 
similar within groups (Table 3). As observed in a pre- 
vious study on patients with preterm birth and periodontal 
intervention, this did not modify illness course within 
groups and was equally safe12,20. 
Socio-demographic, obstetric, and periodontal 
characteristics were similar in both groups, except the 
variable chronologic and gestational age, which 
demonstrates that population group selected was 
relatively homogeneous due to study randomization 
(Tables 1, 2). Preeclampsia occurs generally on patients 
at extreme reproductive age, young women, or older 
than 35 years, which could influence the bigger number 
of older women on a group affecting mean age in each 
group. Since extreme reproductive age is a risk variable 
once complications happened, age as an independent 
variable has not a direct effect on pregnancy outcome. 
Periodontal illness is associated to increase risk of 
gestation adverse outcome. Thus, confirmation of 
periodontal illness as an independent risk factor for 
adverse outcomes must be taken into account for an 
integral evaluation of pregnant women since is a 
preventable and treatable illness, in contrast with 
preeclampsia, which is a treatable but difficult to prevent. 
Studies with larger groups are necessary to evaluate the 
efficacy of early periodontal intervention during 
pregnancy in relation with endothelial dysfunction and 
preeclampsia development. 
A new born resulting from a complicated preeclamptic 
pregnancy increases to 50% probability of using neonatal 
ICU, just for the fact of suffering this illness (OR=1.50 
IC 95% 1.2-2.0). The present study does not present 
differences related to maternal morbidity in the PIG in 
relation with periodontal intervention postpartum (NPIG) 
and overall impact of periodontal intervention did not 
have a negative effect on new born health when evaluated 
with level of neonatal ICU use, what allow us to 
conclude that periodontal intervention in patients suffering 
mild preeclampsia does not increase risks to the mother 
or fetus, being a safe procedure. 
It is known that periodontitis occurs in at least 60% 
of pregnant women with low socioeconomic level. Its 
presence increases C-reactive protein in pregnant 
women3, one of the ways to endothelial dysfunction. 
Pregnant women that develop preeclampsia present an 
early endothelial dysfunction in pregnancy4. It is known 
that periodontitis reduces endothelial funtion10. According 
to this, it is logic to think that periodontal intervention 
would have a better preventive effect when this risk 
factor is interfered in early stages of pregnancy. 
Previously was established that periodontitis treat- 
ment during pregnancy is safe19 as it is for pregnant 
women with preterm birth12,20 and according with the 
results of the present study, this conclusion expands to 
pregnant women that suffer mild preeclampsia. Knowing 
that periodontal treatment does not modify preeclampsia 
course, it would be important to determine the effect of 
early periodontal intervention on normotensive pregnant 
women with high risk of preeclampsia. Endothelial 
dysfunction is a constant in preeclampsia pathogenesis, 
it is interesting to remember that periodontal treatment 
improves endothelial function in patients with perio- 
dontitis9.
