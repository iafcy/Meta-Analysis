Abstract Periodontitis has been associated with adverse 
pregnancy outcomes. Results from intervention studies are 
few and controversial. The present study assessed the 
effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment in the occur- 
rence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Two hundred forty- 
six eligible women were randomly divided into two groups: 
periodontitis intervention (n=122; undergoing non-surgical 
treatment during gestation) and periodontitis control (n= 
124; not treated during gestation). Univariate analysis was 
performed and estimates of relative risk were reported. Data 
from 225 women were analyzed. No differences for preterm 
birth (p=0.721), low birth weight (p=0.198), and preterm 
low birth weight (p=0.732) rates were observed. Relative 
risk estimates for preterm birth, 
low birth weight, and 
preterm low birth weight in the periodontitis intervention 
group were 0.915 (95% CI 0.561–1.493), 0.735 (95% CI 
0.459–1.179), and 0.927 (0.601–1.431), respectively. Non- 
surgical periodontal treatment during the second semester 
of gestation did not reduce the risk for preterm birth, low 
birth weight, and preterm low birth weight.

Studies have suggested that periodontal disease could be a 
risk factor for preterm birth (PTB), 
low birth weight 
(LBW), and preterm low birth weight (PTLBW), due to 
its inflammatory infectious nature [1, 2]. 
Observational studies have showed conflicting findings. 
Some case–control and prospective studies reported a 
significant association between periodontitis and PTLBW 
[3–8], while other studies failed to demonstrate such 
association [9–11]. 
Some animal studies have revealed that the inoculation 
of periodontal pathogens induced a significant reduction of 
birth weight 
increase in the 
occurrence of intrauterine growth restriction [13]. It was 
also demonstrated that 
the lethality rate was 3.9 times 
higher after 1 week postpartum [14]. 

Novak et al. [11] showed that non-surgical periodontal 
therapy significantly reduced levels of periodontal pathogens 
in pregnant women. However, changes in these bacteria 
resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth. 
Some authors have verified the beneficial effects of 
mechanical debridement on maternal periodontal status 
followed by a reduction in the occurrence of PTLBW 
[15–18]. Although findings reported by Mitchell-Lewis et 
al. [9], Jeffcoat et al. [19], and Michalowicz et al. [20] 
in maternal periodontal 
demonstrated an improvement 
status after periodontal treatment, no effects on PTLBW 
were verified. Since findings are contradictory, there is the 
need for further investigations [21]. 



In this manner, the aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment 
during the second trimester of gestation in the occurrence 
rates of PTB, LBW, and PTLBW. 


Sample consisted of women from a low socioeconomic 
class from prenatal care programs at two public hospitals in 
Belo Horizonte, Brazil. During the period of data collec- 
tion, 737 women were determined to be eligible for the 
study. After having applied some exclusion and inclusion 
criteria, 439 women were selected for periodontal exami- 
nation. Final sample consisted of 246 women diagnosed 
with periodontitis. Sample was then randomly divided in 
two groups: periodontitis intervention (PI) (n=122) and 
periodontitis control (PC) (n=124) (Fig. 1). 
The present study received approval from the Ethics 
Research Committee from the Federal University of Minas 
Gerais and by the Review Board of Ethics from the 
municipal government of Belo Horizonte. 

Medical records and prenatal forms from the hospital units 
were examined in an attempt to determine eligibility for the 
study. The inclusion criteria included healthy pregnant 
women aged 18–35 years, gestational period between 12 
and 20 weeks, current single gestation, a minimum of 20 
natural 
teeth, and the presence of periodontitis. The 
exclusion criteria included current genitourinary infection, 
chronic hypertension, diabetes, human immunodeficiency 
virus infection and/or acquired immunodeficiency syn- 
drome, current use of tobacco (smoking), alcohol and/or 
illicit drug use, and any medical condition requiring 
antibiotic prophylaxis for dental 
treatment. In addition, 
women under the use of any antibiotic or non-steroid anti- 
inflammatory agents, antiseptic mouthwashes, and drugs 
that can induce gingival overgrowth, as well as those under 
current periodontal 
treatment, were excluded from the 
sample. 

During prenatal visits, women were selected and invited to 
participate in the study. At 
time, participants were 
informed of the aims of the study and were provided with a 
written informed consent. Data were systematically 
obtained through patient questionnaires and included 
previous gestations, previous abortions, previous preterm 

births, stillbirths, number of live children, multiple gesta- 
tions, ethnicity, marital status, age, maternal weight, and 
education level. 
Dental health care personnel were trained and calibrated 
to improve understanding of medical records and prenatal 
forms and to settle into the hospital routine before data 
collection. 
Prenatal visits were scheduled monthly up to 34 weeks 
of gestation and every 2 weeks until parturition. Periodontal 
examination and periodontal procedures were scheduled 
according to this routine. 

A complete periodontal examination was performed. 
Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and 
bleeding on probing (BOP) measurements were performed 
at six sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe 
UNC15 (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). All 
teeth were 
evaluated, not 
including those with incomplete eruptive 
processes. 

All women in the sample were examined by one trained and 
calibrated periodontist (AMSDO). The calibration process 
included two periodontal examinations for 
the same 
subject, performed in two consecutive weeks on a total of 
ten women. Kappa scores were calculated for PD (k=0.82) 
and CAL (k=0.80). All k scores were considered to be 
satisfactory. 

Periodontitis was determined by the presence of four or 
more teeth with one or more sites with PD≥4 mm and 
CAL≥3 m [15]. 

One group received non-surgical periodontal 
treatment 
during the gestation period (PI group), while one group 
did not 
treatment during gestation 
(PC group) (Fig. 1). The periodontist examiner (AMSDO) 
was blinded to the location of each subject within the 
groups. 

All women were informed of their periodontal status and 
received a kit containing tooth brushes, dental floss, and 
toothpastes. Women from the PI group received oral 
hygiene instructions, plaque index evaluations, dental 
prophylaxis, and mechanical debridement, when necessary, 
under local anesthesia on all affected sites each month 
during the second trimester of gestation. Periodontal final

examination was performed 30–40 days after the periodon- 
tal intervention phase. Then, women were scheduled for 
periodontal maintenance visits every 3 weeks until partu- 
rition. The personnel who performed the periodontal 
therapy were trained to each step of periodontal interven- 
tion. Women from the PC group were recalled and re- 
examined during the 30th and 32nd weeks of gestation. 
This second examination was considered to be the final 
periodontal examination. At this point, periodontal treat- 
ment was offered to these women in postpartum. 

Gestational age was determined by obstetric criteria based 
on the date of the last menstrual period and confirmed 
through ultrasound performed between the 18th and 22nd 
week of gestation. After parturition, pregnancy outcomes 
were determined as follows: (a) preterm birth (less than 37 
complete weeks of gestation), (b) low birth weight (less 
than 2,500 g of birth weight), (c) preterm low birth weight 
(less than 37 complete weeks of gestation and less than

439 women were determined to be eligible and underwent 
periodontal examination. Of the 439 subjects enrolled, 193 
patients were diagnosed with periodontal health or gingivi- 
tis and were excluded. During the study, 9 women from the 
PI group and 12 women from the PC group were excluded 
for different reasons: spontaneous abortion (5), stillbirth (1), 
eligible preterm birth (8), and abandonment (7). Therefore, 
data from the 225 women present at both the baseline and 
final examinations were analyzed. A flowchart of sampling 
strategy is summarized in Fig. 1. 
Homoscedasticity of the groups in relation to maternal 
age, maternal body weight, and newborn birth weight was 
observed. The Bartlett test showed no significant differ- 
ences in the variances of these variables (p>0.01). Groups 
were determined to be homogeneous through Lilliefors test 
(p>0.05). 
Baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The 
mean age of women in the PI group was 29.96±4.38 years 
and in the PC group 26.58±3.96 (p=0.500). 
It was

observed that maternal weight 
prenatal visits (p=0.657), marital status (p=0.950), educa- 
tional level (p=0.933), and ethnicity (p=0.870) were not 
significantly different between the groups. 
Table 2 shows periodontal variables in the baseline and 
final examinations. The mean number of 
teeth was 
homogeneously distributed among the groups. A higher 
frequency of sites with BOP, PD≥4 mm, and CAL≥3 mm 
was verified in the PI group when compared to the PC 
group in baseline examination. When analyzing periodontal 
clinical parameters in baseline and final examinations, a 
worsening in periodontal status of the PC group with an 
increase in the percentage of sites with BOP, PD, and CAL 
could be observed. A decrease in the percentage of sites 
with BOP, PD≥4 mm, and CAL≥3 mm was verified in the 
PI group. 
Table 3 shows the occurrence of pregnancy outcomes 
within the groups. The occurrence rates of PTB, LBW, and 
PTLBW in the PI group were not statistically different from 
the PC group (p=0.722, p=0.198, and p=0.733, respec- 
tively). 
RR estimates for adverse pregnancy outcomes are 
displayed in Table 4. RR estimates and 95% CI for PTB, 
LBW, and PTLBW for the PI group were of 0.915 (0.561– 
1.493), 0.735 (0.459–1.179), and 0.927 (0.601–1.431), 
respectively. It is important to note that, although the point 
estimates of RR for all events were acceptable, the 95% CI 
included the null. Consequently, these RR estimates were 
considered not significant. 

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
non-surgical periodontal procedures, performed during the 
second semester of gestation, on the incidence rates of PTB, 
LBW, and PTLBW. 
It is important to highlight that the study design adopted 
strict exclusion and inclusion criteria, establishing classic 
risk factors and confounding variables for the events of 
interest. As stated by Wimmer and Pihlstrom [23], it is vital 
that periodontal exposure and adverse birth outcomes be 
clearly defined and the many potential confounding factors 
and possible effect modifiers for adverse pregnancy 
outcome be controlled. In this manner, the present study 
brings with it a particular contribution in relation to other 
intervention studies [15, 17, 20, 24, 25].

intervention on 
pregnancy outcomes, the results did not show a significant 
reduction in the risk for the occurrence of PTB, LBW, and 
PTLBW in the intervention group when compared to the 
control group. 
Findings from the present study support previous results 
from three different studies. Dörtbudak et al. [4], Jeffcoat et 
al. [19], and Michalowicz et al. [20] also reported a 
significant improvement in the periodontal status of women 
who underwent periodontal 
therapy during gestation. 
However, no reduction in the occurrence of PTB and 
LBW was demonstrated. 
In contrast, results showing a significant reduction in the 
occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes after periodon- 
tal therapy during gestation were reported in the literature 
[15, 16, 18, 25]. Divergences could be explained by 
methodological issues among the studies, such as sample 
composition, periodontitis, and adverse pregnancy out- 
comes definitions. It is well recognized that these issues 
can strongly influence the results and must be taken into 
account when analyzing the results [6, 23, 26–29]. 
A significant positive effect of non-surgical periodontal 
treatment on periodontal status and its beneficial impact on 
pregnancy outcomes in women diagnosed with gingivitis 
and periodontitis was demonstrated by Lopez et al. [15, 16]. 
However, it is important to emphasize that women present- 
ing genitourinary infection during the period of the study 
were medicated with antibiotics. Another significant differ- 
ence from our study was the use of 0.12% chlorexidine 
daily mouth rinses during periodontal therapy. Here, the 
results should be interpreted with caution. This approach 
can alter clinical response in relation to gingival bleeding. 
[17] 
Preliminary findings from Offenbacher et al. 
showed that periodontal intervention reduced the incidence 
of PTLBW by 3.8-fold. Gazolla et al. [18] also demon- 
strated a significant reduction in the incidence rates of 
PTLBW among women treated during gestation. 
Tarannum and Faizuddin [25] suggested that non- 
surgical periodontal treatment can significantly reduce the 
risk of PTLBW among women with periodontitis. Findings 
from this study showed significant differences between the 
intervention and control groups in relation to mean 
gestational age (p<0.006) and to birth weight (p<0.044). 
In the present study, five cases of spontaneous abortion 
and one case of stillbirth were observed. They were 
excluded from the analysis since the pregnancy outcomes 
differ from those that were proposed to be evaluated in the 
present study (PTB, LBW, and PTLBW). In addition, seven 
cases of abandonment (women abandon the hospital units 
of the study with no medical protocol of transference) were 
observed. It was not possible to analyze these cases due to 
The present study, as most studies which have investi- 
gated the effects of non-surgical periodontal intervention on 
pregnancy outcomes, showed an improvement in clinical 
periodontal status and beneficial effects in oral health. 
However, we believe that there is no sufficient evidence to 
state that periodontal therapy during gestation can influence 
gestational age and birth weight. These findings are in 
accordance with a recent European consensus (Kinane and 
Bouchard) [27] that stated that there is no evidence that 
treating periodontal disease decreases the rate of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes. Until the present moment, findings 
from studies in this field are still controversial and point to 
the need for more intervention studies with adequate design 
in different populations. 

Findings from the present study demonstrated that non- 
surgical periodontal treatment during the second semester 
of gestation did not significantly reduce the risk for the 
occurrence of PTB, LBW, and PTLBW.
