Effect of Periodontal Therapy on 
Pregnancy Outcome in Women 
Affected by Periodontitis 

Background: There is convincing evidence to suggest that infections 
affecting the mother during pregnancy may produce alterations in the 
normal cytokine- and hormone-regulated gestation, which could result 
in preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth 
(PTB). Studies in the late 1990s associated periodontitis with preterm 
low birth weight (PLBW) deliveries, and this may have similar patho- 
genic mechanisms as other maternal infections. This study determined 
the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on pregnancy outcome. 
Methods: A total of 200 pregnant women with periodontitis were ran- 
domly assigned to treatment and control groups. Detailed data about 
previous and current pregnancies were obtained. All women received 
a full-mouth periodontal examination, including oral hygiene index- 
simpliﬁed, bleeding index, and clinical attachment level. The women 
in the treatment group received non-surgical periodontal therapy dur- 
ing the gestational period, and those in the control group received peri- 
odontal treatment after delivery. Periodontal therapy included plaque 
control instructions and scaling and root planing performed under local 
anesthesia. The outcome measures assessed were gestational age and 
birth weight of the infant. PTB was recorded when delivery occurred at 
<37 weeks of gestation, and low birth weight (LBW) was recorded when 
the infant weighed <2,500 g. 
Results: There were 53 PTBs in the treatment group and 68 PTBs in 
the control group. Twenty-six LBW infants were recorded in the treat- 
ment group, and 48 LBW infants were noted in the control group. The 
mean gestational ages were 33.8 – 2.8 weeks and 32.7 – 2.8 weeks 
in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The difference was 
statistically signiﬁcant at P <0.006. The mean birth weight was 
2,565.3 – 331.2 g in the treatment group and 2,459.6 – 380.7 g in 
the control group, with the difference being statistically signiﬁcant at 
P <0.044. A multiple regression model showed a signiﬁcant effect of 
periodontal treatment on birth outcomes. 
Conclusions: Non-surgical periodontal therapy can reduce the risk 
for preterm births in mothers who are affected by periodontitis. Addi- 
tional multicentered, randomized, controlled clinical trials are required 
to conﬁrm this link between periodontitis and PLBW. J Periodontol

major medical, social, and 
economic problem that 
accounts for a large proportion 
of maternal, and especially neo- 
natal, mortality and acute 
morbidity.1,2 Preterm low birth 
weight (PLBW) infants have a 
tremendous impact on the health 
care systems and affected fam- 
ilies in developed and develop- 
ing countries. Thus, there is a 
continuous search for risk fac- 
tors for PLBW deliveries that 
are amenable to prevention. 
Various factors have been as- 
sociated with the delivery of pre- 
term and/or low birth weight 
(LBW) infants. Maternal risk fac- 
tors include age, height, weight, 
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, 
nutritional status, and stress.3,4 
In addition, parity, birth interval, 
previous complications, pre- and 
antenatal care, maternal hyper- 
tension, infections, and cervical 
incompetence also may be im- 
portant.5,6 
In recent years, infection has 
received attention as a risk fac- 
tor for preterm deliveries. PLBW 
may be an indirect result of in- 
fection as a consequence of the 
production of increased level of 
inﬂammatory mediators, which 
shorten gestational age. The 




infection remote from the fetal– 
hypothesis that 
placental unit may inﬂuence PLBW has led to an in- 
creased awareness of the potential role of chronic 
bacterial infections elsewhere in the body.7-9 
Periodontitis is an infectious disease caused by pre- 
dominantly Gram-negative anaerobic and microaero- 
philic bacteria that colonize the subgingival area. This 
results in long-term local elevation of proinﬂamma- 
tory mediators such as prostaglandins, interleukin- 
1b and -6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This local 
elevation can inﬂuence the systemic levels of some of 
these mediators.10,11 The above facts suggest that 
periodontitis has the potential to inﬂuence PLBW 
through an indirect mechanism, involving inﬂam- 
matory mediators, or a direct bacterial assault on the 
amnion. 
Offenbacher et al.12 suggested that maternal peri- 
odontal disease could lead to PLBW infants. It has 
been observed in animal models that infection with 
Gram-negative periodontitis-associated microorgan- 
isms may adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. 
Collins et al.13 reported a 25% reduction in birth 
weight in pregnant hamsters challenged subcutane- 
ously in the dorsal region with the periodontal patho- 
gen Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to normal, 
healthy, pregnant hamsters. 
Results of a case-control study and a concurrent 
cohort study showed that periodontitis may be an in- 
dependent risk factor for PTB and LBW after adjusting 
for several known risk factors.14,15 
In a randomized controlled trial, Lopez et al.16 sug- 
gested that non-surgical periodontal therapy signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced the rate of PLBW in women with 
periodontitis. In light of the ﬁndings cited above, the 
present study was designed to assess the relationship 
between periodontal disease and PLBW and to evalu- 
ate the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on 
pregnancy outcomes. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed 
on 200 pregnant women with periodontitis selected 
from outpatients at the Department of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Medical College 
and Hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The sub- 
jects were enrolled in the study from August 2004 
to August 2005. After obtaining institutional approval 
and consent of the subjects, they were assigned ran- 
domly to treatment and control groups. Ethical clear- 
ance was obtained from the ethical committee for 
periodontal intervention. 
Inclusion criteria were: healthy pregnant women 
aged 18 to 35 years; single gestation between 9 and 
21 weeks; subjects with ‡20 completely erupted teeth, 
excluding the third molars; and subjects with ‡2 mm 
attachment loss at ‡50% of examined sites. 
Exclusion criteria were: current use of tobacco 
(smoking/smokeless) or alcohol; history of congeni- 
tal heart disease; current use of corticosteroids; diabe- 
tes, asthma, glomerulonephritis, or hyperthyroidism; 
mothers with twin pregnancy and Rh factor isoim- 
munity; current antibiotic treatment; and clinically 
evident systemic infection. 
Obstetric and Maternal Data 
Demographic factors such as age, marital status, and 
educational level as well as detailed data about previ- 
ous and current pregnancies were obtained from the 
subjects’ medical records and from interviews during 
prenatal visits. The information regarding pregnancy 
history included number carried to full term, number 
of previous preterm deliveries, number of LBW deliv- 
eries, number of previous pregnancies aborted, and 
number of live births. Maternal age at the time of entry 
into the study, onset of prenatal care, number of pre- 
natal visits, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, 
gestational age, and birth weight were recorded. 
Prenatal care included blood pressure measure- 
ments, routine urine and blood investigations, recording 
of maternal weight, and physical and pelvic examina- 
tions. Blood investigations for hepatitis B, HIV, and 
hematocrit were done. All women underwent ultraso- 
nographic examination between 9 and 32 weeks for 
gestational age determination and to rule out congen- 
ital anomalies. Prenatal care was assessed as ade- 
quate or inadequate; fewer than six prenatal visits 
were considered inadequate. Mothers with inadequate 
prenatal care were excluded from the study. 
Because all subjects included in the study were 
housewives, the socioeconomic status was classiﬁed 
according to the husband’s occupation3 as follows: 
class I (professionals), class II (intermediate), class 
III (skilled worker), class IV (partly skilled worker), 
and class V (unskilled worker). Information about 
alcohol consumption, tobacco use (smoking/non- 
smoking), and pan chewing was obtained through 
personal interview. 
Prenatal Care 
The women in our study had free access to a well- 
designed prenatal care program, Reproductive and 
Child Health and Safe (RCH), which is administered 
by the government of India. Neonatal care is empha- 
sized in the RCH program. The following are under- 
taken in the program: immunization against tetanus, 
anemia prophylaxis and oral 
therapy, antenatal 
checkup at least three times during pregnancy, referral 
of those with complications, care at birth – promotion 
of clean delivery, and pregnancy planning. 
Measurement of Periodontal Status 
Information regarding oral hygiene practices was re- 
corded. All women received a full-mouth periodontal 



examination. Oral hygiene index-simpliﬁed (OHI-S)17 
and bleeding index (BI)18 were recorded. Probing depth 
and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at 
six sites per tooth with a manual probe (UNC-15 grad- 
uated probe), using the cemento-enamel junction as a 
reference point. 
Periodontal Therapy 
A total of 100 subjects were assigned randomly, by 
the ﬂip of a coin, to the treatment group. Women in 
the treatment group received non-surgical periodon- 
tal therapy by the periodontist during the gestational 
period, whereas those in the control group received 
plaque-control (brushing) instructions only. The sub- 
jects in the control group received periodontal therapy 
after the delivery but had regular checkups at 4- to 
5-week intervals. Periodontal therapy included pla- 
que control instructions (rinsing twice daily with 0.2% 
chlorhexidine until periodontal therapy was com- 
pleted) and scaling and root planing performed under 
local anesthesia. Full-mouth scaling and root planing 
was performed by the periodontist over four to ﬁve 
appointments, with a 1-week interval between each 
appointment. Periodontal therapy was completed be- 
fore 28 weeks of gestation, and maintenance therapy 
was provided. Maintenance therapy, which included 
oral prophylaxis and reinforcement of oral hygiene 
instructions, was provided every 3 to 4 weeks until 
delivery. 
Assessment of Pregnancy Outcomes 
Primary outcome measures recorded were PTB and 
LBW. PTB was deﬁned as spontaneous delivery at 
less than 37 completed weeks of gestation that fol- 
lowed spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture 
of membranes. LBW was recorded when the infant 
weighed <2,500 g. Birth outcome that occurred after 
37 weeks of gestation or the birth of an infant with a 
weight ‡2,500 g was deﬁned as normal. Estimation 
of gestational age was based on the last menstrual 
period, ultrasound examinations, sequential physical 
examinations, and postnatal examinations. 
Statistical Methods 
The chi-square test was used to evaluate the sig- 
niﬁcance of differences in percentages. The Student 
t test (two tailed) was used to ﬁnd the signiﬁcance 
of periodontal characteristics between the study and 
control groups and between LBW and normal birth 
weight (NBW). Methods to determine the difference 
between birth outcomes in the treatment and control 
groups included the intention-to-treat analysis and 
the protocol analysis. The intention-to-treat analysis 
involved all of the subjects who were assigned ran- 
domly to the treatment group, even if they did not un- 
dergo the prescribed treatment. Pearson correlation 
coefﬁcient was used to ﬁnd the association between 
the periodontal characteristics (OHI and CAL) and 
the birth outcomes. OHI and CAL follow the interval 
scale, and BI does not follow the interval scale; hence, 
the Spearman rank correlation was used for BI. The 
difference between the correlation coefﬁcient of treat- 
ment and the control group was evaluated using the 
Fisher r-to-z transformation of the coefﬁcient. Multiple 
linear regression was used to identify the signiﬁcance 
of the linear relationship between birth outcomes and 
the other variables. 
RESULTS 
Among the 100 subjects in the control group, nine 
were excluded because they did not follow up and 
two had spontaneous abortion. In the treatment group, 
two subjects had spontaneous abortion and seven 
were lost to follow-up. Eight subjects from the treat- 
ment group refused to undergo intervention but were 
followed up until their delivery. These eight subjects 
were included in the treatment group as per intent- 
to-treat analysis. Figure 1 shows the consort ﬂow 
chart of the progress through the phases of the study. 
The mean age of the women in the treatment group 
was 23 – 3.3 years, and the mean age in the control 
group was 22.9 – 3.6 years (Table 1). The socioeco- 
nomic status of the individuals is shown in Table 2. 
There were 42 (42%) primiparous individuals in the 
treatment group and 41 (41%) primiparous individ- 
uals in the control group. The number of previous 
pregnancies varied from zero to four (Table 3). There 
was no signiﬁcant difference in the distribution by age, 
socioeconomic status, and number of previous preg- 
nancies between the two groups. 
Periodontal characteristics of the treatment and 
control groups are shown in Table 4. Women in both 
groups had mild to moderate periodontitis with a 
mean CAL of 1.99 – 0.61 mm in the control group 
and a mean CAL of 1.99 – 0.51 mm in the treatment 
group; the difference was not signiﬁcant. Mean BI and 
mean OHI-S did not differ signiﬁcantly between the 
control and treatment groups. 
The outcome measures were gestational age and 
birth weight of the infant. The prevalence of PTB 
and LBW is shown in Table 5 using the intention-to- 
treat analysis and per-protocol analysis. Both analy- 
ses showed that the prevalence of PTB and LBW 
was higher in the control group. There were 53 PTBs 
in the treatment group and 68 PTBs in the control 
group. There were 26 cases of LBW in the treatment 
group and 48 in the control group. The overall preva- 
lence of PTB was 64.4% (53.5% in the treatment group 
and 76.4% in the control group). The overall preva- 
lence of LBW was 39.4% (26.3% in the treatment 
group and 53.9% in the control group). The difference 
between the treatment and control groups was statis- 
tically signiﬁcant at P <0.001 for PTB and at P <0.002

for LBW. The mean gestational age and birth weight 
for the treatment and control groups are shown in Ta- 
ble 6 for intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol 
analysis. Infants in the treatment group had a higher 
mean gestational age and a higher mean birth weight. 
Mean gestational age was 33.8 – 2.8 weeks in the 
treatment group and 32.7 – 2.8 weeks in the control 
group. The difference was statistically signiﬁcant at 
P <0.006. Mean birth weight was 2,565.3 – 331.2 g 
in the treatment group and 2,459.6 – 380.7 g in the 
control group, with the difference being statistically 
signiﬁcant at P <0.044. 

The periodontal characteristics were compared in 
the treatment and control groups in relation to the 
birth weight of the infant (Table 7). OHI-S did not 
vary signiﬁcantly between the LBW and NBW groups 
among the controls, but showed a signiﬁcant differ- 
ence (P <0.004) in the treatment group (LBW: 3.23 – 
0.64; NBW: 2.56 – 0.55). BI did not vary signiﬁcantly, 
as related to LBW and NBW, between the treatment 
and control groups. CAL showed no signiﬁcant differ- 
ence in the treatment group between subjects who de- 
livered LBW infants (2.00 – 0.46 mm) and those who 
delivered NBW infants (2.00 – 0.33 mm). In the con- 
trol group, CAL was 2.09 – 0.531 mm among women 
who delivered LBW infants and 1.67 – 0.28 mm 
among those who delivered NBW infants. 
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient was used to ﬁnd an 
association between birth outcomes and periodontal 
characteristics (OHI and CAL). OHI and CAL follow 
the interval scale, and BI does not follow the interval 
scale; hence, the Spearman rank correlation was used 
for BI. The Fisher r-to-z transformation of coefﬁcient 
was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the difference 
for the correlation coefﬁcient for the treatment and

the control group; the difference in coefﬁcients be- 
tween the treatment and control groups was sig- 
niﬁcant (P <0.0169). An inverse correlation in the 
control group suggested that higher CAL values were 
associated with lower birth weights. Table 9 shows the 
coefﬁcients for the correlation between gestational 
age and periodontal characteristics and P value for 
the Fisher test. There was an inverse correlation be- 
tween gestational age and periodontal characteristics 
in both groups, which suggested that shorter gesta- 
tional ages were associated with higher values among 
periodontal parameters. The difference in the correla- 
tion coefﬁcients between the treatment and control 
groups was signiﬁcant for the association between 
CAL and gestational age (P <0.0114). 
Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the 
joint effects of the variables on the birth outcomes per 
intention-to-treat analysis. Table 10 shows the P 
values for multiple linear regression of the gestational 
age in relation to other variables (age, OHI, BI, and 
CAL) in the treatment and control groups. Table 11 
shows multiple linear regression of the birth weight 
in relation to other variables (age, OHI, BI, and CAL) 
in the treatment and control groups. There was a signi- 
ﬁcant linear relationship between birth outcomes and 
OHI in the presence of other variables in the treatment 
group. The linear relationship between CAL and birth 
outcomes was signiﬁcant in the control group. 
Table 12 shows a single multiple regression model 
including both groups. This model included the two- 
factor interaction terms for each main effect with

the effect of each variable differs by group.

was a signiﬁcant treatment effect on gestational age 
(P = 0.006), and the interaction of OHI and treat- 
ment effect correlated inversely with the outcome

DISCUSSION 
Maternal infections have been associated with preg- 
nancy complications for many years.19 There is in- 
creasing evidence to suggest that the presence of 
periodontal infection may present a systemic chal- 
lenge sufﬁcient to initiate the onset of premature labor 
as a source of lipopolysaccharide and/or through 
stimulation of inﬂammatory mediators such as pros- 
taglandin E2 (PGE2).20 A randomized, controlled clin- 
ical trial is the best method by which to establish a 
cause-and-effect relationship between exposure and 
disease. The present study was designed to determine 
whether non-surgical periodontal therapy reduced the 
risk for PLBW infants in women affected by periodon- 
titis. 
Subjects in our study were relatively homogenous 
based on the social and demographic factors reported 
as related to PLBW. The distribution of known risk 
factors for PLBW was similar in the experimental 
and control groups. Women aged 18 to 35 years were 
selected because maternal age <18 years or >35 years 
is a risk factor for PLBW. Subjects with only singleton 
gestation were included because the relationship be- 
tween multiple gestations and preterm labor is well es- 
tablished.21 The study population was drawn from a 
community pool belonging to the same socioeco- 
nomic stratum; subjects had a similar education level 
and similar oral hygiene practices and awareness. In 
Indian women, the prevalence of smoking, one of 
the known risk factors for PLBW,22 is low; however, 
the use of tobacco as an ingredient in pan chewing 
is common. The use of alcohol is not uncommon 
among groups with a low socioeconomic status. Par- 
ticular attention was paid to this aspect in the present 
investigation, and subjects with a history of or current 
use of tobacco (smoking and non-smoking) and alco- 
hol were excluded from the study. 
Convincing evidence has associated PTB with in- 
fection, especially genitourinary tract infections, which 
seem to be an important factor in the premature rup- 
ture of membranes.6 Thus, to have control over this 
important risk factor, subjects who developed symp- 
toms of any systemic infection or who were on any 
antibiotic administration during the pregnancy were 
excluded from the study. 
An increase in parity is associated with an increased 
risk for PTB.23 In our study, there was no signiﬁcant 
difference in the distribution of parity between the treat- 
ment and control groups. Low maternal weight gain 
and inadequate prenatal care are reported to be asso- 
ciated weakly with PTB.24 Inadequate prenatal care 
is cited often as a risk factor for poor pregnancy out- 
comes among women with a low socioeconomic 
status or those who are poorly educated. Several 
studies5,24 showed that adequate prenatal care is 
associated with improved birth weights and a lower 
risk for PTB. 
The women enrolled in the study had adequate pre- 
natal care and adequate weight gain through their 
pregnancy. Severe anemia is one of the known risk 
factors for PTB.25 Subjects enrolled in the present 
study were evaluated periodically for hematocrit, and 
those with any signiﬁcant decrease in hemoglobin 
levels were administered iron supplements. 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the periodon- 
tal characteristics between the treatment and control 
groups at baseline. Non-surgical mechanical debride- 
ment was provided to the subjects in the treatment 
group. Periodontal treatment included plaque control 
instructions and scaling and root planing. PTB caused 
by periodontal disease may result from an increase in 
systemic levels of inﬂammatory mediators. Studies26 
showed that non-surgical periodontal therapy de- 
creases the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines. There 
is evidence that PGE2 levels also decrease in gingival 
crevicular ﬂuid after scaling and root planing.27 
The prevalence of PTB was 53.5% in the treatment 
group and 76.4% in the control group. The prevalence 
of LBW (<2,500 g) was 26.3% in the treatment group 
and 53.9% in the control group. The lower prevalence 
of preterm and LBW infants in the treatment group 
could be attributed to periodontal intervention. The 
results of our study are in agreement with those of a 
study conducted by Mitchell-Lewis et al.,28 which in- 
cluded 164 subjects, 74 of whom received periodontal 
therapy during their pregnancy. They found that the 
prevalence of PLBW was 13.5% in the treatment group 
and 18.9% in the control group. 
The prevalence of PLBW in the Indian population is 
estimated to be around 40%, and about 76% of these 
are PTBs.29 The prevalence of PLBW was higher in our 



study, and this can be attributed to various factors. 
The study population belonged to lower socioeco- 
nomic strata and had lower literacy levels. Women 
who reported physical, sexual, or emotional abuse 
during pregnancy were more likely than non-abused 
women to give birth to a baby with PLBW,30 and the 
prevalence of abuse is higher in lower socioeconomic 
groups. 
Mean gestational age and birth weight were signiﬁ- 
cantly higher in the treatment group (33.8 – 2.8 weeks, 
2,565.3 – 331.2 g) compared to the control group 
(32.7 – 2.8 weeks, 2,459.6 – 380.7 g). A study by 
Lopez16 also showed increases in gestational age 
(34.4 – 2.4 weeks versus 33.6 – 4 weeks) and birth 
weight (2,353 – 112 g versus 2,156 – 562 g) in the 
treatment group compared to the control group. 
Our study showed an inverse correlation between 
gestational age and periodontal characteristics in 
the treatment and control groups. The correlation co- 
efﬁcient was signiﬁcantly higher in the treatment 
group. There was a positive correlation between birth 
weight and CAL in the treatment group, but the corre- 
lation was inverse in the control group. This can be at- 
tributed to the non-surgical therapy provided to the 
subjects in the treatment group. 
The relationship between birth weight and peri- 
odontal characteristics also was analyzed. BI was not 
signiﬁcantly different in the treatment and control 
group between NBW and LBW groups. OHI-S was sig- 
niﬁcantly different between LBW and NBW in the 
treatment group but was not different in the control 
group. However, CAL exhibited a signiﬁcant differ- 
ence in the control group between NBW (1.67 – 
0.28 mm) and LBW mothers (2.09 – 0.53 mm). The 
results are in agreement with those from a study con- 
ducted by Offenbacher et al.12 which showed that 
CAL was signiﬁcantly worse in mothers of PLBW 
(3.10 – 0.74) infants compared to mothers of NBW 
(2.80 – 0.61 mm) infants. 
The mechanism by which periodontitis causes 
PLBW is still unclear. There is some evidence that 
women with severe periodontitis during pregnancy 
are more prone to experience a PTB, even after con- 
sidering shared risk factors. Periodontitis and preterm 
delivery have been associated with certain character- 
istic polymorphisms in genes that code for cyto- 
kines.31 One hypothesis is that persons with the 
mutant or polymorphic genotypes produce more of 
the inﬂammatory cytokines in the presence of inﬂam- 
matory stimuli, such as the bacteria associated with 
periodontitis and preterm labor. This suggests that 
the enhanced host response may mediate and link 
both conditions. The role of prostaglandins in human 
labor has been well documented. Amniotic ﬂuid levels 
of PGE2 increase steadily throughout pregnancy until 
a critical threshold level is reached to induce labor. 

There are studies regarding preterm delivery caused 
by a premature increase in PGE2. It has been sug- 
infections, which serve as 
gested that periodontal 
a reservoir of 
including 
PGE2, may pose a threat to the fetal–placental unit.15 
The limitations of our study include: 1) classiﬁca- 
tion of socioeconomic status was based only on oc- 
cupation; 2) the exclusion of subjects with systemic 
infections was based on clinical presentation; hence, 
subjects with subclinical infection must have been in- 
cluded; and 3) subjects with a history of alcohol/to- 
bacco use were excluded from the study. Hence, the 
results of the study do not apply to the entire Indian 
population. 
Our study provides further evidence that non-surgi- 
cal periodontal therapy can reduce the risk for PLBW 
signiﬁcantly. From the results of this study, it seems 
likely that periodontitis can inﬂuence pregnancy out- 
comes adversely. Non-surgical periodontal therapy 
aimed at reducing the microbial load, and thereby de- 
creasing the inﬂammatory response, may help to re- 
duce the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The 
potential relationship between periodontitis and birth 
outcomes, if proven to be causative, could be signiﬁ- 
cant for public health improvement, given that peri- 
odontitis affects a considerable proportion of the 
general population and is preventable and treatable. 
Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials are 
required to conﬁrm this link between periodontitis 
and PLBW and to determine whether non-surgical 
periodontal therapy can reduce this risk.
