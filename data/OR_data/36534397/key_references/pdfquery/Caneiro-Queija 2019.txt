Abstract: Aim: To analyze if non-surgical treatment of periodontitis in a pregnant Caucasian 
women population can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods and results: A parallel 
randomized clinical trial was designed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Sanitary Area 
Santiago-Lugo, Spain (registration number: 2016/451). Forty patients with periodontitis stage II grade 
B were randomly allocated to receive either comprehensive non-surgical periodontal therapy (test 
group; n = 20) or professional tooth cleaning (control group; n = 20) before 24 gestational weeks. 
Randomization was computer-generated by the statistic program Epidat v.4.1 and allocation was 
performed using sealed opaque envelopes. Clinical measurements and peripheral blood samples for 
biochemical variables were collected at baseline, in the middle of second trimester before non-surgical 
treatment, and in the third trimester. Microbiological samples were collected in the second and 
third trimester. A statistically signiﬁcant reduction was veriﬁed in all clinical and microbiological 
parameters after periodontal treatment in the test group. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed 
for the rest of the variables, including preterm birth and/or low birth weight. No adverse events 
related to periodontal treatment were reported. Conclusions: Non-surgical periodontal treatment in 
Caucasian patients with periodontitis stage II grade B did not signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes. 


Adverse results of pregnancy, such as preterm birth or low birth weight, can be the cause of 
mortality and increased morbidity in neonates [1]. Worldwide, preterm birth is the second most 
common factor of death in children under 5 years old [2]. 
The prevalence of preterm births varies depending on the country (ranged from 5% in some 
European countries to 18% in some African countries). Blencowe et al. [3] identiﬁed data from 
99 countries and estimated the 2010 global prevalence at 11.1% (95% CI = 9.1–13.4%). The preterm 
birth rate in the 1980s was not vastly diﬀerent than the current preterm birth rate [4], and it remains an 
important public health priority worldwide [5].

Periodontitis is an inﬂammatory infection disease aﬀecting the tooth-supporting tissues, initiated 
by a bioﬁlm with gram-negative anaerobic microorganism predominance and mediated by the 
inﬂammatory response of the host. It is also liable to induce systemic inﬂammation and consequently 
modify the normal development of pregnancy [6]. During pregnancy, due to hormonal changes, 
there may be a tendency towards periodontal disease, in particular, there is an increase of anaerobic 
gram-negative bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, 
Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Selenomonas sputigena [7]. 
Infections account for 75% of premature births and/or low birth weight, while subclinical 
infections begin to be considered as an important cause of very premature birth (before the 30th week of 
gestation). However, in more than 50% of cases, the etiological factors of prematurity are unknown [8]. 
Oral infections might be considered one of these factors, since commensal bacterial species of the oral 
cavity colonize the fetoplacental unit of women with full-term gestation and with adverse pregnancy 
outcomes [9]. The bacterial species most strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes include: 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Bergeyella spp. [10]. 
Two main routes have been proposed to trigger an inﬂammatory response in the fetoplacental unit; 
the direct route, in which the oral microorganisms and/or their components reach the fetoplacental unit 
by hematogenous dissemination of the oral cavity or by an ascending route through the genitourinary 
tract; and the indirect route, in which the inﬂammatory mediators produced in the periodontal tissues 
circulate and impact the fetoplacental unit. A large number of studies associate an increase in the levels 
of local and systemic inﬂammatory markers with adverse pregnancy outcomes [11]. As well as this, 
hormonal changes during pregnancy, due to elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone, increase 
vascular permeability in gingival tissues and, as a consequence, bacteria and/or their products can 
diﬀuse more easily [12]. 
The increase in maternal serum levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and 
TNF-α have been associated with prematurity and low birth weight [13,14]. C-reactive protein, which 
is an acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver in response to proinﬂammatory cytokines, has also 
been associated with prematurity [15]. 
Cohort studies have shown a relationship between periodontal disease, premature delivery, and 
low birth weight [16–18], as it has been conﬁrmed in some systematic reviews [19–22]. On the other 
hand, clinical trials have studied the eﬀect of periodontal treatment on adverse pregnancy outcomes 
and showed controversial results [8,21–31]. This is probably because there is a marked heterogeneity 
between studies in terms of the population´s characteristics (race, age, etc.) as well as the periodontitis 
deﬁnition applied. Finally, it should be noted the conclusions reached in the Nine European Workshop 
on Periodontology in 2012 indicating that, up to now, it is not possible to aﬃrm that periodontal 
treatment reduces the rates of premature delivery or birth of underweight children [32]. However, 
these studies have provided that non-surgical periodontal treatment, when performed on pregnant 
women, is safe for the mother and the fetus [32,33]. 
Our hypothesis was that periodontitis has an eﬀect on pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth 
and/or low birth weight. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to analyze if non-surgical treatment 
of periodontitis, using the deﬁnition suggested by the EFP-AAP Consensus Meeting [34], can reduce 
adverse pregnancy outcomes in a pregnant Caucasian women population. 


A parallel randomized clinical trial was designed to test whether the non-surgical periodontal 
treatment provided during pregnancy aﬀected gestational age at delivery and birth weight. Data were 
gathered on the pregnant women at three visits: at the end of the ﬁrst trimester (16 weeks of pregnancy), 
in the middle of second trimester (22–24 weeks of pregnancy), and at the third trimester (33–36 weeks 


of pregnancy), as usually recommended follow-up visits in pregnant woman. No relevant changes 
were performed after trial commencement. 

Pregnant women who were seen for prenatal care at the University Hospital of Santiago de 
Compostela (Spain) were invited to participate in the study when they attended the hospital to undergo 
the ﬁrst gynecological clinic appointment between June 2017 and May 2018. During this screening visit, 
a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed and patients with a periodontitis diagnosis [34] 
were invited to participate. The sample size was done with PASS v.12 (NCSS, LCC; Kaysville, UT, 
USA) with an 80% power and a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, sample size was established as 40 patients. 
The patients who were included in the study were divided in two groups (test and control) according 
to a previous computer-generated randomization (generated by the statistic program Epidat v. 4.1) 
and allocation ratio 1:1 (using sealed opaque envelopes labeled with a study number and containing 
the group allocation opened by examiner after baseline examination). The test group corresponded to 
patients with non-surgical periodontal treatment, and the control group consisted of patients without 
periodontal treatment (Figure 1). All potential participants signed an informed consent form to 
participate in the study. This protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sanitary Area 
Santiago-Lugo, Spain (reference: 2016/451). 




Exclusion criteria were multiple gestation; previous preterm low birth weight; more than 1 
previous miscarriage or one greater than 18 weeks; diabetes; hypertension; alcoholism; drug abuse; 
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection; heart disease, kidney disease or liver disease; recurrent 
cystitis; viral infections; venereal infections; toxoplasmosis; and/or tobacco smoking. 

Demographic data and medical history were assessed by interview during the ﬁrst visit (16th 
gestational week). The interview included items on age, educational level (primary or less, high school, 
and university), area of residence (rural or urban, depending on the number of inhabitants), body mass 
index (BMI), marital status (single, common-law partner, married), and obstetric history (number of 
previous pregnancies, previous miscarriage). 



Full-mouth periodontal examinations were performed by one examiner. The weighted κ values 
for intra-examiner calibration were 0.82 (CI 95% = 0.68–0.98). Periodontal clinical measurements were 
recorded at enrolment and repeated at 2nd and 3rd trimester. Exams included all teeth present in 


the mouth (excluding third molars). A plaque score [35], periodontal pocket depth (PPD) (six sites 
per tooth), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) [35] (six sites per tooth) 
were registered. All scores were measured with a manual periodontal probe UNC-15 (Hu-Friedy, 
Chicago, IL, USA). Periodontitis was deﬁned according to the case deﬁnitions of the World Workshop 
in Periodontology in 2018 [34]: 
1. 
2. 
Interdental CAL was detectable at ≥2 non-adjacent teeth, or 
Buccal or oral CAL ≥3 mm with pocketing ≥3 mm was detectable at ≥2 teeth but the observed 
CAL could not be ascribed to non-periodontitis-related causes such as: (1) gingival recession 
of traumatic origin; (2) dental caries extending in the cervical area of the tooth; (3) presence of 
CAL on the distal aspect of a second molar and associated with malposition or extraction of a 
third molar; (4) an endodontic lesion draining through the marginal periodontium; and (5) the 
occurrence of a vertical root fracture. 

A peripheral blood sample was collected from each subject with venipuncture using a vacuum 
tube (Vacutainer, Nippon Becton Dickinson Tokyo, Japan). Samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm 
for 10 minutes and the serum obtained was dissociated in a plastic tube. At the time of the analyses, 
the serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), 
and ﬁbrinogen were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA). 

In the middle of the second trimester (22–24 weeks of pregnancy) before non-surgical periodontal 
treatment and before the third trimester, four sites (those with the deepest probing depth) were selected, 
and two consecutive paper points were inserted and kept in place for 10 s. All paper points were 
pooled in a vial with reduced transport ﬂuid (RTF) and transferred to the laboratory within 12 h [36]. 
The obtained samples were dispersed (30 s of vortex), serially diluted and processed for culture 
by inoculation on two diﬀerent media: blood agar medium (no 2; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK), with 
horse serum at 5% and with hemin (5mg/L) and Dentaid-1 medium [37]. The blood agar plates were 
studied after 14 days of anaerobic incubation (80% N2; 10% H2; 10% CO2) at 37 
C, and after 3–5 days 
at 37 



Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Parvimona micra, Campylobacter 
restus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp., were identiﬁed based 
mainly on their colony morphology and further conﬁrmed with diﬀerent speciﬁc chemical tests. Counts 
for every bacterial species were obtained and the percentage relative to the total ﬂora calculated. 
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were grown on Dentaid-1 medium plates, and identiﬁed based 
on colony morphology and catalase reaction. 

The test group patients received non-surgical periodontal therapy that was completed by the 
end of week 24 of gestation. This consisted of oral hygiene instructions, followed by mechanical 
supra and subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP) with Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, 
IL, USA). Periodontal therapy was performed over two 1-hour sessions. Periodontal treatment was 
performed by one periodontist (L.C.) in the Department of Periodontology at the University of Santiago 
de Compostela (Spain). 
The control group received professional tooth cleaning (oral hygiene instructions and supragingival 
cleaning of all teeth) at the second-trimester visit. All control participants were oﬀered the opportunity 
to attend for non-surgical periodontal therapy postpartum. 



Primary outcomes of the present study were preterm birth and low birth weight. Following the 
World Health Organization criteria, preterm birth was deﬁned as a delivery at <37 weeks of gestation 
(gestational age determined by last menstrual period and ultrasound fetal measurement) and low birth 
weight was deﬁned as a newborn weight of 2500 gr or less. Secondary outcomes were those related to 
the eﬃcacy of non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical, biochemical and microbiological variables. 

Descriptive analysis was calculated for each variable (mean values, standard deviation). 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to test the normality of the variables. Relationship between 
each variable and preterm birth/low birth weight were analyzed. All variables were also compared 
between women with and without treatment. A t-student test was performed for continuous 
variables whilst A chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. Non-normal distribution 
variables were analyzed by a Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square test for 
categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using ANCOVA test, with pregnancy and 
newborn weight as dependent variables with age, body mass index as a covariable, and treatment 
as an independent variable. Statistical signiﬁcance was established at the 95% conﬁdence level and 
p-values <0.05 for all analyses were selected to be statistically signiﬁcant. SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc. 
version 20.0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all the statistical analyses. 

Initially, 66 women were examined and 50 met the inclusion criteria. Eight rejected to participate 
and two had a miscarriage. Finally, 40 women with periodontitis stage II grade B complied with 
all the visits, 20 received non-surgical treatment (test group), and 20 received no treatment was 
performed (control group), as shown in Figure 2. No adverse events related to periodontal treatment 
were reported. 
Demographic characteristics of the study sample are shown in Table 1. No statistically signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences were observed between groups. The study population was 32.00 ± 4.27 years old for 
the test group and 32.25 ± 4.21 for control group; the majority lived in a rural residence, were 
married, had ﬁnished elementary school, and were her ﬁrst pregnancy and only a 5% had a previous 
spontaneous abortion.

Table 2 depicts the periodontal status of the study population. Selected pregnant women 
presented a mean number of teeth in the test group of 26.95 ± 1.21 and 26.32 ± 2.77 in control group, 
with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between them. Bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and 
clinical attachment level were statistically higher for the test group in the 1st trimester. However, 
after non-surgical periodontal treatment these parameters were reversed, and a signiﬁcative reduction 
was veriﬁed in the 3rd trimester in this test group.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the eﬀects of non-surgical periodontal treatment 
in pregnant women, carried out during the second trimester of pregnancy, on the rates of preterm birth 
and low birth weight, and to assess the clinical, biochemical, and microbiological changes. The eﬀect of 
periodontal intervention on pregnancy outcomes did not show a reduction in the risk of preterm birth 
and low birth weight in the test group compared to the control group. However, we can assume as 
clinically relevant the protector role of periodontitis treatment during pregnancy (ANCOVA analysis), 
due to the signiﬁcant periodontal health improvement in the test group. Pregnancy is a short period 
of time in order to evaluate the systemic impact of a long term periodontal microbial infection and 
related inﬂammatory responses. 
This ﬁnding is supported by previous studies such as Oliveira et al. [31], Oﬀenbacher et al. [30], 
and Michalowicz et al. [38]; these authors demonstrated that the treatment of periodontitis in pregnant 
women was safe and eﬀective for periodontal disease, but did not reduce the incidence of premature 
delivery and low birth weight. The meta-analysis conducted by Baccaglini in 2011 [39] including 
eleven high quality randomized controlled trials performed on 6558 pregnant women, also showed no 
evidence to support that non-surgical periodontal treatment during pregnancy prevents premature 
birth or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. 


Conversely, some papers have suggested a positive eﬀect of non-surgical periodontal treatment 
both in the periodontal condition of the patient and in the adverse results of pregnancy. 
Oﬀenbacher et al. [24] showed that periodontal treatment reduced 3.8 times the rate of premature 
births; this may be due to the fact that many of the included patients had a disadvantaged economic 
status and had previously had preterm births (>12 weeks), therefore, this study population represented 
a high-risk group. Jeﬀcoat et al. [23] showed that successful periodontal therapy reduced the risk of 
premature delivery in a group of African-American women who had never visited a dentist, but their 
results cannot be extrapolated to other populations with diﬀerent characteristics. Radnai et al. [25] 
also showed that periodontal treatment had a positive pregnancy outcome in a demographically 
homogenous Caucasian European population, but these women had an initial localized chronic 
periodontitis. Tarannum et al. [26] provided evidence that non-surgical periodontal therapy can reduce 
the risk of preterm birth/low birth weight, but the study population was Indian, belonged to low 
socio-economic strata (based on occupation), had low education levels, and patients with a history 
of alcohol/tobacco consumption were not excluded. Finally, López et al. [8] also demonstrated the 
positive eﬀect of periodontal treatment in adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients diagnosed with 
gingivitis and periodontitis, but the periodontal treatment included a daily chlorhexidine rinse at 
0.12% and women with urinary tract infections were treated with antibiotics (an exclusion criteria in 
most studies). 
When the clinical variables were analyzed, we have to consider that bleeding on probing, probing 
pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were statistically higher for the test than for the control 
group in the 1st trimester, however both groups were diagnosed with periodontitis stage II, grade 
B [34]. These clinical parameters remained stable throughout the gestational period in the control group 
and after treatment in the test group, there was a signiﬁcative decrease in the percentage of bleeding 
on probing, plaque index, average probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss. These ﬁndings 
for the control group seems to have no correlation with plaque accumulation since it has been shown 
that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy are a modifying factor of bacterial plaque [40]. 
Santa Cruz et al. [9] showed that periodontal clinical status was not associated with adverse pregnancy 
outcomes in a Caucasian Spanish population with a medium–high educational level. 
Biochemical markers increased in the third trimester following the basic periodontal treatment, 
except TNF-α, which decreased after performing the treatment. The diﬀerences between the treatment 
group and the control group were not signiﬁcant for any of the three visits. Most authors agree 
that treatment of chronic periodontitis does not signiﬁcantly change levels of serum markers of 
It has been suggested that non-surgical 
acute-phase inﬂammatory and vascular response [41]. 
mechanical periodontal treatment during pregnancy successfully reduces periodontal inﬂammation 
and gingival crevicular ﬂuid cytokine levels, but it has no signiﬁcant impact on serum biomarkers [38,42]. 
The complex immunological events that occur during pregnancy may limit the ability to evaluate the 
systemic eﬀect of periodontal therapy, because studies have shown that pregnant women have a higher 
production of cytokines depending on the gestational period and the outcome of pregnancy [42]. 
Regarding the presence of periodontopathogens, the non-surgical periodontal treatment performed 
in the second trimester reduced the number of all the subgingival periodontal pathogens analyzed 
and the total bacterial load. These ﬁndings indicate that the periodontal therapy of pregnant women 
with periodontitis produces quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbiota similar to those 
observed in non-pregnant women [43]. Pregnant women with periodontitis harbor a very complex 
and pathogenic subgingival microbiota, including a high prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum, 
Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Parvimona micra [9]. Martínez-Martínez et al. [44] 
did not ﬁnd association between periodontal bacteria and premature birth. In opposition to this, 
Santa Cruz et al. [9] found a signiﬁcant association between the presence of Eikenella corrodens with 
preterm birth and the presence of Capnocytophaga spp. with low birth weight. Novak et al. [43] showed 
that basic periodontal therapy signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of periodontal pathogens but basal 
levels of these were not associated with premature birth. 


The present study is not exempt from a number of methodological limitations that should be 
considered when extrapolating our results. Up to date, available evidence does not provide clinical, 
microbiological, or immunological parameters that deﬁne patients whose pregnancy outcomes would 
be improved with periodontal treatment [10]. The selected study group of our study consisted of 
Caucasian women between 18 and 40 years old and according to the literature the most aﬀected 
population by periodontitis is the African-American population. The periodontitis deﬁnition that we 
have applied in contrast to previous papers is the one recently published by the EFP-AAP Consensus 
Meeting [34]. Based on epidemiological and plausibility studies, various treatment strategies could be 
evaluated that consider speciﬁc target populations, as well as timing and intensity of treatment [10].
