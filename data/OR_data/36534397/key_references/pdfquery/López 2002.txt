Periodontal Therapy May Reduce the Risk 
of Preterm Low Birth Weight in Women 
With Periodontal Disease: A Randomized 
Controlled Trial 





nents, preterm birth and intrauter- 
ine growth restriction, are major 
predictors of perinatal mortality and mor- 
bidity.1,2 Multiple factors have been asso- 
ciated with preterm delivery and low birth 
weight3,4 and some authors have empha- 
sized the heterogeneity of the causes of 
preterm birth.5,6 
Convincing evidence has associated 
preterm birth with infection, especially 
genito-urinary infections, which appear 
to be an important factor in the prema- 
ture rupture of membranes.4,7 Several 
studies have linked bacterial vaginosis 
with preterm birth.8-10 However, treatment 
of vaginosis has not led to deﬁnite con- 
clusions on its efﬁcacy in reducing preterm 
delivery11-14 and the impact of such inter- 
vention on preterm birth rate remains 
unclear.15 Results of 2 case-control stud- 
ies16,17 and a concurrent cohort study18 
showed that periodontal diseases may be 
a potential 
independent risk factor for 
preterm birth and low birth weight after 
adjusting for several known risk factors. 
Periodontal diseases are a group of 
infectious diseases resulting in inflam- 
mation of gingival and periodontal tis- 
sues and progressive loss of alveolar 
bone. The periodontal infection is initi- 
ated and sustained by several bacteria, 
predominantly Gram-negative, anaero- 
bic and microaerophilic bacteria that col- 
onize the subgingival area. Host defense 
mechanisms play an integral role in the 

Background: Recent studies have suggested that periodon- 
tal disease is a risk factor for preterm low birth weight (PLBW). 
A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to help further 
evaluate the proposed association between periodontal disease 
and PLBW. 
Methods: Four hundred pregnant women with periodontal 
disease, aged 18 to 35, were enrolled while receiving prenatal 
care in Santiago, Chile. Women were randomly assigned to either 
an experimental group (n = 200), which received periodontal 
treatment before 28 weeks of gestation or to a control group (n 
= 200) which received periodontal treatment after delivery. Pre- 
vious and current pregnancies and known risk factors were 
obtained from patient medical records and interviews. The pri- 
mary outcome assessed was the delivery at less than 37 weeks 
of gestation or an infant weighing less than 2,500 g. 
Results: Of the 400 women enrolled, 49 were excluded from 
the analyses for different reasons. The incidence of PLBW in the 
treatment group was 1.84% (3/163) and in the control group was 
10.11% (19/188), (odds ratio [OR] 5.49, 95% conﬁdence inter- 
val [CI] 1.65 to 18.22, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regres- 
sion analysis showed that periodontal disease was the strongest 
factor related to PLBW (OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 17.13). Other 
factors signiﬁcantly associated with such deliveries were: previ- 
ous PLBW (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.11 to 14.21), less than 6 pre- 
natal visits (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.46 to 9.38), and maternal low 
weight gain (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.03). 
Conclusions: Periodontal disease appears to be an indepen- 
dent risk factor for PLBW. Periodontal therapy significantly 
reduces the rates of PLBW in this population of women with 
periodontal disease. J Periodontol 2002;73:911-924.

pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Tissue destruc- 
tion in periodontitis is mainly due to the activation of 
immune cells by cell wall components of microorgan- 
isms, such as lipopolysaccharides, which potently stim- 
ulate production of host-derived enzymes, cytokines, 
and other pro-inﬂammatory mediators resulting in con- 
nective tissue destruction.19 
Infections affecting the mother during pregnancy 
may produce alterations in the normal cytokine and 
hormone-regulated gestation, which could result in 
preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and 
preterm birth.20-22 It has been postulated that the asso- 
ciation between periodontal disease and preterm/low 
birth weight (PLBW) may have similar pathogenic 
mechanisms as other maternal infections.23 
Identiﬁcation of risk factors for preterm birth and 
low birth weight should help in the development of 
strategies to reduce the prevalence of these conditions. 
A randomized controlled clinical trial was undertaken 
to: 1) determine the relationship between periodontal 
disease and PLBW; 2) quantify the association between 
other risk factors and PLBW; and 3) determine if peri- 
odontal therapy in pregnant women with periodontal 
disease reduces the risk of PLBW. The main null 
hypothesis tested was that there are no signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences in the incidence of PLBW in pregnant women 
with periodontal disease treated before 28 weeks of 
gestation compared to women with periodontal dis- 
ease treated after delivery. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study Population 
The population study consisted of pregnant women 
who were invited to participate in the study while 
receiving routine prenatal care in Consultorio Carol 
Urzúa of Peñalolén, a district of Santiago, Chile. Women 
were of low socioeconomic status and received free 
uniform prenatal care at that clinic, which belongs to 
the National Public Health Service System, under the 
technical supervision of the Ministry of Health. Every 
year, about 1,100 pregnant women receive prenatal 
care at the facility. 
The prenatal care program applied by the Public 
Health Services in Chile was designed by the Ministry 
of Health’s Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal 
Care. The program includes regular examinations, 
screening for pregnancy complications, nutritional 
advice, laboratory tests for risk assessments, stress 
reduction, education about the symptoms of preterm 
labor, correction of identiﬁed risk factors, and referral 
to the high-risk obstetric clinic when necessary. 
As part of the recruitment process for the study, the 
midwives who were in charge of the prenatal care clin- 
ics referred to the investigators all the women, aged 
18 to 35, who were receiving prenatal care. Eight hun- 
dred twenty-nine (829) women who had completed 9 
weeks of gestation gave verbal consent to determine 
their periodontal status. 
The patients medical records were thoroughly exam- 
ined, relevant data were extracted and eligibility for 
the study was determined. The recruitment of patients 
was done over a 20-month period. 
Inclusion criteria. Otherwise healthy pregnant women, 
aged 18 to 35, with a singleton gestation, between 9 
and 21 weeks of gestation, with periodontal disease 
and with fewer than 18 natural teeth were identiﬁed 
for inclusion in the study. 
Exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria included his- 
tory of congenital heart disease requiring prophylac- 
tic antibiotics for invasive procedures, existing dia- 
betes before pregnancy, current use of corticosteroids, 
chronic renal disease, and the intention to deliver at a 
hospital other than that of the study. 
Patient selection, periodontal therapy, and mainte- 
nance treatment were done in a dental clinic located 
in the building in which the prenatal care was given. 
An informed written consent was obtained from each 
volunteer and the study protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board. 
Sample Size 
Assuming a probability of preterm low birth weight of 
20% in the control group and a probability of 10% in 
the treatment group, we believed that 280 women in 
each group might detect a significant difference of 
PLBW between groups (P <0.050; 2-sided) with a 
power of 80%. The results of the incidence of PLBW 
in the study groups were reviewed after completing 
160 deliveries in each group with the understanding the 
trial would end early for ethical reasons if the observed 
P value of the differences between the groups was 
<0.05 as, indeed, did occur. There were 400 women 
enrolled in the study when at least 160 deliveries had 
occurred in each group. 
Measurement of Periodontal Status 
Upon entering the study all women received a full- 
mouth periodontal examination and the following vari- 
ables were determined: oral hygiene status, gingival 
inﬂammation, probing depth (PD), and clinical attach- 
ment level (CAL). Oral hygiene status was assessed 
as the percentage of surfaces demonstrating plaque. 
Dichotomous measures of supragingival plaque accu- 
mulation were made by running a periodontal probe 
at the cervical surface of each tooth. The presence of 
plaque was positive when a continuous band of plaque 
was found in contact with the gingival tissue on the cer- 
vical portion of mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual tooth 
surfaces. 
Probing depth and attachment level measurements 
were made at the mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, 
distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual positions of every 
tooth with the exception of third molars. The CAL was 




measured using the cemento-enamel junction as a ref- 
erence point. 
Bleeding on probing (BOP) was assessed on the 6 
sites at which PD was determined and deemed posi- 
tive if it occurred within 15 seconds after probing. BOP 
was expressed as the percentage of sites showing 
bleeding. Gingival redness was determined on 2 gin- 
gival units per tooth. It was deemed positive when gin- 
gival redness involved all the marginal and/or the 
attached gingiva of the lingual or buccal gingiva of a 
tooth. Gingival redness was expressed as the per- 
centage of gingival units showing redness. 
Clinical measurements were recorded to the near- 
est millimeter using a calibrated periodontal probe by 
2 calibrated examiners who are periodontists. Cali- 
bration sessions to measure agreement between the 
examiners were conducted and intra- and inter-exam- 
iner reliability was recorded until satisfactory agree- 
ment was reached. The reproducibility expressed as 
proportion of agreement between clinical scores was 
91% for probing depth and bleeding. For attachment 
level and gingival redness the proportion of agreement 
between examiners was 88% and 86%, respectively. 
The examination also included recording of the num- 
ber of teeth present, with carious lesions, missing, and 
with ﬁllings (DMFT index), and any other notable fea- 
tures in the oral cavity; e.g., soft tissue abnormalities, 
pericoronitis. 
Diagnoses of Periodontal Disease 
The presence of 4 or more teeth with 1 or more sites 
with PD ≥4 mm and with clinical attachment loss ≥3 
mm at the same site was diagnosed as periodontal 
disease. Women were randomly assigned to either the 
experimental group, which received periodontal ther- 
apy before 28 weeks of gestation or to the control 
group which received therapy after delivery. Random- 
ization was done equalizing periodontal disease as the 
relevant variable and PD was selected as the variable 
describing periodontal disease. Patients were assigned 
to 1 of 2 categories: those with a mean PD <2.5 mm 
and those with a mean PD ≥2.5 mm. Patients were 
matched on the basis of the mean PD. Each patient 
of the matched pair was allocated to the treatment or 
the control group by a coin toss. 
Recording of Maternal Characteristics 
Demographic factors such as age, marital status, and 
educational level as well as detailed data about previ- 
ous and current pregnancies were obtained from the 
patient medical records and from interviews during 
prenatal visits. A medical, obstetrical, and social his- 
tory was taken according to the protocol of the pre- 
natal care program for each patient. Information on 
known risk factors and obstetric factors were collected 
and included the following: 
In relation to pregnancy history: number carried to 
full term, number of previous preterm deliveries, num- 
ber of low weight births, number of previous preg- 
nancies aborted, and number of live births. 
In relation to the current pregnancy: maternal age 
at the time of study entry, onset of prenatal care, nutri- 
tional status, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, use 
of illicit drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, asymp- 
tomatic bacteriuria, urinary infections, vaginosis or any 
other maternal infectious disease, number of prenatal 
visits, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, ges- 
tational age, and birth weight. 
Prenatal care included the following procedures: 
blood pressure measurements, urine tests, blood tests, 
recording of maternal weight and height, and physical 
and pelvic examinations. At each prenatal visit, an 
evaluation of nutritional status was done to determine 
if weight gain was adequate. A normal standard of the 
weight-to height proportion established for Chilean 
women was used for the evaluation of nutrition status. 
At every week of gestation, pregnant women should 
gain weight within the recommended range for her 
weight-to height proportion. The nomogram by Rosso 
and Mardones24 was used to assess whether weight 
gain was adequate. Underweight women received sup- 
plementary nutrition. 
As a uniform prenatal care protocol was applied to 
all the women of this study, theoretically all of them 
received adequate care. However, there were women 
who began the prenatal care at different times in their 
gestational period, and/or who did not adhere to the 
scheduled prenatal visits. In order to assess if prenatal 
care had been adequate, the number of weeks of ges- 
tation at the beginning of prenatal care and the number 
of prenatal visits were used as assessment criteria. Pre- 
natal care was categorized as starting routine care before 
12 weeks of gestation, between 13 and 20 weeks of 
gestation, and after 20 weeks of gestation. A woman 
who smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day was consid- 
ered a smoker. The number of alcoholic drinks con- 
sumed per week and use of any illegal drugs were also 
recorded. Antibiotic therapy during the gestational period, 
including dates and indications, was also recorded. 
According to the prenatal care program protocol, women 
with symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine 
culture with >100,000 c.f.u.), were treated with nitrofu- 
rantoin for 10 days. Vaginal swabs for Gram-stained 
smears and for microbiological assessment from women 
who presented vaginal discharge with a ﬁshy odor were 
taken. The presence of bacterial vaginosis was deter- 
mined by Gram stain assessment.25 Detection of Tri- 
chomonas vaginalis was done by wet mount and monilia 
by potassium hydroxide preparation. All women with 
vaginosis were treated with locally applied antibiotics, 
either metronidazole, clotrimazole, or nistatine, accord- 
ing to the results of microbiological examinations. 




Periodontal Therapy 
Periodontal therapy consisted of plaque control instruc- 
tions, scaling, and root planing performed under local 
anesthesia. At the beginning of treatment, each woman 
was instructed to rinse once a day with 0.12% chlorhex- 
idine. Periodontal therapy was completed before 28 
weeks of gestation and maintenance therapy was pro- 
vided every 2 to 3 weeks until delivery. Another com- 
plete periodontal examination was given after ﬁnish- 
ing the therapy. All measurements for a given woman 
were performed by the same examiner. Carious lesions 
were treated and all teeth indicated for extraction were 
extracted from both groups. 
Women in the control group were monitored every 
4 to 6 weeks during the gestational period to determine 
any change in their periodontal condition and another 
periodontal examination was performed after 28 weeks 
of gestation. 
Assessment of Pregnancy Outcomes 
Primary outcomes measured were preterm birth and 
low birth weight as they have been used in other stud- 
ies aimed to determine association between adverse 
pregnancy outcomes and periodontal disease.16,17,26 
Preterm birth was deﬁned as spontaneous delivery at 
less than 37 completed weeks of gestation27 that fol- 
lowed spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture of 
membranes, as there is considerable evidence that the 
risk factors for both are similar and the distinction is 
artiﬁcial.28 Low birth weight (LBW) was assessed as 
positive when the infant had a birth weight under 2,500 
g.27 The birth outcome which occurred after 37 com- 
pleted weeks of gestation or the birth of an infant with 
a weight ≥2,500 g was deﬁned as normal. 
Since the definition of preterm birth depends on 
accurate pregnancy dating, both obstetric and neona- 
tal criteria were used. Estimation of gestational age 
was based on the last menstrual period, ultrasound 
examinations, sequential physical examinations, and 
post-natal examination. All women had an ultrasono- 
graphic examination between 9 to 24 weeks for ges- 
tational age dating and to rule out congenital anom- 
alies. The criterion used to determine the gestational 
age was based on menstrual dates if it differed by less 
than 2 weeks from that determined by an ultrasound 
examination performed at ≤16 weeks of gestation. If 
the patient was unsure of her last menstrual period or 
there was more than a 2-week discrepancy between 
the gestational age based on menstrual dates and the 
ultrasound examination, the determination of gesta- 
tional age was based on the ultrasound assessment if 
this examination had been done before 16 weeks of 
gestation. In the few cases in which the patient had no 
recorded last menstrual dates, or the ultrasound exam- 
ination had been performed after 16 weeks of gesta- 
tion, the obstetrical estimate was based on clinical 
judgment and on the pediatrician’s estimate based on 
the Ballard et al. neonatal assessment.29 Labor and 
delivery management decisions were made by the res- 
ident staff and attending physicians at the hospital. 
They had no knowledge that the patients were partic- 
ipating in a research study. 
The records of patients who delivered before 37 
completed weeks of gestation or who had infants 
weighing less than 2,500 g were reviewed by the obste- 
trician researcher of the study (JG) before a ﬁnal ges- 
tational age assignment was made. An infant born at 
term (≥37 weeks of gestation) with a birth weight less 
than 2500 g was diagnosed as having an intrauterine 
growth restriction if the birth weight was in the tenth 
percentile for gestational age determined on the nomo- 
gram for Chilean newborn infants.30 The obstetrician 
was masked from the mother’s periodontal data. 
Women who had a medically indicated preterm 
delivery that followed pregnancies complicated by 
maternal medical or obstetric disorders; e.g., preeclamp- 
sia or eclampsia, polyhidramnios, gestational diabetes, 
or placenta previa were excluded from the analysis. 
Statistical Analysis 
Women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation 
(PTB) or had a low-birth-weigh infant (LBW) were 
grouped in the preterm/low-birth-weight group (PLBW) 
for the analyses of data to identify the risk factors. The 
analyses included descriptive statistics and both uni- 
variate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. 
Categorical variables were compared by the chi square 
test or Fisher’s exact test and continuous variables 
by the unpaired t test. Multivariable logistic regres- 
sion models were developed to identify the risk fac- 
tors for PLBW starting with all variables included in a 
univariate analysis. A stepwise, multiple logistic 
regression was performed. Unadjusted and adjusted 
odds ratios were calculated with 95% conﬁdence lim- 
its. Data to determine the odds ratios for PTB, LBW, 
and PLBW were analyzed on an intention-to-treat 
basis, regardless of compliance with protocol. The 
intention-to-treat analysis involved all patients who 
were randomly assigned and from whom the preg- 
nancy outcomes were available. Odds ratios for PTB, 
LBW, and PLBW were also determined per protocol 
analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a 
software program.‡ Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned 
as P <0.05. 
RESULTS 
Of the 400 women enrolled, 49 (37 in the treatment 
group and 12 in the control group) women (12.7%) 
were excluded from the multivariate logistic regres- 





sion analyses for different reasons. Of 
the 37 women excluded from the treat- 
ment group, 8 had spontaneous abor- 
tions; 5 had indicated preterm deliver- 
ies due to preeclampsia (n = 1), 
gestational diabetes (n = 1), placenta 
previa (n = 2), or polyhydramnios (n = 
1); 18 withdrew from the periodontal 
treatment because they felt nauseous 
and uncomfortable during the treat- 
ment; and 6 were lost to follow up 
because they moved from the residen- 
tial area and parturition data were not 
available. The 18 women who withdrew 
from periodontal therapy had a normal 
parturition but their periodontal status 
before delivery could not be assessed 
because they were not available for a 
new periodontal examination. Figure 1 
shows the ﬂow diagram of the progress 
through the phases of the study. 
Of the 12 women in the control 
group who were excluded from the 
analyses, 6 had spontaneous abortions, 
2 had indicated preterm deliveries due 
to preeclampsia (n = 1) and poly- 
hidramnios (n = 1), and 4 were lost to 
follow up because they moved from the 
residential area. Three-hundred and 
fifty-three women finished the study, 
163 in the treatment group and 188 in 
the control group. 








Twenty-nine women in the treatment 
group (18%) had severe aggressive 
periodontitis and were given metron- 
idazole 250 mg plus amoxicillin 500 
mg 3 times a day for 7 days in addi- 
tion to the mechanical treatment. 
Antibiotics were always prescribed in women with 
severe periodontitis after they had completed at least 
16 weeks of gestation.

Flow diagram. 
The women in the present study were typically those 
of the Chilean population of low socioeconomic sta- 
tus. This is a mixture of Spanish and local aboriginal 
descent, predominantly Caucasian and with no black 
racial genetic component.31 The mean age was 27.56 
(SD ±4.38) years, 24.5% were single, 62.4% had less 
than 12 years of education, 24.5% smoked, and 23.6% 
were primiparous. The total number of multiparous 
women in both groups was 269, and 21 had a history 
of previous PLBW. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of maternal charac- 
teristics of women in both groups at baseline. The 
treatment group had a mean age one year older than 
that of the control group (P = 0.04), as well as a higher 
percentage of single women (P = 0.001). The distrib- 
ution of all other variables showed no signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences between the groups. Alcohol consumption as 
a variable was eliminated from the study since 88% of 
the women did not drink alcohol during the gestational 
period and the remaining women drank less than 3 
drinks a week. 
Table 2 shows the distribution of women according 
to age. The majority of women in both groups was 
between 26 to 35 years old, with no statistical differ- 
ences in the distribution by age in either group. The 
treatment group had a signiﬁcantly higher mean ges- 
tational age (39.6 ± 1.2 versus 39 ± 2, P = 0.002), a 
higher infant mean weight (3,501 g ± 429 versus 3,344 
± 598, P = 0.004), and a significantly higher mean 
number of prenatal visits (9.4 ± 1.8 versus 7.9 ± 2.3) 
than the control group. Table 3 shows the periodontal 
characteristics of women in the treatment group at 
baseline and after receiving periodontal therapy, and

those of women in the control group at baseline and 
after 28 weeks of gestation. Women in both groups 
had moderate to severe marginal periodontitis, with- 
out signiﬁcant differences between the groups at base- 
line. After receiving periodontal therapy, women in the 
treatment group showed periodontal parameters com- 
patible with periodontal health and all the periodontal 
parameters showed statistically signiﬁcant lower val- 
ues than those of women in the control group (Table 
3). The periodontal characteristics of women in the 
control group did not change signiﬁcantly throughout 
pregnancy. 

There were 22 preterm/low-weight- 
birth-infants (6.26%) in the 351 live births. 
Of these, 14 were due to premature birth 
(3.98%) and 8 were low-birth-weight 
infants (2.27%). The incidence of preterm 
birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and 
of preterm/low birth weight (PLBW) are 
shown in Table 4 using the intention-to- 
treat analysis and per protocol analysis. 
The results of both analyses showed that 
women with periodontal disease had more 
than 5 times the incidence of PLBW and 
of PTB compared with women without 
periodontal disease. The rate of LBW was 
also higher in women with periodontal dis- 
ease, but the difference was not statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant.

Table 5 shows the odds ratios for PTB, 
LBW, and PLBW in women with periodon- 
tal disease using the intention-to-treat 
analysis, and per protocol analysis. The 
results of both analyses show that the odds 
ratios of having a PTB or a PLBW for 
women with periodontal disease are higher 
than 5. The P values and the 95% conﬁ- 
dence intervals show that the relationship 
between periodontal disease and these 
pregnancy outcomes is statistically signif- 
icant. Even though the odds ratio for LBW in women 
with periodontal disease is higher than 6 using both the 
intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, the odds 
ratios are not reliable due to the 95% conﬁdence inter- 
vals including 1. 
Infants with PLBW in the treatment group had a 
higher mean gestational age (34.4 ± 2.4 weeks ver- 
sus 33.6 ± 4) and a higher mean birth weight (2,353 
g ± 112 versus 2,156 ± 562) than in the control group, 
but the differences were not signiﬁcant. 
Five preterm births in the control group and the 2 
preterm births in the treatment group were associated 
with premature rupture of membranes. Of the 2 PTB 
in the treatment group associated with premature rup- 
ture of membranes, one was complicated by acute 
maternal pyelonephritis which began at 31 weeks of 
gestation and the preterm delivery occurred at 32.5 
weeks and the second was associated with recurrent 
vaginosis which began at 28 weeks of gestation and 
lasted until delivery, due to the lack of compliance to 
the antibiotic treatment. 
None of the PLBW in the control group was com- 
plicated by placental abruption, trauma, urinary infec- 
tion, vaginosis, venereal disease, substance abuse, 
clinical chorioamnionitis, birth deffects, genetic syn- 
dromes, or chromosomal aneupliody. None of the 
women received tocolytic agents or non-steroidal anti- 
inﬂammatory drugs.

severe and extended gingival inﬂammation and poorer 
periodontal status than women with normal birth (N = 
329) (Table 6). 
Table 7 shows the results of the univariate analysis 
for risk factors for PLBW. Risk factors that had been 
considered in previous studies and those for which 
there was some biological basis were included. In this 
analysis, PLBW was signiﬁcantly associated with the 
following variables: periodontal disease (OR, 5.99; 95% 
CI, 1.7 to 20.6), less than 6 prenatal visits (OR, 4.98; 
95% CI, 2.02 to 12.2), a previous PTB (OR, 4.07; 95% 
CI, 1.2 to 13.4), and low maternal weight gain (OR, 
3.25; 95% CI, 1.1 to 9.06). Other variables such as 
urinary infections, antibiotic treatment due to urinary 
infections, antibiotic treatment due to periodontal dis- 
ease, vaginosis, multiparity (>3 children), 
primiparous condition, tobacco use, his- 
tory of previous abortion, and beginning 
prenatal care after the 20 weeks of ges- 
tation did not inﬂuence the incidence of 
PLBW.

In the univariate analysis presented 
above, variables that appear to be risk 
factors of PLBW may be surrogates for 
other factors, thereby confounding the 
results. To control some of these inter- 
actions, a multiple logistic regression 
model was constructed in which the fac- 
tors discussed above were examined. 
The results of the multivariate logistic 
regression analyses are shown in Table 
8. The factors significantly associated 
with PLBW, in order of decreasing 
adjusted odds ratios, were periodontal 
disease (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.29 to 17.13), a previ- 
ous PLBW (OR, 3.98, 95% CI: 1.11 to 14.21), less 
than 6 prenatal visits (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.46 to 
9.38), and low maternal weight gain (OR, 3.42, 95% 
CI; 1.16 to 10.03). All the other variables included in 
this study were not significantly related to PLBW, and 
showed OR lower than 1 and 95% CI that included 1. 
Thus, after adjusting for all the other risk factors 
entered into the logistic regression model, women 
with periodontal disease have more than 4 times 
greater risk to have a PLBW than periodontally healthy 
women. 
Table 9 shows the results of the univariate analysis 
for risk factors associated with PTB. Three out of the 
4 risk factors that were found associated with PLBW 
were also associated with PTB. These factors were

periodontal disease, less than 6 prenatal visits, and a 
previous PTB. None of the other factors reached a sig- 
niﬁcant level of association with PTB. 
Figure 2 shows the probability of PLBW in associ- 
ation with the combination of the 4 signiﬁcant risk fac- 
tors identiﬁed in the present study. The combination of 
2, 3, or 4 of the risk factors substantially increased 
the probabilities of PLBW. Periodontal disease com- 
bined with any of the other 3 factors increased the 
probability of PLBW in higher proportion than any other 
possible combination of these factors. A woman with 
periodontal disease, a previous PLBW, low weight gain, 
and less than 6 prenatal visits increased the probabil- 
ity of having another PLBW to 70.4%. 

DISCUSSION 
The method used in the present study attempted to 
control several of the known risk factors of PLBW. 
Women aged from 18 to 35 years were selected 
because maternal age under 18 and over 35 years 
has been found a risk factor for PLBW.3 Only patients 
with a singleton gestation were included because the 
relationship between multiple gestation and preterm 
labor is well established.3 Women were randomly 
assigned to each group equalizing periodontal disease 
as the relevant variable. As the study sample was 
obtained from a homogeneous population in relation 
to age and other demographic characteristics, it was 
assumed that the distribution of other variables would 
be similar in both groups of women. The only 2 sig- 
niﬁcant differences in both groups at baseline were 
the mean age of women (28 versus 27) and the per- 
centage of single women. Both factors were signiﬁ- 
cantly higher in the treatment group. The difference 
of one year in the age of women is irrelevant since 
women in both groups were in the range of age in 
which this factor is not related to PLBW and there 
were no differences in the distribution of women by 
age in either group (Table 2). Unmarried women have 
been generally found to be at a higher rate of preterm 
birth than married women after adjusting for other 
related factors,3 but in the present study, marital sta- 
tus was not found to be related to PLBW. Although 
proper random assignment prevents selection bias, it 
does not always guarantee that the groups are totally 
equivalent at baseline. Any differences in some base- 
line characteristics, as occurred in the present study, 
may be the result of chance rather than bias.32 
Women in the present study had free access to pre- 
natal care services to reduce the risk of adverse birth 
outcomes. A relationship between the use of prena- 
tal care and birth outcomes has been shown33-35 and 
the beneﬁcial effects of prenatal care are strongest 
among socially disadvantaged women.35-37 Adequate 
this care has been associated with 
utilization of 
improved birth weights and a lower risk of preterm 
delivery.38,39 In the present study, it was possible to 
control many of the known risk factors for PLBW, if 
the patients adequately used the prenatal care offered. 
Women with less than 6 prenatal visits or those who 
showed low weight gain during pregnancy inade- 
quately utilized the prenatal care available and were 
at a higher risk of a PLBW. 
After evaluating the relationship between many 
potential factors and PLBW in the present study, 4 sig- 
niﬁcant associations were found: periodontal disease, 
previous PLBW, less than 6 prenatal visits, and low 
maternal weight gain. Of these, periodontal disease 
showed the strongest association in the univariate 
analysis and, after adjustment for confounding vari- 
ables, showed an odds ratio of 4.70 (95% conﬁdence

interval 1.29 to 17.13, Table 8) which suggests that it 
is an independent risk factor for PLBW. Although the 
estimates of odds ratios for the 4 risk factors associ- 
ated with PLBW are high and statistically signiﬁcant, the 
associated conﬁdence intervals are rather wide, indi- 
cating some imprecision in these estimates. The wide 
conﬁdence intervals are probably a consequence of the 
small frequencies of these 4 variables in the PLBW cells 
of the model (Table 7) and to the size of the sample 
used. The study aimed to achieve a sample size of 280 
women in each group. After 160 deliveries had occurred 
in each group of women, an interim analysis was per- 
formed as previously planned, which revealed that the 
difference in PLBW rates between the groups reached 
a P value <0.05. For ethical reasons, it was decided to 
cease enrollment and stop the clinical trial. 
Eighteen women in the treatment group withdrew 
from periodontal therapy because they felt uncom- 
fortable during the treatment appointments. Data from 
the dental public services in Chile show that 12% of 
pregnant women usually abandon dental treatments 
during pregnancy.40 Therefore, our 18 patients prob-

Multivariate Logistic Regression Model for Preterm/Low 
Birth Weight (PLBW) 
Standard Adjusted 
Odds Ratio 




It has been recommended that the prin- 
ciple of 
intention-to-treat analysis be 
applied in reporting randomized controlled 
clinical trial results.41,42 The intention-to- 
treat analysis was designed to compare 
patients in the groups to which they were 
originally randomly assigned in controlled 
trials. This is usually interpreted as includ- 
ing all patients, regardless of whether they 
actually satisﬁed the entry criteria, the treat- 
ment was actually received, and subse- 
quent withdrawal or deviation from the pro- 
tocol. However, there is no consensus about 
the validity of excluding specific 
cases within each of these cate- 
gories from an intention-to-treat 
analysis.43 Some authors have pos- 
tulated that treatment effectiveness 
may be overestimated if an inten- 
tion-to-treat analysis is not done.44 
However, in the current study, after 
including the 18 women who with- 
drew from periodontal treatment in 
the intention-to-treat analysis to 
determine the odds ratios for PTB, 
LBW, and PLBW, it was found that 
all the OR were higher than those 
obtained from the protocol analy- 
sis (Table 5). Thus, the effect of 
periodontal treatment to reduce 
PTB and PLBW appears overesti- 
mated when applying the intention- 
to-treat analysis. The inclusion of 
the 18 patients who withdrew from 
treatment in the intention-to-treat 
analysis assumes that they were 
periodontally healthy at the time of 
the delivery, or at least that the por- 
tion of periodontal treatment they 
had received had reduced the peri- 
odontal infection to a level that did 
not influence the pregnancy out- 
come. Since we could not assess 
the periodontal status of 
these 
patients before delivery, and it has 
been shown that the periodontal 
status of patients who do not com- 
ply with plaque control during treat- 
ment may deteriorate,45,46 we pre- 
ferred not 
to include these 18 
women in the multivariate logistic 
regression analyses. 
ably represent the proportion of Chilean pregnant 
women who abandon dental treatment in routine prac- 
tice and is not an effect of treatment bias. 
The results of the present study 
agree with those of a concurrent cohort study18 that 
included 406 pregnant women with gingivitis or mild 
periodontitis who received treatment before 28 weeks

as compared with non-smokers was 1.4 and 1.6, 
respectively. Of the 351 women in the present study, 
126 women smoked ≥1 cigarettes per day. Of these, 
107 (87.7%) smoked ≥5 cigarettes per day. As the 
percentage of women who smoked <4 cigarettes per 
day was low (12%) and considering that the risk of 
PTB has been found to increase with an increasing 
number of cigarettes smoked, we decided to use the 
case-deﬁnition of non-smoker as one who smoked <5 
cigarettes per day. Thus, the result of the relationship 
between smoking and PLBW in the current study may 
have some limitations. Additionally, data about tobacco 
use in the present study were recorded at the time the 
women entered the study, and we did not verify if 
smoking continued during pregnancy. Prenatal care 
given to women in the present study involved health 
education and strong anti-smoking counseling to 
reduce or eliminate smoking during pregnancy. There- 
fore, a large percentage of smokers probably quit 
smoking, and this may explain the lack of association 
between PLBW and smoking. 
Twenty-nine women in the treatment group were 
given metronidazole and amoxicillin because of severe 
periodontitis. It is possible that this antibiotic therapy 
may have controlled or eliminated other infections 
which may have also been a risk factor for PLBW. 
However, the univariate regression analyses did not 
show a relationship between PLBW and antibiotic treat- 
ment for periodontal disease. 
The association between a previous PLBW and the 
current PLBW, with an odds ratio of 3.98, was the 
strongest risk factor found after periodontal disease, 
even though the prevalence of a previous PLBW was 
rather low (7.80%) in the multiparous women. Several 
other studies have found that a history of PLBW is a 
signiﬁcant risk factor for PTB in subsequent pregnan- 
cies with adjusted odds ratios ranging between 2.45 to 
6.2.3,18,47-50 It is not known why a woman with a pre- 
vious PLBW has a higher risk to have a subsequent 
one. It is possible that in women with a positive his- 
tory of PLBW, the cause of the subsequent PLBW may 
be the same factor that caused the previous PLBW. 
Kramer53 stated that only 25% to 30% of cases of PTB 
can be explained by identified risk factors. Until 
recently, there was no awareness that periodontal dis- 
ease could be a risk factor for PLBW. However, accord- 
ing to the results of the present study, periodontal dis- 
ease may be one of the unidentified risk factors in 
women with a history of previous PLBW. 
The mechanisms by which periodontal disease might 
cause PLBW are still not known, but there is evidence 
that this association has biologically feasible bases. 
The role of prostaglandins (PG) in human labor has 
been well documented.21 Increased amniotic ﬂuid con- 
centrations of PG, including PGE2, have been shown 
in term and preterm labor,55 and the stimulatory effect 

of gestation and 233 women with periodontitis who 
were treated after delivery. In that study, the adjusted 
3.5 risk ratio for women with periodontal disease to 
have a PLBW was lower than the OR of 4.7 found in 
the present study. 
The other factors in the present analysis that were 
signiﬁcantly associated with PLBW are consistent with 
the results of other studies.18,33,38,47-50 Urinary infec- 
tions and vaginosis are well known risk factors of 
PLBW.6-10 There was a signiﬁcant proportion of women 
in the present study who presented urinary infections 
and/or vaginosis, but no association was found 
between these variables and PLBW probably due to 
the adequate treatment of these infections. Since there 
is no data about the effect of oral nitrofurantoin on the 
progression of periodontal disease, the possible inﬂu- 
ence of this antibiotic on periodontal disease in the 
control group was investigated. No differences were 
found in the patients in the control group who received 
nitrofurantoin when we compared their periodontal 
characteristics at baseline with those after 28 weeks 
of gestation, and with those of the patients in the con- 
trol group who did not receive nitrofurantoin (data not 
shown). Additionally, the logistic regression analyses 
detected no relationship between nitrofurantoin therapy 
and PLBW. 
There is convincing evidence that maternal smok- 
ing is associated with LBW and with a moderately 
increased risk for PTB.51,52 In the present study, the 
proportion of smokers was similar in both groups, and 
smoking did not show an association with PLBW. A 
dose-response relationship between smoking and LBW 
has been found, with birth weight impairments increas- 
ing with the number of cigarettes smoked.3,53 In a 
study by Cnattingius et al.,54 the odds ratio for preterm 
delivery among women who smoked 1 to 9 cigarettes 
per day and those who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day

of PGE2 on myometrial contractility is also well known. 
There is also experimental evidence that interleukin- 
1β (IL-1β) might be involved in infection-induced 
preterm labor by interfering with the normal regulation 
of EP1 receptor levels and with the promotion of 
increased PGE2 production in amnion tissue.56 Gingi- 
val crevicular ﬂuid increases considerably in inﬂamed 
periodontal tissues and contains high levels of inﬂam- 
matory mediators. It has been shown that increased 
levels of PGE2 and IL-1β in gingival crevicular ﬂuid in 
patients with periodontal disease were highly corre- 
lated with the levels of intra-amniotic PGE2 and IL- 
1β.23 Additionally, in a pregnant hamster model, sub- 
cutaneous infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a 
common periodontal pathogen, induced elevations in 
intra-amniotic PGE2 and tumor necrosis factor-α and 
result in fetal growth restriction.57 Recently, a prospec- 
tive follow-up study among predominantly African- 
American primiparous women58 found that the sec- 
ond trimester levels of serum antibody against P. 
gingivalis were related to LBW. These studies pro- 
vided evidence that periodontal disease can produce 
an unfavorable change in the fetal environment and 
may be a sufﬁciently infectious challenge to produce 
PLBW. 
The main characteristics of the current study can be 
summarized as follows: 1) periodontal disease was 
diagnosed before the third trimester of pregnancy, 
establishing that the exposure variable was present 
before the occurrence of outcomes. 2) The treatment 
and control groups were similar with respect to the 
risk factors for PLBW and were also comparable in the 
extent and severity of periodontal disease at baseline. 
3) Periodontal therapy administered to the treatment 
group significantly changed the periodontal charac- 
teristics to the level of periodontal health. Thus, for 
the objective of the current study, to determine the 
association between periodontal disease and PLBW, 
women in the treatment group were periodontally 
healthy and without periodontal infection. 4) The peri- 
odontal characteristics of women in the control group 
did not change signiﬁcantly during pregnancy, thus an 
effect of the passage of time, as a confounder factor 
in women in the control group, did not exist. 5) Women 
with PLBW exhibited signiﬁcantly more severe peri- 
odontal disease than women with normal births, which 
may suggest a dose-response relationship. 
The present study analyzed risk factor data for PLBW 
prospectively collected, fulﬁlling several of the criteria 
needed to assess the causal contribution of associated 
factors. To our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst effort 
to examine the relationship between periodontal dis- 
ease and PLBW using a randomized controlled clini- 
cal trial. Additional studies using similar methodology 
in other populations are needed to corroborate these 
results. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Results of the present study showed that: 1) periodontal 
disease is an independent risk factor for PLBW and 
affords more than a 4-fold increase in the risk of PLBW; 
2) other risk factors signiﬁcantly associated with such 
deliveries in the population studied were a history of 
PLBW, less than 6 prenatal visits, and low maternal 
weight gain; and 3) periodontal therapy signiﬁcantly 
reduces the rate of PLBW in women with periodontal 
disease.
