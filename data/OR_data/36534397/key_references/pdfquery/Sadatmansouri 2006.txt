Considering the high prevalence of preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) and their complications as well as the role 
played by periodontal disease in their incidence and the lack of any report of periodontal therapy on these problems in Iran, the 
goal of the present research was to determine the effects of periodontal treatment on PLBW incidence among women with 
moderate or advanced periodontitis who were referred to Javaheri hospital (2004-2005). This clinical trial research was con­ 
ducted on 30 pregnant women age ranging from 18-35 years old, with moderate or advanced periodontitis. Fifteen subjects 
randomly underwent the first phase of periodontal treatment including scaling, root planning and the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine 
mouth rinse for one week. None of these steps were taken for the controls. After necessary follow ups, the effect of periodontal 
treatment on birth term and birth weight were analyzed statistically. This research was conducted on 30 subjects, 15 controls 
and 15 cases in study group. In the control group, the observed rate of PLBW was 26.7% whereas among periodontally treated 
group, phase I, PLBW infant was not observed (P<0.05). Infants birth weight were (3059.3-389.7) gms in study group and 
(3371-394.2) gms in the control group and respectively (P<0.05). Periodontal therapy, phase I, results in a reduction in PLBW 
incidence rate. Therefore, the application of such a simple method among periodontally diseased pregnant women is recom­ 
mended. 

Preterm birth (PTB) which refers to the delivery of a new 
born child before the 37th week of pregnancy and low birth 
weight (LBW) which refers to the birth of a newborn child 
with a weight equal or less than 2500 gms are grouped un­ 
der the term of preterm low birth weight (PLB W).[1] PLBW is 
one of the highly significant causes for mortality and mor­ 
bidity among infant.[2] Approximately 11% of all pregnancies 
lead to PLBW[3] and despite considerable progresses in medi­ 
cal care, this rate is increasing in western countries.[4] PLBW 
infants are greatly exposed to the risk of a number of acute 
and chronic disorders such as respiratory distress syndrome, 
cerebral palsy, heart diseases, epilepsy and severe learning 
disabilities.[5] 
According to statistics nearly 10% of pregnant women in U.S.A 
are affected with pre-term delivery causing more than 60% 
of all neonatal mortality as well as 50% of infants medic care 
expenses in this country.[6] 
The role of infection as an underlying cause for PLBW has 
been investigated earlier and have found relationship be­ 
tween periodontal disease and PTB.[7] It has been found that 
mothers with PLBW babies have more periodontal problems 
than the mothers with normal babies. 
The rate of PLBW among women treated periodontally has 
been reported less than those who have not received such a 
treatment.[1,7,9]

Considering the importance of this problem and the lack of 
any related evidence in this country, the aim of this study 
was to determine the effects of periodontal treatment phase 
I on pregnant women with moderate or advanced periodon­ 
titis. 

In this randomized clinical trial research, pregnant women 
in the 18 to 35 year age group with moderate or advanced 
periodontal disease who were in the 13th to 20th week of 
pregnancy participated. 
Subjects having a history of congenital heart disease requir­ 
ing prophylactic antibiotics, diabetes, current use of corti­ 
costeroids, chronic renal disease, and with the presence of 
fetal congenial abnormality (evaluated ultrasonically until 
the 20th week) were excluded. 
Periodontal parameters including pocket depth, clinical at­ 
tachment loss, bleeding on probing were investigated. 
Pocket depths, from gingival margin to the pocket base, were 
measured and recorded in milimeter for all teeth except the 
third molars, at six points using a Williams probe. Clinical 
attachment loss was also measured in milimeter at surround­ 
ing points of each tooth from CEJ to the base of pocket by a 
Williams probe. Bleeding on probing was evaluated as posi­ 
tive if bleeding was observed within seconds after pocket 
depth measurement, otherwise bleeding on probing was 
considered as negative. Subjects, having 4 or more than 4 
teeth, with at least one site with pocket depth of (equal or 
more than 4 mm) and clinical attachment loss of (equal or 




In this research, 30 pregnant women with moderate or ad­ 
vanced periodontitis were selected. The mean age of con­ 
trol group was 28.4+4.1 whereas that of case group was 
29.1+4.3 (P<0.7). None of the subjects were excluded due 
to abortion, eclampsia, preeclampsia, pregnancy diabetes, 
placenta previa and polyhidramnios. Individual characteris­ 
tics and history of disease of all samples are shown in [Table 
1] revealing that subjects of both groups had equal level of 
educational status, history of previous PLBW maternal 
weight before pregnancy and antibiotic therapy. 
Periodontal characteristics, of each group, in preliminary ex­ 
aminations are shown in [Table 2] displayed no statistically 
significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment 
loss and the percentage of positive bleeding on probing sites 
between groups (P>0.05). 
In the control group repeated periodontal examinations were 
conducted after 28th week of pregnancy while in the study 
group at 2 weeks post treatment (maximally in 30th week). 
Periodontal characteristics in monitored examinations dem­ 
onstrate that periodontal problems were resolved in the treat 
group and significant differences in periodontal character­ 
istics existed between groups (P<0.05) [Table 3]. 
The mean birth weights were 3059+389. 7gr and 
3371+394.2 gr in control and case groups, respectively 
showing 312 gr or 10.2% increase among case subjects. Such 
a difference was statistically significant according to t-test 
analysis (P<0.05). 

more than 3 mm) were diagnosed with periodontal disease. 
Following the selection of 30 women, based on the above 
mentioned criteria, they were randomly divided into two 
groups. Fifteen women, who were less than 28th week of 
pregnant, underwent the first phase of periodontal treat­ 
ment including ultrasonic scaling and hand instrument root 
planning under local anesthesia with Lidocaine or 
Mepivastesin, if needed. Maintenance phase of treatment 
consisted of oral hygiene instructions, use of 0.2% 
chlorhexidine mouth rinse once a night for one week pe­ 
riod and periodontal evaluation once every two weeks prior 
to delivery. 
Control group subjects did not receive any treatment and 
they were recommended all types of periodontal treatment 
after delivery. The studied women were also investigated 
for risk factors including cigarette smoking, genitourinary 
tract infections, history of PLB delivery, weight before preg­ 
nancy and antibiotic therapy due to pregnancy infection. 
Smoking of more than 5 cigarettes was considered as a cri­ 
teria for smokers. Women with vaginal or urinary tract in­ 
fection were suggested to consult with a gynecologist. Moth­ 
ers weight of less than 50 kg before pregnancy was consid­ 
ered as low weight subjects. Those having obstetric disor­ 
ders, e.g, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, preeclamp­ 
sia eclampsia and polyhidramnios were excluded. 
Periodontal examinations were repeated after the 28th week 
of pregnancy for control group and 2nd week after treat­ 
ment (maximally during the 30th week) for the study group. 

Data were subjected to chi square, Fisher’s exact test and T. 
C test for statistical analysis.

case group. Lopez et al. showed that periodontal therapy 
could decrease the rate of PLB incidence in periodontally 
diseased pregnant women,[1] however, the studied subjects 
were not similar in two important risk factors involved in 
PLBW incidence namely the mean age and marital status. 
In the present study, both groups were similar in PLBW in­ 
fluencing factors and significant difference was observed. 
Mitchell et al. suggested that periodontal therapy in 
periodontally diseased pregnant women could lead to a re­ 
duction in PLBW incidence rate.[9] Jeffcoat et al. showed 
that scaling and root planning, among other therapies, 
played more effective role in the reduction of PLBW rate 
and the addition of Metronidazole 250 mg times a day for 
one week was less beneficial.[7] In the present study peri­ 
odontal treatment included scaling and root planing and 
subjects affected with vaginal or genitourinary tract infec­ 
tion were treated by a gynecologist. There was no statisti­ 
cally significant difference in antibiotic therapy between 
groups. Offenbacher et al. showed that pregnant women af­ 
fected with bacterial vaginal infection showed a decrease in 
PLBW incidence rate (P<0.05) which could be justified by 
Metronidazole therapy,[8] however; in Jeffcoat research Met­ 
ronidazole therapy associated with periodontal treatment 
phase I, did not have a influence on PLBW incidence rate.[7] 
Various risk factors are associated with PTB incidence in­ 
clude: low (<17 years) and high (> 37 years) maternal age, 
African race, low socioeconomic status, inadequate prena­ 
tal care, alchohol and tobacco use, hypertension, genitouri­ 
nary tract infection; diabetes, multiple pregnancies, vaginosis 
and a history of previous PTB.[1,6-8] Galloway initially sug­ 
gested that maternal periodontal disease caused potentially 
harmful effects on the developing fetus. These findings were 
not considered important until the time of Offenbacher who 
stated that periodontal infections could act as reservoirs 
for gram negative anaerobes and bacterial lipopolsyaccharide 
(LPS) and endotoxin could increase inflammatory mediators 
including PGE2 IL -C 1 and TNF-;A and pose a potential threat 
to the fetal placental unit, even in the absence of genitouri­ 
nary infection, resulting in preterm labor and premature rup­ 
ture of membrane.[8] Comparisons between post partum 
women with PLBW and their counterparts with normal birth 
outcome revealed higher levels Bacteroides Forsythus and 
Campylobacter rectus for the first group.[9] 
(6.7%) with low birth weight less than 2500 gr, was found 
whereas in periodontally treated subjects no low birth weight 
infants were found. 
In control group, three infants were born before 37th week 
of pregnancy but among periodontally treated group no 
preterm low birth infants were observed. There was not any 
statistically significant difference between groups in the 
number of preterm infants using Fisher’s exact test (P<0.11). 
The treatment group had higher mean gestational period (3 
8.5+O.8 weeks versus 3 7.9+1.3 weeks) [Table 4] than the 
control group, however, the difference was not statistically 
significant (P<0.06). 
The incidence rate of PLBW, both PTB and LBW, is shown in 
[Table 5]. showing incidence rate of 26.7% in the control 
group whereas there was no PLBW infant in the study group. 
Fisher’s exact test proved statistically significant differences, 
in PLBW incident rate between groups (P<0.05). 
The risk of PLBW incidence among control group is several 
times more than the study group. 

The findings of this study showed that periodontal therapy 
significantly reduces the incidence rate of PLBW among preg­ 
nant women with moderate or advanced periodontitis. The 
incidence rate of PLBW, in the control group, was 26.7% 
whereas no PLBW case was observed in the case group. There 
was statistically significant difference in the mean birth 
weight between groups with a 10.2% increase among the

livery.[1] In a lot of investigations, less than 6 prenatal visits 
have been known as influencial risk factors on PLBW inci­ 
dence.[1,8,10] 
In the present study, all pregnant women were referred to 
Javaheri hospital for prenatal care on once a month before 
28th week of gestation and twice a month thereafter, so the 
effect of the risk factor was eliminated. There was no statis­ 
tically significant difference in pre pregnancy weight (less 
than 50 kg) and history of previous PLBW between groups. 
The patients were selected from the same hospital and were 
similar in socioeconomic status. 
Periodontal therapy phase I is able to reduce the incidence 
rate of PLBW. As result, periodontal treatments and oral hy­ 
giene instructions are essential to prevent future complica­ 
tions among pregnant women particularly those with peri­ 
odontitis. Pre pregnancy care and prenatal follow up are 
thought to be the most reasonable choice.
