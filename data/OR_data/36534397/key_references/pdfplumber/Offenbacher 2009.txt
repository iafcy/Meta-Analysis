Abstract
OBJECTIVE—To test the effects of maternal periodontal disease treatment on the incidence of
preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation).
METHODS—The Maternal Oral Therapy to Reduce Obstetric Risk Study was a randomized,
treatment-masked, controlled clinical trial of pregnant women with periodontal disease who were
receiving standard obstetric care. Participants were assigned to either a periodontal treatment arm,
consisting of scaling and root planing early in the second trimester, or a delayed treatment arm that
provided periodontal care after delivery. Pregnancy and maternal periodontal status were followed
to delivery and neonatal outcomes until discharge. The primary outcome (gestational age less than
37 weeks) and the secondary outcome (gestational age less than 35 weeks) were analyzed using a
χ2 test of equality of two proportions.
RESULTS—The study randomized 1,806 patients at three performance sites and completed
1,760 evaluable patients. At baseline, there were no differences comparing the treatment and
control arms for any of the periodontal or obstetric measures. The rate of preterm delivery for the
treatment group was 13.1% and 11.5% for the control group (P=.316). There were no significant
differences when comparing women in the treatment group with those in the control group with
regard to the adverse event rate or the major obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
CONCLUSION—Periodontal therapy did not reduce the incidence of preterm delivery.

Studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk
for various obstetric and fetal complications including preterm delivery, very preterm
–
delivery (less than 32 weeks of gestation), fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia.1 14 A
recent meta-analysis by Vergnes and Sixou that included 17 studies enrolling 7,151 women,
1,056 of whom delivered preterm neonates or low birth weight neonates or both,15 found
that a pooled estimate for the risk of delivery at a gestational age of less than 37 weeks or
having a neonate weighing less than 2,500 g or both in patients with periodontal disease was
2.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95– 4.10, P<.001). However, the authors cautioned
that additional high-quality studies are needed. Results from four randomized, single-center
clinical trials suggest that periodontal treatment during pregnancy may reduce preterm
births.16–19
However, results of a randomized, multicenter clinical trial show no difference
between treatment and control groups for mean gestational age and for preterm birth at less
than 37 weeks.20
The purpose of this article is to present the results of a large, randomized trial that tested the
effects of maternal periodontal disease treatment on the incidence of preterm birth.
METHODS
The Maternal Oral Therapy to Reduce Obstetric Risk Study was a randomized, treatment-
masked, controlled clinical trial of pregnant women with periodontal disease who were
receiving standard obstetric care. Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory response to
the tooth-associated microbial biofilm (plaque) that induces inflammation of the adjacent
tissues and causes local tissue destruction and loss of the tooth attachment apparatus
(ligament and bone). Bacterial biofilms begin on the crown (supragingival) and extend onto
root surfaces under the gumline (subgingival) with penetration into the root surfaces and can
become mineralized as hard deposits (calculus). Nonsurgical treatment of periodontal
disease includes the mechanical removal of supragingival and subgingival microbial
deposits and calculus by debridement using hand or ultrasonic instruments to remove
bacteria and calculus and to plane the root surfaces to removed diseased and bacterially
contaminated root surfaces. The study assessed the effects of nonsurgical periodontal
therapy on rates of preterm delivery as the primary study outcome (defined as delivery at a
gestational age of less than 37 weeks), as compared with a group who received periodontal
care delayed until after delivery. All obstetric and dental examinations were performed by
trained and calibrated obstetric and dental investigators. Safety oversight was provided by an
independent data and safety monitoring board and the institutional review boards at each
participating center. All participants provided written informed consent. Enrollment
occurred between December 2003 and October 2007.
Patients were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center and the affiliated clinic at Lincoln
Health Center, the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center, and two obstetric
sites of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (University Health
Center-Downtown of University Health Systems and Salinas Clinic of the San Antonio
Metropolitan Health District). Pregnant women presenting for obstetric care who were of
legal age to consent and who were able to complete periodontal treatment before 23 6/7
weeks of gestation were recruited and screened for periodontal and obstetric eligibility. To
be eligible, women had to have at least 20 teeth and at least three periodontal sites with at
least 3 mm of clinical attachment loss. Before randomization, women could receive limited
dental care to reduce the likelihood of an acute infectious event during pregnancy. These
limited treatments included the extraction of hopeless teeth and restoration of pulp-
threatening caries.

Gestational age was determined by ultrasound examination performed before 16 weeks.
Women were excluded if they had multiple gestation; history of human immunodeficiency
virus infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, autoimmune disease, or diabetes
(gestational diabetes was acceptable); need for antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal
probing or periodontal treatment; or any obstetric finding that precluded enrollment in the
study. Women with advanced caries or advanced periodontal disease requiring multiple
immediate extractions were excluded.
Eligible participants were assigned randomly to receive periodontal treatment either before
23 6/7 weeks gestational age or after delivery. A permuted block randomization scheme
with a random mixture of block sizes was used, stratifying participants by clinical center.
Dental examiners were masked to treatment assignment of participants until after the
postpartum examination, after the primary obstetric outcome was collected. This was
achieved by using different staff members for examinations and therapy. Different
examination and treatment rooms were used, and schedules were staggered as much as
possible. Dental therapists were instructed not to divulge treatment status to study staff
assigned to postnatal data collection. Participants and staff were instructed to not inform the
postpartum examiner of the pregnancy outcome. The managing physicians were totally
unaware of oral treatment assignments or treatment appointments.
Participants received up to four sessions (mean 1.3, standard deviation ±0.4) of
supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planing using hand and ultrasonic
instruments to complete the baseline therapy. Local anesthesia was used as needed. Those in
the treatment group also received full-mouth tooth polishing and oral hygiene home
instructions. There were no follow-up periodontal treatment visits. After delivery, those in
the delayed-treatment group received periodontal therapy at no cost.
The principal outcome (gestational age less than 37 weeks) included induced or spontaneous
deliveries, fetal demise, and miscarriage but not therapeutic abortions. The study initially
was planned with the primary outcome being the proportion of births with gestational age
less than 35 weeks. Before the start of recruitment, the data and safety monitoring board
recommended switching the primary outcome to births with gestational age less than 37
weeks to improve study power. This change did not involve changing the target sample size.
Secondary outcomes included incidence of gestational age less than 35 weeks; mean birth
weight among neonates adjusting for race, sex, and gestational age; and a composite
measure of neonatal morbidity and mortality before discharge defined as fetal demise after
randomization-neonatal death before discharge from hospital to home or chronic care,
respiratory distress syndrome, proven sepsis, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or
necrotizing enterocolitis requiring treatment. These data were collected from neonatal
intensive care unit records as were data on congenital abnormalities.
Before study initiation, periodontal examiners were trained and calibrated to the reference
examiner to quantify intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability of measuring periodontal
soft and hard tissue indices in both a dental chair and hospital bed. Annual retraining
sessions were held. Percentage agreements for probing depth and attachment loss measures
within 1 mm ranged from 80.5% to 100%, Kappas ranged from 0.755 to 1.000, and
intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.892 to 1.000 (average 0.970). Intraexaminer
Kappa scores between measurements made in the dental chair and the bed were 0.983 and
0.969 for probing depth and clinical attachment loss measures, respectively.
Sample size determination used data from the University of Alabama pilot trial17 and
estimated a preterm (gestational age less than 35 weeks) birth rate of 6% in the delayed
periodontal therapy group compared with 2% in the periodontal therapy group, assuming a

loss to follow-up rate of 3% in each group. We added the 3% loss to follow-up rate to each
group under an intent-to-treat assumption, with the further assumption that all individuals
lost to follow-up had a preterm birth. In this situation, a sample size of 900 per treatment
group would provide power of 91% to detect such a difference between the two treatment
groups. After the data and safety monitoring board recommended changing the primary
outcome from gestational age less than 35 weeks to gestational age less than 37 weeks
without changing the sample size, we determined the detectable treatment effect, using the
same assumptions as above, for several preterm rates in the delayed-treatment group. For
rates of 12%, 16%, and 20%, we would have 90% power to detect differences of 5.1, 5.7,
and 6.2 percentage points, respectively.
Dental examiners conducted comprehensive oral soft tissue (cancer screening) and
periodontal examinations at baseline and delivery. After enrollment, women were followed
up by obstetric surveillance through parturition, followed by a postdelivery dental follow-up
and neonatal surveillance that included chart review after discharge. All reported and
observed adverse events were documented on case-report forms describing onset, duration,
severity, assessment of causality, and relationship to treatment intervention. Participants’
obstetric charts were reviewed weekly to collect adverse events and treatment provided
(outside of routine). All neonatal discharge summary findings were collected to monitor any
adverse neonatal morbidity such as neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Serious
adverse events included preterm labor hospitalization, pre-term birth, birth with maternal or
fetal indications, other hospitalizations, triage, stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, neonatal
death, and congenital anomaly.
Two interim analyses for efficacy were conducted (after 600 and 1,200 completed
pregnancies) using O'Brien-Fleming type boundaries as the decision criteria for efficacy. All
analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle unless stated otherwise. A P
of .05 was used as a cutoff for statistical significance. P-values were not adjusted for
multiple testing. The primary outcome (gestational age less than 37 weeks) and the
secondary outcome (gestational age less than 35 weeks) were analyzed using a χ2 test of
equality of two proportions. Pregnancies that did not end in a live birth (such as
miscarriages) were regarded as part of the unfavorable outcome (gestational age less than 37
weeks or less than 35 weeks). Differences in proportions in outcomes between the treated
group and the control group were tested for statistical significance by χ2 or Fisher exact test.
The primary analysis for whether birth weight among those neonates with gestational ages
less than 37 weeks differed by treatment group used a Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS
Of an estimated total patient pool of 29,000, 10,005 were invited to enroll, of whom 6,748
were potentially eligible and 1,806 were randomized (Fig. 1). Of those who were screened,
there were 1,884 medically ineligible and 1,568 dentally ineligible. Randomizations
occurred from February 2004 to September 2007. Approximately equal numbers of
randomized participants in the two groups provided follow-up data for all outcomes,
although 31.3% of those in the delayed treatment control group did not receive postpartum
periodontal treatment for reasons shown in Figure 1.
The treatment and control (delayed treatment) groups at baseline did not differ in maternal
age, race, ethnicity, marital status, education, insurance or public assistance, maternal weight
or height, or mean gestational age at randomization (19 5/7±2 1/7 weeks, Table 1).
Similarly, the groups did not differ in parity, previous pregnancy histories, self-reported
drug use, or smoking history; however, the treatment group reported significantly higher
alcohol use during pregnancy. With respect to periodontal status, both groups had similar

numbers of teeth, mean bleeding on probing scores, and extent of sites with at least 4 mm of
probing depth. The overall randomization resulted in no significant differences in baseline
characteristics comparing treatment with control groups, and this was also valid for each
performance site, except that the number of nulliparous pregnancies was slightly higher
among the group randomized to treatment at the North Carolina site (29.8% compared with
20.9%, treatment compared with control, respectively, data not shown).
Overall, there were no significant differences comparing women in the treatment group with
those in the control group with regard to the major obstetric and neonatal outcomes of
interest (Table 2). Primary outcome data (gestational age less than 37 weeks) are displayed
in two ways: one considering missing data to be preterm delivery and the other in which the
missing data are omitted (not intent-to-treat). There were no differences between those in the
treatment and control groups in either of these analyses. For intent-to-treat analyses, the
odds ratios (ORs) for gestational age less than 37 were 1.219 (95% CI 0.0893–1.664), for
gestational age less than 35 0.998 (95% CI 0.640 –1.554), and for gestational age less than
32 1.138 (95% CI 0.637–2.033). Similarly, there were no differences between those in the
treatment and control groups for secondary outcomes including mean birth weight,
distribution of low birth weight categories, Apgar scores, neonatal intensive care unit
admissions, rate of prematurity at gestational ages less than 35 weeks and less than 32
weeks, and incidence of preeclampsia. The ORs for intrauterine growth restriction were
0.801 (95% CI 0.604 –1.062), for birth weights less than 2,500 1.008 (95% CI 0.716 –
1.419), and for birth weights less than 1,500 1.148 (95% CI 0.543–2.428).
Changes in periodontal status are given in Table 3. There was a significant worsening of
periodontal status among patients in the delayed treatment (control) group. For example,
there was an increase in overall mean probing depths of 0.23±0.02 mm among those in the
control group. However, there was a significant interaction effect between all probing-depth
measures and clinical center. In Alabama and North Carolina, both the control and treatment
groups got worse (positive change score), with the control group having a statistically
greater mean change in probing depth (P<.001 and P<.022, respectively). In Texas,
periodontal status of the control group changed little during the study, and the treatment
group improved (negative change score), resulting in a significant difference between
groups (P<.001). The changes in percentage of sites with probing depths of 4 mm or more
present a similar pattern of change. However, the percentage of sites with probing depths of
5 mm or more decreased in the treatment groups at Alabama and Texas, whereas both
groups in North Carolina increased. There was no center interaction effect for attachment
level and bleeding on probing measurements, with both measures being significantly better
in the treatment group as compared with the control group (P=.005 and P<.001,
respectively).
The data in Table 3 show that treatment effects on periodontal status varied among centers
and that the restoration of periodontal health may not have been achieved. Therefore, we
conducted a non–intent-to-treat analysis to investigate the proportion of women meeting
various definitions of periodontal health. These definitions were chosen a priori to evaluate
the effectiveness of the periodontal therapy. Table 4 presents the number and percentage of
women meeting various definitions of periodontal health at baseline and delivery. At
baseline, no women met the definition of having all periodontal pockets less than 4 mm; at
delivery, four women in the control group (0.5%) and seven in the treatment group (1.0%)
met the criterion (P=.32). For periodontal pockets less than 5 mm, more women in the
control group met the definition at baseline than at delivery, with the treatment group
displaying the opposite pattern (P=.02). Aproximately 12–18% of women in both groups
had less than 10% of sites with bleeding on probing at delivery. We also defined periodontal
health as a shallow probing depth (3 mm or less) in the relative absence of bleeding on

probing (less than 10%). Very few women met this stringent criterion. Because a previous
study linked incidence or progression of probing depth to increased risk of preterm birth,21
we used the same definition of disease progression in this analysis. Among women in the
control group, 30.5% had no progression during pregnancy compared with 40.7% in the
treatment group. In summary, although the treatment group had less postpartum periodontal
disease than did the control group, only a small proportion of the treatment group achieved
what would be considered periodontal health, and we failed to arrest disease progression
between baseline and delivery in 40.7% of the treatment group.
There was no significant difference in the frequency of control and treatment group
participants with serious adverse events. There were 119 (13.4%) participants reporting one
or more serious adverse events among those randomized to treatment (total n=887) and 101
(11.4%) among those in the control group (total n=884), P=.20 (χ2). Comparing the two
groups (n events treatment group/n events control group), there were no significant
differences in the observed outcomes of serious adverse events, which included preterm
labor hospitalization (15/15), pre-term birth (36/34), birth with maternal or fetal indications
(40/34), other hospitalizations (35/25), triage (8/3), stillbirth or spontaneous abortion (7/7),
neonatal death (4/2), and congenital anomaly (15/12).
DISCUSSION
Although the periodontal therapy resulted in a small but statistically significant
improvement for many periodontal clinical signs relative to the delayed-treatment group,
periodontal treatment did not restore most participants to periodontal health. The results
from this study are in general agreement with previous findings of the Obstetrics and
Periodontal Therapy study,20 which demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy
did not alter the rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, or fetal growth restriction. So, what
factors may explain the lack of any effect of this periodontal intervention on pregnancy
outcomes?
One explanation is that periodontal disease does not influence preterm birth rates; the
accumulated evidence to date has not been sufficient to conclude that periodontal disease is
a cause or even an effect modifier in combination with other factors for pre-term birth. A
second explanation may be that periodontal disease does increase the risk for preterm birth,
but treatment of this exposure does not reduce that risk. Stamilio et al, commenting on a
meta-analysis of studies on periodontal disease and preterm birth, notes that causation and
treatment efficacy can be interrelated or they can function independently.22 For example,
bacterial vaginosis is considered to be one contributing cause of preterm birth, yet antibiotic
treatment of bacterial vaginosis in controlled trials did not reduce the risk of prematurity.23
At this point, there is not sufficient evidence to determine whether periodontal disease
simply does not increase risk for preterm birth or whether it does increase risk but treatment
as performed in this study was ineffective in decreasing preterm birth. This is in contrast to
the recent meta-analysis by Polyzos etal,24 which includes data from seven trials including
the large OPT trial. This meta-analysis concludes that periodontal therapy reduces the risk of
preterm birth for gestational age less than 37 weeks (overall OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35–0.86,
P=.008, n=2,527 births). Further, the greatest benefit was seen among patients with less
periodontal disease at baseline and no previous preterm deliveries, suggesting that
prevention or other modalities of intervention including preconception or intraconception
may be more efficacious rather than treatment of severe disease during pregnancy, such as in
this study.
A third possibility is that preterm birth and periodontal disease both share a common
underlying condition or trait, for example, an exaggerated inflammatory response that might

explain the clinical response to the oral infection and the inflammatory process associated
with obstetric complications. In this type of model, periodontal disease would contribute to
the inflammatory burden and may be an effect modifier for the relationship between other
conditions and the outcome (eg, subclinical vaginosis and preterm birth).
Any randomized, controlled trial assumes that the treatment provided is successful in
reducing the level of the exposure. However, the treatment of periodontal disease is not
always successful, and pregnancy itself poses an additional risk for periodontal disease onset
and progression.21 Thus, a fourth possibility is that the periodontal intervention itself was
not successful in returning the study participants to a healthy periodontal status. The data
shown in Table 4 illustrate this point using definitions of periodontal health that have been
published previously.25 In the Oral Conditions and Pregnancy Study,26 we identify maternal
periodontal progression (as defined in Table 4) as the strongest periodontal indicator for
prematurity. In the present study, 40.7% of the treatment group demonstrated progression.
Bleeding on probing levels, which are a marker of potential systemic infectious exposure,
and disease activity are high in both groups. These findings suggest that a single treatment
employing only scaling and root planing was not adequate to control gingival inflammation
between baseline and delivery.
Finally, there are striking analogies between the findings of the larger randomized controlled
trials to treat periodontal disease and those targeting bacterial vaginosis. Both exposures
represent putative risk factors in many but not all studies and appear as opportunistic biofilm
infections dominated by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. There is ample evidence of
periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Campylobacter rectus
displaying placental tropism and creating fetal exposure in utero.27 The biologic plausibility
of the potential role of these organisms in mediated pregnancy and neonatal development
pathologies is well established; however, trials designed to reduce or eliminate these
infections appear to have been ineffective. Randomized controlled trials that more
effectively control the micro-biome of the oral and reproductive tract are necessary to better
control the role of this potentially noxious maternal–fetal burden.
Periodontal therapy as provided in this protocol did not reduce the incidence of preterm
delivery at less than 37, 35, or 32 weeks of gestational age, weight for gestational age, or
neonatal morbidity. Periodontal therapy consisting of a single treatment of scaling and root
planing and oral hygiene instruction was ineffective in resolving gingival inflammation and
preventing disease progression in the majority of these pregnant women.
