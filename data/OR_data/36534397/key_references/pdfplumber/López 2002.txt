Periodontal Therapy May Reduce the Risk
of Preterm Low Birth Weight in Women
With Periodontal Disease: A Randomized
Controlled Trial
Néstor J. López,* Patricio C. Smith,* and Jorge Gutierrez†
Background: Recent studies have suggested that periodon-
tal disease is a risk factor for preterm low birth weight (PLBW).
A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to help further
evaluate the proposed association between periodontal disease
and PLBW.
Methods: Four hundred pregnant women with periodontal
disease, aged 18 to 35, were enrolled while receiving prenatal
care in Santiago, Chile. Women were randomly assigned to either Low birth weight and its 2 compo-

respectively. Of the 351 women in the present study,
126 women smoked ≥1 cigarettes per day. Of these,
107 (87.7%) smoked ≥5 cigarettes per day. As the
percentage of women who smoked <4 cigarettes per
day was low (12%) and considering that the risk of
PTB has been found to increase with an increasing
number of cigarettes smoked, we decided to use the
case-definition of non-smoker as one who smoked <5
cigarettes per day. Thus, the result of the relationship
between smoking and PLBW in the current study may
have some limitations. Additionally, data about tobacco
