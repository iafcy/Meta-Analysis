The hypothesis that there is a possible connection between pre-term delivery

However, there is still controversy as to whether there is a true correlation

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the protection of human
study participants.
Women with any systemic medical problem, undergoing a multiple (twins, triplets,
etc.) pregnancy, or with a history of previous pre-term birth or miscarriage were
excluded. Mothers who smoked, consumed alcoholic drinks in a great amount, took
drugs, or suffered malnutrition were also excluded, as were those who would require
antibiotics for invasive procedures.
Sample Size
Before the study, a sample size calculation was performed which related birthweight

95% test power for a two-sample t test, N = 39 was the necessary minimum case
number. To show a two-week difference in delivery time, at 2.5 SD and 95% power,
the desired minimum sample size was N = 42.
