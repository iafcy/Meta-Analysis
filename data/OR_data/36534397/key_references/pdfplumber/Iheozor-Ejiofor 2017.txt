Background
Periodontal disease has been linked with a number of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and adverse pregnancy
outcomes, all likely through systemic inflammatory pathways. It is common in women of reproductive age and gum conditions tend
to worsen during pregnancy. Some evidence from observational studies suggests that periodontal intervention may reduce adverse
pregnancy outcomes. There is need for a comprehensive Cochrane review of randomised trials to assess the effect of periodontal treatment
on perinatal and maternal health.
Objectives
To assess the effects of treating periodontal disease in pregnant women in order to prevent or reduce perinatal and maternal morbidity
and mortality.
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 6 October 2016),
Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (to 7 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016,
Issue 9) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 6 October 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 6 October 2016), and LILACS BIREME Virtual
Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 6 October 2016). ClinicalTrials.gov and the
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 6 October 2016. We placed no
restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of periodontal treatment in preventing or reducing perinatal
and maternal morbidity and mortality. We excluded studies where obstetric outcomes were not reported.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data using a prepiloted data extraction form. Missing data
were obtained by contacting authors and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Where appropriate, results of

comparable trials were pooled and expressed as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) . The random-
effects model was used for pooling except where there was an insufficient number of studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence
using GRADE.
Main results
There were 15 RCTs (n = 7161 participants) meeting our inclusion criteria. All the included studies were at high risk of bias mostly due
to lack of blinding and imbalance in baseline characteristics of participants. The studies recruited pregnant women from prenatal care
facilities who had periodontitis (14 studies) or gingivitis (1 study).The two main comparisons were: periodontal treatment versus no
treatment during pregnancy and periodontal treatment versus alternative periodontal treatment. The head-to-head comparison between
periodontal treatments assessed a more intensive treatment versus a less intensive one.
Eleven studies compared periodontal treatment with no treatment during pregnancy. The meta-analysis shows no clear difference in
preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10; 5671 participants; 11 studies; low-quality evidence) between periodontal treatment
and no treatment. There is low-quality evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight < 2500 g (9.70% with periodontal
treatment versus 12.60% without treatment; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; 3470 participants; 7 studies).
It is unclear whether periodontal treatment leads to a difference in preterm birth < 35 weeks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.76; 2557 participants;
2 studies; ) and < 32 weeks (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.32; 2755 participants; 3 studies), low birth weight < 1500 g (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38 to
1.70; 2550 participants; 2 studies), perinatal mortality (including fetal and neonatal deaths up to the first 28 days after birth) (RR 0.85, 95%
CI 0.51 to 1.43; 5320 participants; 7 studies; very low-quality evidence), and pre-eclampsia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62; 2946 participants;
3 studies; very low-quality evidence). There is no evidence of a difference in small for gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 3610
participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence) when periodontal treatment is compared with no treatment.
Four studies compared periodontal treatment with alternative periodontal treatment. Data pooling was not possible due to clinical
heterogeneity. The outcomes reported were preterm birth < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g
and perinatal mortality (very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in < 37 weeks, preterm birth < 35 weeks, birth
weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 1500 g and perinatal mortality when different periodontal treatments are compared because the quality
of evidence is very low.
Maternal mortality and adverse effects of the intervention did not occur in any of the studies that reported on either of the outcomes.
Authors' conclusions
It is not clear if periodontal treatment during pregnancy has an impact on preterm birth (low-quality evidence). There is low-quality
evidence that periodontal treatment may reduce low birth weight (< 2500 g), however, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. There
is insufficient evidence to determine which periodontal treatment is better in preventing adverse obstetric outcomes. Future research
should aim to report periodontal outcomes alongside obstetric outcomes.

Treating gum disease to prevent adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women
What is the aim of this review?
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if treating gum disease can prevent adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women. Cochrane
researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 15 relevant studies.
Key messages
There is no evidence that the treatment of gum disease reduces the number of babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, however, it may
reduce the number of babies born weighing less than 2500 g. It is uncertain whether there is a difference in adverse birth outcomes when
different methods of treating gum disease are compared.
What was studied in the review?
Gum health tends to worsen during pregnancy. There has been some research associating gum disease with adverse birth outcomes. The
review assessed studies where pregnant women with gum disease were treated using a combination of different mechanical techniques
with or without antibiotics.
What are the main results of the review?
The review authors found 15 relevant studies. Five were from North America, four from South America, three from Europe, two from Asia
and one from Austalia. Eleven studies compared either scaling and root planing or scale and polish with no treatment while the other four
studies compared scaling and root planing with alternative mechanical treatments.

When pregnant women with gum disease who receive periodontal treatment are compared with those who receive no treatment:
- there is no clear difference in the number of babies born before 37 weeks (low-quality evidence);
- there may be fewer babies born weighing less than 2500 g (low-quality evidence).
It is unclear if one periodontal treatment is better than alternative periodontal treatments in preventing adverse birth outcomes.
How up-to-date is this review?
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to October 2016.

Number analysed: n = 366 (attrition n = 2 participants delivered elsewhere)
Interventions A) Antenatal periodontal treatment - SRP + placebo capsule (n = 123): scaling and root planing was
performed according to usual clinical procedures and clinicians were instructed to spend as much time
and as many visits as needed
B) Antenatal periodontal treatment - SRP + metronidazole capsule (n = 120): metronidazole was
taken 250 mg 3 times a day for 1 week. Scaling and root planing was performed according to usual clin-
ical procedures and clinicians were instructed to spend as much time and as many visits as needed
C) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Dental prophylaxis + placebo capsule (n = 123): tooth cleaning
and polish (supragingival scaling and rubber cup polish) + placebo capsule 3 times daily
All women: received oral hygiene instructions from a dental hygienist and supplies of toothbrushes,
dental floss and fluoride toothpaste
Dental hygienists carried out examinations at baseline supervised by periodontists. SRP was adminis-
tered by "clinicians"
Outcomes Preterm birth rate (< 35 weeks); preterm birth rate (< 37 weeks)
Intention-to-treat analysis was applied and the prevalence of preterm birth calculated for each of the 3
randomised treatment groups
Funding Not stated

Notes It was believed that 280 women in each group might detect a significant difference of preterm low birth
weight between groups with a power of 80%. Data to determine the odds ratios for preterm birth, low
birth weight and preterm low birth weight were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. 29 women in
the treatment group had severe aggressive periodontitis and were given metronidazole and amoxicillin
(3 times daily) for 7 days in addition to mechanical treatment

Methods Study design: RCT
Location: USA
Setting: Periodontal Infections and Prematurity Study (PIPS), a multicentre trial, was conducted in 3
antenatal clinics in metropolitan Philadelphia, USA
Recruitment period: not stated
Participants Inclusion criteria: women between 6 and 20 weeks gestation with periodontal disease who returned
for the scheduled treatment visit
Exclusion criteria: periodontal treatment during pregnancy, antibiotic use within 2 weeks; use of an-
timicrobial mouthwash within 2 weeks, multiple gestation, and known mitral valve prolapse
Mean age (± standard deviation (years)): Group A = 24.1 ± 5.2, Group B = 24.4 ± 5.7 (P = 0.41)
Gestational age: 6 to 20 weeks
History of preterm delivery (%): Group A = 11.7, Group B = 12.9 (P = 0.62)
Periodontal characteristics: periodontal disease was defined as attachment loss ≥ 3 mm on ≥ 3 teeth.
Moderate/severe - Group A = 54.8, Group B = 55.3 (P = 0.9)
Number randomised: n = 756
Number evaluated: n = 713 (attrition n = 43; lost to follow-up n = 43)
Interventions A) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Scaling and root planing (n = 376)
B) Antenatal periodontal treatment - Superficial tooth cleaning procedure (n = 380): superfi-
cial tooth cleaning procedure involved using the rotating cup to remove stains and plaque from the
supragingival portion of the tooth using minimally abrasive polishing past. No sharp instruments were
used for the subgingival removal of calculus
Interventions were delivered by hygienists
Outcomes Spontaneous preterm birth (occurring < 35 weeks of gestation because of either idiopathic preterm
labour or from preterm premature rupture of the amniotic membranes); < 37 weeks of gestational age,
< 35 weeks gestational age; gestational age at delivery; birth weight; neonatal adverse outcomes (res-

haemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, death), stillbirth, miscarriage
Funding Not stated
Notes For a prevalence of preterm birth at < 35 weeks of gestation of 7%, it was estimated that 636 partici-
pants would be needed per treatment group and the goal was to recruit 700 subjects per treatment
group. However, because of temporal restraints that were mandated by the mechanism of funding, en-
rolment stopped after 3 years of recruitment, which was well before the target sample size was reached

Setting: the Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) Study, a multicentre trial, was conducted in
Hennepin County Medical Centre (Minnesota), the University of Kentucky, the University of Mississippi
Medical Center and Harlem Hospital (New York)
Recruitment period: March 2003 to June 2005
Participants Inclusion criteria: at least 16 years of age, less than 16 weeks 6 days gestation, at least 20 natural
teeth, and the presence of periodontal disease (4 or more teeth with a probing depth of at least 4 mm
and a clinical attachment loss of at least 2 mm, as well as bleeding on probing at 35% or more of tooth
sites)
Exclusion criteria: multiple pregnancy, required antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal procedures,
medical condition that precluded elective dental treatment, had extensive tooth decay, or likely to
have fewer than 20 teeth after treatment of moderate to severe caries, abscesses or other non-peri-
odontal pathoses. Baseline assessments were conducted between 13 weeks 0 days and 16 weeks 6

Number randomised: n = 823
Number evaluated: n = 823 (for gestational age); (attrition n = 11: lost to follow-up n = 7, withdrawal n
= 2, elective abortion n = 2)
Interventions A) Antenatal periodontal treatment; before 21 weeks gestation (n = 413): scaling and root planing un-
til birth; removal of dental plaque and calculus from the tooth enamel and root (up to 4 treatment vis-
its were allowed); instruction in oral hygiene, monthly tooth polishing and reinstruction in oral hygiene
(actual treatment time = mean 127.7 minutes and 2.0 visits)
B) Postnatal periodontal therapy (n = 410): brief oral examination at monthly follow-ups; attended
the same number of visits as the treatment in pregnancy group; periodontal therapy after birth
All women: topical or systemic antimicrobials were not used; at study entry, all women were screened
for periodontal disease in the obstetric clinic (assessed attachment loss, probing depth, bleeding on
probing on 6 sites on each tooth, evaluation of dental plaque and calculus on selected teeth). Women
were referred to a dentist for treatment of teeth that were abscessed, fractured or likely to become
symptomatic during the study. Full-mouth assessments were repeated at 21 to 24 weeks gestation and
again at 29 to 32 weeks gestation
Over half the women (59%) were judged to need essential dental care (239 (61%) in the treatment
group and 244 (57%) in the control group) and 73% of these women (74% in the treatment group and
71% in the control group) completed the recommended treatment. Control women with progressive
periodontitis at 6 or more sites were offered full-mouth scaling and root planing. Treatment group par-
ticipants with progressive disease at 6 or more tooth sites were referred to a consulting periodontist
and could receive a second course of full-mouth scaling and root planing and/or systemic antibiotics,
or subgingival irrigation with antimicrobial solutions

birth, but this was subsequently dropped due to very low eligibility rates. Pregnant women < 22 weeks
gestation ≥ 18 years of age at time of scaling and root planing or supragingival polish, 2 or more sites
measuring ≥ 5 mm probing depths plus periodontal attachment loss of 1 to 2 mm at 1 or more sites
with probing depths ≥ 5 mm; ≥ 20 teeth

acceptable), any medical contraindication to periodontal probing (e.g. congenital heart disease), and
use of phentermine and fenfluramine (phen-fen) for weight loss; currently undergoing periodontal
treatment, chronic regimen of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chronic use of med-
ications that cause gingival enlargement such as phenytoin, cyclosporin-A, or calcium channel antago-
nists, 5 or more teeth requiring extraction, rampant decay or any other oral condition that, in the clini-

Notes Before randomisation, women could receive limited dental care to reduce the likelihood of an acute
infectious event during pregnancy including the extraction of hopeless teeth and restoration of pulp-
threatening caries. Sample size determination used data from the University of Alabama pilot trial and
estimated a preterm (gestational age < 35 weeks) birth rate of 6% in the delayed periodontal therapy
group compared with 2% in the periodontal therapy group. A sample size of 900 per treatment group
would provide power of 91%, however, the primary outcome was changed due to advice from the mon-
itoring board without change of sample size

ening preterm birth, otherwise healthy with a singleton pregnancy
Exclusion criteria: women with any systemic medical problem, multiple pregnancy, history of previ-
ous preterm birth or miscarriage, smokers, high consumption of alcohol, drug use, malnourished or
women requiring antibiotics for invasive procedures
Mean age (± standard deviation (years)): Group A = 29.1 ± 6.4, Group B = 28.9 ± 5.4 (P = 0.888)

50% of teeth
Number randomised: n = 89
Number evaluated: n = 83 (attrition n = 6 lost to follow-up)
Interventions A) Antenatal periodontal treatment (n = 43 (41)): treatment around 32 weeks gestational age (oral hy-
giene instruction), supra and subgingival scaling with hand instruments and/or ultrasonic scaler, teeth
polishing with a fluoride paste. The women were examined and treated by a periodontist
B) Postnatal periodontal treatment (n = 46 (42)): treatment was suggested postbirth
Outcomes Preterm birth (< 37 weeks); low birth weight (< 2500 g); gestational age at birth
Funding Funded through 'institutional support'
Notes Power calculation was performed which related birth weight assessment and time of gestation. Assum-
ing a 500 g birth weight difference at a 95% test power for a 2-sample t-test, n = 39 was the necessary
minimum case number. To show a 2-week difference in delivery time, at 2.5 standard deviation and

Study Reason for exclusion
Gazolla 2007 The control group consisted of women who refused to participate and were classed as the 'non-
treated' group. There was no randomisation
Geisinger 2014 Not an RCT. The study was used in generating preliminary data for another RCT
Jeffcoat 2011 Overlap with an included study (Jeffcoat 2003) and does not contain useful additional information
to supplement the primary publication
Jiang 2016 The study compared antimicrobial mouthrinse with toothbrushing. Antimicrobial mouthrinse
alone is not considered a periodontal treatment, however, it can be used as an adjunct to a me-
chanical periodontal treatment
Moreira 2014 Population consisted of a subsample of participants included in a study (Weidlich 2013) which was
excluded for the wrong study population. There is lack of clarity on whether the concerns we had
about the primary study were addressed in this study and obstetric outcomes were not reported

Adverse effects of the therapy were previously considered a secondary outcome, however, due to their importance they were eventually
listed as a primary outcome.
We planned to report different measures of gestational age and birth weight. Mean gestational age (weeks) and mean birth weight (grams/
kilograms) were reported, however, the rarity of the outcomes and skewness of data precluded our pooling these data. We did not present
these outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables.
We were unable to carry out any of the planned subgroup analyses due to insufficient data.
At protocol stage we stated our intention to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. We decided to generate a 'Summary
of findings' table for the main comparison alone (periodontal treatment versus no treatment).
We planned to report preterm birth < 34 weeks and < 28 weeks. Eventually we used the cut-offs that were reported in the included studies
(preterm birth < 35 and < 32 weeks).
Following editorial comments, we changed the 'Types of interventions' section to: "Treatment during pregnancy for periodontal disease,
performed by a dentist, dental hygienist or therapist (including mechanical debridement using scaling and root planing, polishing, or
surgery), either singly or in combination with counselling on oral hygiene, antiseptic oral agents, topical or systemic antimicrobial therapies
compared with either placebo (for adjunctive treatment), no treatment or alternative treatments."
