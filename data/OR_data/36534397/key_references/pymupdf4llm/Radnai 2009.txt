#### Abstract
##### There is growing evidence that chronic periodontitis may be a risk factor for pre-term birth. The goal of this intervention study was to determine the effect of periodontal treatment on the pregnancy outcome in women with threatening pre-term birth and initial localized chronic periodontitis. Forty-one women with a singleton pregnancy were enrolled in the study. For this treatment group, oral hygiene instruc- tion and periodontal therapy were provided in the third trimester, while those in the control group (42 persons) did not receive any periodontal treatment. In the treatment group, the mean weight of new- borns was 3079.0 g, compared with the control group mean of 2602.4 g. The incidence of pre-term birth and low birthweight in the treatment group was significantly less than in the control group (p = 0.015). Periodontal treatment completed before the 35th week appeared to have a beneficial effect on birth weight and time of delivery.

#### Key words: newborn, pregnancy, periodon##### tal therapy, periodontitis, pre-term birth.

## Benefits of Periodontal Therapy When Preterm Birth Threatens

#### INTRODUCTION

##### he hypothesis that there is a possible connection between pre-term delivery and periodontal disease in pregnant women emerged in the early 1990s.
# T
##### However, there is still controversy as to whether there is a true correlation among periodontal infection, pre-term delivery, and restriction of fetal growth. Study designs have varied—some epidemiological (Offenbacher et al., 1996;
###### Farrell et al., 2006), some microbiological (Madianos et al., 2001; Urbán
##### et al., 2006), and others interventional (Jeffcoat et al., 2003; Sadatmansouri et al., 2006). A positive correlation between periodontitis and pre-term delivery (Dasanayake, 1998; Bosnjak et al., 2006; Radnai et al., 2006) was shown in a majority of these studies, although some epidemiological (Moore et al.,2004; Skuldbøl et al., 2006) and interventional (Mitchell-Lewis et al., 2001; Michalowicz et al., 2006) studies showed no significant relationship between maternal periodontitis and pre-term delivery. Hence, conclusive evi- dence appears to be lacking. An intervention study could provide further evidence of a possible causal effect of periodontitis on pre-term delivery. Thus, the aim of our investigation was to assess the potential beneficial effects of periodontal treat- ment during pregnancy on the birthweight and the time of delivery.

#### MATERIALS & METHODS

##### Study Population

The study population consisted of 83 systemically healthy Caucasian women who were
hospitalized due to threatened pre-term delivery at the University of Szeged, Department
of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The women were screened, and those with periodontal
disease were randomized to either a periodontal treatment or a no-treatment protocol.
After being informed of the aims and methods of the study, they agreed to participate.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the protection of human
study participants.
Women with any systemic medical problem, undergoing a multiple (twins, triplets,
etc.) pregnancy, or with a history of previous pre-term birth or miscarriage were
excluded. Mothers who smoked, consumed alcoholic drinks in a great amount, took
drugs, or suffered malnutrition were also excluded, as were those who would require
antibiotics for invasive procedures.

##### Sample Size

Before the study, a sample size calculation was performed which related birthweight
assessment and time of gestation. Hence, assuming a 500 g birthweight difference at a
95% test power for a two-sample _t_ test, N = 39 was the necessary minimum case
number. To show a two-week difference in delivery time, at 2.5 SD and 95% power,
the desired minimum sample size was N = 42.

##### Treatment and Control Group Enrollment

The study was carried out in 2005 and 2006. During the two study years, there were
4167 deliveries at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in Szeged. Among


-----

those women who delivered during that time-span, 429 women were
admitted to the hospital because of threatened pre-term birth, and
were treated as in-patients. More than half did not meet inclusion
criteria, or refused to participate (281 women). The periodontal status
of 148 women was examined, and those who were periodontally
healthy were identified. Initial localized chronic periodontitis was
found in 89 women. For the allocation of the participants for
periodontal treatment, we used a block randomization with blocks of
two. We generated a random sequence of 1’s and 2’s, and the treatment
was allocated accordingly to the 1st or 2nd person in the blocks,
leaving the other for the control group. There were 43 women in the
treatment and 46 in the control group. Finally, data pertaining to 83
women were analyzed (Fig.), since six women were not available for
follow-up (two in the treatment, four in the control groups). The
dentist who examined and treated the women was blind to the
pregnancy outcome.

##### Collection of Demographic and Socioeconomic Data

A questionnaire was used to record demographic data, and actual and
previous general medical and obstetric histories, including information
regarding the socio-cultural status and educational levels of both the
mother and the father. Educational levels were defined as follows:
primary school (8 yrs), technical school (3 yrs post-primary school),
grammar school (4 yrs after primary school), and higher education
(university or college). The parents’ occupations were categorized as
manual worker, intellectuals/professionals, or ‘other occupation,’ _e.g.,_
taxi driver, housewife, office worker. Place of residence was defined as
being either in a city or in a village.

##### Periodontal Status Measurements

Periodontal examinations were completed at the Department of
Obstetrics & Gynecology, where a dental unit with an ultrasonic scaler
was installed. This area was suitable for dental examinations and the
undertaking of professional oral hygiene treatment and periodontal
status measurements. Examinations and periodontal treatment were
carried out by the same dental clinician.
To measure probing depth, the clinician used a disposable periodontal probe with a tip diameter of 0.5 mm. The depth was taken from
the gingival margin to the most apical point of the sulcus/pocket, at
6 sites per tooth, i.e., mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,
mid-lingual, and distolingual. Bleeding on probing was regarded as
positive if it occurred within 15 sec after the probing depth was measured at any tooth site, and was recorded dichotomously.
Examinations were completed by the same team member, and the
examiner, who was an experienced periodontologist, re-examined 20
women after a 30-minute time period had elapsed, to test reproducibility.

##### Definition of Preterm Delivery and Threatened Preterm Birth

Premature delivery (WHO, 1950) implies labor that occurs at fewer
than 37 complete wks of gestation, and is generally accompanied by
low birthweight, i.e., a birthweight < 2500 g.
Gestational age at delivery and periodontal treatment were calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period, or based on the
results of ultrasonic examination, which was provided in the first trimester of pregnancy. Threatened pre-term birth, between the completed
24th and 37th wks, includes obstetric events during pregnancy, such as
premature rupture of the membranes, or necessity of treatment for premature uterine activity and/or cervical dilation. Women with this condition received special obstetric treatment to maintain their pregnancy as
long as possible. The therapy consisted of, first, bed rest, then tocolytic
agents (intravenous MgSO4/Gynipral), and antibiotic administration for
the prevention of genito-urinary infection (based on the antibiogram).


Figure. Study Flow Diagram (randomization with 89 women)

Before the 35th wk of pregnancy, where pre-term birth is threatened, an
intramuscular steroid was given to prevent infantile respiratory distress
syndrome. As a result of such treatments, labor could possibly be
delayed until after the 37th wk of gestation.

##### Initial Localized Chronic Periodontitis Criteria

A pregnant woman was regarded as having periodontitis if she had ≥ 4 mm
probing depth, at least at one site, and bleeding on probing (BOP) for
≥ 50% of teeth. Participants having no ≥ 4 mm pockets or BOP occurring
at less than 50% of teeth were regarded as periodontally healthy.

##### Periodontal Treatment

The participants underwent periodontal examination within two days after
being admitted as in-patients at the hospital due to a threatened pre-term
delivery. The periodontal treatment was carried out in the third trimester,
around the 32nd wk of pregnancy, and consisted of oral hygiene instruction,
supra- and subgingival scaling carried out with hand instruments and/or an
ultrasonic scaler, and finished by polishing of the teeth with a fluoridecontaining polishing paste. For those who received no periodontal
treatment during pregnancy, it was suggested post-delivery.

##### Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to assess the demographic and socioeconomic data. For comparison of mean values, Student’s _t_ test was
used, as well as Mann-Whitney tests where non-normality was
determined. Normal distribution of samples was tested by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Association of treatment with categorical
data was analyzed by the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test,
including the calculation of unadjusted odds ratios. The significance
level was set at p < 0.05.

#### RESULTS

##### The effect of periodontal treatment on the birthweight of the newborn and the dates of delivery of 83 women (Table 1) was analyzed statistically in the present study. With respect to cali- bration of the periodontal examinations, the intra-class correla- tion coefficient was 0.94 or greater for the different periodontal scores and indices.
