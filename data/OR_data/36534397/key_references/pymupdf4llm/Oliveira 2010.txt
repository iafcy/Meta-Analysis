Abstract Periodontitis has been associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes. Results from intervention studies are
few and controversial. The present study assessed the
effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Two hundred fortysix eligible women were randomly divided into two groups:
periodontitis intervention (n=122; undergoing non-surgical
treatment during gestation) and periodontitis control (n=
124; not treated during gestation). Univariate analysis was
performed and estimates of relative risk were reported. Data
from 225 women were analyzed. No differences for preterm
birth (p=0.721), low birth weight (p=0.198), and preterm
low birth weight (p=0.732) rates were observed. Relative
risk estimates for preterm birth, low birth weight, and
preterm low birth weight in the periodontitis intervention
group were 0.915 (95% CI 0.561–1.493), 0.735 (95% CI
0.459–1.179), and 0.927 (0.601–1.431), respectively. Nonsurgical periodontal treatment during the second semester
of gestation did not reduce the risk for preterm birth, low
birth weight, and preterm low birth weight.

Introduction

Studies have suggested that periodontal disease could be a
risk factor for preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight
(LBW), and preterm low birth weight (PTLBW), due to
its inflammatory infectious nature [1, 2].
Observational studies have showed conflicting findings.
Some case–control and prospective studies reported a
significant association between periodontitis and PTLBW

[3–8], while other studies failed to demonstrate such
association [9–11].
Some animal studies have revealed that the inoculation
of periodontal pathogens induced a significant reduction of
birth weight [12] and a significant increase in the
occurrence of intrauterine growth restriction [13]. It was
also demonstrated that the lethality rate was 3.9 times
higher after 1 week postpartum [14].
Novak et al. [11] showed that non-surgical periodontal
therapy significantly reduced levels of periodontal pathogens
in pregnant women. However, changes in these bacteria
resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.
Some authors have verified the beneficial effects of
mechanical debridement on maternal periodontal status
followed by a reduction in the occurrence of PTLBW

[15–18]. Although findings reported by Mitchell-Lewis et
al. [9], Jeffcoat et al. [19], and Michalowicz et al. [20]
demonstrated an improvement in maternal periodontal
status after periodontal treatment, no effects on PTLBW
were verified. Since findings are contradictory, there is the
need for further investigations [21].


-----

In this manner, the aim of the present study was to
evaluate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment
during the second trimester of gestation in the occurrence
rates of PTB, LBW, and PTLBW.

Methods

Study sample

Sample consisted of women from a low socioeconomic
class from prenatal care programs at two public hospitals in
Belo Horizonte, Brazil. During the period of data collection, 737 women were determined to be eligible for the
study. After having applied some exclusion and inclusion
criteria, 439 women were selected for periodontal examination. Final sample consisted of 246 women diagnosed
with periodontitis. Sample was then randomly divided in
two groups: periodontitis intervention (PI) (n=122) and
periodontitis control (PC) (n=124) (Fig. 1).
The present study received approval from the Ethics
Research Committee from the Federal University of Minas
Gerais and by the Review Board of Ethics from the
municipal government of Belo Horizonte.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Medical records and prenatal forms from the hospital units
were examined in an attempt to determine eligibility for the
study. The inclusion criteria included healthy pregnant
women aged 18–35 years, gestational period between 12
and 20 weeks, current single gestation, a minimum of 20
natural teeth, and the presence of periodontitis. The
exclusion criteria included current genitourinary infection,
chronic hypertension, diabetes, human immunodeficiency
virus infection and/or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, current use of tobacco (smoking), alcohol and/or
illicit drug use, and any medical condition requiring
antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment. In addition,
women under the use of any antibiotic or non-steroid antiinflammatory agents, antiseptic mouthwashes, and drugs
that can induce gingival overgrowth, as well as those under
current periodontal treatment, were excluded from the
sample.

Data collection

During prenatal visits, women were selected and invited to
participate in the study. At that time, participants were
informed of the aims of the study and were provided with a
written informed consent. Data were systematically
obtained through patient questionnaires and included
previous gestations, previous abortions, previous preterm


births, stillbirths, number of live children, multiple gestations, ethnicity, marital status, age, maternal weight, and
education level.
Dental health care personnel were trained and calibrated
to improve understanding of medical records and prenatal
forms and to settle into the hospital routine before data
collection.
Prenatal visits were scheduled monthly up to 34 weeks
of gestation and every 2 weeks until parturition. Periodontal
examination and periodontal procedures were scheduled
according to this routine.

Periodontal assessment

A complete periodontal examination was performed.
Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and
bleeding on probing (BOP) measurements were performed
at six sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe
UNC15 (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). All teeth were
evaluated, not including those with incomplete eruptive
processes.

Intra-examiner agreement

All women in the sample were examined by one trained and
calibrated periodontist (AMSDO). The calibration process
included two periodontal examinations for the same
subject, performed in two consecutive weeks on a total of
ten women. Kappa scores were calculated for PD (k=0.82)
and CAL (k=0.80). All k scores were considered to be
satisfactory.

Criteria for periodontitis definition

Periodontitis was determined by the presence of four or
more teeth with one or more sites with PD≥4 mm and
CAL≥3 m [15].

Periodontal therapy

One group received non-surgical periodontal treatment
during the gestation period (PI group), while one group
did not receive periodontal treatment during gestation
(PC group) (Fig. 1). The periodontist examiner (AMSDO)
was blinded to the location of each subject within the
groups.
All women were informed of their periodontal status and
received a kit containing tooth brushes, dental floss, and
toothpastes. Women from the PI group received oral
hygiene instructions, plaque index evaluations, dental
prophylaxis, and mechanical debridement, when necessary,
under local anesthesia on all affected sites each month
during the second trimester of gestation. Periodontal final

examination was performed 30–40 days after the periodontal intervention phase. Then, women were scheduled for
periodontal maintenance visits every 3 weeks until parturition. The personnel who performed the periodontal
therapy were trained to each step of periodontal intervention. Women from the PC group were recalled and reexamined during the 30th and 32nd weeks of gestation.
This second examination was considered to be the final
periodontal examination. At this point, periodontal treatment was offered to these women in postpartum.


Assessment of pregnancy outcomes

Gestational age was determined by obstetric criteria based
on the date of the last menstrual period and confirmed
through ultrasound performed between the 18th and 22nd
week of gestation. After parturition, pregnancy outcomes
were determined as follows: (a) preterm birth (less than 37
complete weeks of gestation), (b) low birth weight (less
than 2,500 g of birth weight), (c) preterm low birth weight
(less than 37 complete weeks of gestation and less than

Statistical analysis

Lilliefors and Bartlett tests were performed to verify
normality and homogeneity of parametric data, respectively.
In order to test the effects of periodontal status in the
occurrence of PTB and/or LBW, Pearson’s chi-squared and
the Student’s t tests, as well as the relative risk (RR)
calculation, were performed when appropriate. Results were

439 women were determined to be eligible and underwent
periodontal examination. Of the 439 subjects enrolled, 193
patients were diagnosed with periodontal health or gingivitis and were excluded. During the study, 9 women from the
PI group and 12 women from the PC group were excluded
for different reasons: spontaneous abortion (5), stillbirth (1),
eligible preterm birth (8), and abandonment (7). Therefore,
data from the 225 women present at both the baseline and
final examinations were analyzed. A flowchart of sampling
strategy is summarized in Fig. 1.
Homoscedasticity of the groups in relation to maternal
age, maternal body weight, and newborn birth weight was
observed. The Bartlett test showed no significant differences in the variances of these variables (p>0.01). Groups
were determined to be homogeneous through Lilliefors test
(p>0.05).
Baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The
mean age of women in the PI group was 29.96±4.38 years
and in the PC group 26.58±3.96 (p=0.500). It was
observed that maternal weight (p=0.628), number of
prenatal visits (p=0.657), marital status (p=0.950), educational level (p=0.933), and ethnicity (p=0.870) were not
significantly different between the groups.
Table 2 shows periodontal variables in the baseline and
final examinations. The mean number of teeth was
homogeneously distributed among the groups. A higher
frequency of sites with BOP, PD≥4 mm, and CAL≥3 mm
was verified in the PI group when compared to the PC
group in baseline examination. When analyzing periodontal
clinical parameters in baseline and final examinations, a
worsening in periodontal status of the PC group with an
increase in the percentage of sites with BOP, PD, and CAL
could be observed. A decrease in the percentage of sites
with BOP, PD≥4 mm, and CAL≥3 mm was verified in the
PI group.
Table 3 shows the occurrence of pregnancy outcomes
within the groups. The occurrence rates of PTB, LBW, and
PTLBW in the PI group were not statistically different from
the PC group (p=0.722, p=0.198, and p=0.733, respectively).
RR estimates for adverse pregnancy outcomes are
displayed in Table 4. RR estimates and 95% CI for PTB,
LBW, and PTLBW for the PI group were of 0.915 (0.561–
1.493), 0.735 (0.459–1.179), and 0.927 (0.601–1.431),
respectively. It is important to note that, although the point


estimates of RR for all events were acceptable, the 95% CI
included the null. Consequently, these RR estimates were
considered not significant.

Discussion

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of
non-surgical periodontal procedures, performed during the
second semester of gestation, on the incidence rates of PTB,
LBW, and PTLBW.
It is important to highlight that the study design adopted
strict exclusion and inclusion criteria, establishing classic
risk factors and confounding variables for the events of
interest. As stated by Wimmer and Pihlstrom [23], it is vital
that periodontal exposure and adverse birth outcomes be
clearly defined and the many potential confounding factors
and possible effect modifiers for adverse pregnancy
outcome be controlled. In this manner, the present study
brings with it a particular contribution in relation to other
intervention studies [15, 17, 20, 24, 25].
Another important methodological attribute of the
present study is the homoscedasticity of the sample in the
groups in relation to maternal age, marital status, educational level, ethnicity, prenatal visits, and maternal body
weight.
Upon baseline examination, there was a higher frequency of sites with BOP, PD≥4 mm, and CAL≥3 mm in the PI
group when compared to the PC group. In relation to
periodontal changes between baseline and final examinations, a worsening in periodontal status in the PC group and
an improvement in clinical parameters in the PI group could
be observed. In this manner, the benefits of non-surgical

periodontal therapy during pregnancy are clear. This is in
accordance with previous reports [15–18, 20, 24, 25].
Regarding the effects of periodontal intervention on
pregnancy outcomes, the results did not show a significant
reduction in the risk for the occurrence of PTB, LBW, and
PTLBW in the intervention group when compared to the
control group.
Findings from the present study support previous results
from three different studies. Dörtbudak et al. [4], Jeffcoat et
al. [19], and Michalowicz et al. [20] also reported a
significant improvement in the periodontal status of women
who underwent periodontal therapy during gestation.
However, no reduction in the occurrence of PTB and
LBW was demonstrated.
In contrast, results showing a significant reduction in the
occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes after periodontal therapy during gestation were reported in the literature

[15, 16, 18, 25]. Divergences could be explained by
methodological issues among the studies, such as sample
composition, periodontitis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes definitions. It is well recognized that these issues
can strongly influence the results and must be taken into
account when analyzing the results [6, 23, 26–29].
A significant positive effect of non-surgical periodontal
treatment on periodontal status and its beneficial impact on
pregnancy outcomes in women diagnosed with gingivitis
and periodontitis was demonstrated by Lopez et al. [15, 16][.]

However, it is important to emphasize that women presenting genitourinary infection during the period of the study
were medicated with antibiotics. Another significant difference from our study was the use of 0.12% chlorexidine
daily mouth rinses during periodontal therapy. Here, the
results should be interpreted with caution. This approach
can alter clinical response in relation to gingival bleeding.
Preliminary findings from Offenbacher et al. [17]
showed that periodontal intervention reduced the incidence
of PTLBW by 3.8-fold. Gazolla et al. [18] also demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence rates of
PTLBW among women treated during gestation.
Tarannum and Faizuddin [25] suggested that nonsurgical periodontal treatment can significantly reduce the
risk of PTLBW among women with periodontitis. Findings
from this study showed significant differences between the
intervention and control groups in relation to mean
gestational age (p<0.006) and to birth weight (p<0.044).
In the present study, five cases of spontaneous abortion
and one case of stillbirth were observed. They were
excluded from the analysis since the pregnancy outcomes
differ from those that were proposed to be evaluated in the
present study (PTB, LBW, and PTLBW). In addition, seven
cases of abandonment (women abandon the hospital units
of the study with no medical protocol of transference) were
observed. It was not possible to analyze these cases due to


the absence of final periodontal examinations and records
of pregnancy outcome.
The present study, as most studies which have investigated the effects of non-surgical periodontal intervention on
pregnancy outcomes, showed an improvement in clinical
periodontal status and beneficial effects in oral health.
However, we believe that there is no sufficient evidence to
state that periodontal therapy during gestation can influence
gestational age and birth weight. These findings are in
accordance with a recent European consensus (Kinane and
Bouchard) [27] that stated that there is no evidence that
treating periodontal disease decreases the rate of adverse
pregnancy outcomes. Until the present moment, findings
from studies in this field are still controversial and point to
the need for more intervention studies with adequate design
in different populations.

Conclusion

Findings from the present study demonstrated that nonsurgical periodontal treatment during the second semester
of gestation did not significantly reduce the risk for the
occurrence of PTB, LBW, and PTLBW.
