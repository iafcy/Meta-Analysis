**Abstract: Aim: To analyze if non-surgical treatment of periodontitis in a pregnant Caucasian**
women population can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods and results: A parallel
randomized clinical trial was designed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Sanitary Area
Santiago-Lugo, Spain (registration number: 2016/451). Forty patients with periodontitis stage II grade
B were randomly allocated to receive either comprehensive non-surgical periodontal therapy (test
group; n = 20) or professional tooth cleaning (control group; n = 20) before 24 gestational weeks.
Randomization was computer-generated by the statistic program Epidat v.4.1 and allocation was
performed using sealed opaque envelopes. Clinical measurements and peripheral blood samples for
biochemical variables were collected at baseline, in the middle of second trimester before non-surgical
treatment, and in the third trimester. Microbiological samples were collected in the second and
third trimester. A statistically significant reduction was verified in all clinical and microbiological
parameters after periodontal treatment in the test group. No significant differences were observed
for the rest of the variables, including preterm birth and/or low birth weight. No adverse events
related to periodontal treatment were reported. Conclusions: Non-surgical periodontal treatment in
Caucasian patients with periodontitis stage II grade B did not significantly reduce the risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes.

**Keywords: preterm birth; low birth weight; pregnancy; periodontal disease**

**1. Introduction**

Adverse results of pregnancy, such as preterm birth or low birth weight, can be the cause of
mortality and increased morbidity in neonates [1]. Worldwide, preterm birth is the second most
common factor of death in children under 5 years old [2].
The prevalence of preterm births varies depending on the country (ranged from 5% in some
European countries to 18% in some African countries). Blencowe et al. [3] identified data from
99 countries and estimated the 2010 global prevalence at 11.1% (95% CI = 9.1–13.4%). The preterm
birth rate in the 1980s was not vastly different than the current preterm birth rate [4], and it remains an
important public health priority worldwide [5].

Periodontitis is an inflammatory infection disease affecting the tooth-supporting tissues, initiated
by a biofilm with gram-negative anaerobic microorganism predominance and mediated by the
inflammatory response of the host. It is also liable to induce systemic inflammation and consequently
modify the normal development of pregnancy [6]. During pregnancy, due to hormonal changes,
there may be a tendency towards periodontal disease, in particular, there is an increase of anaerobic
gram-negative bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia,
_Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Selenomonas sputigena [7]._
Infections account for 75% of premature births and/or low birth weight, while subclinical
infections begin to be considered as an important cause of very premature birth (before the 30th week of
gestation). However, in more than 50% of cases, the etiological factors of prematurity are unknown [8].
Oral infections might be considered one of these factors, since commensal bacterial species of the oral
cavity colonize the fetoplacental unit of women with full-term gestation and with adverse pregnancy
outcomes [9]. The bacterial species most strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes include:
_Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Bergeyella spp. [10]._
Two main routes have been proposed to trigger an inflammatory response in the fetoplacental unit;
the direct route, in which the oral microorganisms and/or their components reach the fetoplacental unit
by hematogenous dissemination of the oral cavity or by an ascending route through the genitourinary
tract; and the indirect route, in which the inflammatory mediators produced in the periodontal tissues
circulate and impact the fetoplacental unit. A large number of studies associate an increase in the levels
of local and systemic inflammatory markers with adverse pregnancy outcomes [11]. As well as this,
hormonal changes during pregnancy, due to elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone, increase
vascular permeability in gingival tissues and, as a consequence, bacteria and/or their products can
diffuse more easily [12].
The increase in maternal serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF-α have been associated with prematurity and low birth weight [13,14]. C-reactive protein, which
is an acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver in response to proinflammatory cytokines, has also
been associated with prematurity [15].
Cohort studies have shown a relationship between periodontal disease, premature delivery, and
low birth weight [16–18], as it has been confirmed in some systematic reviews [19–22]. On the other
hand, clinical trials have studied the effect of periodontal treatment on adverse pregnancy outcomes
and showed controversial results [8,21–31]. This is probably because there is a marked heterogeneity
between studies in terms of the population´s characteristics (race, age, etc.) as well as the periodontitis
definition applied. Finally, it should be noted the conclusions reached in the Nine European Workshop
on Periodontology in 2012 indicating that, up to now, it is not possible to affirm that periodontal
treatment reduces the rates of premature delivery or birth of underweight children [32]. However,
these studies have provided that non-surgical periodontal treatment, when performed on pregnant
women, is safe for the mother and the fetus [32,33].
Our hypothesis was that periodontitis has an effect on pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth
and/or low birth weight. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to analyze if non-surgical treatment
of periodontitis, using the definition suggested by the EFP-AAP Consensus Meeting [34], can reduce
adverse pregnancy outcomes in a pregnant Caucasian women population.

**2. Material and Methods**

_2.1. Study Design_

A parallel randomized clinical trial was designed to test whether the non-surgical periodontal
treatment provided during pregnancy affected gestational age at delivery and birth weight. Data were
gathered on the pregnant women at three visits: at the end of the first trimester (16 weeks of pregnancy),
in the middle of second trimester (22–24 weeks of pregnancy), and at the third trimester (33–36 weeks


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3638_ 3 of 14

of pregnancy), as usually recommended follow-up visits in pregnant woman. No relevant changes
were performed after trial commencement.

_2.2. Study Population_

Pregnant women who were seen for prenatal care at the University Hospital of Santiago de
Compostela (Spain) were invited to participate in the study when they attended the hospital to undergo
the first gynecological clinic appointment between June 2017 and May 2018. During this screening visit,
a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed and patients with a periodontitis diagnosis [34]
were invited to participate. The sample size was done with PASS v.12 (NCSS, LCC; Kaysville, UT,
USA) with an 80% power and a significance level of 0.05, sample size was established as 40 patients.
The patients who were included in the study were divided in two groups (test and control) according
to a previous computer-generated randomization (generated by the statistic program Epidat v. 4.1)
and allocation ratio 1:1 (using sealed opaque envelopes labeled with a study number and containing
the group allocation opened by examiner after baseline examination). The test group corresponded to
patients with non-surgical periodontal treatment, and the control group consisted of patients without
periodontal treatment (Figure 1). All potential participants signed an informed consent form to
participate in the study. This protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sanitary Area
Santiago-Lugo, Spain (reference: 2016/451).

**Figure 1. Research outline.**

_2.3. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria_

Inclusion criteria were Caucasian pregnant women (gestational age ≤16 weeks), aged 18 to
40 years, with more than 20 natural teeth and diagnosis of periodontitis.
Exclusion criteria were multiple gestation; previous preterm low birth weight; more than 1
previous miscarriage or one greater than 18 weeks; diabetes; hypertension; alcoholism; drug abuse;
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; heart disease, kidney disease or liver disease; recurrent
cystitis; viral infections; venereal infections; toxoplasmosis; and/or tobacco smoking.

_2.4. Maternal Characteristics_

Demographic data and medical history were assessed by interview during the first visit (16th
gestational week). The interview included items on age, educational level (primary or less, high school,
and university), area of residence (rural or urban, depending on the number of inhabitants), body mass
index (BMI), marital status (single, common-law partner, married), and obstetric history (number of
previous pregnancies, previous miscarriage).
The following variables were recorded shortly after delivery: newborn weight, newborn sex,
duration of pregnancy, and type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean).

_2.5. Periodontal Measurements_

Full-mouth periodontal examinations were performed by one examiner. The weighted κ values
for intra-examiner calibration were 0.82 (CI 95% = 0.68–0.98). Periodontal clinical measurements were
recorded at enrolment and repeated at 2nd and 3rd trimester. Exams included all teeth present in

the mouth (excluding third molars). A plaque score [35], periodontal pocket depth (PPD) (six sites
per tooth), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) [35] (six sites per tooth)
were registered. All scores were measured with a manual periodontal probe UNC-15 (Hu-Friedy,
Chicago, IL, USA). Periodontitis was defined according to the case definitions of the World Workshop
in Periodontology in 2018 [34]:

1. Interdental CAL was detectable at ≥2 non-adjacent teeth, or
2. Buccal or oral CAL ≥3 mm with pocketing ≥3 mm was detectable at ≥2 teeth but the observed
CAL could not be ascribed to non-periodontitis-related causes such as: (1) gingival recession
of traumatic origin; (2) dental caries extending in the cervical area of the tooth; (3) presence of
CAL on the distal aspect of a second molar and associated with malposition or extraction of a
third molar; (4) an endodontic lesion draining through the marginal periodontium; and (5) the
occurrence of a vertical root fracture.

_2.6. Biochemical Variables_

A peripheral blood sample was collected from each subject with venipuncture using a vacuum
tube (Vacutainer, Nippon Becton Dickinson Tokyo, Japan). Samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm
for 10 minutes and the serum obtained was dissociated in a plastic tube. At the time of the analyses,
the serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF),
and fibrinogen were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA).

_2.7. Microbiological Variables_

In the middle of the second trimester (22–24 weeks of pregnancy) before non-surgical periodontal
treatment and before the third trimester, four sites (those with the deepest probing depth) were selected,
and two consecutive paper points were inserted and kept in place for 10 s. All paper points were
pooled in a vial with reduced transport fluid (RTF) and transferred to the laboratory within 12 h [36].
The obtained samples were dispersed (30 s of vortex), serially diluted and processed for culture
by inoculation on two different media: blood agar medium (no 2; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK), with
horse serum at 5% and with hemin (5mg/L) and Dentaid-1 medium [37]. The blood agar plates were
studied after 14 days of anaerobic incubation (80% N2; 10% H2; 10% CO2) at 37 [◦]C, and after 3–5 days
at 37 [◦]C in air with 5% CO2.
_Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Parvimona micra, Campylobacter_
_restus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp., were identified based_
mainly on their colony morphology and further confirmed with different specific chemical tests. Counts
for every bacterial species were obtained and the percentage relative to the total flora calculated.
_Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were grown on Dentaid-1 medium plates, and identified based_
on colony morphology and catalase reaction.

_2.8. Periodontal Treatment_

The test group patients received non-surgical periodontal therapy that was completed by the
end of week 24 of gestation. This consisted of oral hygiene instructions, followed by mechanical
supra and subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP) with Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago,
IL, USA). Periodontal therapy was performed over two 1-hour sessions. Periodontal treatment was
performed by one periodontist (L.C.) in the Department of Periodontology at the University of Santiago
de Compostela (Spain).
The control group received professional tooth cleaning (oral hygiene instructions and supragingival
cleaning of all teeth) at the second-trimester visit. All control participants were offered the opportunity
to attend for non-surgical periodontal therapy postpartum.

_2.9. Outcomes_

Primary outcomes of the present study were preterm birth and low birth weight. Following the
World Health Organization criteria, preterm birth was defined as a delivery at <37 weeks of gestation
(gestational age determined by last menstrual period and ultrasound fetal measurement) and low birth
weight was defined as a newborn weight of 2500 gr or less. Secondary outcomes were those related to
the efficacy of non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical, biochemical and microbiological variables.

_2.10. Statistical Analysis_

Descriptive analysis was calculated for each variable (mean values, standard deviation).
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to test the normality of the variables. Relationship between
each variable and preterm birth/low birth weight were analyzed. All variables were also compared
between women with and without treatment. A t-student test was performed for continuous
variables whilst A chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. Non-normal distribution
variables were analyzed by a Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square test for
categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using ANCOVA test, with pregnancy and
newborn weight as dependent variables with age, body mass index as a covariable, and treatment
as an independent variable. Statistical significance was established at the 95% confidence level and
_p-values <0.05 for all analyses were selected to be statistically significant. SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc._
version 20.0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all the statistical analyses.

**3. Results**

Initially, 66 women were examined and 50 met the inclusion criteria. Eight rejected to participate
and two had a miscarriage. Finally, 40 women with periodontitis stage II grade B complied with
all the visits, 20 received non-surgical treatment (test group), and 20 received no treatment was
performed (control group), as shown in Figure 2. No adverse events related to periodontal treatment
were reported.
Demographic characteristics of the study sample are shown in Table 1. No statistically significant
differences were observed between groups. The study population was 32.00 ± 4.27 years old for
the test group and 32.25 ± 4.21 for control group; the majority lived in a rural residence, were
married, had finished elementary school, and were her first pregnancy and only a 5% had a previous
spontaneous abortion.

Table 2 depicts the periodontal status of the study population. Selected pregnant women
presented a mean number of teeth in the test group of 26.95 ± 1.21 and 26.32 ± 2.77 in control group,
with no significant differences between them. Bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and
clinical attachment level were statistically higher for the test group in the 1st trimester. However,
after non-surgical periodontal treatment these parameters were reversed, and a significative reduction
was verified in the 3rd trimester in this test group.

**4. Discussion**

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment
in pregnant women, carried out during the second trimester of pregnancy, on the rates of preterm birth
and low birth weight, and to assess the clinical, biochemical, and microbiological changes. The effect of
periodontal intervention on pregnancy outcomes did not show a reduction in the risk of preterm birth
and low birth weight in the test group compared to the control group. However, we can assume as
clinically relevant the protector role of periodontitis treatment during pregnancy (ANCOVA analysis),
due to the significant periodontal health improvement in the test group. Pregnancy is a short period
of time in order to evaluate the systemic impact of a long term periodontal microbial infection and
related inflammatory responses.
This finding is supported by previous studies such as Oliveira et al. [31], Offenbacher et al. [30],
and Michalowicz et al. [38]; these authors demonstrated that the treatment of periodontitis in pregnant
women was safe and effective for periodontal disease, but did not reduce the incidence of premature
delivery and low birth weight. The meta-analysis conducted by Baccaglini in 2011 [39] including
eleven high quality randomized controlled trials performed on 6558 pregnant women, also showed no
evidence to support that non-surgical periodontal treatment during pregnancy prevents premature
birth or other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Conversely, some papers have suggested a positive effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment
both in the periodontal condition of the patient and in the adverse results of pregnancy.
Offenbacher et al. [24] showed that periodontal treatment reduced 3.8 times the rate of premature
births; this may be due to the fact that many of the included patients had a disadvantaged economic
status and had previously had preterm births (>12 weeks), therefore, this study population represented
a high-risk group. Jeffcoat et al. [23] showed that successful periodontal therapy reduced the risk of
premature delivery in a group of African-American women who had never visited a dentist, but their
results cannot be extrapolated to other populations with different characteristics. Radnai et al. [25]
also showed that periodontal treatment had a positive pregnancy outcome in a demographically
homogenous Caucasian European population, but these women had an initial localized chronic
periodontitis. Tarannum et al. [26] provided evidence that non-surgical periodontal therapy can reduce
the risk of preterm birth/low birth weight, but the study population was Indian, belonged to low
socio-economic strata (based on occupation), had low education levels, and patients with a history
of alcohol/tobacco consumption were not excluded. Finally, López et al. [8] also demonstrated the
positive effect of periodontal treatment in adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients diagnosed with
gingivitis and periodontitis, but the periodontal treatment included a daily chlorhexidine rinse at
0.12% and women with urinary tract infections were treated with antibiotics (an exclusion criteria in
most studies).
When the clinical variables were analyzed, we have to consider that bleeding on probing, probing
pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were statistically higher for the test than for the control
group in the 1st trimester, however both groups were diagnosed with periodontitis stage II, grade
B [34]. These clinical parameters remained stable throughout the gestational period in the control group
and after treatment in the test group, there was a significative decrease in the percentage of bleeding
on probing, plaque index, average probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss. These findings
for the control group seems to have no correlation with plaque accumulation since it has been shown
that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy are a modifying factor of bacterial plaque [40].
Santa Cruz et al. [9] showed that periodontal clinical status was not associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes in a Caucasian Spanish population with a medium–high educational level.
Biochemical markers increased in the third trimester following the basic periodontal treatment,
except TNF-α, which decreased after performing the treatment. The differences between the treatment
group and the control group were not significant for any of the three visits. Most authors agree
that treatment of chronic periodontitis does not significantly change levels of serum markers of
acute-phase inflammatory and vascular response [41]. It has been suggested that non-surgical
mechanical periodontal treatment during pregnancy successfully reduces periodontal inflammation
and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels, but it has no significant impact on serum biomarkers [38,42].
The complex immunological events that occur during pregnancy may limit the ability to evaluate the
systemic effect of periodontal therapy, because studies have shown that pregnant women have a higher
production of cytokines depending on the gestational period and the outcome of pregnancy [42].
Regarding the presence of periodontopathogens, the non-surgical periodontal treatment performed
in the second trimester reduced the number of all the subgingival periodontal pathogens analyzed
and the total bacterial load. These findings indicate that the periodontal therapy of pregnant women
with periodontitis produces quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbiota similar to those
observed in non-pregnant women [43]. Pregnant women with periodontitis harbor a very complex
and pathogenic subgingival microbiota, including a high prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
_Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Parvimona micra [9]. Martínez-Martínez et al. [44]_
did not find association between periodontal bacteria and premature birth. In opposition to this,
Santa Cruz et al. [9] found a significant association between the presence of Eikenella corrodens with
preterm birth and the presence of Capnocytophaga spp. with low birth weight. Novak et al. [43] showed
that basic periodontal therapy significantly reduced the levels of periodontal pathogens but basal
levels of these were not associated with premature birth.

The present study is not exempt from a number of methodological limitations that should be
considered when extrapolating our results. Up to date, available evidence does not provide clinical,
microbiological, or immunological parameters that define patients whose pregnancy outcomes would
be improved with periodontal treatment [10]. The selected study group of our study consisted of
Caucasian women between 18 and 40 years old and according to the literature the most affected
population by periodontitis is the African-American population. The periodontitis definition that we
have applied in contrast to previous papers is the one recently published by the EFP-AAP Consensus
Meeting [34]. Based on epidemiological and plausibility studies, various treatment strategies could be
evaluated that consider specific target populations, as well as timing and intensity of treatment [10].

**5. Conclusions**

We can conclude that non-surgical periodontal treatment in Caucasian patients with periodontitis
stage II grade B did not significantly reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
