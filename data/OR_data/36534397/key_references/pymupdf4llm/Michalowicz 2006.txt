**Background**
Maternal periodontal disease has been associated with an increased risk of preterm
birth and low birth weight. We studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment
on preterm birth.

**Methods**
We randomly assigned women between 13 and 17 weeks of gestation to undergo scaling and root planing either before 21 weeks (413 patients in the treatment group) or
after delivery (410 patients in the control group). Patients in the treatment group also
underwent monthly tooth polishing and received instruction in oral hygiene. The gestational age at the end of pregnancy was the prespecified primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were birth weight and the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age.

**Results**
In the follow-up analysis, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) occurred in 49
of 407 women (12.0%) in the treatment group (resulting in 44 live births) and in 52
of 405 women (12.8%) in the control group (resulting in 38 live births). Although periodontal treatment improved periodontitis measures (P<0.001), it did not significantly
alter the risk of preterm delivery (P = 0.70; hazard ratio for treatment group vs. control group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.37). There were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups in birth weight (3239 g
vs. 3258 g, P = 0.64) or in the rate of delivery of infants that were small for gestational
age (12.7% vs. 12.3%; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.58). There were 5 spontaneous abortions or stillbirths in the treatment group, as compared with 14 in the control group (P = 0.08).

**Conclusions**
Treatment of periodontitis in pregnant women improves periodontal disease and is
safe but does not significantly alter rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, or fetal
growth restriction. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00066131.)

bout 11% of singleton births in the
United States occur before 37 weeks of gestation,[1] and the rate of premature delivery

# A has increased during the past 15 years. Preterm and

low-birth-weight infants are at elevated risk for
death, neurodevelopmental disabilities, cognitive
impairment, and behavioral disorders.[2-4] About
half of mothers delivering preterm infants have no
known risk factors.[5] Recent studies suggest that
periodontitis, an inflammatory disease caused primarily by gram-negative bacteria that destroy toothsupporting connective tissue and bone, is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, as well
as low birth weight and preeclampsia.[6-8]

In rodents, subcutaneous inoculations with
periodontal pathogens cause dose-dependent decreases in litter weight and elicit the production
of cytokines and prostaglandins that signal preterm labor when present in amniotic fluid.[9,10]
However, in humans, no causal link has been established between periodontitis and prematurity
or low birth weight, and several epidemiologic
studies have found no association.[11-13]

Data from two single-center clinical trials suggest that periodontal treatment during pregnancy
may reduce the rate of preterm births,[14,15] although a recent study found no association between periodontal care during pregnancy and low
birth weight.[16] We designed the present trial to
assess whether nonsurgical periodontal treatment
in pregnant women reduces the risk of delivery
before 37 weeks and results in a greater birth
weight and a reduced proportion of infants who
are small for gestational age.


Methods


The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT)
Study was a randomized, blinded, controlled trial
of the effects of nonsurgical periodontal treatment
during pregnancy on gestational age at birth and
on birth weight. An independent data and safety
monitoring board met semiannually to review the
interim results. The institutional review board at
each participating center approved the study; all
participants provided written informed consent.

**Study Population**
We enrolled patients at Hennepin County Medical
Center (MN), the University of Kentucky, the Uni­
versity of Mississippi Medical Center, and Harlem
Hospital (NY). Potential participants were referred


by health care providers. Pregnant women who
were at least 16 years of age and who were at less
than 16 weeks and 6 days of gestation underwent
screenings for periodontal disease in obstetrics
clinics. Unlike gingivitis, periodontitis cannot be
assessed by visual examination alone; it is diagnosed with the use of a probe that is inserted into
the gingival crevice between the teeth and gums.
Clinical attachment loss (in millimeters) is a measure of the severity of destruction of tooth-supporting connective tissue and alveolar bone. Attachment loss is typically accompanied by a deepening
of the gingival crevice, the depth of which is termed
probing depth. Women who had multiple probing
depths of more than 4 mm and evidence of clinical attachment loss were referred for baseline examination.

To be eligible for the trial, women had to have
at least 20 natural teeth and the presence of periodontal disease, which we defined as 4 or more
teeth with a probing depth of at least 4 mm and
a clinical attachment loss of at least 2 mm, as well
as bleeding on probing at 35% or more of tooth
sites. Women were ineligible if they had multiple
fetuses, required antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal procedures, had a medical condition that
precluded elective dental treatment, had extensive
tooth decay, or were likely to have fewer than 20
teeth after initial treatment.

**Study Intervention**
We randomly assigned participants to receive periodontal treatment either before 21 weeks or after
delivery. Randomization, stratified by center with
the use of permuted randomized blocks of 2 and
4, was made by a telephone call to the coordinating center.

Treatment consisted of periodontal scaling and
root planing (i.e., removal of dental plaque and
calculus from the tooth enamel and root) with the
use of ultrasonic and hand instruments and local
anesthesia as needed; up to four visits for treatment were allowed. Treatment participants also
received instruction in oral hygiene; they then had
monthly tooth polishing and reinstruction in oral
hygiene and underwent scaling and planing as
needed until delivery. Control patients received
only a brief oral examination at monthly followups but attended the same number of these visits
as the treatment group. Patients in the control
group were offered the same periodontal therapy
after delivery as those in the treatment group re

ceived. All patients received a $20 gift certificate
and an infant’s toy after each visit.

**Outcomes**
The prespecified primary outcome was the gestational age at the end of pregnancy. Gestational age
was determined at randomization on the basis of
the last menstrual period or the results of ultrasonography, as described elsewhere.[17] Secondary
outcomes included birth weight, the proportion
of infants who were small for gestational age, Apgar scores, and admissions to a neonatal intensive
care unit.

**Clinical Assessments, Data Collection,**
**and Safety Monitoring**
Before the study began, periodontal examiners
were trained by a single clinician (Dr. Michalo­wicz),
and their techniques were standardized with the
use of criteria described previously.[18] The standardization of the techniques of the examiners
was reassessed during the study with the use of
the same criteria, and we assessed the reproducibility of the results among examiners by having
the examiners remeasure selected teeth in 5% of
the participants; the average agreement for probing depth and measures of attachment loss (within 1 mm) was 98%.

At baseline, patients reported their pregnancy
history and any medications they were taking.
Examiners measured probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing at six sites
on each tooth; they also evaluated dental plaque[19]
and calculus[20] on selected teeth. Bleeding on probing was scored as present or absent. Patients were
referred to a dentist for treatment of teeth that
were abscessed, fractured, or likely to become
symptomatic during the study. Full-mouth periodontal assessments were repeated at 21 to 24
weeks of gestation and again at 29 to 32 weeks.

An obstetrical nurse abstracted data regarding
delivery and postnatal status and risk factors for
prematurity from medical records. Obstetrical adverse events were identified by a review of medical records and reports from patients. Examiners
and nurses were not aware of the study-group assignments.

Patients were monitored for oral adverse events
and the progression of periodontitis, which was
defined as any increase in clinical attachment loss
of 3 mm or more.[21] Treatment of progressive disease was not delayed until after delivery in either


group unless treatment was contraindicated because of advanced gestational age (middle-to-late
third trimester). All patients with progressive disease at fewer than six tooth sites received root
planing at those sites. Patients with six or more
affected sites were referred to a consulting periodontist for treatment; affected patients in the control group received full-mouth scaling and root
planing, whereas those in the treatment group
could receive root planing, systemic antibiotics,
and subgingival irrigation with antimicrobial solutions. For patients with progressive disease, the
last periodontal measures before rescue treatment
were carried forward.

**Statistical Analysis**
We performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat
basis unless stated otherwise. To emphasize differences in lower gestational ages, gestational ages
were censored at 37 weeks.

Our primary analysis compared groups according to gestational age at delivery with the use of
the log-rank test stratified by center. To calculate
power, we estimated the time-to-event distribution
of the control group with the use of pilot data from
two enrollment centers. To estimate the desired
distribution of gestational ages of the treatment
group, we added to the gestational-age distribution
of the control group 5, 3, and 2 weeks for gestation of 20, 25, and 30 to 35 weeks, respectively,
interpolating for intermediate gestational ages. We
computed power by simulating data from these
distributions. With a one-sided type I error of 0.05
and allowing for a 30% loss to follow-up, calculations showed that 405 patients per group would
be required to show statistical significance with
a power of 90%. Adjusted analyses with the use of
Cox regression added baseline risk factors, including self-reported use of alcohol or drugs, race or
ethnic group, maternal age, the time since a previous pregnancy (in months), and the occurrence
of selected infections.

The study’s first seven birth outcomes were
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Consequently,
with the monitoring board’s approval, we added
a competing-risks analysis[22] with two event types
— live birth and spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. In the competing-risks analysis, we treated these first seven events as hypothesis generating and used only later events for hypothesis
testing.

All periodontal measures were analyzed with

(the center, the treatment group, the follow-up
visit, and interactions); adjusted analyses used design factors plus baseline risk factors.

We performed four semiannual interim analyses for monitoring-board meetings with the use
of the Lan–DeMets method and the O’Brien–Fleming alpha-spending function.[23] All reported P values are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple
testing.


Results


the use of linear mixed models, with the change
from baseline to either the 2-month or 4-month
follow-up visit as the dependent variable. Initial
analyses accounted only for study design factors


We randomly assigned 823 patients to two groups
— 413 to the treatment group and 410 to the control group — between March 2003 and June 2005
(Fig. 1). Eleven patients in the treatment group and
eight patients in the control group were erroneously assigned after 16 weeks and 6 days but were
included in the analyses. Follow-up concluded in
December 2005.

Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Of 531 patients who had
a previous pregnancy ending with a live birth, 77
(14.5%) had had a previous live preterm birth. On
the basis of clinical periodontal measures, most
patients were judged to have generalized early-tomoderate periodontitis.

During their study pregnancy, 22% of patients
were diagnosed with urinary tract infections, 12%
with bacterial vaginosis, 6% with gestational diabetes, and 16% with group B streptococcal colonization. Thirteen percent reported the use of tobacco. The frequency of these findings did not
differ significantly between groups.

**Birth Outcomes**
The gestational age at the end of pregnancy was
available for 814 of 823 women (98.9%) (Fig. 1).
Eleven patients in the treatment group and eight
in the control group had labor induced before 37
weeks because of hypertension, diabetes, or preeclampsia and were included in the primary analysis. In the time-to-event analysis, the groups did
not differ significantly in gestational age at the
end of pregnancy, which was censored at 37 weeks
(hazard ratio for women in the treatment group
vs. those in the control group, 0.93; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.37; P = 0.70) (Fig. 2). Results
did not change when women with spontaneous
abortions were excluded or when indicated deliveries before 37 weeks of gestation were treated as
losses to follow-up at the time of induced delivery.

† Race or ethnic group was reported by the patients. Some women selected more than one category and were included in all.
‡ Some patients reported more than one event.

live births.

- Percentages are based on 305 women in the control group and 306 women in the treatment group who had had any

The groups did not differ significantly after adjustment for baseline characteristics (hazard ratio,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.30; P = 0.45). The effects of
treatment on preterm birth did not differ significantly between centers (P = 0.30 for the interaction
between groups according to center) or according
to race or ethnic group (P = 0.76 for the comparison of black patients with those of all other races;


P = 0.52 for the comparison of Hispanic patients

in the control group had either a spontaneous
abortion or stillbirth after the decision was made
to consider the events as separate study outcomes.
In the competing-risks analysis, neither the risk of
live preterm birth (P = 0.51) nor of spontaneous
abortion or stillbirth (P = 0.08) differed significantly between groups. When all spontaneous
abortions or stillbirths (5 in the treatment group
and 14 in the control group) were included in a
competing-risks analysis, the P value was 0.04. The
groups did not differ significantly in the rates of
any secondary outcomes, including preeclampsia
(Table 2).

**Compliance and Clinical Periodontal**
**Outcomes**
Overall, 630 patients (77%) missed no more than
one of the six follow-up study visits. Among participants in the treatment group, 395 (96%) received
periodontal treatment, which lasted an average of
127 minutes. Periodontal treatment improved all
clinical measures of disease (Table 2).

**Adverse Events**
Treatment and control groups had a similar number of serious medical adverse events, which included hospitalization for more than 24 hours for


labor pains, hospitalization for any other reason,
a congenital anomaly in the infant, spontaneous
abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death (37 patients

[9.0%] in the treatment group and 41 [10%] in the
control group, P = 0.64). Twenty-two events were
hospitalizations in which the participant was discharged without having delivered. Infants with
congenital anomalies were born to 13 women in
the treatment group and 7 women in the control
group. No women died; the infants of one mother in the treatment group and two in the control
group died of complications from extreme prematurity.

A total of 3 patients in the treatment group
and 6 in the control group had generalized clinical attachment loss, and 48 patients in the treatment group and 45 in the control group had localized clinical attachment loss after the baseline
examination. Patients with generalized progression in periodontal disease were treated before
delivery with the following therapies: one patient
in the treatment group and two patients in the
control group underwent full-mouth scaling and
root planing, one patient in the control group underwent root planing and received systemic antibiotics, and one patient in the treatment group
received systemic antibiotics alone. Three other

- The numbers of patients in the study groups do not include those who withdrew from the study or were lost to follow
up. Two women who underwent elective abortions were treated as lost to follow-up at the time of the abortion. The
analyses of birth weight, birth length, size for gestational age, Apgar scores, number of admissions to a neonatal inten­
sive care unit, and the rate of preterm births included 391 patients in the control group and 402 in the treatment group
(i.e., excluding women who had spontaneous abortion or stillbirth). Plus–minus values are means ±SD, unless other­
wise noted.
† P values in this category were calculated with the use of Fisher’s exact test.
‡ P values for Apgar scores were calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
§ This category includes all live preterm births in the specified gestational period. Percentages were calculated as a frac­

tion of all live births.

- This category includes patients with pregnancy-associated hypertension occurring 4 hours to 14 days after an episode
of pregnancy-associated proteinuria in a woman with no previous hypertension or proteinuria; patients with pregnancyassociated hypertension in conjunction with pulmonary edema or thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets per cubic milli­
meter); and patients with the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP).
‖ Plus–minus values in this category are means ±SE. The number is the value at baseline minus the value at follow-up.


patients were treated after delivery and one declined treatment. Overall, only a small fraction of
all tooth sites lost clinical attachment (0.17% in
the treatment group and 0.28% in the control
group, P = 0.17).


**Additional Analyses of Birth Outcomes**
We also conducted several post hoc analyses (Fig.
3). Because it is possible that treatment may improve the outcomes of pregnancy only in women
with more severe disease, we performed analyses


n engl j med 355;18 www nejm org november 2 2006 1891

that were limited to women with extensive gingival bleeding (the highest one third or two thirds
of patients in terms of the percentage of bleeding
on probing at baseline) or periodontal pocketing
(the highest third of patients in terms of the percentage of sites with a probing depth ≥4 mm). In
these subgroups, the risk of preterm delivery did
not differ significantly between the treatment and
control groups (Fig. 3). Although preterm births
were more frequent in our study than in earlier trials of periodontal treatment,[14,15] we also performed
analyses that were limited to women with previous
preterm births or with a previous preterm birth,
spontaneous or induced abortion, or stillbirth, and
found similar results (Fig. 3).

Noncompliance with study treatment may have
diluted a treatment effect. Yet we found no significant effect of periodontal treatment on the risk
of preterm delivery at the two sites (Minnesota and
Kentucky) with the highest compliance and the
largest periodontal treatment effects or among the
subgroup of patients who had four or more followup visits (Fig. 3).

Another possibility is that the periodontal treatment did not affect periodontitis sufficiently to
affect birth outcomes. However, we also found no
significant effects of treatment on preterm births
in analyses comparing all patients in the control
group with only the “best responders” to treatment, as defined by the highest third of proportional reduction in the percentage of bleeding on
probing (i.e., a reduction of at least 40%; P = 0.59)


(Fig. 3); the lowest residual percentage of bleeding
on probing after treatment (35.7% or less, P = 0.26);
or periodontal condition after treatment that did
not meet the eligibility criteria of the study, which
occurred among 178 women in the treatment
group (P = 0.48).

We found that scaling and root planing before 21
weeks of gestation plus monthly tooth polishing
thereafter did not significantly alter the risk of
preterm delivery before 37 weeks, increase birth
weight, improve Apgar scores, or reduce either the
rate of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit
or the proportion of infants who were small for
gestational age. Treatment improved clinical measures of periodontal disease and was not associated
with adverse medical events.

These results are inconsistent with reports of
two previous randomized trials of periodontal
treatment during pregnancy. Jeffcoat et al.[14] randomly assigned 366 pregnant women to one of
three groups. One group underwent scaling and
planing and received metronidazole, the second
group underwent simple cleaning and received
placebo, and the third group underwent scaling
and planing and received placebo for 7 days. Preterm birth rates (before 35 weeks and before 37
weeks of gestation) were lowest in the group that
underwent root planing and received placebo but
did not differ significantly among the groups.


Discussion

Because no data were reported on the effectiveness of periodontal treatment per se, we cannot
compare the effect of such treatment in this study
with that in ours.

In a study of Chilean women mostly from low
socioeconomic strata,[15] periodontal therapy significantly reduced the rate of preterm birth (1.1%
in the treated group vs. 6.4% in the control group,
P = 0.02). Several differences between this study
and ours deserve mention. Whereas the Chilean
study included subjects of Spanish and Aboriginal descent, we recruited a more diverse sample
from four locations in the United States. The Chilean group also had a greater average response to
periodontal treatment than did patients in our
study, a finding that could be associated with the
use of chlorhexidine mouth rinses and systemic
antibiotics (18% of patients received amoxicillin
and metronidazole) in the Chilean study. Our
study, by contrast, used neither agent, for the following reasons. Although chlorhexidine reduces
gingival bleeding,[24] its effect on periodontitis is
slight,[25] and it causes tooth staining that can unmask treatment. Systemic antibiotics, although
useful adjuncts in severe periodontitis,[26] may resolve nonoral infections and confound the effects
of local periodontal therapy on the outcomes of
pregnancy. Also, the study by Jeffcoat et al. suggests that the use of systemic antibiotics after root
planing does not significantly improve birth outcomes. Finally, although antibiotics that are delivered into the periodontal pocket enhance the response to root planing,[27] all the products that are
available in the United States are tetracycline derivatives and are contraindicated during pregnancy.
Nonetheless, our treatment response, in terms of
mean reductions in the probing depth and attachment loss, is consistent with improvements after
scaling and root planing reported in persons who
are not pregnant.[28,29]

It is possible that we delivered periodontal care
too late in pregnancy to affect birth outcomes.
The timing of our care, however, was consistent
with that in the two previous randomized trials.
Additional studies would be needed to determine
whether the provision of periodontal treatment
even earlier in pregnancy or before conception
might improve birth outcomes.

One theory linking periodontitis to pregnancy
outcomes posits that oral bacteria seed the pla

centa, membranes, or amniotic fluid through
blood-borne routes, eliciting an inflammatory cascade that precipitates preterm labor.[30] We did not
assess bacteremia, but recent reports cast doubt
on this theory. For example, although one report
showed that periodontal disease was more prevalent in mothers who delivered preterm than in
those who delivered full term,[7] periodontal pathogens were detected in placentas of only 2 of 59
mothers who delivered preterm and of only 3 of
44 mothers delivering full term. Another study
failed to detect periodontal bacteria in the amniotic fluid of women with periodontitis who delivered preterm, even though these microorganisms were frequently found in dental plaque.[31]
Moreover, the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum
in dental plaque and vaginal-swab samples was not
associated with the presence of the bacteria in
amniotic fluid.[32]

Given the 95% CI of the hazard ratio for preterm delivery for patients in the treatment group,
as compared with those in the control group (0.63
to 1.37), we cannot rule out a modest increase or
decrease in the risk of preterm delivery with periodontal treatment. We observed a nonsignificant
reduction in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth
with periodontal treatment. Other reports have
linked periodontal disease[12,33] and other nonuterine maternal infections[34,35] with an increased risk
of miscarriage. However, we view this finding with
particular caution because only 19 patients in our
study had either a spontaneous abortion or stillbirth and because we began evaluating rates of
earlier pregnancy losses (using a competing-risks
analysis) only after seven such events had occurred.

In summary, the treatment of periodontitis in
pregnant women was safe and effective in improving periodontal disease. However, it did not
significantly alter the rates of preterm birth, low
birth weight, fetal growth restriction, or preeclampsia.
