## Periodontal Therapy May Reduce the Risk of Preterm Low Birth Weight in Women With Periodontal Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial

#### Néstor J. López,* Patricio C. Smith,* and Jorge Gutierrez[†]


**Background: Recent studies have suggested that periodon-**
tal disease is a risk factor for preterm low birth weight (PLBW).
A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to help further
evaluate the proposed association between periodontal disease
and PLBW.
**Methods: Four hundred pregnant women with periodontal**
disease, aged 18 to 35, were enrolled while receiving prenatal
care in Santiago, Chile. Women were randomly assigned to either
an experimental group (n = 200), which received periodontal
treatment before 28 weeks of gestation or to a control group (n
= 200) which received periodontal treatment after delivery. Previous and current pregnancies and known risk factors were
obtained from patient medical records and interviews. The primary outcome assessed was the delivery at less than 37 weeks
of gestation or an infant weighing less than 2,500 g.
**Results: Of the 400 women enrolled, 49 were excluded from**
the analyses for different reasons. The incidence of PLBW in the
treatment group was 1.84% (3/163) and in the control group was
10.11% (19/188), (odds ratio [OR] 5.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65 to 18.22, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that periodontal disease was the strongest
factor related to PLBW (OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 17.13). Other
factors significantly associated with such deliveries were: previous PLBW (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.11 to 14.21), less than 6 prenatal visits (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.46 to 9.38), and maternal low
weight gain (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.03).
**Conclusions: Periodontal disease appears to be an indepen-**
dent risk factor for PLBW. Periodontal therapy significantly
reduces the rates of PLBW in this population of women with
periodontal disease. J Periodontol 2002;73:911-924.

ow birth weight and its 2 components, preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction, are major

# L

predictors of perinatal mortality and morbidity.[1,2] Multiple factors have been associated with preterm delivery and low birth
weight[3,4] and some authors have emphasized the heterogeneity of the causes of
preterm birth.[5,6]

Convincing evidence has associated
preterm birth with infection, especially
genito-urinary infections, which appear
to be an important factor in the premature rupture of membranes.[4,7] Several
studies have linked bacterial vaginosis
with preterm birth.[8-10] However, treatment
of vaginosis has not led to definite conclusions on its efficacy in reducing preterm
delivery[11-14] and the impact of such intervention on preterm birth rate remains
unclear.[15] Results of 2 case-control studies[16,17] and a concurrent cohort study[18]

showed that periodontal diseases may be
a potential independent risk factor for
preterm birth and low birth weight after
adjusting for several known risk factors.
Periodontal diseases are a group of
infectious diseases resulting in inflammation of gingival and periodontal tissues and progressive loss of alveolar
bone. The periodontal infection is initiated and sustained by several bacteria,
predominantly Gram-negative, anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria that colonize the subgingival area. Host defense

pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Tissue destruction in periodontitis is mainly due to the activation of
immune cells by cell wall components of microorganisms, such as lipopolysaccharides, which potently stimulate production of host-derived enzymes, cytokines,
and other pro-inflammatory mediators resulting in connective tissue destruction.[19]

Infections affecting the mother during pregnancy
may produce alterations in the normal cytokine and
hormone-regulated gestation, which could result in
preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and
preterm birth.[20-22] It has been postulated that the association between periodontal disease and preterm/low
birth weight (PLBW) may have similar pathogenic
mechanisms as other maternal infections.[23]

Identification of risk factors for preterm birth and
low birth weight should help in the development of
strategies to reduce the prevalence of these conditions.
A randomized controlled clinical trial was undertaken
to: 1) determine the relationship between periodontal
disease and PLBW; 2) quantify the association between
other risk factors and PLBW; and 3) determine if periodontal therapy in pregnant women with periodontal
disease reduces the risk of PLBW. The main null
hypothesis tested was that there are no significant differences in the incidence of PLBW in pregnant women
with periodontal disease treated before 28 weeks of
gestation compared to women with periodontal disease treated after delivery.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**
**_Study Population_**
The population study consisted of pregnant women
who were invited to participate in the study while
receiving routine prenatal care in Consultorio Carol
Urzúa of Peñalolén, a district of Santiago, Chile. Women
were of low socioeconomic status and received free
uniform prenatal care at that clinic, which belongs to
the National Public Health Service System, under the
technical supervision of the Ministry of Health. Every
year, about 1,100 pregnant women receive prenatal
care at the facility.
The prenatal care program applied by the Public
Health Services in Chile was designed by the Ministry
of Health’s Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal
Care. The program includes regular examinations,
screening for pregnancy complications, nutritional
advice, laboratory tests for risk assessments, stress
reduction, education about the symptoms of preterm
labor, correction of identified risk factors, and referral
to the high-risk obstetric clinic when necessary.
As part of the recruitment process for the study, the
midwives who were in charge of the prenatal care clinics referred to the investigators all the women, aged
18 to 35, who were receiving prenatal care. Eight hun

weeks of gestation gave verbal consent to determine
their periodontal status.
The patients medical records were thoroughly examined, relevant data were extracted and eligibility for
the study was determined. The recruitment of patients
was done over a 20-month period.
**Inclusion criteria. Otherwise healthy pregnant women,**
aged 18 to 35, with a singleton gestation, between 9
and 21 weeks of gestation, with periodontal disease
and with fewer than 18 natural teeth were identified
for inclusion in the study.
**Exclusion criteria.** Exclusion criteria included history of congenital heart disease requiring prophylactic antibiotics for invasive procedures, existing diabetes before pregnancy, current use of corticosteroids,
chronic renal disease, and the intention to deliver at a
hospital other than that of the study.
Patient selection, periodontal therapy, and maintenance treatment were done in a dental clinic located
in the building in which the prenatal care was given.
An informed written consent was obtained from each
volunteer and the study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board.

**_Sample Size_**
Assuming a probability of preterm low birth weight of
20% in the control group and a probability of 10% in
the treatment group, we believed that 280 women in
each group might detect a significant difference of
PLBW between groups (P <0.050; 2-sided) with a
power of 80%. The results of the incidence of PLBW
in the study groups were reviewed after completing
160 deliveries in each group with the understanding the
trial would end early for ethical reasons if the observed
_P value of the differences between the groups was_
<0.05 as, indeed, did occur. There were 400 women
enrolled in the study when at least 160 deliveries had
occurred in each group.

**_Measurement of Periodontal Status_**
Upon entering the study all women received a fullmouth periodontal examination and the following variables were determined: oral hygiene status, gingival
inflammation, probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Oral hygiene status was assessed
as the percentage of surfaces demonstrating plaque.
Dichotomous measures of supragingival plaque accumulation were made by running a periodontal probe
at the cervical surface of each tooth. The presence of
plaque was positive when a continuous band of plaque
was found in contact with the gingival tissue on the cervical portion of mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual tooth
surfaces.
Probing depth and attachment level measurements
were made at the mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal,
distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual positions of every

measured using the cemento-enamel junction as a reference point.
Bleeding on probing (BOP) was assessed on the 6
sites at which PD was determined and deemed positive if it occurred within 15 seconds after probing. BOP
was expressed as the percentage of sites showing
bleeding. Gingival redness was determined on 2 gingival units per tooth. It was deemed positive when gingival redness involved all the marginal and/or the
attached gingiva of the lingual or buccal gingiva of a
tooth. Gingival redness was expressed as the percentage of gingival units showing redness.
Clinical measurements were recorded to the nearest millimeter using a calibrated periodontal probe by
2 calibrated examiners who are periodontists. Calibration sessions to measure agreement between the
examiners were conducted and intra- and inter-examiner reliability was recorded until satisfactory agreement was reached. The reproducibility expressed as
proportion of agreement between clinical scores was
91% for probing depth and bleeding. For attachment
level and gingival redness the proportion of agreement
between examiners was 88% and 86%, respectively.
The examination also included recording of the number of teeth present, with carious lesions, missing, and
with fillings (DMFT index), and any other notable features in the oral cavity; e.g., soft tissue abnormalities,
pericoronitis.

**_Diagnoses of Periodontal Disease_**
The presence of 4 or more teeth with 1 or more sites
with PD ≥4 mm and with clinical attachment loss ≥3
mm at the same site was diagnosed as periodontal
disease. Women were randomly assigned to either the
experimental group, which received periodontal therapy before 28 weeks of gestation or to the control
group which received therapy after delivery. Randomization was done equalizing periodontal disease as the
relevant variable and PD was selected as the variable
describing periodontal disease. Patients were assigned
to 1 of 2 categories: those with a mean PD <2.5 mm
and those with a mean PD ≥2.5 mm. Patients were
matched on the basis of the mean PD. Each patient
of the matched pair was allocated to the treatment or
the control group by a coin toss.

**_Recording of Maternal Characteristics_**
Demographic factors such as age, marital status, and
educational level as well as detailed data about previous and current pregnancies were obtained from the
patient medical records and from interviews during
prenatal visits. A medical, obstetrical, and social history was taken according to the protocol of the prenatal care program for each patient. Information on
known risk factors and obstetric factors were collected


In relation to pregnancy history: number carried to
full term, number of previous preterm deliveries, number of low weight births, number of previous pregnancies aborted, and number of live births.
In relation to the current pregnancy: maternal age
at the time of study entry, onset of prenatal care, nutritional status, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, use
of illicit drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary infections, vaginosis or any
other maternal infectious disease, number of prenatal
visits, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, gestational age, and birth weight.
Prenatal care included the following procedures:
blood pressure measurements, urine tests, blood tests,
recording of maternal weight and height, and physical
and pelvic examinations. At each prenatal visit, an
evaluation of nutritional status was done to determine
if weight gain was adequate. A normal standard of the
weight-to height proportion established for Chilean
women was used for the evaluation of nutrition status.
At every week of gestation, pregnant women should
gain weight within the recommended range for her
weight-to height proportion. The nomogram by Rosso
and Mardones[24] was used to assess whether weight
gain was adequate. Underweight women received supplementary nutrition.
As a uniform prenatal care protocol was applied to
all the women of this study, theoretically all of them
received adequate care. However, there were women
who began the prenatal care at different times in their
gestational period, and/or who did not adhere to the
scheduled prenatal visits. In order to assess if prenatal
care had been adequate, the number of weeks of gestation at the beginning of prenatal care and the number
of prenatal visits were used as assessment criteria. Prenatal care was categorized as starting routine care before
12 weeks of gestation, between 13 and 20 weeks of
gestation, and after 20 weeks of gestation. A woman
who smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day was considered a smoker. The number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week and use of any illegal drugs were also
recorded. Antibiotic therapy during the gestational period,
including dates and indications, was also recorded.
According to the prenatal care program protocol, women
with symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine
culture with >100,000 c.f.u.), were treated with nitrofurantoin for 10 days. Vaginal swabs for Gram-stained
smears and for microbiological assessment from women
who presented vaginal discharge with a fishy odor were
taken. The presence of bacterial vaginosis was determined by Gram stain assessment.[25] Detection of _Tri-_
_chomonas vaginalis was done by wet mount and monilia_
by potassium hydroxide preparation. All women with
vaginosis were treated with locally applied antibiotics,
either metronidazole, clotrimazole, or nistatine, accord

**_Periodontal Therapy_**
Periodontal therapy consisted of plaque control instructions, scaling, and root planing performed under local
anesthesia. At the beginning of treatment, each woman
was instructed to rinse once a day with 0.12% chlorhexidine. Periodontal therapy was completed before 28
weeks of gestation and maintenance therapy was provided every 2 to 3 weeks until delivery. Another complete periodontal examination was given after finishing the therapy. All measurements for a given woman
were performed by the same examiner. Carious lesions
were treated and all teeth indicated for extraction were
extracted from both groups.
Women in the control group were monitored every
4 to 6 weeks during the gestational period to determine
any change in their periodontal condition and another
periodontal examination was performed after 28 weeks
of gestation.

**_Assessment of Pregnancy Outcomes_**
Primary outcomes measured were preterm birth and
low birth weight as they have been used in other studies aimed to determine association between adverse
pregnancy outcomes and periodontal disease.[16,17,26]

Preterm birth was defined as spontaneous delivery at
less than 37 completed weeks of gestation[27] that followed spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture of
membranes, as there is considerable evidence that the
risk factors for both are similar and the distinction is
artificial.[28] Low birth weight (LBW) was assessed as
positive when the infant had a birth weight under 2,500
g.[27] The birth outcome which occurred after 37 completed weeks of gestation or the birth of an infant with
a weight ≥2,500 g was defined as normal.
Since the definition of preterm birth depends on
accurate pregnancy dating, both obstetric and neonatal criteria were used. Estimation of gestational age
was based on the last menstrual period, ultrasound
examinations, sequential physical examinations, and
post-natal examination. All women had an ultrasonographic examination between 9 to 24 weeks for gestational age dating and to rule out congenital anomalies. The criterion used to determine the gestational
age was based on menstrual dates if it differed by less
than 2 weeks from that determined by an ultrasound
examination performed at ≤16 weeks of gestation. If
the patient was unsure of her last menstrual period or
there was more than a 2-week discrepancy between
the gestational age based on menstrual dates and the
ultrasound examination, the determination of gestational age was based on the ultrasound assessment if
this examination had been done before 16 weeks of
gestation. In the few cases in which the patient had no
recorded last menstrual dates, or the ultrasound examination had been performed after 16 weeks of gesta

judgment and on the pediatrician’s estimate based on
the Ballard et al. neonatal assessment.[29] Labor and
delivery management decisions were made by the resident staff and attending physicians at the hospital.
They had no knowledge that the patients were participating in a research study.
The records of patients who delivered before 37
completed weeks of gestation or who had infants
weighing less than 2,500 g were reviewed by the obstetrician researcher of the study (JG) before a final gestational age assignment was made. An infant born at
term (≥37 weeks of gestation) with a birth weight less
than 2500 g was diagnosed as having an intrauterine
growth restriction if the birth weight was in the tenth
percentile for gestational age determined on the nomogram for Chilean newborn infants.[30] The obstetrician
was masked from the mother’s periodontal data.
Women who had a medically indicated preterm
delivery that followed pregnancies complicated by
maternal medical or obstetric disorders; e.g., preeclampsia or eclampsia, polyhidramnios, gestational diabetes,
or placenta previa were excluded from the analysis.

**_Statistical Analysis_**
Women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation
(PTB) or had a low-birth-weigh infant (LBW) were
grouped in the preterm/low-birth-weight group (PLBW)
for the analyses of data to identify the risk factors. The
analyses included descriptive statistics and both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Categorical variables were compared by the chi square
test or Fisher’s exact test and continuous variables
by the unpaired t test. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify the risk factors for PLBW starting with all variables included in a
univariate analysis. A stepwise, multiple logistic
regression was performed. Unadjusted and adjusted
odds ratios were calculated with 95% confidence limits. Data to determine the odds ratios for PTB, LBW,
and PLBW were analyzed on an intention-to-treat
basis, regardless of compliance with protocol. The
intention-to-treat analysis involved all patients who
were randomly assigned and from whom the pregnancy outcomes were available. Odds ratios for PTB,
LBW, and PLBW were also determined per protocol
analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a
software program.[‡] Statistical significance was defined
as P <0.05.

**DISCUSSION**
The method used in the present study attempted to
control several of the known risk factors of PLBW.
Women aged from 18 to 35 years were selected
because maternal age under 18 and over 35 years
has been found a risk factor for PLBW.[3] Only patients
with a singleton gestation were included because the
relationship between multiple gestation and preterm
labor is well established.[3] Women were randomly
assigned to each group equalizing periodontal disease
as the relevant variable. As the study sample was
obtained from a homogeneous population in relation
to age and other demographic characteristics, it was
assumed that the distribution of other variables would
be similar in both groups of women. The only 2 significant differences in both groups at baseline were
the mean age of women (28 versus 27) and the percentage of single women. Both factors were significantly higher in the treatment group. The difference
of one year in the age of women is irrelevant since
women in both groups were in the range of age in
which this factor is not related to PLBW and there
were no differences in the distribution of women by
age in either group (Table 2). Unmarried women have
been generally found to be at a higher rate of preterm
birth than married women after adjusting for other
related factors,[3] but in the present study, marital status was not found to be related to PLBW. Although
proper random assignment prevents selection bias, it
does not always guarantee that the groups are totally
equivalent at baseline. Any differences in some baseline characteristics, as occurred in the present study,
may be the result of chance rather than bias.[32]

Women in the present study had free access to prenatal care services to reduce the risk of adverse birth
outcomes. A relationship between the use of prenatal care and birth outcomes has been shown[33-35] and
the beneficial effects of prenatal care are strongest
among socially disadvantaged women.[35-37] Adequate
utilization of this care has been associated with
improved birth weights and a lower risk of preterm
delivery.[38,39] In the present study, it was possible to
control many of the known risk factors for PLBW, if
the patients adequately used the prenatal care offered.
Women with less than 6 prenatal visits or those who
showed low weight gain during pregnancy inadequately utilized the prenatal care available and were
at a higher risk of a PLBW.
After evaluating the relationship between many
potential factors and PLBW in the present study, 4 significant associations were found: periodontal disease,
previous PLBW, less than 6 prenatal visits, and low
maternal weight gain. Of these, periodontal disease
showed the strongest association in the univariate
analysis and after adjustment for confounding vari

interval 1.29 to 17.13, Table 8) which suggests that it
is an independent risk factor for PLBW. Although the
estimates of odds ratios for the 4 risk factors associated with PLBW are high and statistically significant, the
associated confidence intervals are rather wide, indicating some imprecision in these estimates. The wide
confidence intervals are probably a consequence of the
small frequencies of these 4 variables in the PLBW cells
of the model (Table 7) and to the size of the sample
used. The study aimed to achieve a sample size of 280


in each group of women, an interim analysis was performed as previously planned, which revealed that the
difference in PLBW rates between the groups reached
a P value <0.05. For ethical reasons, it was decided to
cease enrollment and stop the clinical trial.
Eighteen women in the treatment group withdrew
from periodontal therapy because they felt uncomfortable during the treatment appointments. Data from
the dental public services in Chile show that 12% of
pregnant women usually abandon dental treatments

quent withdrawal or deviation from the pro

the validity of excluding specific
cases within each of these categories from an intention-to-treat
analysis.[43] Some authors have postulated that treatment effectiveness
may be overestimated if an intention-to-treat analysis is not done.[44]

including the 18 women who withdrew from periodontal treatment in

determine the odds ratios for PTB,
LBW, and PLBW, it was found that

of gestation and 233 women with periodontitis who
were treated after delivery. In that study, the adjusted
3.5 risk ratio for women with periodontal disease to
have a PLBW was lower than the OR of 4.7 found in
the present study.
The other factors in the present analysis that were
significantly associated with PLBW are consistent with
the results of other studies.[18,33,38,47-50] Urinary infections and vaginosis are well known risk factors of
PLBW.[6-10] There was a significant proportion of women
in the present study who presented urinary infections
and/or vaginosis, but no association was found
between these variables and PLBW probably due to
the adequate treatment of these infections. Since there
is no data about the effect of oral nitrofurantoin on the
progression of periodontal disease, the possible influence of this antibiotic on periodontal disease in the
control group was investigated. No differences were
found in the patients in the control group who received
nitrofurantoin when we compared their periodontal
characteristics at baseline with those after 28 weeks
of gestation, and with those of the patients in the control group who did not receive nitrofurantoin (data not
shown). Additionally, the logistic regression analyses
detected no relationship between nitrofurantoin therapy
and PLBW.
There is convincing evidence that maternal smoking is associated with LBW and with a moderately
increased risk for PTB.[51,52] In the present study, the
proportion of smokers was similar in both groups, and
smoking did not show an association with PLBW. A
dose-response relationship between smoking and LBW
has been found, with birth weight impairments increasing with the number of cigarettes smoked.[3,53] In a
study by Cnattingius et al.,[54] the odds ratio for preterm
delivery among women who smoked 1 to 9 cigarettes


as compared with non-smokers was 1.4 and 1.6,
respectively. Of the 351 women in the present study,
126 women smoked ≥1 cigarettes per day. Of these,
107 (87.7%) smoked ≥5 cigarettes per day. As the
percentage of women who smoked <4 cigarettes per
day was low (12%) and considering that the risk of
PTB has been found to increase with an increasing
number of cigarettes smoked, we decided to use the
case-definition of non-smoker as one who smoked <5
cigarettes per day. Thus, the result of the relationship
between smoking and PLBW in the current study may
have some limitations. Additionally, data about tobacco
use in the present study were recorded at the time the
women entered the study, and we did not verify if
smoking continued during pregnancy. Prenatal care
given to women in the present study involved health
education and strong anti-smoking counseling to
reduce or eliminate smoking during pregnancy. Therefore, a large percentage of smokers probably quit
smoking, and this may explain the lack of association
between PLBW and smoking.
Twenty-nine women in the treatment group were
given metronidazole and amoxicillin because of severe
periodontitis. It is possible that this antibiotic therapy
may have controlled or eliminated other infections
which may have also been a risk factor for PLBW.
However, the univariate regression analyses did not
show a relationship between PLBW and antibiotic treatment for periodontal disease.
The association between a previous PLBW and the
current PLBW, with an odds ratio of 3.98, was the
strongest risk factor found after periodontal disease,
even though the prevalence of a previous PLBW was
rather low (7.80%) in the multiparous women. Several
other studies have found that a history of PLBW is a
significant risk factor for PTB in subsequent pregnancies with adjusted odds ratios ranging between 2.45 to
6.2.[3,18,47-50] It is not known why a woman with a previous PLBW has a higher risk to have a subsequent
one. It is possible that in women with a positive history of PLBW, the cause of the subsequent PLBW may
be the same factor that caused the previous PLBW.
Kramer[53] stated that only 25% to 30% of cases of PTB
can be explained by identified risk factors. Until
recently, there was no awareness that periodontal disease could be a risk factor for PLBW. However, according to the results of the present study, periodontal disease may be one of the unidentified risk factors in
women with a history of previous PLBW.
The mechanisms by which periodontal disease might
cause PLBW are still not known, but there is evidence
that this association has biologically feasible bases.
The role of prostaglandins (PG) in human labor has
been well documented.[21] Increased amniotic fluid concentrations of PG, including PGE2, have been shown


-----

of PGE2 on myometrial contractility is also well known.
There is also experimental evidence that interleukin1β (IL-1β) might be involved in infection-induced
preterm labor by interfering with the normal regulation
of EP1 receptor levels and with the promotion of
increased PGE2 production in amnion tissue.[56] Gingival crevicular fluid increases considerably in inflamed
periodontal tissues and contains high levels of inflammatory mediators. It has been shown that increased
levels of PGE2 and IL-1β in gingival crevicular fluid in
patients with periodontal disease were highly correlated with the levels of intra-amniotic PGE2 and IL1β.[23] Additionally, in a pregnant hamster model, subcutaneous infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a
common periodontal pathogen, induced elevations in
intra-amniotic PGE2 and tumor necrosis factor-α and
result in fetal growth restriction.[57] Recently, a prospective follow-up study among predominantly AfricanAmerican primiparous women[58] found that the second trimester levels of serum antibody against _P._
_gingivalis were related to LBW. These studies pro-_
vided evidence that periodontal disease can produce
an unfavorable change in the fetal environment and
may be a sufficiently infectious challenge to produce
PLBW.
The main characteristics of the current study can be
summarized as follows: 1) periodontal disease was
diagnosed before the third trimester of pregnancy,
establishing that the exposure variable was present
before the occurrence of outcomes. 2) The treatment
and control groups were similar with respect to the
risk factors for PLBW and were also comparable in the
extent and severity of periodontal disease at baseline.
3) Periodontal therapy administered to the treatment
group significantly changed the periodontal characteristics to the level of periodontal health. Thus, for
the objective of the current study, to determine the
association between periodontal disease and PLBW,
women in the treatment group were periodontally
healthy and without periodontal infection. 4) The periodontal characteristics of women in the control group
did not change significantly during pregnancy, thus an
effect of the passage of time, as a confounder factor
in women in the control group, did not exist. 5) Women
with PLBW exhibited significantly more severe periodontal disease than women with normal births, which
may suggest a dose-response relationship.
The present study analyzed risk factor data for PLBW
prospectively collected, fulfilling several of the criteria
needed to assess the causal contribution of associated
factors. To our knowledge, this represents the first effort
to examine the relationship between periodontal disease and PLBW using a randomized controlled clinical trial. Additional studies using similar methodology
in other populations are needed to corroborate these


**CONCLUSIONS**
Results of the present study showed that: 1) periodontal
disease is an independent risk factor for PLBW and
affords more than a 4-fold increase in the risk of PLBW;
2) other risk factors significantly associated with such
deliveries in the population studied were a history of
PLBW, less than 6 prenatal visits, and low maternal
weight gain; and 3) periodontal therapy significantly
reduces the rate of PLBW in women with periodontal
disease.
