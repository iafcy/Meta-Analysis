## Abstract

Considering the high prevalence of preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) and their complications as well as the role
played by periodontal disease in their incidence and the lack of any report of periodontal therapy on these problems in Iran, the
goal of the present research was to determine the effects of periodontal treatment on PLBW incidence among women with
moderate or advanced periodontitis who were referred to Javaheri hospital (2004-2005). This clinical trial research was con­
ducted on 30 pregnant women age ranging from 18-35 years old, with moderate or advanced periodontitis. Fifteen subjects
randomly underwent the first phase of periodontal treatment including scaling, root planning and the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine
mouth rinse for one week. None of these steps were taken for the controls. After necessary follow ups, the effect of periodontal
treatment on birth term and birth weight were analyzed statistically. This research was conducted on 30 subjects, 15 controls
and 15 cases in study group. In the control group, the observed rate of PLBW was 26.7% whereas among periodontally treated
group, phase I, PLBW infant was not observed (P<0.05). Infants birth weight were (3059.3-389.7) gms in study group and
(3371-394.2) gms in the control group and respectively (P<0.05). Periodontal therapy, phase I, results in a reduction in PLBW
incidence rate. Therefore, the application of such a simple method among periodontally diseased pregnant women is recom­
mended.


**Key words: Birth term, birth weight, periodontal treatment**

Preterm birth (PTB) which refers to the delivery of a new
born child before the 37th week of pregnancy and low birth
weight (LBW) which refers to the birth of a newborn child
with a weight equal or less than 2500 gms are grouped un­
der the term of preterm low birth weight (PLB W).[[1] ]PLBW is
one of the highly significant causes for mortality and mor­
bidity among infant.[[2]] Approximately 11% of all pregnancies
lead to PLBW[[3]] and despite considerable progresses in medi­
cal care, this rate is increasing in western countries.[[4]] PLBW
infants are greatly exposed to the risk of a number of acute
and chronic disorders such as respiratory distress syndrome,
cerebral palsy, heart diseases, epilepsy and severe learning
disabilities.[[5] ]

According to statistics nearly 10% of pregnant women in U.S.A
are affected with pre-term delivery causing more than 60%
of all neonatal mortality as well as 50% of infants medic care
expenses in this country.[[6] ]

The role of infection as an underlying cause for PLBW has
been investigated earlier and have found relationship be­
tween periodontal disease and PTB.[[7]] It has been found that
mothers with PLBW babies have more periodontal problems
than the mothers with normal babies.

The rate of PLBW among women treated periodontally has
been reported less than those who have not received such a
treatment.[[1,7,9] ]

Periodontal parameters including pocket depth, clinical at­
tachment loss, bleeding on probing were investigated.
Pocket depths, from gingival margin to the pocket base, were
measured and recorded in milimeter for all teeth except the
third molars, at six points using a Williams probe. Clinical
attachment loss was also measured in milimeter at surround­
ing points of each tooth from CEJ to the base of pocket by a
Williams probe. Bleeding on probing was evaluated as posi­
tive if bleeding was observed within seconds after pocket
depth measurement, otherwise bleeding on probing was
considered as negative. Subjects, having 4 or more than 4
teeth, with at least one site with pocket depth of (equal or
more than 4 mm) and clinical attachment loss of (equal or


Considering the importance of this problem and the lack of
any related evidence in this country, the aim of this study
was to determine the effects of periodontal treatment phase
I on pregnant women with moderate or advanced periodon­
titis.

## Materials and Methods


In this randomized clinical trial research, pregnant women
in the 18 to 35 year age group with moderate or advanced
periodontal disease who were in the 13[th] to 20[th] week of
pregnancy participated.

Subjects having a history of congenital heart disease requir­
ing prophylactic antibiotics, diabetes, current use of corti­
costeroids, chronic renal disease, and with the presence of
fetal congenial abnormality (evaluated ultrasonically until
the 20[th] week) were excluded.

more than 3 mm) were diagnosed with periodontal disease.
Following the selection of 30 women, based on the above
mentioned criteria, they were randomly divided into two
groups. Fifteen women, who were less than 28[th] week of
pregnant, underwent the first phase of periodontal treat­
ment including ultrasonic scaling and hand instrument root
planning under local anesthesia with Lidocaine or
Mepivastesin, if needed. Maintenance phase of treatment
consisted of oral hygiene instructions, use of 0.2%
chlorhexidine mouth rinse once a night for one week pe­
riod and periodontal evaluation once every two weeks prior
to delivery.

Control group subjects did not receive any treatment and
they were recommended all types of periodontal treatment
after delivery. The studied women were also investigated
for risk factors including cigarette smoking, genitourinary
tract infections, history of PLB delivery, weight before preg­
nancy and antibiotic therapy due to pregnancy infection.
Smoking of more than 5 cigarettes was considered as a cri­
teria for smokers. Women with vaginal or urinary tract in­
fection were suggested to consult with a gynecologist. Moth­
ers weight of less than 50 kg before pregnancy was consid­
ered as low weight subjects. Those having obstetric disor­
ders, e.g, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, preeclamp­
sia eclampsia and polyhidramnios were excluded.

Periodontal examinations were repeated after the 28[th] week
of pregnancy for control group and 2nd week after treat­
ment (maximally during the 30th week) for the study group.

Infants weight and delivery time in weeks were recorded.

Data were subjected to chi square, Fisher’s exact test and T.
C test for statistical analysis.


It should be also mentioned that in control group and infant


## Results

In this research, 30 pregnant women with moderate or ad­
vanced periodontitis were selected. The mean age of con­
trol group was 28.4+4.1 whereas that of case group was
29.1+4.3 (P<0.7). None of the subjects were excluded due
to abortion, eclampsia, preeclampsia, pregnancy diabetes,
placenta previa and polyhidramnios. Individual characteris­
tics and history of disease of all samples are shown in [Table
1] revealing that subjects of both groups had equal level of
educational status, history of previous PLBW maternal
weight before pregnancy and antibiotic therapy.


Periodontal characteristics, of each group, in preliminary ex­
aminations are shown in [Table 2] displayed no statistically
significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment
loss and the percentage of positive bleeding on probing sites
between groups (P>0.05).

In the control group repeated periodontal examinations were
conducted after 28[th] week of pregnancy while in the study
group at 2 weeks post treatment (maximally in 30[th] week).


Periodontal characteristics in monitored examinations dem­
onstrate that periodontal problems were resolved in the treat
group and significant differences in periodontal character­
istics existed between groups (P<0.05) [Table 3].

The mean birth weights were 3059+389. 7gr and
3371+394.2 gr in control and case groups, respectively
showing 312 gr or 10.2% increase among case subjects. Such
a difference was statistically significant according to t-test
analysis (P<0.05).

(6.7%) with low birth weight less than 2500 gr, was found
whereas in periodontally treated subjects no low birth weight
infants were found.

In control group, three infants were born before 37th week
of pregnancy but among periodontally treated group no
preterm low birth infants were observed. There was not any
statistically significant difference between groups in the
number of preterm infants using Fisher’s exact test (P<0.11).

The treatment group had higher mean gestational period (3
8.5+O.8 weeks versus 3 7.9+1.3 weeks) [Table 4] than the
control group, however, the difference was not statistically
significant (P<0.06).

The incidence rate of PLBW, both PTB and LBW, is shown in

[Table 5]. showing incidence rate of 26.7% in the control
group whereas there was no PLBW infant in the study group.
Fisher’s exact test proved statistically significant differences,
in PLBW incident rate between groups (P<0.05).

The risk of PLBW incidence among control group is several
times more than the study group.

## Discussion

The findings of this study showed that periodontal therapy
significantly reduces the incidence rate of PLBW among preg­
nant women with moderate or advanced periodontitis. The
incidence rate of PLBW, in the control group, was 26.7%
whereas no PLBW case was observed in the case group. There
was statistically significant difference in the mean birth
weight between groups with a 10.2% increase among the

Various risk factors are associated with PTB incidence in­
clude: low (<17 years) and high (> 37 years) maternal age,
African race, low socioeconomic status, inadequate prena­
tal care, alchohol and tobacco use, hypertension, genitouri­
nary tract infection; diabetes, multiple pregnancies, vaginosis
and a history of previous PTB.[[1,6-8]] Galloway initially sug­
gested that maternal periodontal disease caused potentially
harmful effects on the developing fetus. These findings were
not considered important until the time of Offenbacher who
stated that periodontal infections could act as reservoirs
for gram negative anaerobes and bacterial lipopolsyaccharide
(LPS) and endotoxin could increase inflammatory mediators
including PGE2 IL [-]C 1 and TNF-;A and pose a potential threat
to the fetal placental unit, even in the absence of genitouri­
nary infection, resulting in preterm labor and premature rup­
ture of membrane.[[8] ] Comparisons between post partum
women with PLBW and their counterparts with normal birth
outcome revealed higher levels Bacteroides Forsythus and
Campylobacter rectus for the first group.[[9] ]

Adequate utilization of prenatal care has been associated
with improved birth weights and lower risk of preterm de­


case group. Lopez et al. showed that periodontal therapy
could decrease the rate of PLB incidence in periodontally
diseased pregnant women,[[1]] however, the studied subjects
were not similar in two important risk factors involved in
PLBW incidence namely the mean age and marital status.

In the present study, both groups were similar in PLBW in­
fluencing factors and significant difference was observed.
Mitchell et al. suggested that periodontal therapy in
periodontally diseased pregnant women could lead to a re­
duction in PLBW incidence rate.[[9]] Jeffcoat et al. showed
that scaling and root planning, among other therapies,
played more effective role in the reduction of PLBW rate
and the addition of Metronidazole 250 mg times a day for
one week was less beneficial.[[7]] In the present study peri­
odontal treatment included scaling and root planing and
subjects affected with vaginal or genitourinary tract infec­
tion were treated by a gynecologist. There was no statisti­
cally significant difference in antibiotic therapy between
groups. Offenbacher et al. showed that pregnant women af­
fected with bacterial vaginal infection showed a decrease in
PLBW incidence rate (P<0.05) which could be justified by
Metronidazole therapy,[[8]] however; in Jeffcoat research Met­
ronidazole therapy associated with periodontal treatment
phase I, did not have a influence on PLBW incidence rate.[[7] ]

livery. In a lot of investigations, less than 6 prenatal visits
have been known as influencial risk factors on PLBW inci­
dence.[[1,8,10] ]

In the present study, all pregnant women were referred to
Javaheri hospital for prenatal care on once a month before
28[th] week of gestation and twice a month thereafter, so the
effect of the risk factor was eliminated. There was no statis­
tically significant difference in pre pregnancy weight (less
than 50 kg) and history of previous PLBW between groups.
The patients were selected from the same hospital and were
similar in socioeconomic status.

Periodontal therapy phase I is able to reduce the incidence
rate of PLBW. As result, periodontal treatments and oral hy­
giene instructions are essential to prevent future complica­
tions among pregnant women particularly those with peri­
odontitis. Pre pregnancy care and prenatal follow up are
thought to be the most reasonable choice.
