**SUMMARY**

**_Objective: To determine the efficacy of periodontal intervention on pregnancy outcome in mild preeclamptic women._**
**_Methods: A sample of 60 pregnant women with mild preeclampsia (blood pressure levels <160/110 mm and proteinuria_**
>300 mg/l in 24 hours urine) from the Hospital Universitario del Valle (Cali, Colombia) was included to the study. Preeclamptic
women were randomized in two groups, one with periodontal intervention (PIG, N=28) and another in which the periodontal
intervention was practiced after childbirth (NPIG, N=32). Maternal socio-demographic, medical and periodontal data were
obtained. PIG included patients in which supragingival and subgingival cleaning within ultrasonic and manual devices were
performed after study inclusion. The progression from mild to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome, the number
of days of clinical stability and the percentile of birth-weight adjusted for gestational age were evaluated in both groups.
**_Results: Most of the patients (60%) were multigravids. Gestational age at inclusion was 31.8±1.6 weeks. Chronic_**
periodontitis was a frequent finding (61.7%). Social, demographic, medical and periodontal conditions were similar between
both groups. Disease progression to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome was also similar (89.2% PIG versus
84.4%, p=0.65) (OR=1.06 IC 95% 0.87-1.29, p=0.65). Days of clinical stability were similar between the groups (median 10 days
, range 1-46, PIG versus 12 days, range 1-59, p=0.57) and the percentile of birth weight adjusted with gestational age had no
differences between the groups (median percentil 50 range 5-90 PIG versus percentil 55 range 5-95, p=0.73).
**_Conclusion: Periodontal intervention does not seem to harm the health, the severity or alter the frequency on maternal_**
complications in mild preeclampsia subjects.

**_Métodos: En un ensayo clínico controlado se evaluaron_**
60 mujeres embarazadas con diagnóstico de pre-eclampsia
leve (presión arterial <160/110 mm Hg y proteinuria >300 mg/
l en orina de 24 horas), que se trataron en la unidad de alto
riesgo obstétrico del Hospital Universitario del Valle (Cali,
Colombia). Se evaluaron las características socio-demográficas, así como los aspectos médicos y periodontales. De este
conjunto 28 (46.7%) gestantes se incluyeron al azar en el
grupo con intervención periodontal anteparto (GIP) y 32
(53.3%) en el grupo sin intervención periodontal (GNIP). El
análisis se hizo de acuerdo con la intención de tratamiento. La
variable dependiente fue la proporción de mujeres que agravaron su condición pre-eclámptica hacia pre-eclampsia severa, eclampsia o síndrome de HELLP, el número de días de
estabilidad clínica y el percentil de peso del recién nacido
ajustado para la edad de la gestación.
**_Resultados: De las pacientes 60% eran multíparas. La_**
edad gestacional promedio de ingreso al estudio fue 31.8
semanas. El diagnóstico periodontal más frecuente fue
periodontitis crónica (61.7%). Las características socio-demográficas, obstétricas y periodontales fueron afines en
ambos grupos. La pre-eclampsia se agravó de manera comparable en los dos grupos (GIP 89.2% versus GNIP 84.4%,
p=0.65) (OR=1.06 IC 95% 0.87-1.29, p=0.65). La estabilidad
clínica en días, fue parecida en ambos grupos (GIP mediana
10 días, rango 1-46 versus GNIP 12 días, rango 1-59, p=0.57).
La mediana del peso del recién nacido ajustado por la edad
gestacional fue semejante en los dos grupos (GIP percentil 50,
rango 5-90 versus GNIP percentil 53 rango 5-95, p=0.73).
**_Conclusiones: El tratamiento periodontal en mujeres con_**
pre-eclampsia no complicada no incrementa la severidad o
frecuencia de las complicaciones maternas.

Preeclampsia (PE) is an exclusive illness of human
gestation. It contributes with 42% of maternal and
perinatal mortality, and is the first cause of intrauterine
growth restriction, preterm birth, and low weight at
birth[1]. It is known as a «the disease of several theories»
because the aetiology is still unknown although some
risk factors have been identified such as: first pregnancy/
null parity, chronic kidney disease, uterine malformations,
none prenatal care, diabetes, familial predisposition,
obesity, hypertension, low social-economical level, or
non treated infections [2].
Endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia is a constant
event, but it is unknown if this dysfunction is cause or

**178**


consequence of the illness. In pregnancy there is an
inflammatory physiological state which is more accentuated in pregnant women developing preeclampsia, and
has been associated to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-?, reactive C protein)[3,4]

and infections[5], including periodontitis[6,7]. Changes have
been observed in atherosclerosis at placental level in
pregnant women with preeclampsia as well as bacterial
translocation of oral pathogens to placenta[8]. Also, it was
recently demonstrated that periodontal illness is related
to increased levels of reactive C protein specifically in
women with preeclampsia [3].
Besides, a controlled clinical trial including males and
none pregnant females demonstrated that periodontal
treatment improves endothelial disfunction[9]. This may
have implications on preeclampsia, since vascular stress
generates vasoconstriction and platelet activation
worsening the preeclampsia clinical course.
A preliminary study determined the effect of
periodontal intervention on pregnant women with preterm
birth risk factors, which had decreased incidence of this
event[10,11], however, when intervention is done late there
is no significant benefit[12]. Since preeclampsia is both
associated and principal cause of induced preterm birth,
the aim of this study was to evaluate periodontal
intervention efficacy and safety on pregnancy outcome
of women diagnosed with mild preeclampsia.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

A randomized controlled clinic trial was performed
between March 2006 and December 2007, including 60
pregnant women hospitalized in the Obstetric High Risk
Unit at Hospital Universitario del Valle (HUV), Cali,
Colombia. The study was estimated with ? =0.1 and
? =0.2, one case by one control, complication expected
frequency of 80% (progression to severe preeclampsia,
eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or maternal fetal
complications). Expected risk reduction due to periodontal
intervention was taken into account in preterm birth
studies and low weight at birth[10,11] as this is the first
research in which periodontal intervention is performed
to preeclampsia patients. Sample size was estimated in
60 patients. Pregnant women diagnosed with mild
preeclampsia and gestational age between 26 and 34
weeks were the inclusion criteria, without caring on
parity, or patient age.

Gestational age was calculated based on a trustable
amenorrhea if this existed (regular menstrual cycle
before pregnancy, null anovulatories use), or echography
on first pregnancy trimester.
This study was approved by two Institutional Ethics
Committees (Facultad de Salud, Universidad del Valle
and HUV). Patients agree or accept voluntary
participation in research. Exclusion criteria were:
pregnant women with history of chronic hypertension,
kidney or cardiovascular disease previous to pregnancy,
diabetes or past history of infections different to
periodontal or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Included patients were randomized by blocks to
avoid disparity in groups, in case of suspension of the
study (severe adverse effects of periodontal treatment).
Treatment intention was determined at random, in closed
envelopes prepared by professionals external to the
research group. Of the patients 28 (47%) were
randomized to the periodontal intervention group (PIG,
conventional medical treatment with periodontal
treatment at day of inclusion) and 32 (53%) were
randomized to the group without periodontal intervention
(NPIG, conventional medical treatment, and periodontal
treatment postpartum for ethical reasons). Patients
were healthy before developing preeclampsia. Other
data like educational level, smoking habits, and alcoholism,
were obtained from clinic record and confirmed by
interview. Patients had not received antibiotics or
periodontal treatment 3 and 6 months before inclusion,
respectively.
Preeclampsia´s clinic diagnosis was done by attending
doctors and confirmed by research group´s gynaecologists and obstetricians, and was defined as pregnancy
induced hypertension of >140/90 mm/Hg sitting down
(confirmed with 2 tests separated by 4 hours each) and
proteinuria >300 mg in 24 hours urine, without concomitant
urine infection.
Mild preeclampsia diagnosis was defined when
patient had systolic blood pressure between 140-160
mm/Hg and/or diastolic between 90-110 mm/Hg, without
pre-convulsive symptoms (headache, blurred vision,
epigastralgia, phosphene, tinnitus, normal osteo-tendinous
reflex) and with no compromise of target organs (altered
LFTs, altered LDH, thrombocytopenia) or fetal
compromise (IGRU or oligohydramnios).
Number of teeth and periodontal clinical parameters
were measured on every patient. Third molars were


excluded from evaluation since eruption is not proper
and interfere with measurements. All measurements
were practiced by trained periodontists with the same
evaluation criteria and equipment. Measurements were
registered on a periodontics chart and periodontal diagnosis was confirmed by a second group of periodontists
(JB, JS). Periodontists did not know the objectives of the
research. Every tooth was evaluated to determine
pocket depth (mm) and clinical attachment level (mm,
six measurements per tooth -mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual using a
periodontal probe UNC-Hu-Friedy). Pocket depth was
determined measuring the distance between gingival
margin to the bottom of periodontal pocket. Clinical
attachment level was determined by measuring the
distance between enamel-cemental line to the bottom
of periodontal pocket. Gingival bleeding was determined
on the same six sites, and was registered as positive if
occurred 15 seconds after the periodontal probing.
Bleeding at probing was determined as a percentage of
the bleeding sites. Periodontal diagnosis was establish
according to the report consensus criteria of the American
Academy of Periodontology[13]. Dependent variable at
medical assessment was outcome of pregnancy
characterized by number of events of preeclampsia,
eclampsia, or HELLP´s syndrome developed, new born
percentile weight adjusted to gestational age and number
of complete days of clinic stability after study inclusion.
Independent variable was patients group (PIG or NPIG).
Confusion variables were social and demographic variables. Periodontal treatment included oral health
education, hygiene, dental plaque removal, scaling and
root planning (if necessary), subgingival irrigation without
antibiotic administration in one single session (one to two
hours). Periodontal treatment was performed by
periodontists.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Statistical analysis was performed using univariate
analysis to evaluate sample characteristics in both groups
with measures of central tendency and dispersion.
Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate periodontal
treatment effect on pregnancy outcome. Differences
between continue variables were evaluated using
Student’s t test (two tailed) for data with normal
distribution, and Kruskal-Wallis´ test for data with other

p<0.05 was consider significant.

**RESULTS**

Sixty five patients were identified of having mild
preeclampsia and invited to participate in the study.
Afterwards 5 patients were excluded, 3 (4,6%) that
having a presumptive clinic diagnose of mild preeclampsia, also had less proteinuria <300 mg/dl in 24
hours urine, which locates them as gestational
hypertension; and 2 (3,1%) for whom was determined
that hypertension condition corresponded to a chronic
disease (Figure 1).
Mean age of patients included was 24.7± 6.4 years

frequent marital status was unmarried in law (60%),
predominant race was mixed in ethnic backgrounds and
urban procedence (Table 1). Obstetric sociodemographic
(Table 1) and periodontal clinic characteristics (Table 2)
were similar in both groups, except for age, where
patients in PIG were younger than patients from the
NPIG (24±6.5 years PIG _vs. 27±7.6 years NPIG,_
p=0.01). Other difference found was mean gestational
week at inclusion time (31.2% for PIG and 32.4% for
NPIG, p=0.04). Patients did not inform of smoking or
drinking habits. Most frequent periodontal diagnose was
chronic periodontitis (61,7%) (Table 2). Patient belonging
to PIG presented more mild chronic periodontitis when
compared to NPIG (57% PIG vs. 37% NPIG) (p=0.001)
(Table 2).

Twenty two (78,6%) of the patients included in the
PIG worsen their preeclamptic condition to severe
preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis,
liver enzyme rising, platelets consumption), or another
kind of complication, while for the NPIG (56,3%) were
eighteen patients (p=0.07) (OR=2.85, IC 95%, 0.918.92). Clinic stability was similar for both groups; for
PIG was 10 days (ranging 1-46 days), while for NPIG
was 12 days (ranging 1-59 days) (p=0.57). Preterm birth


incidence was similar for both groups (PIG 26, 92,8%
vs. NPIG 24,7%, p=0,06). For PIG, 9 (32,1%) of the
new born needed neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) due
to some complication, in contrast, 5 (15,6%) of the new
born from the NPIG needed ICU (p=0.13).
Neonates weight percentiles adjusted to gestational
age were similar for both groups (PIG 50, rank 5-90 vs.
NPIG 53, rank 5-95, p=0,73) (Table 3). Twenty-one of

patients developed severe preeclampsia, one (3,6%)

some other kind of complication like premature rupture
of membranes, oligohydramnios and polihydramnios,
while 7 of this patients (25%) did not present any other
complication during pregnancy, after being include in
the research. For the NPIG, 18 patients (56,3%)
presented complications during pregnancy, after being
included in the research, 16 (50%) presented severe
preeclampsia, 2 (6,3%) presented some kind of
complication, respiratory and uteroplacental failure, and
14 (43,8%) of them did not developed any complication
(Table 3). Comparing statistically this results, there is no
significant difference between PIG and NPIG (p=0,67),
indicating that periodontal treatment was not associated
with development of maternal clinical complications in
women suffering mild preeclampsia.

**DISCUSSION**

Preeclampsia is characterized by a systemic vascular
dysfunction that affects placental circulation, as
demonstrated by histopathology changes. Indeed of
been considered a multifactorial illness, there is growing
evidence of the presence of chronic infection[2] as
etiological/or triggering factor for systemic vascular
dysfunction (endothelial dysfunction). Previous studies
observed an association between periodontal illnesses
and preeclampsia [3,6,14-17]. Studies about the effect of
periodontal intervention on pregnant women suffering
preeclampsia are not reported in literature, however,
diverse studies exist relating periodontal illness and
adverse outcome of pregnancy in what concerns to low
weight at birth, preterm birth, intrauterine growth
restriction, low gestational age, and gestational diabetes[18]. Literature reports four studies about association

between periodontal illness and preeclampsia (3 casecontrol studies, and one prospective study), with ORs
from 2.4 and 3.5, however, a case-control study carried
out in Argentina did not found association to an adjusted
OR 0.99 (IC 0.70-1.40)[4].
A recent meta-analysis determined that urinary
infection (N=104,927 OR=1.63 IC 95% 1.43-1.83) and
periodontal illness (N=3,507 OR=1.76 IC 95% 1.392.17)[1] are unique infections associated to preeclampsia
development.
For ethical reasons, and taking into account that
preeclampsia is a serious and potentially fatal disease,
and treatment consists on patient’s stabilization while
pregnancy ends, were only included pregnant women
diagnosed with mild preeclampsia. None patients with
severe preeclampsia were included since pregnancy on
this patients ends in 24-48 hours[1] post diagnosis. Inclusion
of these patients allowed following clinical evolution to
determine periodontal intervention effect on women
suffering preeclampsia.
The present controlled clinic assay determined that
severity and frequency of medical complications in mild
preeclampsia are not significantly increased after
periodontal intervention (Table 3). Mean new born
weight was lower in PIG due to gestational age at birth
since weight percentile adjusted to gestational age were
similar within groups (Table 3). As observed in a previous study on patients with preterm birth and periodontal
intervention, this did not modify illness course within
groups and was equally safe[12,20].
Socio-demographic, obstetric, and periodontal
characteristics were similar in both groups, except the
variable chronologic and gestational age, which
demonstrates that population group selected was
relatively homogeneous due to study randomization
(Tables 1, 2). Preeclampsia occurs generally on patients
at extreme reproductive age, young women, or older
than 35 years, which could influence the bigger number
of older women on a group affecting mean age in each
group. Since extreme reproductive age is a risk variable
once complications happened, age as an independent
variable has not a direct effect on pregnancy outcome.
Periodontal illness is associated to increase risk of
gestation adverse outcome. Thus, confirmation of
periodontal illness as an independent risk factor for
adverse outcomes must be taken into account for an
integral evaluation of pregnant women since is a


preventable and treatable illness, in contrast with
preeclampsia, which is a treatable but difficult to prevent.
Studies with larger groups are necessary to evaluate the
efficacy of early periodontal intervention during
pregnancy in relation with endothelial dysfunction and
preeclampsia development.
A new born resulting from a complicated preeclamptic
pregnancy increases to 50% probability of using neonatal
ICU, just for the fact of suffering this illness (OR=1.50
IC 95% 1.2-2.0). The present study does not present
differences related to maternal morbidity in the PIG in
relation with periodontal intervention postpartum (NPIG)
and overall impact of periodontal intervention did not
have a negative effect on new born health when evaluated
with level of neonatal ICU use, what allow us to
conclude that periodontal intervention in patients suffering
mild preeclampsia does not increase risks to the mother
or fetus, being a safe procedure.
It is known that periodontitis occurs in at least 60%
of pregnant women with low socioeconomic level. Its
presence increases C-reactive protein in pregnant
women[3], one of the ways to endothelial dysfunction.
Pregnant women that develop preeclampsia present an
early endothelial dysfunction in pregnancy[4]. It is known
that periodontitis reduces endothelial funtion[10]. According
to this, it is logic to think that periodontal intervention
would have a better preventive effect when this risk
factor is interfered in early stages of pregnancy.
Previously was established that periodontitis treatment during pregnancy is safe[19 ]as it is for pregnant
women with preterm birth[12,20] and according with the
results of the present study, this conclusion expands to
pregnant women that suffer mild preeclampsia. Knowing
that periodontal treatment does not modify preeclampsia
course, it would be important to determine the effect of
early periodontal intervention on normotensive pregnant
women with high risk of preeclampsia. Endothelial
dysfunction is a constant in preeclampsia pathogenesis,
it is interesting to remember that periodontal treatment
improves endothelial function in patients with periodontitis[9].
