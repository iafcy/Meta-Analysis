**stillbirths in the control group and no pregnancy losses in**
**the treated group (P�.12). Measures of fetal and neonatal**
**well-being were similar in the two groups, including**

birth. A vital clue as to the origin of many cases of
preterm birth has come from the discovery that inflammatory pathways may be involved in a high proportion
of early deliveries, suggesting the presence of infection.[2]

Trials using antibiotics have in general failed to prevent
preterm birth,[3] suggesting that if the inflammation is of
bacterial origin, the source may be a distant site, and one
that will not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy.
Periodontal disease is one possibility.[4]

Many case series and cohort studies have shown
significant associations between periodontal disease
and preterm birth,[5] fetal growth restriction,[4] and
preeclampsia.[6] Experiments using animals have also
shown strong associations between periodontal pathogens and fetal death[7–9] and growth restriction.[7] The
mechanisms by which an inflamed and infected periodontium could adversely affect the pregnant uterus
and developing fetus are uncertain, although evidence suggests roles for translocation of periodontopathic organisms, and stimulation and release of
inflammatory mediators and prostaglandins into the
maternal circulation.[10]

Evidence from seven trials of treatment during
pregnancy are now available, but many of the findings are in conflict and inconclusive.[11] The largest of
these trials, the Obstetric and Periodontal Therapy
(OPT) Study, observed no beneficial effect of periodontal treatment on preterm birth or birth weight,
but did observe a possible effect of preventing stillbirth, the certainty of which was unclear.[12]

The purpose of the present study was to perform
a randomized controlled trial of treatment of periodontal disease in midpregnancy to investigate whether
such treatment may prevent preterm birth, fetal growth
restriction, and preeclampsia. Our study was conducted
by a single group of investigators operating from a major
center, with screening and treatments at six additional
sites within metropolitan Perth, Western Australia.

##### MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Smile Study was a single-center randomized
controlled trial of treatment for periodontal disease in
midpregnancy conducted at seven sites in one city.
The protocol was approved by the ethics committees
responsible for each of the study sites. Pregnant
women were invited to participate in public and
private antenatal clinics and offices across metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Advertisements in the
lay media and promotional material in clinical environments invited women who had concerns about the
health of their gums, pain on biting, bleeding from the
gums, or a history of preterm birth. We had observed
in a previous study that these four items were predic

tive of periodontal disease (unpublished observations,
2003). Women were eligible for recruitment if they
were more than 16 years of age; did not have
maternal cardiac disease that would warrant the need
for antibiotics for periodontal examination or treatment; had not already received periodontal treatment
during the current pregnancy; had no fewer than 20
natural teeth; had a single pregnancy of more than 12
and less than 20 weeks of gestational age; did not have
any known fetal anomalies or other risk factors, such
as hydramnios, that would place the pregnancy at
imminent risk of complications; and were able to
attend regularly for periodontal treatment if required.
Periodontal screening studies were conducted at
King Edward Memorial Hospital, the Oral Health
Centre of Western Australia, Osborne Park Hospital,
Swan Districts Hospital, Armadale Hospital, Rockingham Hospital, and Joondalup Hospital. The latter five
hospitals are secondary level centers across metropolitan Perth, whereas King Edward Memorial Hospital
is the tertiary-level perinatal center for the state of
Western Australia. Informed written consent to conduct the screening study was obtained by a research
midwife. These screening studies were performed by
one of five research hygienists under the supervision
of two specialist periodontists (I.N. and J.S.). The
examinations were a modified Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs study conducted in a
well-equipped dental environment.[13] Each study took
approximately 20 minutes to conduct. Periodontal
disease was defined as presence of periodontal pockets
of 4 mm or greater in depth at 12 or more probing sites
in fully erupted teeth (typically excluding wisdom teeth).
This definition was based on the results of a pilot study
that showed that 15.4% of our general antenatal population had periodontal disease of this degree (unpublished observations, 2003). Periodontal pocketing was
used to define the presence of periodontal disease rather
than loss of clinical attachment because it better represents the microbial challenge and is the most frequently
used criterion of current disease.
Pregnant women were invited to participate in
the treatment study if the findings from the screening
examination met the criteria for periodontal disease.
Informed written consent for treatment was obtained
by a research midwife or hygienist. A questionnaire was
then administered to obtain data on demographic, dental, and medical aspects of the woman’s health.
Randomization was conducted by a research
midwife or hygienist using computer randomization
software specifically designed to allocate each case at
random with stratification for nulliparity, history of
preterm birth, and current smoking. Women found to

have a periodontal disease were randomly allocated
to receive periodontal treatment in midpregnancy
(treatment group; n�542) or after the pregnancy was
concluded (control group; n�540).
The women who were found to not have periodontal disease were provided with a written record
of their examination but were not involved in the
study thereafter.
Treatment was preceded by full periodontal examination, including precise measurement of periodontal pocket depth to 0.2 mm with a Florida probe
(Florida Probe Corporation, FL). Data obtained by
this system are recorded directly into a computer
database.[14] Examination also included measurement
of clinical attachment loss, bleeding after probing
across the full mouth, and calculation of a modified
O’Leary Plaque Index.[15] A treatment plan was then
devised, often in consultation with a specialist periodontist, and discussed with the woman.
The primary objective of the treatment was to
remove or control various biofilms that act as reservoirs for the bacterial load. Treatments were conducted either by the hygienists or periodontists and
included nonsurgical de´bridement of the subgingival
and supragingival plaque, removal of local predisposing factors such as calculus, root planing, and adjustment of overhanging restorations. Comprehensive
oral hygiene instructions and motivation were pro

vided at each visit. The advice included recommendations for tooth brushing and flossing after every
meal and rinsing with 0.12% non–alcohol-based chlorhexidine mouthwash. Local anesthesia was used as
required (1% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenalin up to
a maximum dose of 4.4 mL per treatment visit). These
treatment sessions were provided on three occasions
at weekly intervals commencing around 20 weeks of
gestation. Each woman was given $10 to reimburse
for travel expenses at each treatment visit.
Four weeks after the final treatment, typically at
28 weeks of gestation, a further examination was
conducted to provide a quantified assessment of the
success of treatment. This assessment included a
clinical examination and measurements with a Florida probe. Those women in whom the treatment had
not been successful were offered a further 3-week
treatment regimen (107 [19.6%] women were found to
require additional treatment visits).
All women in the antenatal treatment arm of the
study were examined again at 32 and 36 weeks of
gestation. The success of treatment was again quantified, and oral hygiene advice and motivation were
provided. Systemic antibiotics were not provided for
periodontal disease.
Women allocated to the postnatal (control) group
were offered periodontal care after the birth, commencing 6 weeks after delivery. They had no further

contact with any members of the research team until
their pregnancy was concluded. The postnatal care
involved the same 3-week treatment protocol as for
women in the antenatal treatment group. A follow-up
visit was then offered 4 weeks later to assess the
effectiveness of the treatment.
All medical, nursing, and perinatal pathology
staff members were unaware of the treatment allocation of each woman in the study, and health care was
provided according to standard protocols within each
clinic and hospital. Details of all medical, obstetric,
and neonatal outcomes were extracted from the medical records by research midwives who were also
blinded to the treatment allocation. Twenty-four
women had moved interstate or overseas, and their
obstetric and neonatal outcomes were obtained by
telephone (nine in the control and 15 in the antenatal
treatment group, respectively). Stillbirth in Australia
is defined as death of the unborn fetus after 20
completed weeks of gestation or more than 400 g
birth weight.
The primary hypothesis was that treatment of
periodontal disease during pregnancy reduces the
rate of preterm birth from 12% to 7%. A sample size
of 1,082 women was required to detect this reduction
in the preterm birth rate with 80% (��.20) power
while using a two-sided test of proportions at 5%
significance level (��.05).
We initially planned a study with a sample size of
1,094 women, which included an interim analysis to
be conducted when 60% of the study pregnancies
were completed. In August 2007, the independent
data safety monitoring committee recommended proceeding without an interim analysis after data on treatment safety and pregnancy outcomes from the trial
conducted by Michalowicz et al[12] were published.
Continuous outcomes were summarized using
means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. Categorical outcomes
were summarized using frequency distributions. Univariable comparisons of pregnancy outcomes were
based on the Mann-Whitney or t test for continuous
data and the �[2] or Fisher exact test for categorical
data. Comparison of the rate of preterm birth adjusted
for parity, smoking, and history of preterm birth was
performed using logistic regression analysis with odds
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
used to summarize the treatment effect. Supplementary univariate comparisons of gestational ages at
delivery between groups were based on KaplanMeier survival curves and the log rank test, and a
proportional hazards Cox regression model was used
for adjusted analyses with hazard ratios and their CIs.


Primary data analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary subgroup analyses
of dose response effects to treatment compared pregnancy outcomes according to the disease severity and
treatment compliance during pregnancy (noncompliant women in the treatment group were excluded
from this analysis). Results of this analysis were
similar to those obtained when using the intention-totreat approach and are not shown. SPSS (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago IL) statistical software was used for data analysis. P�.05 was considered statistically significant.

##### RESULTS
A total 6,340 women were invited to participate in the
study between February 2005 and December 2007,

with the final pregnancy concluding in June 2008 (Fig.
1). The women were approached either directly by
research midwives within a clinical environment, or
they responded by telephone to promotional material
in the lay press. Of these, 3,737 women were recruited and received a screening examination of their
periodontal status. These examinations identified
1,087 women (29.1%) with periodontal disease, each
of whom then provided consent to participate in the
treatment arm of the study. Five hundred forty-one
women were allocated at random to receive periodontal treatment commencing 6 weeks after the
pregnancy was concluded (control group), and 546
women were allocated at random to receive treatment
commencing at 21 weeks of gestation (treatment group).
Five women assigned to antenatal treatment withdrew
their consent before treatment commenced. One
woman was excluded when found at 19 weeks of
gestation to have a multiple pregnancy. Two women

were available for all women except one in the
antenatal group, who was known to have left Australia
to give birth in her country of origin.
The two groups were similar in baseline maternal characteristics (Table 1): 71.6% of the women
were Caucasian, 98.0% had received more than 9
years of education, the mean prepregnancy body
mass index was 24.9 kg/m[2], and 45.1% had experienced a previous spontaneous or induced pregnancy loss. There were no differences between the
two groups in rates of preeclampsia (P�.551, OR
0.82, 95% CI 0.44–1.56) or gestational hypertension (P�.607, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.31).
Four fetuses in the control group were stillborn
(Tables 2 and 3). All four were from pregnancies that
were uncomplicated, and their mothers were all married, had more than 12 years of education, and were
nonsmokers. In each case, the perinatal pathologist
classified the cause of stillbirth as unknown, and there

were no features of inflammation in the fetus or
placenta. All four mothers had given histories of daily
occurrences of bleeding from their gums during tooth
brushing, and on periodontal examination each had
bleeding, inflammation, and plaque levels classified as
moderate. There was a single neonatal death, occurring at 1 hour of age after preterm birth at 22 weeks of
gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by
antepartum hemorrhage and was in the control
group. Except for a single case of loss to follow-up
where the neonatal outcome was unknown, all remaining 538 women allocated to the treatment group
completed their pregnancies and were discharged to
home with a live infant.
The two groups were similar in duration of
pregnancy, either when expressed as the rate of
preterm birth (P�.812, OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.7–1.58)
or when compared using estimated Kaplan-Meier
cumulative probabilities of delivery (Figure 2)
(P�.548, hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.91–1.15) and
median gestational age at delivery (Table 2). Factors simultaneously associated with an increased
risk of preterm delivery included history of preterm
delivery (P�.002, OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.42–5.17), preeclampsia (P�.001, OR 17.56, 95% CI 8.75–35.24),


threatened abortion (P�.011, OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.26–
6.34), and antepartum hemorrhage (P�.001, OR 3.75,
95% CI 1.91–7.36). Risk of preterm delivery for
nulliparous women was similar to that of parous
women who had no history of preterm delivery
(P�.838, OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64–1.72).
The type of onset of labor was similar for each
group (P�.436). Birth weights were similar in the two
groups when expressed either as mean birth weight
(P�.117) or expected birth weight for gestational age
using charts derived from the local population
(P�.103).
There were no differences between the two groups
in measures of fetal welfare or health of the newborn
(Table 4). These measures included incidence of
nonreassuring fetal heart rate traces (P�.264), the
need for delivery based on abnormal fetal heart rate
patterns (P�.687), the presence of meconium in
amniotic fluid (P�.522), cesarean delivery for fetal
distress (P�.720), Apgar scores less than 7 at 1 or 5
minutes (P�.403 and P�.988, respectively), the need
for resuscitation of the newborn (P�.133), umbilical
artery pH (P�.371), PCO2 (P�.867) and base excess
(P�.864) values, or the need for admission to the

##### DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
treatment of periodontal disease during midpregnancy prevents complications of pregnancy. Periodontal treatment did not prevent, or cause, preterm
birth, fetal growth restriction, or preeclampsia. All
other measures of pregnancy outcome were similar in
the two groups, with the possible exception of perinatal death. There were four stillbirths and one neonatal death in the control group and no pregnancy
losses in the treatment group.
Meta-analysis of the first seven trials of periodontal treatment during pregnancy revealed a possible
reduction in preterm birth and incidence of low birth
weight.[11] These findings from randomized trials
added to observations from observational studies[4,16]

indicating associations between periodontal disease
and preterm birth. The results of the present study
and those of the next largest trial[12] are not supportive

of the hypothesis, with both trials providing strong
evidence that treatment of periodontal disease is
ineffective in preventing early birth. There are many
differences, however, between many of the randomized controlled trials that have been reported.[11] Only
three of the seven trials reported adequate randomization procedures, and only three trials were blinded.
Within these various trials was a diversity of patient
populations.
The first reported trial involved women of Spanish and local aboriginal descent who were of low
socioeconomic status.[17] Preterm birth was less frequent in those who had been allocated to receive
periodontal therapy (1.1% in the treatment group,
6.4% in the control group, P�.02). The second trial
was a pilot study, conducted at the University of
Alabama in Birmingham.[18] Three hundred sixty-six
women were randomly assigned to scaling and root
planing, with or without metronidazole, or dental
prophylaxis and placebo. Eighty-five percent of
women in this trial were African-American. The trial
provided some preliminary evidence that periodontal
treatment may prevent preterm birth, and that adjunctive treatment with metronidazole is not of benefit and may be harmful. The largest trial reported
until now was the OPT Study conducted in the
United States and reported in 2006, which observed
preterm birth in 12% of women in the treatment
group and 12.8% in the control group, a difference
that was not statistically significant.[12]

The finding in the present study of four stillbirths
in the control group and none in the treatment group
would not in itself be grounds to expect that the
treatment was protective for the fetus because the

numbers were relatively small, the difference did not
achieve statistical significance, and this was not a
primary endpoint of the study. There is, however,
evidence from other sources suggesting that such a
protective effect may be real. First, the finding is
consistent with that observed in the next largest
randomized controlled trial of periodontal treatment
during pregnancy, the OPT Study, reported by
Michalowicz et al.[12] In that trial, 3 of 407 patients in
the treatment group and 10 of 405 patients in the
control group had a stillbirth. The authors viewed
this finding with particular caution because the
numbers were relatively small. If the numbers of
stillbirths in the study by Michalowicz et al and the
present study are combined by meta-analysis, the
reduction in stillbirth after periodontal treatment is
statistically significant (P�.02, OR 4.00, 95% CI
1.22–13.10). These two randomized controlled trials have been chosen for this meta-analysis because
they are the only ones that share similar study
designs.
Second, we have observed previously that women
with a history of recent perinatal loss are more likely to
have periodontal disease. In a case–control study of 53
women whose pregnancy had resulted in perinatal
death compared with 111 matched controls, those
women who had experienced a perinatal loss were
more likely to have periodontal disease (OR 2.34,
95% CI 1.05–5.47).[19]

Third, the lethal effects of periodontal pathogens
in causing fetal death are well established in animal
models, including both hamsters[7,8] and sheep.[9]

Stillbirth, however, was not a primary endpoint of
the present study. Despite our previous observations
that periodontal disease may increase the risk of fetal
death, we were unable to design our study with
stillbirth as a primary outcome. To perform such a
study would require a sample size that is unachievable within the range of contemporary research
funding and opportunity. Hence, the value of combining results from similar studies becomes evident.
The OPT Study had design features generally similar
to those of the present study,[12] suggesting that results
from the two trials can be combined with relative
confidence. Meta-analysis of the first seven published randomized controlled trials of periodontal
treatment during pregnancy, however, did not provide reassurance that stillbirth may be prevented by
such treatment.[11]

In conclusion, the evidence provided by the
present study does not support the hypothesis that
treatment of periodontal disease in midpregnancy
prevents preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, or


preeclampsia. A possible beneficial effect in preventing a proportion of stillbirths remains uncertain.
Several other randomized controlled trials are currently in progress, and meta-analyses of the results of
all studies can be expected to provide conclusive
evidence in the future. Studies also need to be
performed to investigate any possible benefits from
periodontal treatment before conception. In the
meantime, the information available to us at this
time suggests that periodontal treatment during
pregnancy is safe for the woman and her pregnancy, and that any beneficial effects for the child
are either nonexistent or likely to be restricted to
certain populations or subgroups that have yet to be
defined with certainty.
