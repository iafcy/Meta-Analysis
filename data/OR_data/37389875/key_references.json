            "abstract": "## PURPOSE\nStrategies to improve pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness could positively impact recovery after surgery. This study investigated the feasibility of vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in bladder cancer patients prior to radical cystectomy (RC).\n## METHODS\nA total of 60 patients were randomised (1:1) to exercise or control following a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The exercise group was offered twice-weekly pre-operative supervised vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in addition to standard treatment. The controls received standard treatment only. A repeat CPET was undertaken before surgery and post-operative recovery outcomes were recorded.\n## RESULTS\nOver half of the 112 eligible patients approached in the clinic were recruited to the study (53.5%), with recruited patients attending a median of 8 (range 1-10) exercise sessions over a pre-operative period of 3-6\u00a0weeks. Improvements in peak values of oxygen pulse (P\u2009=\u20090.001), minute ventilation (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and power output (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were observed at the follow-up CPET in the exercise group versus controls and there were no adverse events. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect changes in post-operative recovery outcomes, there were marginal (non-significant) differences in favour of the exercise group in post-operative Clavien-Dindo score and need for high dependency unit inotropic support.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBladder cancer patients respond well to pre-surgical aerobic interval exercise, and the improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness variables could have important implications for post-operative recuperation after RC. These findings provide a strong foundation for an adequately powered randomised controlled trial.\n",

However, the existing studies provide controversial results and show a clear bias toward low-risk patients.\n## METHODS\nThis was a randomized blinded controlled trial. Eligible candidates accepting to participate were blindly randomized (1:1 ratio) to control (standard care) or intervention (standard care\u200a+\u200aprehabilitation) groups. Inclusion criteria were: i) age >70 years; and/or, ii) American Society of Anesthesiologists score III/IV. Prehabilitation covered 3 actions: i) motivational interview; ii) high-intensity endurance training; and promotion of physical activity. The main study outcome was the proportion of patients suffering postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included the endurance time (ET) during cycle-ergometer exercise.\n## RESULTS\nWe randomized 71 patients to the control arm and 73 to intervention. After excluding 19 patients because of changes in the surgical plan, 63 controls and 62 intervention patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The intervention group enhanced aerobic capacity [\u0394ET 135 (218) %; P < 0.001), reduced the number of patients with postoperative complications by 51% (relative risk 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8; P = 0.001) and the rate of complications [1.4 (1.6) and 0.5 (1.0) (P\u200a=\u200a\u200a0.001)] as compared with controls.\n## CONCLUSION\nPrehabilitation enhanced postoperative clinical outcomes in high-risk candidates for elective major abdominal surgery, which can be explained by the increased aerobic capacity.\n",

It remains, however, to be demonstrated whether prehabilitation in these patients reduces postoperative complications.\n## METHODS\nThis 2-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial was carried out in 2 large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients (\u226560 years) with colorectal (pre)malignancy scheduled for elective colorectal resection and with a score \u22647 metabolic equivalents on the veterans-specific activity questionnaire were randomly assigned to the prehabilitation group or the usual care group by using block-stratified randomization. An oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold <11\u200amL/kg/min at the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test was the final inclusion criterion. Inclusion was based on a power analysis. Patients in the prehabilitation group participated in a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, nine sessions in total) supervised exercise program given in community physical therapy practices before colorectal resection. Patients in the reference group received usual care. The primary outcome was the number of patients with one or more complications within 30 days of surgery, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n## RESULTS\nBetween February 2014 and December 2018, 57 patients [30 males and 27 females; mean age 73.6 years (standard deviation 6.1), range 61-88 years] were randomized to either prehabilitation (n = 28) or usual care (n = 29). The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the prehabilitation group (n = 12, 42.9%) than in the usual care group (n = 21, 72.4%, relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.37-0.96, P = 0.024).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nExercise prehabilitation reduced postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo elective colon resection for (pre)malignancy. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also rectal, surgery.\n",

The primary endpoint was oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold. Secondary endpoints included other CPET values and preoperative quality of life (QoL) assessed using the SF-36\u00ae.\n## RESULTS\nThirty-eight patients were randomized (20 to prehabilitation, 18 to standard care), and 35 (25 men and 10 women) completed both preoperative assessments and were analysed. The median age was 62 (i.q.r. 54-69) years, and there were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Prehabilitation led to improvements in preoperative oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (+1\u00b75 (95 per cent c.i. 0\u00b72 to 2\u00b79) ml per kg per min) and peak exercise (+2\u00b70 (0\u00b70 to 4\u00b70) ml per kg per min). The oxygen pulse (oxygen uptake per heart beat) at the anaerobic threshold improved (+0\u00b79 (0\u00b70 to 1\u00b78) ml/beat), and a higher peak work rate (+13 (4 to 22) W) was achieved. This was associated with improved preoperative QoL, with the overall SF-36\u00ae score increasing by 11 (95 per cent c.i. 1 to 21) (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7028) and the overall SF-36\u00ae mental health score by 11 (1 to 22) (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7037).\n## CONCLUSION\nA 4-week prehabilitation programme can deliver improvements in CPET scores and QoL before liver resection.

In this randomized controlled trial, we hypothesized that a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program enhances cardiorespiratory fitness before lung cancer surgery and therefore reduces the risk of postoperative complications.\n## METHODS\nPatients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC) (n\u00a0= 77) or preoperative rehabilitation based on HIIT (Rehab) (n\u00a0= 74). Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the 6-minute walk test were performed twice before surgery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and in-hospital postoperative complications.\n## RESULTS\nThe groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the preoperative waiting period (median 25 days), the peak oxygen consumption and the 6-minute walking distance increased (median\u00a0+15%, interquartile range, 25th to 75 percentile [IQR25%-75%, %]\u00a0=\u00a0+9% to\u00a0+22%, p\u00a0= 0.003 and\u00a0+15%, IQR25%-75%\u00a0=\u00a0+8% to\u00a0+28%, p < 0.001, respectively) in the Rehab group, whereas peak oxygen consumption declined in the UC group (median -8%, IQR25%-75%\u00a0= -16% to 0%], p\u00a0= 0.005). The primary end point did not differ significantly between the two groups: at least one postoperative complication developed in 27 of the 74 patients (35.5%) in the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6%) in the UC group (p\u00a0= 0.080). Notably, the incidence of pulmonary complications was lower in the Rehab compared with in the UC group (23% versus 44%, p\u00a0= 0.018), owing to a significant reduction in atelectasis (12.2% versus 36.4%, p < 0.001), and this decrease was accompanied by a shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (median -7 hours, IQR25%-75%\u00a0= -4 to -10).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this randomized controlled trial, preoperative HIIT resulted in significant improvement in aerobic performances but failed to reduce early complications after lung cancer resection.\n",

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to objectively assess cardiopulmonary fitness at baseline and after 6 weeks of exercise. A follow-up CPET was performed at 12 weeks. CPET-derived measures were used to guide prescription of the training program. A nonrandomized control cohort of LT patients were selected to match the exercise group based on specific demographic data. Allocation to study arms was primarily based on the distance participants lived from the hospital where training occurred. Both groups received structured nutritional advice.\n## RESULTS\nThe exercise program was feasible, with 9 of 16 (56%) patients completing the full program of 6 weeks.
