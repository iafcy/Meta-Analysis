Background: Considering the relation between preoperative functional capacity and postoperative complications, enhancing patients’ functional 
capacity before surgery with a prehabilitation program may facilitate faster recovery and improve quality of life. However, time before surgery 
is short, mandating a multimodal and high-intensity training approach. This study investigated feasibility and safety of a prehabilitation 
program for colorectal cancer. 
Methods: Multimodal prehabilitation was offered to patients eligible for participation and they were assigned to an intervention or control group 
by program availability. The prehabilitation program consisted of the following four interventions: in-hospital high-intensity endurance and 
strength training, high-protein nutrition and supplements, smoking cessation, and psychological support. Program attendance, patient satisfac- 
tion, adverse events, and functional capacity were determined. 
Results: Fifty patients participated in this study (prehabilitation 20, control 30). Program evaluation revealed a high (90%) attendance rate and 
high level of patient satisfaction. No adverse events occurred. Endurance and/or strength were improved. Eighty-six percent of patients with 
prehabilitation recovered to their baseline functional capacity 4 weeks postoperatively, 40% in the control group (P < 0.01). 
Conclusions: Multimodal prehabilitation including high-intensity training for colorectal cancer patients is feasible, safe, and effective. A 
randomized controlled trial (NTR5947) was initiated to determine whether prehabilitation may lower morbidity and mortality rates in 
colorectal surgery. 




of cancer in the world, with more than 1.4 million cases 
and 700.000 deaths a year.1 The most essential step in curative 
treatment is surgery. Although perioperative care improved 
greatly, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates still remain 
high.2,3 Furthermore, major surgery is associated with a marked 
reduction in functional capacity, even in the absence of compli- 
cations.4,5 This is clinically reflected as delayed and impaired 
recovery, leading to a reduction in health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL). 
The number of postoperative complications is correlated 
with patients’ preoperative functional capacity, psychological 
well-being, and nutritional and smoking status.6–12 Traditional 
approaches have targeted the intraoperative and postoperative 
period for rehabilitation and lifestyle changes. However, recent 
evidence shows that the preoperative period might be the 
optimal time-frame for intervention.13–15 This approach, in- 
troduced as prehabilitation, is not yet implemented in daily 
clinical practice worldwide. 
To date, trials with preoperative home-based training 
programs showed small effect sizes and had low compliance 
rates.16,17 Moreover, moderate exercise programs have not 
yielded beneficial effects in a preoperative setting.17 These 
findings may not be unexpected, because the preoperative 
training period is relatively short (maximum of 5 weeks).18 
In such a short time span, high-intensity training (HIT) attains 
a sufficient cardiopulmonary response for the improvement 
of postoperative outcome. Because of the load of this HIT,

thorough guidance of patients enhances feasibility and com- 
pliance to such a training program. Furthermore, evidence 
shows that prehabilitation should be multimodal including su- 
pervised high-intensity exercise training, adequate nutrition, 
smoking cessation, and psychological support for an optimal 
benefit.19 In terms of nutrition, protein supplementation as an 
addition to training may lead to more effectiveness.20–23 
Psychological support and cessation of smoking may further 
enhance the effects of such a program.24,25 
This pilot study was initiated to test the feasibility, safety, and 
effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation program intended 
to be studied in a randomized controlled trial (NTR5947). 


This study was conducted between June 2016 and 
June 2017 at Máxima Medical Center (MC), Veldhoven, 
the Netherlands. Patients of at least 18 years old and sched- 
uled for elective resection for CRC without neoadjuvant 
treatment were eligible for participation. Patients with meta- 
static disease, chronic renal failure, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score 4 or 5, conditions interfering with 
the ability to perform the exercises such as paraplegia or or- 
thopedic impairments, and patients unable to give informed 
consent were excluded. 

This nonrandomized prospective, hospital-based observa- 
tional cohort study was approved by the Máxima MC Ethics 
Committee (NL54547.015.15). Patients were approached to 
participate when diagnosis was final and surgery was sched- 
uled. After providing verbal and written consent, patients were 
assigned to the prehabilitation program or to the control group, 
which was dependent on program availability at time of inclu- 
sion (flow chart Fig. 1). The sample size was set to 30 in the con- 
trol group and 20 in the intervention group based on previous 
studies.17 
Both groups received perioperative care according to 
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines.26 
Patients were screened for anemia and optimized using iron 
injections (Ferinject) if needed (threshold >7 mmol/l or 
12 mg/dl). A smoke cessation program of 4 weeks, which in- 
cluded intensive counseling (group and/or telephone sessions 
weekly) in combination with nicotine replacement therapy, 
was offered to all smokers. Both groups were assessed at 
standardized time points before and after surgery (Table 1). 
The multimodal prehabilitation program for the intervention 
group is described next. 

The prehabilitation group followed a 4-week program in- 
cluding 3 weekly hospital-based high-intensity endurance 
(interval) training, complemented with upper and lower body 























































resistance training. Participants were also encouraged to walk 
or cycle for 60 minutes on the days between the supervised 
training sessions. 
The endurance training was performed on a stationary bi- 
cycle with three blocks of moderate intensity and three blocks 
of high-intensity intervals. The training intensity was personalized 
using cardiopulmonary exercise testing data (electrocardiogram, 
VO2max, heart frequency, anaerobic threshold (AT), and respira- 
tory quotient).27,28 The workload (watt) for the high-intensity 
block started at 65% of the maximum workload (at VO2peak). 
This intensity results in a metabolic response in the range of 
85–100% of VO2peak (Borg scale 15–17) at the end of the 
high-intensity interval, which is considered an appropriate range 
for HIT. For recovery at moderate intensity, we chose a workload 
(watt) at 75% of VO2 AT (or, if AT was not visible, 20% of 
VO2peak). The workload was increased with 10% when Borg 
rating of perceived exertion scale was less than 13 and/or heart 
rate of less than 85% of the maximum heart rate and decreased 
with 10% when the exercise intensity in the first block could not 
be achieved in the last block. 
Resistance training was performed in two series of ten rep- 
etitions per exercise (lateral pull down, step up, leg press, chest 
press, and abdominal crunch), targeting the major muscle 
groups. Resistance was based on baseline one-repetition mea- 
surement (1RM) of those exercises, starting at 65% of the 
1RM in week 1, followed by 70% in week 2, and 75% in weeks 
3 and 4.29,30 If the patient was able to perform 15 repetitions in 
the last block, the dose was increased by 10% and or decreased 
by 10% if 10 repetitions could not be achieved. 

The prehabilitation group received protein supplements 
(Refit TMP 90 Shake, Friesland Campina) twice a day during 
the program: (1) one portion within 1 hr after exercise and (2) 
one before bedtime (0.4 g/kg of body weight per serving). The 
participants completed a 3-day-food diary before the start and 
at the end of the program. Participants in the intervention group 
received a tailored dietary advice aiming at a total protein intake 
of 1.5–1.8 g/kg per day.23,31,32 Vitamin D and multivitamins 
(50% of RDA) were provided daily during prehabilitation.33–35 

Preoperatively, patients in the intervention group were 
scheduled for a 90-min visit with a trained psychologist to 
address patients’ anxiety level, to provide coping strategies, 
to teach relaxation techniques, and to discuss postoperative 
expectations. If desired, more sessions were offered during 
the 4 weeks of prehabilitation. When included in the interven- 
tion group, patients were individually informed by a researcher 
for half an hour for optimal understanding of the prehabilitation 
program. In addition, patients were phoned weekly by a spe- 
cialized nurse to increase adherence to the program. During 
these contacts, coping mechanisms and psychological com- 
plaints were addressed, and training perseverance was fur- 
ther encouraged. 

The primary outcomes were feasibility, determined as ad- 
herence to training sessions, and number of dropouts and 
safety, determined as occurrence of adverse events.36,37 Drop- 
outs as well as participants who finished the program received 
questionnaires developed by the researchers to assess the 
reason for dropout and program satisfaction respectively. 
The questionnaire was designed based on our patient experi- 
ence and contained simple questions regarding program satis- 
faction, 1 = not satisfied, 5 = very satisfied, and questions 
with percentage of patients with the answer yes or no (Fig. 1). 
A secondary outcome was functional capacity after 
prehabilitation and 4 weeks postoperatively, determined with 
the six-minute walk test (6MWT). During the 6MWT, the pa- 
tient walked as far as possible along a 50-m stretch of corridor 
in 6 mins, according to the protocol.38,39 An increase of 20 m 
was considered to be clinically relevant.40–42 
Another secondary outcome was muscle strength as 
measured with 1RM, also determined after prehabilitation 
and 4 weeks postoperatively. Because determining 1RM 
directly (by lifting the maximum weight achievable for the 
patient) has been questioned because of a risk of serious 
muscular injury, we chose to define the 1RM by indirect 
measures using the Brzycki formula (1RM = weight (cid:1) 36/ 
(37 − repetitions)).43,44 

information was extracted using screening 
methods and tests for functional capacity in both groups 
(cardiopulmonary exercise testing, hand grip strength test, 
stair climb test, and sit-to-stand test), physical activity level 
(modified Community Healthy Activities Model Program 
for Seniors19), nutritional status (Patient-Generated Subjective 
Global Assessment, skin fold measurements, anthropometry, 
body mass index and food diary), HRQoL (Short Form Health 
Survey-36, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC QLQ-CR29), vul- 
nerability of older patients (fried frailty score and G8 score), 
and depression and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 
[GAD-7] and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]). These 
questionnaires were captured to test complete logistics for the 
international randomized controlled trial (RCT) but were too 
few to perform proper analysis. 
Follow-up included 4 weeks postoperatively (number and 
type of complications, reintervention, readmission, and mor- 
tality) and 1 yr after surgery (data to be analyzed) (Table 1). 

Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The data 
on functional capacity and strength were described by means ± 
standard deviation for normally distributed data or medians 
(interquartile range [IQR]) for nonnormally distributed data 
per time point, and as individual absolute or proportional dif- 
ferences for patients in the intervention group. 
Secondary outcomes were described as means ± SD for 
continuous normally distributed variables or median (IQR) 
for continuous nonnormally distributed variables. Categor- 
ical parameters were described as number plus percentage 
per time point. Statistical methods included t test and the 
Mann-Whitney U test for continuous parameters, distributed 
either normally or not normally, respectively, at a single post- 
operative time point. 
A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi- 
cant. Categorical and noncategorical data on feasibility were 
analyzed as qualitative measures. Statistical analysis was 





performed using SPSS for Windows software (Version 22.0) 
and Graphpad Prism software for Windows. 


Patient characteristics are described in Table 2. Patients in 
the prehabilitation group had a lower average 6MWT (535 vs. 
568, ns), VO2peak (23 vs. 27, ns), and 1RM leg press (97 vs. 
116, ns), suggesting a lower baseline functional capacity in 
the intervention group compared with controls. The number 
of anastomoses constructed, laparoscopy and conversion rate, 
duration of surgery, etc. were similar in both groups. In addi- 
tion, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, rates 
for mortality, reintervention, and readmission for both groups 
were similar to rates from hospital administration after stan- 
dard care before the introduction of this prehabilitation pro- 
gram (Table 3). Most common postoperative complications 
included ileus, wound, and urine tract infections within 30 days

postoperatively. Eight (80%) of 10 patients with anemia were 
treated with preoperative iron injections of whom 4 (50%) re- 
sponded with a hemoglobin level higher than 7 mmol/l. 

No adverse events as a result of the study were reported. 
Three (15%) of 20 patients in the intervention group did not 
complete the program. One patient withdrew because she 
was a caregiver to her husband and did not have the time to fin- 
ish the program; the two others could not complete the pro- 
gram because their surgery was rescheduled to an earlier 
moment (because of logistical challenges). Ninety percent 
(n = 18) of patients indicated that they felt less tired because 
of the program. Program evaluation revealed a high attendance 
rate at the training sessions: of the 17 (85%) patients who com- 
pleted the program, 12 (71%) attended 90% or more of the 12 
intended training sessions. The remaining 5 patients (29%) 
also attended more than 75% of training sessions, and overall, 
88% of training sessions were completed by patients. A high 
level of patient satisfaction was reported (mean score of 4.6, 
1 = not satisfied, 5 = very satisfied). Reasons for patients to 
join a prehabilitation program, factors related to program satis- 
faction, and major challenges in completing the program are 
given in Figure 2. Forty percent (n = 8) of the participants 
perceived no obstacles to the completion of the program as 
offered. When asked if they would follow the program again 
in retrospect, all patients confirmed, and all patients would 
recommend the program to family or friends. 

Most patients (n = 15, 88%) in the prehabilitation group im- 
proved their functional capacity after 4 weeks of prehabilitation. 
Strength (1RM) increased for all 17 patients (mean increase of 
17.5 kg). Sixty-four percent (n = 11) of the patients showed 
a clinically relevant (≥20 m) progression in 6MWT after 
prehabilitation (mean increase of 67 m).14,17,45 There were 
2 patients (12%) showing no progression in functional capacity. 
Both patients had a baseline 6MWT slightly above mean baseline 
functional capacity. Overall, more than half of patients in the in- 
tervention group progressed on all tests. All patients improved 
on at least three tests (of seven) for endurance and strength. 
Four weeks after surgery, the mean functional capacity of 
patients in the intervention group increased compared with 
baseline, whereas the control group showed a decline in func- 
tional capacity (Fig. 3). A mean increase of 30.3 m compared 
with baseline is seen in the intervention group, and −16.3-m 
decrease in walking distance is seen in the control group. This 
suggests that patients recover above their baseline functional 
capacity after prehabilitation, whereas the control group shows 
a slight decline in condition (P < 0.05). We also observed that 
86% (n = 15) of patients in the prehabilitation group recovered 
to baseline functional capacity within 4 weeks after surgery, ver- 
sus only 40% (n = 12) in the control group (P < 0.01). 

This study was initiated to assess the feasibility, safety, 
and effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation program 
for CRC patients undergoing elective surgery. We found that 
prehabilitation is feasible and safe, enables patients to improve 
their functional capacity preoperatively, and enhances recovery. 

During this pilot series, we found that all patients who en- 
rolled in the program attended at least 9 of 12 training sessions. 
The attendance was as high as 88% of the scheduled sessions. 
All scheduled visits to the dietitian and psychologist were 
attended. This sums up to a total of 17 in hospital appoint- 
ments, which seemed not to be an obstacle for our patients. 
There were no adverse events because of the prehabilitation 
program. However, we learned that protein consumption just 
before sleep caused uncomforting and nausea in some patients. 
Therefore, we advised to take this dose at least 1 hr earlier. Dur- 
ing the pilot, all patients had a session with a registered psy- 
chologist, but on evaluation, there was not much added value 
because fear for the operation and the cancer diagnosis overall 
was realistic and weekly counseling by the case manager 
(nurse specialist in colorectal care) would suffice. We now 
use validated questionnaires PHQ-9 and GAD-7 for screening 
to select individual patients for psychologist consultation. 
Weekly contact with the case managers warranted optimal pa- 
tient information and patient involvement with a focus on 
persistent behavioral changes. None of the patients in the 
prehabilitation group were active smokers; however, all four 
smokers in the control group stopped preoperatively in our 
counseling program. Because of the high attendance and the 
lack of adverse events, the 4-pillar prehabilitation program 
proved to be feasible and safe. 
All patients improved clinically in their physical perfor- 
mance after 4 weeks of training, because there was a mean in- 
crease of more than 30 m in the 6MWT.42,46 Muscle strength 
was increased in all participants. Therefore, the program is ef- 
fective in increasing functional capacity. Previous studies on

prehabilitation describe that multimodal programs may be 
more effective.25 Exercise, nutritional, psychological, and 
smoking cessation interventions seem most effective when 
combined and tailored to the individual patient. Earlier studies 
FIGURE 3. Patients undergoing a 4-week prehabilitation program 
before colorectal surgery showed progress after training and performed 
better postoperatively (analysis of variance, P < 0.05) on functional 
capacity (6MWT) compared with controls receiving standard care. 
using lower-intensity and home-based programs resulted in 
only modest or no improvement in functional capacity.17 We, 
therefore, opted for a supervised and personalized HIT.47 
Four weeks after surgery, patients in the prehabilitation 
group had a mean functional capacity (6MWT) higher than 
at baseline. Their gain in functional capacity before surgery 
helped them recover. Patients in the control group did not 
have a second measurement before surgery. Four weeks after 
surgery, the mean functional capacity was below baseline. 
There is a statistically significant benefit for prehabilitation, 
although the study was not designed to prove this consider- 
ing the nonrandomized fashion. However, on individual ba- 
sis, there is a relevant difference because only 40% of the 
control group have reached baseline, whereas 86% of the 
prehabilitation group have reached baseline or performed 
better. Therefore, we state that the prehabilitation program 
could be effective in enhancing recovery. The increased re- 
covery by prehabilitation will hopefully lead to less compli- 
cations, a shorter hospital stay, a better quality of life, and a 
reduction in health care cost, which is to be proven in our in- 
ternational RCT. 
Giving patients the opportunity to change their own be- 
havior and have an effect on their own treatment was thought 






to be extremely important. Because these patients felt actively 
engaged with their treatment, they were better informed, had 
more confidence in their treatment, and shared decision-making 
became standard practice. 

Although this prehabilitation program proved feasible, it 
could only succeed because of the collaboration of involved 
medical disciplines and hospital management. Most specialists 
tend to work in “silo’s,”48,49 but successful implementation of 
the program requires secure planning, coordination over dis- 
ciplines, and flexible resources to facilitate all appointments 
for patients during prehabilitation. Regular meetings with 
representatives of all the disciplines allowed us to instigate 
and implement an appropriate framework for prehabilitation. 
Enthusiasm of patients was communicated to the whole 
research team and was an indispensable factor in further 
enhancing and sustaining commitment of involved health 
care practitioners. 
The Dutch guidelines compel surgeons to operate within 
5 weeks after diagnosis. To create the window of opportunity 
for prehabilitation, a speedy workup within 1 wk is mandatory. 
However, in many national and international laws, the “natu- 
ral” waiting time for surgery allows for prehabilitation for a 
4-wk period. In addition, “waiting time” targets for hospitals, 
which are publicly available, result in the expectation of pa- 
tients that they will be operated within this period. Recent 
studies show that oncological outcome does not improve 
when colorectal patients are operated within these 5 weeks.18 
Moreover, the present study indicates that prehabilitation re- 
sults in substantial benefits for patients in terms of improving 
functional capacity and this finding should be investigated on 
a larger scale. The planned RCT aims to show an association 
between increasing preoperative functional capacity using 
prehabilitation and better postoperative outcomes. Consequently, 
it may even be recommended to prolong the prehabilitation 
period further for individual patients. 

The aim of this study was to test feasibility of a multi- 
modal prehabilitation program, and therefore, only 50 patients 
were included. Because of these small numbers and lack of 
randomization, limited conclusions can be drawn on the effects 
of the program. Especially for the analysis of postoperative 
outcomes on complications, quality of life and costs, a larger 
sample number is needed. A larger patient population may also 
facilitate analysis of responsiveness in different subgroups of 
patients. This study offered multimodal prehabilitation based 
on availability of the program. Because we wanted the patients 
to train in a group of approximately five patients, we had pe- 
riods (blocks) to include for the control group and periods to 
include for the intervention. The design of the international 
RCT based on this pilot will rule out most bias. 

Prehabilitation may be seen as a new era in healthcare 
focusing on prevention and lifestyle changes. The combina- 
tion of current knowledge may allow us to improve care 
before any type of intensive treatment, such as surgery or 
chemoradiotherapy.5,17,50,51 Prehabilitation improves patient 
education and gives patients a central role (patient empower- 
ment). We hope to demonstrate enhanced recovery and facili- 
tate the earlier start of adjuvant treatment. Potentially, there 
might be a higher compliance to adjuvant treatment and there- 
fore benefit for oncological outcomes.52 
The principal of future prehabilitation research and im- 
plementation includes support throughout the healthcare 
organization and the involvement of all relevant stake- 
holders (such as medical specialists, management, finance 
and health insurance companies), to allow patients to prepare 
optimally for any type of major treatment. New studies may eval- 
uate community-based prehabilitation programs facilitating an 
accessible and individualized program to create definitive life- 
style changes for everyone. 

This study demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and effec- 
tiveness of multimodal prehabilitation. The program consisted 
of HIT, optimal nutrition, smoking cessation, and psychologi- 
cal support for CRC patients. A randomized controlled trial 
(NTR5947) was initiated to determine whether prehabilitation 
may lower morbidity and mortality rates in colorectal surgery.
