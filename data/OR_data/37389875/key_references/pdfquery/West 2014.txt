Background. Patients requiring surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer often additionally 
undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT), of which the effects on physical ﬁtness 
are unknown. The aim of this feasibility and pilot study was to investigate the effects of 
NACRT and a 6 week structured responsive exercise training programme (SRETP) on oxygen 
uptake ( ˙VO2) at lactate threshold ( ˆuL) in such patients. 
Methods. We prospectively studied 39 consecutive subjects (27 males) with T3–4/N+ 
resection margin threatened rectal cancer who completed standardized NACRT. Subjects 
underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline (pre-NACRT), at week 0 (post- 
NACRT), and week 6 (post-SRETP). Twenty-two subjects undertook a 6 week SRETP on a 
training bike (three sessions per week) between week 0 and week 6 (exercise group). These 
were compared with 17 contemporaneous non-randomized subjects (control group). 
Changes in ˙VO2 at ˆuL over time and between the groups were compared using a compound 
symmetry covariance linear mixed model. 
Results. Of 39 recruited subjects, 22 out of 22 (exercise) and 13 out of 17 (control) completed 
the study. There were differences between the exercise and control groups at baseline [age, 
ASA score physical status, World Health Organisation performance status, and Colorectal 
Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (CR- 
POSSUM) predicted mortality]. In all subjects, ˙VO2 at ˆuL signiﬁcantly reduced between 
baseline and week 0 [21.9 ml kg21 min21; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 21.3, 22.6; 
P,0.0001]. In the exercise group, ˙VO2 at ˆuL signiﬁcantly improved between week 0 and 
week 6 (+2.1 ml kg21 min21; 95% CI +1.3, +2.9; P,0.0001), whereas the control group 
values were unchanged (20.7 ml kg21 min21; 95% CI 21.66, +0.37; P¼0.204). 
Conclusions. NACRT before rectal cancer surgery reduces physical ﬁtness. A structured 
exercise intervention is feasible post-NACRT and returns ﬁtness to baseline levels within 
6 weeks.

In the UK, colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of 
cancer death.1 2 In 2012, (cid:2)9000 patients were diagnosed with 
rectal cancer (35% aged .75 yr), of whom 75% underwent 
major resection with 90 day postoperative mortality of 3.2%.3 
Twenty-ﬁve per cent are locally advanced [Tumour, Node, Me- 
tastasis (TNM) stage—T3/T4N+] cancers considered for 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) to control 
local 
disease, achieve tumour downsizing, and negative resection 
margins;4 – 8 however, external beam radiation and oral or i.v. 
ﬂuoropyrimidines cause dose-limiting toxicity, 
reaching 
grade 3–5 in 20%. The UK National Bowel Cancer Audit found 
the ASA-physical status (ASA-PS) score (a categorical descrip- 
tor of ﬁtness for surgery) as the strongest predictor of death 
within 30 days of surgery.3 Only two trials have suggested 
that rectal cancer patients with a lower subjective perform- 
ance status [World Health Organisation (WHO) score .1] 
have worse postoperative outcome after combined chemo- 
therapy or chemoradiation and surgery.9 10 

recovery have 
usually been intra- and postoperative,11 12 which for high-risk 
populations might be too late. The preoperative period might 
be a better time to engage patients in enhancing physical 
ﬁtness, that is, ‘prehabilitation’.13 14 Presurgical exercise inter- 
ventions are feasible, safe, improve function, and quality of 
life,15 16 but little is known of their effects on physical ﬁtness 
measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); yet 
poor ﬁtness is linked to poor postoperative outcomes.17 – 21 
Identifying prehabilitation programmes to optimize preopera- 
tive ﬁtness is therefore a priority.22 
The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate, in 
patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery after NACRT, how 
objectively measured physical ﬁtness changes with NACRT 
and a preoperative 6 week structured responsive exercise 
training programme (SRETP). Other exploratory aims were 
to observe changes in physical activity (PA) and physical 
ﬁtness, and to explore safety and feasibility of the exercise 
programme in this high-risk patient cohort. 


This prospective pilot, non-randomized, parallel group, inter- 
ventional controlled trial was approved by the North West— 
Liverpool East Research and Ethics Committee (11/H1002/12) 
and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01325909). Written 
informed consent was obtained from all patients. We recruited 
consecutive patients between March 2011 and February 2013 
referred to the Colorectal Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT), age 
≥18 yr, with locally advanced (circumferential resection 
margin threatened) resectable rectal cancer, undergoing stan- 
dardized NACRTon the basis of TNM classiﬁcation .T2/N+ with 
no distant metastasis23 and WHO performance status ,2.24 
Exclusion criteria were: inability to give informed consent, non- 
resectable disease, inability to perform CPETor bicycle exercise, 
and patients who declined surgery or NACRT, or who received 
non-standard NACRT. After completing NACRT, patients were 

allocated to the exercise training group by default. If unable 
to commit to the exercise schedule (or living .15 miles from 
the hospital), they were asked to act as contemporaneously 
recruited controls (no exercise intervention) with the same 
CPET follow-up. 
All subjects underwent CPET 2 weeks before NACRT (base- 
line) and immediately post-NACRT (week 0), then at weeks 3, 
6, 9, and 14 before surgery at week 15. Patients in the exercise 
group undertook the intervention continuously between week 
0 and week 6 (Fig. 1). CPET data were reported blind by two 
experienced assessors. All subjects underwent a continuous 
72 h period of PA monitoring (Sensewear biaxial accelerom- 
eter, worn over the right triceps) during weekdays at baseline 
(2 weeks before NACRT), immediately post-NACRT (week 0), 
and week 6. 
Subjects in the exercise group attended a 6 week supervised 
in-hospital exercise training programme (three sessions/ 
week). The exercise training intensities were responsive to 
each individual CPET at week 0 and week 3 (informed and 
altered according to measured work rates at ˙VO2 at ˆuL and 
˙ 
VO2 at peak exercise). Exercise training consisted of 40 min 
(including 5 min warm-up and 5 min cool-down) of interval 
training on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer 
(Optibike Ergoline GmbH, Germany). The training programme 
was preloaded on a chip-and-pin card which executed the 
interval intensities automatically. The interval-training pro- 
gramme consisted of alternating moderate (80% of work rate 
at ˙VO2 at ˆuL – 4 by 3 min intervals) to severe (50% of the differ- 
ence in work rates between ˙VO2 at peak and ˙VO2 at ˆuL – 4 by 2 
min intervals) intensities (total 20 min) for the ﬁrst two ses- 
sions. This is then increased to 40 min (6×3 min intervals at 
moderate intensity and 6×2 min intervals at severe intensity) 
(Supplementary Appendix S1). The training programme was 
modiﬁed for each individual’s ramped CPET protocol results 
ensuring consistent and individualized intensities for all sub- 
jects.25 All subjects exercised in pairs for camaraderie. 
TNM staging involved ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy for histological 
diagnosis, colonoscopy, chest, abdomen, and pelvis computer- 
aided tomography (CT), and 1.5 T pelvic magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). All subjects underwent 5 weeks NACRT. Stan- 
dardized radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions on 
weekdays using a 3D conformal technique with CT guidance. 
A boost dose was given (5.4 Gy in three fractions) to the 
primary tumour only. Oral capecitabine (825 mg m22) was 
given twice daily on radiotherapy days. No subjects received 
brachytherapy. At 9 weeks post-NACRT, subjects were restaged 
using chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT and pelvic MRI. The colo- 
rectal MDT was blind to CPET results and patient allocation. 
All subjects underwent total mesorectal excision,26 and a 
defunctioning stoma was constructed at the discretion of the 
surgeon. 

CPET (Geratherm Respiratory GmbH; Love Medical Ltd, Manches- 
ter, UK) followed a standard protocol described elsewhere.27 
Subjects characteristics were recorded included as shown in 



Table 1. Resting ﬂow–volume loops were used to derive forced 
expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity 
(FVC). Ventilation and gas exchange variables included oxygen 
uptake ( ˙VO2), ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon 
dioxide ( ˙VE/ ˙VO2; ˙VE/ ˙VCO2), and oxygen pulse ( ˙VO2/heart rate), 
all measured both at estimated lactate threshold ( ˆuL) and at 
peak exercise. Averaged step count while active was measured 
over 72 h using the PA monitor. 
NACRT-associated toxicity and CPET-related adverse events 
were discussed at the weekly MDT meeting. Toxicity events 
were graded on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria (version 3.0), and acute radiation-induced 
skin toxicity using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
scoring system. The physiological variables of the Colorectal 
Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration 
of Mortality and Morbidity (CR-POSSUM)28 were completed 
immediately before operation; the operative details of CR- 
POSSUM were completed after operation. 
We aimed to evaluate changes in ˙VO2 at ˆuL between base- 
line, week 0, and week 6 in the exercise and control groups as 
a measure of the impact of NACRT and SRETP on physical 
ﬁtness. Exploratory aims include observing: changes in 
number of steps (PA) with NACRT (between baseline and week 
0) and in both the exercise and control groups (between week 
0 and week 6); changes in ˙VO2 at ˆuL and at peak until 
week 15; and the safety and feasibility of the exercise interven- 
tion (number of adverse events and adherence recorded to 
CPET or exercise training sessions).

Our aim was to recruit 30 subjects (15 each in the exercise and 
control group) who would undergo standardized NACRT and 
the intervention period as an intention to treat for rectal 
cancer. This was based on an unpaired t-test with 90% power 
to detect a minimum difference in ˙VO2 at ˆuL of 1.5 ml kg21 
min21 and an SD of 1.1 ml kg21 min21 and allowed for 20% sub- 
jects drop-out (based on a previous study).29 
Continuous variables are reported as mean (range), mean (SD) 
or median and inter-quartile range (IQR), depending on distribu- 
tion, and categorical variables as frequency (%). Univariate 
statistical comparisons of patient characteristics between 
the groups were undertaken: for continuous variables, a two- 
sample t-test when relevant distributional assumptions were 
met and the Mann–Whitney U-test otherwise; for categorical 
variables, x2 tests or, when cell counts were insufﬁcient, 
Fisher’s exact test. P,0.05 was taken as statistically signiﬁcant. 
For the primary analysis, compound symmetry covariance 
pattern linear mixed models were used to model ˙VO2 at ˆuL 
and ˙VO2 at peak exercise over the three time points: baseline 
(pre-NACRT), week 0, and week 6 post-NACRT. Group (exer- 
cise/control) and visit (baseline, week 0, and week 6) were 
included as main effects in addition to the interaction 
between them. We identiﬁed three relevant formal compari- 
sons for each of these two endpoints: (i) all subjects, pre vs 
week 0, (ii) exercise group only, week 0 vs week 6, and (iii) 
between-group comparison of the change between week 0 
and week 6 (effectively a week 6 comparison between the 
groups corrected for between-group differences at week 0). 
These six comparisons were considered to be statistically sig- 
niﬁcant at a Bonferroni-corrected level of P,0.008. Residuals 
and model ﬁt were assessed using Q –Q plots and residual vs 
predicted mean plots. The impact of potential confounders 
on between-group comparisons was assessed by incorporat- 
ing variables listed in Table 1 into the ﬁnal models as sensitivity 
analyses. For PA, these comparisons were considered as ex- 
ploratory and tested against the uncorrected 5% signiﬁcance 
level; the need to square-root transform PA makes it impossible 
to recover the differences and CIs on a meaningful scale, so 
only P-values and predicted means are presented. All mixed 
model statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 

A total of 39 subjects were recruited, of whom 22 out of 22 and 
13 out of 17 completed the study in the exercise and control 
groups, respectively (four subjects having dropped out before 
baseline CPET). PA data were complete in 22 out of 22 and 10 
out of 17 subjects. Subject characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
There were signiﬁcant baseline differences between the 
groups in age, ASA, WHO performance status, and CR-POSSUM 
predicted morbidity scores, the control group being older and 
having poorer subjective performance. 
Supplementary Table S1 shows BMI, spirometry variables 
(FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC), and haemoglobin over the whole 
study period, along with MRI tumour staging and re-staging 
post-NACRT (week 9) clinical data. There were no signiﬁcant 
baseline differences in these variables.

of ˙VO2 at ˆuL between the groups at week 6, correcting for differ- 
ences in ˙VO2 at ˆuL between the groups at week 0, shows a dif- 
ference of +2.77 ml kg21 min21 (95% CI +1.49–4.05; 
P,0.0001).

VO2 at peak shows similar changes in the exercise group: 
+2.65 ml kg21 min21 (95% CI +1.19– 4.10; P¼0.0005), while 
the control group worsened by 21.25 ml kg21 min21 (95% 
CI: 23.14 to +0.64; P¼0.19). A direct comparison of ˙VO2 at 
peak between the groups at week 6, correcting for differences 
in ˙VO2 at peak at week 0, shows a change of +3.90 ml kg21 
min21 (95% CI +1.52 –6.28; P¼0.0017). Adjusting for potential 
confounders had negligible effect on these analyses (not 
shown). Results of a secondary analysis of ˙VO2 at ˆuL, including 
all time-points, are shown in Figure 3. 
There was a signiﬁcant difference in the averaged number of 
steps between baseline and week 0 for all subjects (P¼0.0004) 
and for the exercise and control groups between week 0 and 
week 6 (P,0.0001 and P¼0.003) (Supplementary Table S3), 
but the improvement seen between week 0 and week 6 did 
not differ between the exercise and control groups (P¼0.84). 


This blinded interventional pilot study shows that a 6 week 
SRETP improves objectively measured physical ﬁtness in 
patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery after standardized 
NACRT, consistent with our previous work (a small pilot study 
studying the changes in ﬁtness with NACRT).29 We also found 
a signiﬁcant decline in PA with NACRT, and a subsequent

(ml kg21 min21) (A) and ˙VO2 at peak (ml kg21 min21) (B) at baseline 
(pre-NACRT), week 0 (post-NACRT), and week 6 for the exercise 
(dashed line) and control groups (solid line). 
Supplementary Table S2 shows tumour and treatment char- 
acteristics. A signiﬁcant difference was found between the 
groups in TNM down-staging in response to NACRT. All subjects 
completed NACRT. One subject needed capecitabine dose re- 
duction, while four subjects (three in the exercise group and 
radiation skin changes 
one control) sustained perineal 
(maximum score 2 out of 4). The control group responded sig- 
niﬁcantly less to NACRT on restaging MRI (as classiﬁed by MRI 
tumour regression scores). 
Supplementary Table S3 shows changes in CPETand PA vari- 
ables. The median time to starting exercise after completion of 
NACRT was two working days (IQR 1–7 days). The mean (SD) 
%adherence to the exercise programme (percentage of the 
18 sessions completed) was 96 (5)%. The mean (SD) %adher- 
ence to CPETs (percentage of 6 CPETs attended) was 92 
(14)% in the exercise group vs 60 (5)% in controls. There were 
no adverse events associated with CPET or SRETP. The control 
group had a lower peak work rate and lower ventilatory efﬁ- 
ciency at baseline. 
There was a signiﬁcant reduction in ˙VO2 at ˆuL (21.91 ml kg21 
min21; 95% CI 21.27 to 22.55; P,0.0001) and ˙VO2 at peak

post-NACRT. The exercise group showed a signiﬁcant

but then improves in both groups, probably because of the 
natural resumption of activities of daily living post-NACRT. Of 
note, the exercise group re-attained their baseline activity 
levels with a signiﬁcant change in ﬁtness after the intervention 
period; however, the control group sustained a decline in 
ﬁtness while their activity overshot their baseline levels. The 
dramatic changes in physical ﬁtness between the groups are 
therefore mediated by the structured exercise intervention; 
improving PA is not enough. 
These ﬁndings have important clinical implications. Fitness 
improves rapidly in the ﬁrst 3 weeks of the intervention (Fig. 3), 
while the control group, unable to recover from NACRT, showed 
a sustained decline from week 3 to week 14. The exercise group 
overshot baseline (pre-NACRT) at week 6, but ﬁtness thereafter 
declined. By week 6, subjects in the exercise group recovered 
from the effects of NACRT on ﬁtness and PA, while the control 
group, recovering only PA, were at high risk of adverse surgical 
outcome on the basis of conventional risk stratiﬁcation cut-off 
points for ˙VO2 at ˆuL of 10.1 –10.9 ml kg21 min21.18 27 40 In units 
where CPET is part of the routine perioperative cancer pathway, 
rectal cancer patients usually undergo testing before NACRT, 
not upon restaging. Such ﬁtness for surgery assessments 
might be less predictive of outcome than post-NACRT mea- 
surements, as they do not account for variability in changes 
in ﬁtness with NACRT. 

Strengths of this study include its prospective nature, the 
homogenous study population (only operable locally advanced 
rectal cancer patients), the blinded reporting of objectively 
measured CPET outcome variables (blind to patient character- 
istics, group allocation, and timeline), the rigorous exercise 
intervention, the standardized NACRTregime, and the statistic- 
al modelling undertaken to show difference in effect sizes 
with CIs. 
Potential weaknesses of this study include the non- 
randomized design which may have resulted in unobserved 


improvement over 6 weeks post-NACRT which did not differ 
between the groups. The training programme was safe and 
feasible (96% adherence to the intervention), with no 
adverse events; however, the practical day-to-day running of 
the prehabilitation programme needs careful execution and 
management to become part of routine clinical practice. 
initial ﬁtness and willingness to participate in a 
Patients’ 
prehabilitation programme, travel time, and distance from 
the prehabilitation centre, and also ﬂexibility in accessing the 
intervention, all need to be given careful consideration from 
the outset. 
Our study is the ﬁrst to show a meaningful decline in object- 
ively measured physical ﬁtness and PA after standardized 
NACRT, and a clinically meaningful improvement in physical 
ﬁtness with SRETP after NACRT before elective rectal cancer 
surgery. Poor preoperative physical ﬁtness, reﬂecting poor 
physiological reserves, is associated with postoperative mor- 
bidity,20 30 31 and rehabilitation after acute or chronic stres- 
sors32 – 34 can improve ﬁtness and quality of life. It therefore 
seems reasonable to aim an exercise intervention (prehabilita- 
tion) at restoring physical ﬁtness back to baseline (pre-NACRT) 
before another acute stressor (major cancer surgery). Recent 
systematic reviews15 16 conclude that preoperative aerobic ex- 
ercise training is feasible, safe, and tolerable in several surgical 
patient groups, and improves at least one measure of physical 
ﬁtness. However, because of the small number of studies, lim- 
itations in study design, and heterogeneous reporting of inter- 
ventions and outcomes, evidence is lacking on its effects on 
physical ﬁtness and surgical outcome. 
A randomized controlled trial in colorectal cancer14 found 
no differences between a structured bike and strengthening 
regime compared with simple walking and breathing exercises. 
A subsequent observational study of a trimodal prehabilitation 
programme showed better postoperative 6 min walking dis- 
tance in the intervention group.35 Randomized studies on 
aerobic prehabilitation in colonic resection showed improve- 
ment in subjectively measured oxygen uptake, peak power 
output, and heart rate.36 37 Kothmann and colleagues38 
deﬁne a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in 
˙ 
VO2 at ˆuL of 2.0 ml kg21 min21; although they found that a mod- 
erate continuous exercise programme signiﬁcantly improved 
objectively measured physical ﬁtness ( ˙VO2 at ˆuL) in a high-risk 
cohort of patients with aortic abdominal aneurysms, MCID was 
not obtained, possibly because of too low an exercise duration 
and intensity.38 Our sample size estimate was based on the 
changes in ˙VO2 at ˆuL between baseline and week 0 of +1.5 
ml kg21 min21 in our pilot work29 with an aim of returning 
patients ﬁtness back to pre-NACRT levels. Using a higher inten- 
sity, interval-training regime of longer duration, as suggested 
by Kothmann and colleagues,38 we attained a between-group 
difference in ˙VO2 at ˆuL at week 6 of +2.77 ml kg21 min21 (95% 
CI +1.49 –4.05; P,0.0001), a substantial clinically important 
difference. 
Our subjects achieved far less than the recommended daily 
step count of 10 000 steps per day39 (49% and 55% in the exer- 
cise and control group, respectively). PA declines with NACRT in

differences between the groups and also the observed differ- 
ences between the groups that we reported (notably perform- 
ance status, CR-POSSUM predicted mortality, response to 
NACRT, peak work rates, and ventilatory equivalents). Although 
some sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the im- 
portance of these potential confounders, they might be sufﬁ- 
cient to account for a proportion of the observed differences 
between the control and the exercise group, and there is 
clearly no substitute for a randomized design with a larger 
sample size. Other weaknesses include the single-centre 
design which may limit the generalizability of the results.

NACRT acutely reduced objectively measured physical ﬁtness, 
while SRETP immediately post-NACRT before surgery (proving 
safe and feasible) improved ﬁtness. The exercise programme 
aimed to return patients to a pre-NACRT level of ﬁtness, and ac- 
tually showed an improvement above baseline ﬁtness at week 
6. The control group sustained the same decline in NACRT, 
which remained uncorrected despite their regaining baseline 
PA. This is a novel ﬁnding in this high-risk surgical cohort that 
needs to be validated by a randomized controlled trial. Our 
group is conducting such a trial which is currently recruiting 
(NIHR-funded PB-PG-0711-25093). This assesses changes in 
physical ﬁtness and quality of life after a 9 week intervention 
in this patient group. A larger trial is also needed to investigate
