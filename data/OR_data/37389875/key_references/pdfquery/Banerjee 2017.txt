Abstract 
Purpose Strategies to improve pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness could positively impact recovery after surgery. This 
study investigated the feasibility of vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in bladder cancer patients prior to radical 
cystectomy (RC). 
Methods A total of 60 patients were randomised (1:1) to exercise or control following a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). 
The exercise group was offered twice-weekly pre-operative supervised vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in addition to 
standard treatment. The controls received standard treatment only. A repeat CPET was undertaken before surgery and post- 
operative recovery outcomes were recorded. 
Results Over half of the 112 eligible patients approached in the clinic were recruited to the study (53.5%), with recruited patients 
attending a median of 8 (range 1–10) exercise sessions over a pre-operative period of 3–6 weeks. Improvements in peak values of 
oxygen pulse (P = 0.001), minute ventilation (P = 0.002) and power output (P < 0.001) were observed at the follow-up CPET in 
the exercise group versus controls and there were no adverse events. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect 
changes in post-operative recovery outcomes, there were marginal (non-significant) differences in favour of the exercise group in 
post-operative Clavien-Dindo score and need for high dependency unit inotropic support. 
Conclusions Bladder cancer patients respond well to pre-surgical aerobic interval exercise, and the improvements in cardiopul- 
monary fitness variables could have important implications for post-operative recuperation after RC. These findings provide a 
strong foundation for an adequately powered randomised controlled trial.

Pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness is increasingly being 
recognised as an important factor influencing post-operative re- 
covery outcomes. Almost two decades ago, Older et al. identified 
an association between low cardiopulmonary fitness in older 
people and poor outcome following major surgery [1]. Other 
studies have since provided further evidence of the utility of 
pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) variables 
for risk stratification of surgical patients, including those under- 
going radical cystectomy (RC) [2, 3]. However, the role of pre- 
operative exercise programmes (prehabilitation) for optimising 
cardiopulmonary fitness prior to surgery has received less atten- 
tion [4]. Although systematic review evidence suggests that ex- 
ercise training can improve cardiopulmonary fitness before sur- 
gery in older people and can reduce the risk of post-operative 
complications following major abdominal surgery [5–7], the 
paucity of high quality clinical trials has been highlighted [5]. 

Furthermore, studies that have investigated the effects of exercise 
prehabilitation programmes on post-operative recovery out- 
comes in cancer patients have yielded equivocal results. 
Intensive supervised pre-operative exercise programmes re- 
sulted in modest improvements in pre-operative cardiopulmo- 
nary fitness measures in lung cancer patients, including the six- 
minute walk test [8] and peak aerobic capacity [8, 9], but with 
no effect on pre-surgical or longer-term quality of life [10]. In 
addition, a supervised exercise programme involving trunk and 
limb-strengthening exercise improved chemoradiotherapy 
completion rate in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, but 
did not improve post-operative recovery outcomes [11]. In con- 
trast, Sekine et al. [12] reported a reduction in post-operative 
pulmonary complications and hospital length of stay in lung 
cancer patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease af- 
ter daily hospital-based pulmonary exercises and walking 
(5000 steps/day) in 2 weeks prior to lobectomy. Similarly, in 
prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, there 
is evidence that home-based pelvic floor muscle exercise has 
favourable effects on post-operative urinary continence out- 
comes up to 12 months of follow-up [13–15]. However, 
home-based exercise programmes involving aerobic and resis- 
tance exercise have had minimal impact on post-operative hos- 
pital length of stay or severity of complications in colorectal or 
bladder cancer patients [16–19], although Jensen et al. [19] 
reported improved post-operative mobility in the latter. 
Jensen et al. [20] showed that a 2-week home-based pro- 
gramme of pre-operative muscle strengthening exercises and en- 
durance training was feasible and resulted in improvements in 
muscle power in bladder cancer patients prior to RC. However, 
because of the short time-window between decision for surgery 
and RC, there is a need to optimise the exercise stimulus for 
cardiopulmonary adaptations, and the potential advantages of 
vigorous intensity interval exercise in this respect were recently 
highlighted [21]. Interval training enables patients to undertake 
aerobic (endurance) exercise at a higher intensity than would be 
possible for continuous exercise at the same intensity but the 
feasibility of this exercise modality in bladder cancer patients 
awaiting RC is unknown. Hence, the main purpose of this study 
was to investigate the feasibility of randomising bladder cancer 
patients to a short-term programme of pre-operative vigorous 
intensity aerobic interval exercise versus standard care prior to 
elective RC. A secondary aim was to collect and report prelim- 
inary data on CPET and post-operative recovery outcomes before 
and after the exercise prehabilitation programme. 


Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, United Kingdom, between 
2012 and 2014, and were randomised to standard treatment or 
pre-operative exercise training. Medical clearance to participate 
in the study was given by one of four consultant urologists, 
who were blind to treatment allocation. Randomisation was 
undertaken using a pre-generated random sequence (nQuery 
Advisor 6.1; Statistical Solutions) which was held by a research 
administrator not involved in the day to day running of the 
study. Upon completion of the baseline assessments, the study 
urologist (SB) phoned the administrator for group allocation 
(exercise or standard care). As the main purpose was to assess 
the feasibility of the exercise programme, there was no formal 
sample size calculation but we aimed to recruit 60 patients (30 
in each group) in accordance with published recommendations 
[22, 23]. Written informed consent was obtained prior to study 
participation, and ethical approval was granted by the East of 
England Regional Ethics Committee. 

The aim was to be as inclusive as possible so that the results of 
the study would have broad applicability. Bladder cancer pa- 
tients listed for RC via the multi-disciplinary team were in- 
cluded in the study, and eligibility was not limited by choice of 
surgical technique. Patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemo- 
therapy before RC were also included but entered the trial at 
least 2 weeks after completion of treatment. Patients offered 
urinary diversion for benign disease were excluded from the 
study. None of the patients recruited to the study were meeting 
current physical activity guidelines of a minimum of 150 min 
of moderate intensity physical activity per week [24]. 

Patients are treated according to targets set by NHS England, 
i.e. following general practitioner referral for a suspected can- 
cer, patients are to be investigated by 31 days and treated by 
62 days, resulting in a time-window between decision to op- 
erate and RC of 31 days (though this can vary due to medical 
decisions and availability of operating slots). Pre- and post- 
operatively, patients in both groups received the same level of 
standard treatment, which included pre-planned admission to 
the same high dependency unit (HDU) in the immediate post- 
operative period and subsequent step down to a urology ward. 
Patients were cared for by the same group of nurses and doc- 
tors who were blinded to group allocation. Patients in the 
control group were advised to carry on with their lifestyles 
in the ‘usual way’. 


Patients were recruited from the Urology Department at the 
Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals National Health 
Twice-weekly exercise training sessions were supervised by a 
small team of exercise science staff working closely with the 

study urologist (SB) in an exercise facility at the University of 
East Anglia, UK, which is close to the treating hospital. A 
consistent approach to setting the exercise intensity and mon- 
itoring physiological responses was used throughout the 
study. Sessions comprised vigorous intensity aerobic interval 
exercise on a cycle ergometer (Monark 824E; Varberg, 
Sweden) using the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion 
(RPE) Scale to control intensity [25]. The Borg RPE Scale is 
a psychophysiological scale, ranging from ‘No exertion’ to 
‘Maximal Exertion’. Following a 5–10-min warm-up against 
light resistance (50 W), the aim was for patients to perform 
6 × 5 min intervals at a target perceived exertion of 13–15 
(‘somewhat hard’ to ‘hard’, equating to 70–85% predicted 
maximum heart rate based on 220-age), with 2.5 min interpo- 
lated active rest intervals against light resistance (50 W). They 
were instructed to maintain a steady pedalling cadence of 50– 
60 rev min−1 during the aerobic intervals, and the exercise 
programme was progressed by gradually adding more load 
to the flywheel to maintain the target perceived exertion 
(Fig. 2). Immediately following the aerobic intervals, patients 
performed a ‘cool-down’ against low resistance (50 W). 

Feasibility was assessed in terms of recruitment and attrition, 
willingness to be randomised, acceptability of the outcome 
measures, adherence to the intervention, safety and suitability 
of the exercise dose and adverse events. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise test and post-operative 
recovery outcomes 
CPETs and post-operative recovery outcomes were blindly 
assessed by an exercise physiologist who was not directly 
involved in the supervision of exercise sessions and clinical 
staff at the treating hospital who were unaware of group allo- 
cation, respectively. 
All patients performed a baseline incremental CPET to max- 
imum exercise tolerance on an electronically-braked cycle er- 
gometer (Excalibur Sport, Lode, Netherlands). Following a 2- 
min warm-up against no resistance (0 W), work rate was in- 
creased using a ramp protocol (10–20 W min−1) to maximum 
exercise tolerance. Heart rate was recorded continuously by 
ECG (Cardioperfect, Cardioperfect, Welch Allyn, USA). 
Pulmonary gas exchange variables (oxygen uptake [V˙ O2]; car- 
bon dioxide production:[V˙ C O2]; minute ventilation [V˙ E]) and 
other respiratory variables) were measured breath-by-breath 
with an on-line expired gas analysis system (Ultima, 
CardioO2; Medical Graphics Corporation). Anaerobic thresh- 
old (AT) was determined from 30-s averaged data by two ex- 
perienced exercise physiologists (JS and GC) using the V-slope 
method and confirmed by analysing the ventilatory equivalents 
[26]. Peak values for all variables were recorded as the highest 
value over any 30-s averaged period, with peak oxygen pulse 
calculated as the amount of oxygen consumed per heart beat. 

Clavien-Dindo grading was used to score post-surgical com- 
plications [27, 28]. Post-operative ileus and pneumonia prev- 
alence, time spent in HDU, need for inotropic support and 
hospital length of stay (LoS) were used as other post- 
operative recovery outcomes. 

All statistical analyses were undertaken using SPSS (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). CPET and post-operative recov- 
ery outcomes were tested for normality of distribution using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Body mass index (BMI) and 
CPET variables were normally distributed and analysed using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline values as 
the covariate [29], to compare differences between the groups 
at follow-up (prior to surgery). Post-operative recovery out- 
comes were not normally distributed, and non-parametric sta- 
tistical tests were used. The Chi-square test was used to com- 
pare categorical data. The Spearman’s rank correlation coeffi- 
cient was used to investigated bivariate associations between 
CPET variables and post-operative recovery outcomes in 
pooled baseline data (independent of group assignment). 
Normally distributed data are presented as mean ± SD and 
non-normally distributed data as medians and range (unless 
otherwise stated). The significance level was set at P < 0.05. 


Of the 112 eligible patients who were approached to take part in 
the study, 60 (53.5%) agreed to participate (53 males; 7 fe- 
males). All recruited patients were willing to be randomised, 
and none withdrew consent following randomisation. The 
groups were well-matched for demographic variables, surgical 
treatment, comorbidities and smoking habits, though more pa- 
tients in the control group had a history of ischemic heart dis- 
ease, and more patients in the exercise group had undergone 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to the study (Table 1). Travel 
distance to the exercise facility was cited as the reason for non- 
participation in 38 (73%) of 52 eligible patients who declined to 
take part. Three eligible patients (5.8%) refused to take part 
because they felt they would be unable to undertake the CPET 
or comply with the exercise regimen. A further four patients 
(7.6%) refused to take part as they had an indwelling urethral 
catheter or a nephrostomy which they thought might prevent

them from undertaking exercise. Seven patients (13.4%) did not 
specify their reasons for not participating. Only five of the 60 
recruited patients dropped out of the study, two were deemed 
unfit for surgery following randomisation, and three opted for 
radiotherapy after the follow-up CPET. Recruitment and patient 
flow through the study is shown in Fig. 1. 
Most patients completed all assessments, demonstrating 
the acceptability of the pre-operative CPET and post- 
operative recovery outcomes. One patient from each group 
dropped out of the study before the follow-up CPET. 
Another two patients from the exercise group and four con- 
trols did not complete the follow-up CPET but their post- 
operative outcomes were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). 
The latter patients did not drop out of the study, rather they 
were unable to attend the follow-up (pre-operative) CPET. 
This means that a total of 27/30 (90%) of patients in the exer- 
cise group and 25/30 (83%) patients in the control group com- 
pleted both CPET assessments (Fig. 1), with no adverse 
events, and with AT data being available for 24 and 23 pa- 
tients, respectively. There were no post-operative recovery 
outcomes for three other patients in the exercise group (one 
dropped out before the follow-up CPET and the others after 
the follow-up CPET) and two other patients in the control 

group (one dropped out before the follow-up CPET and the 
other after the follow-up CPET). This means that 10% of 
patients in the exercise group and 7% in the control group 
dropped out of the study (Fig. 1). 
The median number of supervised exercise sessions 
attended by patients in the exercise arm was 8 (range 1–10) 
over a pre-operative period of 3–6 weeks. Three exercise pa- 
tients underwent RC < 4 weeks after recruitment and conse- 
quently attended < 8 sessions. Between the first and fourth 
week, patients exercised at an average of 85–87% predicted 
maximum heart rate (based on 220-age) and 90–92% of the 
measured peak heart rate during the CPET (Fig. 2), demon- 
strating the safety and suitability of the exercise dose. 
Flywheel load (power output) was gradually increased from 
111 ± 5.5 to 122 ± 5.8 W during this time to ensure target heart 
rates for vigorous intensity exercise were maintained as pa- 
tients adapted to the exercise programme (Fig. 2). The average 
number of aerobic intervals achieved in the first week of exer- 
cise was 5.5 (range 3.5–6.0), whereas all patients were achiev- 
ing six intervals per session in the fourth week. There were no 
adverse events resulting from the supervised exercise sessions. 

CPET variables at baseline and follow-up are presented in 
Table 2. The time between baseline and follow-up CPET was 
32 (6.5) days (range 20–45 days) for the exercise group and 29 
(4.2) days (range 21–37 days) for the controls. Improvements 
in peak values of oxygen pulse (P = 0.001), V˙ E (P = 0.002) 
and power output (P < 0.001) but not peak V˙ O2 (P = 0.057) or 
AT (P = 0.637) were observed at the follow-up CPET in the 
exercise group versus controls (Table 2). Although this feasi- 
bility study was not powered to detect changes in post- 
operative recovery outcomes, four patients (15%) in the exer- 
cise group versus ten controls (36%) had some deviation from 
the normal post-operative course of recovery (Clavien-Dindo 
Grade ≥ 1; P = 0.075), whereas one patient (4%) in the exer- 
cise group and four controls (14%) had a Clavien-Dindo Grade 
≥ 3; (P = 0.172). The prevalence of post-operative ileus (P = 
0.808) and pneumonia (P = 0.609) were similar between the 
exercise and control groups (6 versus 7 patients and 3 versus 2 
patients, respectively). Median time spent in HDU was 1 day 
in both the exercise and control group (range 1–10 and 1– 
7 days, respectively; P = 0.938), although fewer patients in 
the exercise group needed HDU inotropic support, reaching 
borderline statistical significance (2 versus 7 patients; P = 
0.078). The median hospital LoS was 7 days in both the exer- 
cise and control groups (range 4–78 and 5–107 days, respec- 
tively; P = 0.865). When the pre-operative data were pooled 
and considered independent of group assignment, inverse as- 
sociations were observed between LoS (HDU and hospital) 
and pre-operative CPET variables (P < 0.05; Table 3). 

Fig. 1 Participant flow through 
the trial 

This is the first study to show that vigorous intensity aerobic 
interval exercise is feasible in bladder cancer patients awaiting 
RC. Patients adapted to the programme quickly, and all were 
able to perform six aerobic intervals per exercise session at the 
vigorous intensity target heart rate by the fourth week of ex- 
ercise. The recruitment rate of eligible patients was very good 
(53.5%), with the main reason for non-participation being 
distance between the exercise facility and their home. As the 
hospital serves a large rural community, with some patients 
living > 80 km away, twice-weekly travel to the supervised 
exercise sessions was too onerous for some participants. We 
also observed excellent retention over the course of the study 
(8.3% attrition), which is likely to be at least in part due to 
flexible exercise scheduling. In addition, most patients (87%) 
were able to attend both CPET assessments prior to RC and 
there were no adverse events. The time between baseline and 
follow-up CPET assessments was in the range of 20–45 days 
across both groups. This provided an opportunity for all pa- 
tients in the exercise arm to attend a minimum of six super- 
vised exercise sessions prior to RC. 
Because of the short time-window between decision for 
surgery and RC, there is a need for pre-surgical exercise

Fig. 2 Average weekly heart rate (HR; top figure) and power output 
(bottom figure) over four pre-operative weeks of supervised aerobic in- 
terval exercise. Average heart rate data are presented as percentage of the 
peak heart rate measured during the pre-operative CPET and predicted 
maximum heart rate based on 220-age 
programmes to be effective and time efficient, and the potential 
advantages of vigorous interval exercise were recently 
highlighted [21]. Supervised pre-operative exercise 
programmes also need to be pragmatic, taking into account 
the need for extra hospital visits, and the challenges this pre- 
sents for some patients. Our exercise programme involved 
twice-weekly aerobic interval exercise training at ‘somewhat 
hard’ to ‘hard’ intensity (Borg RPE 13–15), equating to ~ 70– 
85% predicted maximum heart rate [30], which is reported to be 
optimal for inducing improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness 
in previously sedentary older people [31]. Improvements in 
peak values of oxygen pulse, V˙ E and power output suggest 
the exercise programme could be an effective stimulus for in- 
ducing cardiopulmonary adaptations. Furthermore, the im- 
provement in peak oxygen pulse and progressive increase in 
power output needed to maintain the vigorous intensity target 
heart rate (Fig. 2) are indicative of adaptations in cardiac stroke 
volume, which commonly result from endurance training [32]. 
These improvements were accompanied by a marginal (non- 
significant) increase in peak V˙ O2, which in conjunction with 
enhanced pedalling efficiency, probably account for the

increase in peak power output observed in the exercise group. 
In contrast, AT was unchanged, suggesting metabolic adapta- 
tions influencing oxygen utilisation within active skeletal mus- 
cles were negligible. In the exercise group, the ability of skeletal 
muscle to utilise additional oxygen resulting from enhanced 
delivery may have been compromised to a greater degree be- 
cause a higher proportion of participants had undergone neoad- 
juvant chemotherapy (33 versus 17% in the control group). 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was previously shown to ad- 
versely affect skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phos- 
phorylation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, 
probably influencing the reported decline in peak V˙ O2 and 
AT prior to surgery [33]. Furthermore, cisplatin (commonly 
used in neoadjuvant chemotherapy) causes skeletal muscle 
atrophy and alterations in metabolic signalling pathways that 
were only partially reversed by exercise training in healthy 
mice [34]. As improvements in AT following endurance train- 
ing are strongly influenced by adaptations in metabolic path- 
ways that enhance fat utilisation and oxidative ATP produc- 
tion [32], a higher volume of pre-operative exercise and/or 
longer period of recovery may be needed to overcome the 
adverse effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal mus- 
cle mitochondria and signalling pathways prior to RC. In this 
respect, a 6-week programme of thrice-weekly cycle ergome- 
ter interval training was needed to restore AT to pre- 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy levels in patients with locally ad- 
vanced rectal cancer [35]. Hence, programmes which offer 
additional weekly sessions might be needed to enhance the 
stimulus for metabolic adaptations in patients who have un- 
dergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Systematic reviews support the positive impact of pre- 
operative exercise on post-operative recovery outcomes in 
patients undergoing cardiac and abdominal surgery but there 
has been significant heterogeneity in study design and a pau- 
city of high quality studies [36, 37]. Our results are to be 
considered with caution as adequately powered clinical trials 
are needed to establish whether improvements in pre- 
operative cardiopulmonary fitness are associated with en- 
hanced recovery following RC. Nevertheless, these prelimi- 
nary data show marginal (non-significant) differences in fa- 
vour of the exercise group in post-operative Clavien-Dindo 
score (≥ 1) and need for HDU inotropic support. It has been 
proposed that pre-operative exercise has the potential to im- 
prove physiological reserve, thereby helping to counter the 
physical challenges of surgery and enhancing post-operative 
recuperation [4]. However, the magnitude of change neces- 
sary to positively influence surgical outcomes is unclear, and 
previous research suggests that improvements of 2– 
3 ml kg−1 min−1 in pre-operative peak V˙ O2 following exercise 
programmes [8, 9] might not translate into quality of life en- 
hancements in lung cancer patients before or after surgery 
[10]. Other exercise prehabilitation studies in lung, colorectal 
and bladder cancer patients have not reported changes in car- 
diopulmonary fitness following exercise prehabilitation 
programmes that resulted in improvements [12] or no im- 
provements [16–19] in post-operative recovery outcomes. 
Observational studies suggest that an AT of less than 11– 
12 ml kg−1 min−1 is associated with major post-operative com- 
plications (Clavien Class ≥ 3) and poorer recovery outcomes 
(including hospital length of stay) in bladder cancer patients 
undergoing RC [2, 38], and this is consistent with evidence 
from a large-scale study of patients (N = 843) undergoing 
intra-abdominal surgery [39]. AT was > 11 ml kg−1 min−1 in 
> 50% of our participants prior to surgery, and when our data 
were pooled and considered independent of group assign- 
ment, higher scores for pre-operative peak V˙ O2, peak V˙ E, 
peak power output and AT were associated with improved 
recovery outcomes (Table 3). This raises the question of 
whether cardiopulmonary fitness gains that fail to reach a 
given AT or peak V˙ O2 threshold could positively influence 
post-operative recovery outcomes in this patient group. In 
addition, the relative importance of cardiopulmonary fitness 
versus other factors in optimising post-operative recovery, e.g. 
adequate nutrition and mental preparation [4], is an important 
avenue for future research. 
This study had some limitations. The sample size was in- 
sufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of 
improved pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness on post- 
operative recovery outcomes, and we have no data on the 
long-term maintenance of intervention effects. Furthermore, 
because we aimed to be as inclusive as possible, broad vari- 
ability in participant characteristics at baseline (comorbidities, 
physical fitness levels, etc.) and differences in the number of 
exercise sessions attended are likely to have had some bearing 
on the results. In addition, the mean age of our sample popu- 
lation (> 70 years) and recruitment of patients from a single 
centre serving a large rural community may limit the general- 
isation of our results. Regarding the latter, our recruitment rate 
and reasons for non-participation may be less representative of 
patients living closer to treating hospitals. Travel distance to 
the exercise facility was cited as the main reason for non- 
participation in the study but this is likely to be less of an issue 
in patients living in closer proximity. Nevertheless, other rea- 
sons (including physical limitations or a lack of confidence to 
engage in the exercise programme) prevented > 26% of eligi- 
ble patients from taking part. This suggests that a programme 
of hospital supervised vigorous intensity aerobic interval ex- 
ercise is unlikely to be feasible for all bladder cancer patients. 
For this reason, other forms of pre-operative exercise, partic- 
ularly exercise that can be undertaken in the home or commu- 
nity environment, should be evaluated in future research.
