Background: Patients with low fitness as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) have 
higher mortality and morbidity after surgery. Preoperative exercise intervention, or prehabilitation, has 
been suggested as a method to improve CPET values and outcomes. This trial sought to assess the 
capacity of a 4-week supervised exercise programme to improve fitness before liver resection for colorectal 
liver metastasis. 
Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of a 4-week (12 sessions) high-intensity 
cycle, interval training programme in patients undergoing elective liver resection for colorectal liver 
metastases. The primary endpoint was oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold. Secondary endpoints 
included other CPET values and preoperative quality of life (QoL) assessed using the SF-36®. 
Results: Thirty-eight patients were randomized (20 to prehabilitation, 18 to standard care), and 35 (25 
men and 10 women) completed both preoperative assessments and were analysed. The median age was 
62 (i.q.r. 54–69) years, and there were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. 
Prehabilitation led to improvements in preoperative oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (+1⋅5 (95 per 
cent c.i. 0⋅2 to 2⋅9) ml per kg per min) and peak exercise (+2⋅0 (0⋅0 to 4⋅0) ml per kg per min). The oxygen 
pulse (oxygen uptake per heart beat) at the anaerobic threshold improved (+0⋅9 (0⋅0 to 1⋅8) ml/beat), and 
a higher peak work rate (+13 (4 to 22) W) was achieved. This was associated with improved preoperative 
QoL, with the overall SF-36® score increasing by 11 (95 per cent c.i. 1 to 21) (P = 0⋅028) and the overall 
SF-36® mental health score by 11 (1 to 22) (P = 0⋅037). 
Conclusion: A 4-week prehabilitation programme can deliver improvements in CPET scores and QoL 
before liver resection. This may impact on perioperative outcome. Registration number: NCT01523353 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov). 




Patients with lower oxygen uptake (V O2) at the anaer- 
obic threshold (AT), as assessed by cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing (CPET), have higher mortality, higher 
morbidity and longer hospital stay when undergoing 
major surgery1,2. In patients with cancer, postoperative 
rehabilitative exercise therapy improves physical func- 
tion, peak oxygen consumption and quality of life (QoL). 
There are, however, limitations. Following surgery, indi- 
viduals may be fatigued, worried about the effects of 
exercise on the healing process, or anxious while awaiting 
adjuvant treatments3. Postoperative rehabilitation also 
fails to add any of the benefits of exercise therapy to the 
immediate perioperative period4. Preoperative exercise 
intervention, or prehabilitation, has been proposed as 
a more timely intervention in a patient’s management 
pathway, as it may bring the benefits of exercise therapy 
to bear on the intended operative intervention4,5. The use 
of prehabilitation in addition to rehabilitation has been 
shown to increase preoperative walking capacity and to aid 
functional recovery following colorectal resection6. 
Currently no randomized study of prehabilitation has 
delivered improved fitness, as measured objectively with

CPET, in a cancer population. The largest randomized 
trial of prehabilitation to date failed to demonstrate an 
advantage of a home-based exercise programme over a con- 
trol arm of walking and breathing exercises5. A number of 
non-randomized studies7– 9 have demonstrated that super- 
vised exercise programmes, typically of 6 weeks or more, 
could deliver clinically relevant improvements in fitness. 
However, this delay is not always feasible when treating 
malignant disease. This randomized clinical trial sought 
to assess the feasibility of a 4-week supervised preopera- 
tive exercise programme in patients awaiting surgery for 
colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), assessing the impact 
on preoperative fitness, QoL, perioperative outcomes and 
subsequent postoperative course. 

This was a randomized clinical trial conducted with ethical 
approval from the UK Research Ethics Service (Integrated 
Research Application System ID: 65982), and registered on 
Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01523353). 

All patients with CRLM referred to the tertiary hepato- 
biliary service at Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, 
UK, were screened for potential eligibility. Patients with 
resectable CRLM were eligible for recruitment if aged 
over 18 years, able to give informed consent, partake 
in cycle-based exercise, and complete the exercise pro- 
gramme before the proposed surgery date. Resectability 
was defined in the multidisciplinary meeting at the tertiary 
hepatobiliary centre as: metastases deemed surgically treat- 
able with curative intent (either 1- or 2-stage resection). 
Patients were ineligible for recruitment if they had known 
pre-existing chronic liver disease. 
Potentially eligible candidates were given details of the 
study at the first clinic attendance, but were invited to 
participate only once a decision to proceed to surgery had 
been made, and full informed consent obtained. Ethical 
approval stipulated that recruitment to the study must not 
result in delayed surgical care. Consequently patients were 
potentially eligible only when the provisional operative 
date allowed at least 4 weeks for prehabilitation. 

Candidates were randomized to either a prehabilitation 
exercise programme or standard care by means of a random 
number block randomization list created at the trial outset. 
An individual, independent of the study group, held this 
list and provided e-mail results of randomization following 
recruitment. 

Prehabilitation consisted of 12 interval exercise sessions 
over a 4-week period. The programme was developed 
within an exercise laboratory, and validated in a healthy 
population10. Two recovery exercise sessions were included 
at the end of the first and fourth weeks (sessions 3 
and 12). The interval sessions included a warm-up and 
warm-down, and 30 min of interval training alternating 
between exercise of moderate (less than 60 per cent V O2 
at peak exercise) and vigorous (more than 90 per cent V O2 
at peak) intensity11. The sessions were delivered using 
a cycle ergometer (Optibike; Ergoline, Bitz, Germany). 
The exercise programme was personalized to candidates 
following a standardized equation based on the work 
rate at their anaerobic threshold on baseline CPET. No 
restrictions were placed on candidates in either arm of the 
study, and they were encouraged to follow clinical advice 
on exercise before surgery. 

The methodology for performing CPET has been 
described previously12. Clinical physiologists performed 
the tests. Patients were asked to continue their normal 
medication before the test. CPET was performed on an 
electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 
200; Ergoline). The protocol consisted of 3 min of rest, 
followed by 3 min of freewheel pedalling, then a ramped, 
incremental protocol until volitional termination. This 
was followed by 5 min of recovery. Ventilation and gas 
exchange variables were measured using a metabolic cart 
(Geratherm Respiratory; Love Medical, Manchester, UK). 
Pulse rate, 12-lead ECG, non-invasive BP and pulse 
oximetry were monitored throughout. The exercise ramp 
gradient was set to 10–25 W per min, based on a calcula- 
tion described by Wasserman et al.13 using predicted V O2 
at unloaded pedalling, predicted V O2 at peak exercise, 
height and patient age. 
CPET-derived variables included V O2 at AT (ml per kg 
per min), V O2 at peak (ml per kg per min), V E/V CO2 (pul- 
monary ventilation during exercise/carbon dioxide out- 
put) at AT, absolute oxygen uptake at AT (V O2 at AT 
(l/min)), absolute oxygen uptake at peak exercise (V O2 at 
peak (l/min)), heart rate at AT (beats/min) and heart rate at 
peak (beats/min). These variables were defined as described 
by Wasserman and colleagues13. 
The AT was estimated using a conventional cluster of 
variables (breakpoint in the V CO2 –V O2 relationship) with 
increases in the ventilatory equivalent of oxygen (V E/V O2) 
and end-tidal oxygen tension, but no increase in V E/V CO2 
or fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension. V O2 at peak 
was taken as the highest V O2 attained over a 30-s average.

Evaluation of AT was undertaken independently by two 
experienced assessors, blinded to each other’s assessments, 
with disagreement resolved by a third assessor. 
Patients were considered high-risk if their baseline V O2 
at AT was less than 11 ml per kg per min. High-risk patients 
were admitted routinely to critical care after surgery, and 
had increased intraoperative monitoring and support14 . 
preoperative QoL score, assessed using the Short Form 
36 (SF-36®; QualityMetric, Lincoln, Rhode Island, USA) 
questionnaire15. Data were also collected on operative 
intervention, perioperative outcomes and subsequent post- 
operative progress. The study was not statistically powered 
for formal assessment of differences in perioperative or 
long-term outcome, and these data are descriptive. 

The primary aim of the study was to improve preoperative 
V O2 at the AT by 1⋅5 ml per kg per min. This was consid- 
ered achievable and clinically relevant. If delivered across 
a patient population14, it could reduce the proportion of 
patients considered high-risk (V O2 at AT of less than 11 ml 
per kg per min) by 30 per cent. 

Clinicians providing care were blinded to the intervention 
received by patients, and to the results of all but the baseline 
CPET values. This blinding included anaesthetists, sur- 
geons, ward staff and staff reporting the CPET results. 


Secondary outcome measures included changes in the 
other preoperative CPET measures, and changes in the

15 pairs of subjects were required. Assuming an attrition 
rate of 25 per cent9, a total recruitment of 38 patients 
was required. 

Continuous normally distributed data were analysed using 
a t test, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for con- 
tinuous data with a non-normal distribution. Categorical 
data were analysed with the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test, 
as appropriate. All statistical tests were conducted using 
SPSS® version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). 

The first candidate was recruited in August 2011, and the 
trial closed in February 2013, when planned recruitment 
was achieved. Of 193 consecutive patients assessed for 
eligibility, 115 were deemed potentially eligible. Some 104 
patients were approached, of whom 38 agreed to partici- 
pate and were randomized. One of the commonest reasons 
for ineligibility (38 patients) or failure to recruit (7)

before the second assessment. One patient in the pre- 
habilitation arm developed an unrelated malignancy and 
underwent emergency surgery. One patient withdrew 
from the standard care arm upon hearing the results of 
randomization, as this patient wished to participate only 
if randomized to the exercise programme. Of patients 
within the exercise arm, 18 of 19 completed 100 per 
cent of the exercise sessions, with one patient missing 
two sessions whilst having emergency colonic stenting 
for an obstructing primary tumour. Of the 35 patients 
(25 men and 10 women) who completed both CPET

patient was found to have advanced extrahepatic dis- 
ease during investigation for abdominal pain, and did 
not proceed to surgery. This patient was included in 
analysis of the prehabilitation effect but excluded from 
the operative intervention analysis. Of 34 patients who 
had surgery, five underwent laparotomy without liver 
resection because of the intraoperative identification of 
unresectable disease. This comprised three patients with 
peritoneal metastases, one patient with multiple additional 
hepatic metastases, and one with chemotherapy-induced 
liver injury that precluded extended resection. There 
the exercise 
were no reported adverse outcomes of 
intervention. 

Prehabilitation led to an improvement in V O2 at AT of 
1⋅5 ml per kg per min (P = 0⋅023), as well as an improve- 
ment in V O2 at peak (2⋅0 ml per kg per min) (P = 0⋅047), 
oxygen pulse at AT (0⋅9 ml/beat) (P = 0⋅050) and a higher 
peak work rate (13 W) (P = 0⋅005) compared with values in 
the standard care arm (Table 2). 
Within the prehabilitation arm there were significant 
improvements in a number of CPET variables, includ- 
ing V O2 at peak, heart rate reserve and oxygen pulse at 
AT (Table 2). By comparison, there were no significant 
improvements within the standard care arm. No patient 
in the standard care arm had a significant improvement in 
V O2 at AT, and four had a deterioration in excess of 1⋅5 ml 
per kg per min. Overall, there was a non-significant trend 
towards worse V O2 at AT (P = 0⋅088). 

Changes in the preoperative QoL measures are summa- 
rized in Table 2 and Fig. 2. Within the prehabilitation arm 
there were significant improvements in the SF-36® scores, 
but not in the standard care arm. 
When the study arms were compared, prehabilitation 
was associated with improvements in overall SF-36® QoL 
(+11, 95 per cent c.i. 1 to 21; P = 0⋅028) and SF-36® mental 
health (+11, 1 to 22; P = 0⋅037) scores. There was also a 
trend toward greater SF-36® physical health (+8, −1 to 
16; P = 0⋅102). 

A subgroup analysis of patients deemed high-risk on base- 
line CPET demonstrated similar results to those for the 
overall cohort (Table 3). Mean V O2 at AT in the prehabili- 
tation arm improved by 2⋅3 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅3 to 4⋅2) ml 
per kg per min (P = 0⋅029), so that the mean V O2 at AT was 
above the 11⋅0 ml per kg per min threshold considered to 
indicate high risk. Of the nine patients defined as high-risk 
at baseline, five were no longer considered to be so. 
Trends towards improvement that approached statistical 
significance were seen for several other measures following

interventions and perioperative outcomes are 
Surgical 
summarized in Table 4; there was no statistically significant 
difference in any postoperative outcomes between the 
two arms. Complications are summarized in Table S1 
(supporting information). Again, there were no significant 
differences in complication types between study arms. 

This randomized study demonstrates that a short preop- 
erative prehabilitation programme can deliver consider- 
able improvements in preoperative CPET scores. Better 
CPET-derived variables are associated with lower mor- 
bidity, mortality and hospital stay after major abdominal 
surgery2. Although the impact of improved CPET scores 
on operative morbidity and mortality has yet to be demon- 
strated, this study suggests that patients deemed high-risk14 
for major abdominal surgery may be able to modulate their 
risk by means of prehabilitation. 
The prehabilitation programme achieved its primary 
objective of a 1⋅5-ml per kg per min improvement in 
V O2 at AT, in comparison with standard care. This is 
an important achievement given the failures of previous 
attempts to deliver this result within a similar time 
interval5. Patients of poorer fitness, deemed high-risk on 
baseline assessment, had considerable gains in V O2 at AT. 
This suggests that these patients may have more to benefit 
from prehabilitation, certainly if the operative risk can 
be brought into line with the patients of higher baseline 
V O2 at AT. Within the prehabilitation arm, a number 
of measures of preoperative fitness seen as potentially 
relevant to predicting outcome16 also improved. 
An unexpected finding was the marked deterioration 
in some patients randomized to standard care. Crucially, 
this raises the question about timing of any preoperative 
CPET. Many studies of CPET fail to report on the timing 
of the test in relation to surgery1,2 . CPET 4 weeks before 
surgery that suggests a patient is low-risk may in fact be 
inaccurate by the time of operation, representing a major 
confound to the literature. 
The variation in response to the standard exercise pro- 
gramme is interesting and in keeping with the theory of 
‘responder/non-responder’ based on genetic markers17. 
This variation in response to a prehabilitation programme 
means that 
to justify delaying surgical 
intervention. Future work should focus on identifying 
individuals in whom benefit is likely to be greatest, so that 
more resources can be dedicated to their prehabilitation. 


The greatest benefit would be expected in V O2 
responders, although absence of a V O2 response may 
not represent a failure of delivering benefit. In the 
prehabilitation arm, nearly 40 per cent of patients

responded to the exercise programme in terms of increas- 
ing V O2 at AT; however, it may be that the programme 
prevented the ‘non-responders’ 
from deteriorating as 
seen in the standard care group. The prehabilitation pro- 
gramme may have delivered other established exercise 
benefits, including improved muscle bulk, insulin resis- 
tance and preoperative psychological status, which could 
all contribute to an improved outcome18– 20. 
Most of the improvement in QoL was the result of 
improvements in mental health, particularly emotional and 
social functioning, in concordance with other studies of 
exercise in patients with cancer21. It is, however, interest- 
ing that a 4-week programme of just 12 sessions was able 
to achieve similar improvements to programmes typically 
of much longer duration22. The improvements in QoL 
are probably related to participation in the exercise pro- 
gramme, rather than improved physical function. In the 
control arm, in comparison to the deterioration in CPET 
values, QoL values were largely unchanged, suggesting that 
QoL was independent of physical fitness. This suggests that 
improvements in physical fitness do not necessarily cor- 
relate with improved QoL, although participation in the 
exercise programme itself seemed to be key. This is simi- 
lar to previous findings, although the mechanism for this 
improvement is not clear23. 
Study completion and attendance was high in comparison 
to that in other studies5,9. The high adherence suggests that 
the exercise intervention is acceptable, and that patients in 
the study cohort were highly motivated. This is likely mul- 
tifactorial, including the supervised nature of the exercise 
and the interval-based nature of the training programme, 
with interval training shown to be more enjoyable than 
constant load programmes24. 
The results of this study offer an interesting avenue for 
future development, but some limitations must be consid- 
ered. Importantly, although the study demonstrates that it 
is possible to deliver major improvements in CPET val- 
ues, and it would appear logical to assume this will deliver 
the benefits associated with improved fitness1,2, confirma- 
tion is required in a larger trial. A potential recruitment 
bias may limit generalizability to the wider population. The 
study cohort was younger than a typical patient group, 
suggesting that a preoperative exercise intervention may 
be more appealing to the younger patient population14. 
However, younger patients often have more aggressive 
disease25, which may explain the rate of failure to progress 
to liver resection. 
This study focused on improving the aerobic capacity 
of patients. However, a number of other patient factors, 
including nutritional status, conditioning and physiological 
status, can also affect outcome26– 28. Some studies6,29 have 
examined a multimodal prehabilitation programme. Utiliz- 
ing the 6-min walk test (6MWT), these have consistently 
demonstrated an advantage over control arms in improving 
functional capacity. More recently, a pilot study30 showed 
that the addition of whey supplementation to a nutrition- 
ally controlled diet can lead to improved 6MWT capacity. 
The optimal components of prehabilitation and rehabilita- 
tion programmes are yet to be established. 
Prehabilitation offers an opportunity to improve preop- 
erative education that is a key pillar of enhanced recov- 
ery after surgery (ERAS)26. The additional time spent 
with patients during the exercise programme provides an 
opportunity for education, which can reduce preoperative 
anxiety, improving postoperative gut motility and wound 
healing26– 28. The benefits of improved fitness, alongside 
the potential benefits of increased preoperative education, 
are consistent with the goals and mechanisms underpin- 
ning ERAS programmes, and warrant evaluation in a larger 
randomized study.
