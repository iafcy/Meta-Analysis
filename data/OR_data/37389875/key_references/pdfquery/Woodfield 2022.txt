Purpose: Improving cardiopulmonary reserve, or peak oxygen consumption( 
O2peak), may reduce postoperative complications; however, this may be difficult to 
achieve between diagnosis and surgery. Our primary aim was to assess the efficacy 
of an approximate 14- session, preoperative high- intensity interval training(HIIT) 
̇ 
V O 2peak by a clinically relevant 2 ml·kg−1·min−1. Our sec- 

ondary aim was to document clinical outcomes. 
Methodology: In this prospective study, participants aged 45– 85 undergoing 
major abdominal surgery were randomized to standard care or 14 sessions of 



max heart rate at least once during the session) and low/moderate- intensity cy- 
̇ 
V O2peak 
from baseline to surgery. Clinical outcomes included postoperative complica- 
tions, length of stay(LOS), and Short Form 36 quality of life questionnaire(SF- 36). 
Results: Of 63 participants, 46 completed both CPETs and 50 completed clinical

follow- up. There was a significant improvement in the HIIT group's mean ± SD 
O2peak (HIIT 2.87 ± 1.94 ml·kg1·min−1 vs standard care 0.15 ± 1.93, with an overall 
difference of 2.73 ml·kg1·min−1 95%CI [1.53, 3.93] p < 0.001). There were no sta- 
tistically significant differences between groups for clinical outcomes, although 
the observed differences consistently favored the exercise group. This was most 
notable for total number of complications (0.64 v 1.16 per patient, p = 0.07), SF- 
36 physical component score (p = 0.06), and LOS (mean 5.5 v 7.4 days, p = 0.07).

Postoperative complications are common after major ab- 
dominal surgery, occurring in up to 40% of patients.1,2 
Unfortunately, important risk factors, such as the number 
of pre- existing comorbidities, the extent of the underlying 
pathology, and the magnitude of the required operation, 
cannot be changed prior to surgery. Most modifiable risk 
factors, such as smoking cessation3 and optimizing spe- 
cific medical problems, will improve the outcome in only 
a subset of patients. Cardiopulmonary fitness is the one 
modifiable risk factor that it may be possible to improve 
in a larger proportion of patients, by the introduction of 
preoperative aerobic exercise training. A peak oxygen 
̇ 
V O2peak) below 18.6 mL·kg−1·min−1 4 or an 
consumption ( 
anaerobic threshold (AT) of <10– 11 ml·kg−1·min−1 4– 6 is 
associated with significantly higher rates of postoperative 
complications. High- intensity interval training (HIIT) and 
moderate- intensity continuous training (MICT) are the 
most common methods of improving cardiopulmonary 
fitness. Studies in clinical populations have shown that 
HIIT results in substantial5 and rapid6,7 improvement in 
̇ 
V O2peak and is safe in those with coronary artery disease 
and cardiac failure.7 HIIT is also appealing for preoper- 
ative patients because rapid improvement is important 
where there is a limited period of time between diagnosis 
and surgery. 
There is an increasing body of evidence indicating that 
preoperative aerobic exercise can improve peak oxygen 
consumption. We identified eleven studies that document 
the impact of preoperative aerobic exercise on either peak 
oxygen consumption or AT in a four to six- week period 
before surgery.8– 18 All studies were conducted in patients 
undergoing major abdominal or thoracic procedures. All 
except two14,16 demonstrated an improvement in oxygen 
consumption. All but one18 had a small sample size, with 
26 or fewer patients being exercised. Only four studies 
were randomized,10,11,16,18 and only one was designed to 
prospectively assess postoperative complications.18 Of the 
three studies that based their exercise program around the 
principles of HIIT,8,11,16 two showed a significant improve- 
̇ 
V O 2peak of at least 2.0 ml·kg−1·min−1,8,11 while 
ment in 
̇ 
V O 2peak.16 In this context, we 
one showed no change in 
believe that further well- designed randomized studies 
are required to confirm the extent of the impact of preop- 
erative HIIT on oxygen consumption and the volume of 
̇ 
V O2peak. An important practical 
HIIT required to increase 
question is whether HIIT can be used to benefit the large 
number of major abdominal surgery patients whose time 
between diagnosis and surgery is brief (e.g., 4 weeks). 
In terms of complications, although we know that fit- 
ter patients do better,4,19,20 there are conflicting results in 
the literature when assessing the impact that improving 

preoperative cardiopulmonary fitness has on postoper- 
ative complications.21 While some studies suggest that 
prehabilitation could reduce hospital stay22,23 and the risk 
of specific complications such as chest infection,22 the re- 
sults of most reviews have been equivocal.24 However, two 
recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs),18,25 powered 
to assess complications, have demonstrated a statistically 
significant and clinically important reduction of compli- 
cations after 6 weeks preoperative exercise. While these 
strengthen the evidence for prehabilitation to reduce com- 
plications, patients often have less than 6 weeks between 
diagnosis and surgery due to the urgency of required 
surgery. 
In an effort to understand whether a short course of 
exercise “prehabilitation” can provide the benefits demon- 
strated in longer exercise interventions, this RCT compares 
a 4 weeks exercise program using HIIT against standard 
preoperative care for patients undergoing major abdom- 
inal surgery. The overarching objective of this study was 
to examine the impact of a focused, individualized HIIT 
exercise program over a 4 week period on both cardio- 
pulmonary fitness and postoperative clinical outcomes. 
The primary hypothesis was that an individualized and 
supervised preoperative HIIT program would result in a 
̇ 
V O2peak of 2 mL·kg−1·min−1 
clinically relevant increase in 
when compared to standard care.8,11 The secondary hy- 
pothesis was that a HIIT program that delivers a clinically 
significant increase in cardiopulmonary fitness would 
also result in an improvement in clinical outcomes. 


We performed a single center, two arm, parallel, pro- 
spective RCT comparing an exercise program using 
HIIT against standard preoperative care for patients un- 
dergoing major abdominal surgery. The study was ap- 
proved by the Southern Health and Disability Ethics 
Committee (reference number 15/STH/116) and was 
registered with the Australasian Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12617000587303). An overview of the study de- 
sign is presented in Figure 1 and in our protocol paper.26 
The inclusion criteria were patients aged 45– 85 undergo- 
ing major abdominal surgery, who lived close enough to 
the hospital to attend multiple exercise sessions. Major 
abdominal surgery included a procedure expected to last 
two hours, or with an anticipated blood loss of greater 
than 500ml.27 This included gastrointestinal resections, 
liver surgery, large abdominal wall hernia repair, abdomi- 
nal aortic aneurysm repair, hysterectomy, radical pros- 
tatectomy, cystectomy, and nephrectomy. The exclusion 
criteria were as follows: (A) Inability to perform a CPET 
or a contraindication to exercise found on CPET, such as 

 
 


an arrhythmia or ST segment changes. (B) Medical con- 
ditions where exercise may contribute to adverse events. 
These included symptomatic angina, a myocardial infarc- 
tion in the last three months, and uncontrolled cardiac ar- 
rhythmia. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease 
with no symptomatic angina or with successful revascu- 
larization were included. Other medical contraindica- 
tions included uncontrolled hypertension (BP>180/100), 
aortic aneurysm >6.5 cm, and severe obstructive pulmo- 
nary disease with a FEV1<1.0 liters. (C) Receiving medi- 
cal therapy which could change oxygen consumption at 
the same time as the proposed exercise program. This 
included treatment of anemia and receiving neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. (D) Inability to follow 
instructions or to provide consent. 
Potentially eligible patients were interviewed by a re- 
search nurse and assessed by the study anesthetist. After 
consent, CPET was performed on a stationary cycle er- 
gometer (Quark Ergoline). The CPET protocol has been 
previously published.26 Tests were terminated when the 
participant achieved a maximal effort or for medical rea- 
sons.28 Evidence of a maximal effort test included a respi- 
̇ 
V 
ratory exchange ratio (RER) of ≥1.1 or a plateau in the 
̇ 
V O2peak, resting and maxi- 
O2 with increasing workload. 
mal heart rate (HRmax), maximal workload in Watts, and 
the workload required to elicit 60% and 90% HRmax were 
recorded. A cardiologist checked the electrocardiogram 
results. Randomization was performed using a computer- 
generated sequence of numbers kept in sealed envelopes 
that were sequentially opened. The randomization ratio 
was 1:1 for the first 40 participants. This was changed to 2 
for standard care and 1 for HIIT for the remainder of the 
study (due to lack of adherence in attending the second 
CPET in the control group).26

For those randomized to exercise, the protocol in- 
cluded 14 sessions of HIIT over 4 weeks. Each session 
included approximately 30 min of stationary cycling 
on a cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 828E) under 
the supervision of an exercise physiologist. The ses- 
sion began with 5 min of warm- up cycling, followed by 
20 min of interval training and 5 min of pedaling against 
a light load. The interval training was based around ten 
1 min intervals of high- intensity cycling against a high 
resistance with the objective of reaching 90% HRmax 
(determined via CPET) at least once during the session. 
Intense intervals were alternated with 1 min intervals 
of active rest, defined as cycling against minimal resis- 
tance at ≥60% HRmax. The duration of intense training 
did not exceed 10 min. Once 90% HRmax was achieved, 
we aimed to achieve this target in as many intense inter- 
vals as possible, and in sustaining this for a longer pro- 
portion of the interval. Individualization of the protocol 
included increasing the training load or the duration of 
intense intervals, with the aim of achieving five 2 min 
intervals followed by 1– 2 min of lower intensity cycling. 
Individualization also included the ability to start with 
shorter periods of intense exercise in those with medical 
comorbidities. Participants on beta blockers had pulse 
and level of perceived exertion monitored using the 6– 20 
Borg scale.29 Patient heart rate was recorded using Polar 
heart rate monitors. Standard care for all participants in- 
cluded anesthetic preassessment, hospital orientation to 
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) targets,30 treat- 
ment of identified medical problems, advice on stopping 
smoking and reducing alcohol consumption, and advice 
on healthy living, including diet and being encour- 
aged to exercise more before surgery. An independent 
safety monitoring committee, including an anesthetist, 
surgeon, and cardiologist, independently reviewed the 
study protocols and any adverse events. 
The primary outcome was change in 
̇ 
V O2peak, defined 
as the highest oxygen consumption measured over a 20 s 
interval during the CPET.31 Secondary physiological out- 
comes included peak work rate and AT. Adherence was 
determined by the number of HIIT sessions attended, and 
the number of sessions where a target HR of >90% HRmax 
was reached. As we were unable to perform a study large 
enough to use complications as our primary outcome, we 
included a range of clinical outcomes as secondary end- 
points to assess their relationship to HIIT training. Length 
of stay was the number of postoperative days in hospi- 
tal, with day zero being the day of surgery. Postoperative 
complications, using standard definitions,32,33 were doc- 
umented in hospital and up to 6 weeks after discharge. 
In- hospital complications were prospectively identified 
in the ward, and a validated questionnaire34 was sent 
6 weeks later to identify complications that developed after 

discharge from hospital. We also collected data using three 
postoperative surveys. The postoperative morbidity survey 
(POMS), which assesses postoperative adverse events in 
nine different domains according to predefined criteria,35 
was performed on postoperative day 5. The surgical recov- 
ery scale (SRS), which assesses 13 items including energy 
levels, feeling of fatigue, and a number of practical phys- 
ical activities36 was performed on postoperative day five 
and 6 weeks after surgery. Quality of life (QoL) was mea- 
sured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF- 36).37 
This documented the impact of HIIT on the patients’ QoL 
and enabled us to assess differences in physical function 
(PCS score) after surgery. QoL was documented on four 
occasions: at randomization, before surgery, 6 weeks 
after surgery, and 12 weeks after surgery. With respect 
to blinding, although the exercise physiologist was not 
blinded, two researchers always performed the CPET. The 
assessor of the clinical endpoints was blinded to the group 
the participant was in. 
For patient demographics, mean and standard de- 
viation were used for normally distributed continuous 
variables, median and interquartile range for other contin- 
̇ 
V O2peak between 
uous variables. Differences in changes of 
groups were compared using linear mixed model analysis 
and the Student's t- test. For secondary endpoints, differ- 
ences in the number of postoperative complications and 
in the number of POMS events per person were compared 
using the Wilcoxon rank- sum tests. Differences in the 
number of patients with a postoperative complication and 
an identified POMS event were compared using Pearson's 
chi- squared tests. Differences in the length of stay were 
compared using the Student's t- test. Differences between 
groups were also compared using appropriate models de- 
pending on the categorical or continuous nature of the 
endpoint and the distribution of the data. These adjusted 
for age, operative severity, and ASA score. For endpoints 
recorded on more than one occasion (the SF- 36 and the 
surgical recovery scale scores), linear mixed models were 
used to give an overall comparison between groups. An 
analysis was also performed for individual time points, 
comparing the change in score from baseline between 
groups with the Student's t- test using Bonferroni correc- 
tions. Both per- protocol (PP) and intention- to- treat (ITT) 
analyses were performed, with PP being the main planned 
analysis.26 Statistical analysis was performed using R 
4.0.2,38 and significance was determined by two- sided 
p < 0.05. In order to provide 80% power to detect a differ- 
̇ 
ence of 2 ml·kg−1·min−1 in the change in 
V O2peak between 
groups, using a two- sided test at the 0.05 level, a sample 
size of 20 participants per group was required. Based on 
a dropout rate of 1 in 3, we aimed to enroll 60 patients.

cal modeling, regression analyses, sample size calculation, 

 
 


and our ITT results are presented in the Supplemental 
Digital Content. 


Sixty- three patients were enrolled between September 
2015 and February 2019. This included 30% of those con- 
tacted. Reasons for non- enrollment are outlined in the 
Supplemental Digital Content p1, Patient Recruitment. 
Participants randomized into the exercise and control 
groups were not different with respect to age, sex, smok- 
ing status, ASA score, medical comorbidities, medications, 
and the type of surgery performed (Table 1). Drop out 
after randomization (Table 2) ranged from 19% to 32% for 
different endpoints. Of those randomized to exercise, 75% 
(21/28) completed the exercise program. Reasons for with- 
drawal included acute respiratory infection, chest pain in 
the initial exercise session, anxiety, discomfort sitting on a 
bike seat because of previous surgery, and competing time 
commitments. In the control group, five patients did not 
attend their second CPET, two withdrew as “there was 
no point being in the study if they were not exercised,” 
and three patients set up their own well- designed aerobic 
exercise programs. These three patients were included in 
the ITT, but not the PP analysis. Two adverse events were 
documented: a new arrhythmia diagnosed during the ini- 
tial CPET and an episode of chest pain during HIIT. Both 
events resolved on stopping the intervention without ad- 
ditional sequel. 
For those who completed the exercise program, adher- 
ence for attending exercise sessions was 85% (on average 
participants completed 12 of their 14 sessions). The main 
reason for not completing 14 sessions was limited time 
before surgery. Adherence to reaching 90% HR max at 
least once during an exercise session was 97.5%. On aver- 
age, participants trained 3.7 times a week and performed 
8 min of intense exercise per session, resulting in approx- 
imately 100 min of intense exercise throughout the exer- 
cise program.

provide evidence that supports further and larger studies 
on the effect of preoperative HIIT on clinical outcomes.

was an improvement in PCS, the difference was greatest 
6 weeks after surgery (p = 0.015, see supplemental digital 
content Table S2) due to the decrease in PCS being greater 
in the control group than in the exercise group. By three 
months after surgery, both groups were similar to their 
baseline.

the supplement. Tables S1– S2 pp 3– 4 present the PP re-

This RCT confirms that preoperative HIIT increases aer- 
obic capacity. Novel findings are that these benefits are 
realized after a brief training program (average 12 ses- 
sions) that can be achieved in the short time period (aver- 
age 3.7 sessions a week) before surgery. This study was 
not powered to detect changes in postoperative outcomes; 
however, the observed differences in several outcomes, in- 
cluding length of stay and the number of complications, 
were numerically lower in the exercise groups (p < 0.1). If 
these findings are substantiated in larger RCTs, it would 
suggest that a brief, intense period of preoperative exer- 
cise, aimed at improving patient outcomes, should be 
considered as an addition to standard preoperative care 
before major abdominal surgery. 
Our 2.7 mL·kg−1·min−1 improvement in aerobic capac- 
ity with HIIT involved approximately 100 min of intense 
exercise. Participants were supervised and attained the 
target heart rate of 90% HRmax in >95% of the attended 
exercise sessions. This improvement is comparable with

with a total of 40 min of intense exercise, did not change 
̇ 
V O2peak. As many cancer patients do not have 6 weeks be- 
tween diagnosis and surgery, we needed to achieve a high- 
intensity training volume comparable to West et al.8 in a 
shorter period of time. Achieving approximately 100 min 
of high- intensity activity during their training period re- 
quired our participants to train an average of 3.7 times per 
week, rather than three sessions per week as described by 
others.4 An obvious criticism is that this exceeds, in an al- 
ready compromised cohort, the ACSM recommendation 
of three days per week of vigorous activity.39 We would 
note, however, that the program was well attended and 
tolerated by participants with minimal adverse events. 
We believe the observed differences in postoperative 
clinical outcomes between study groups should be inter- 
preted carefully. Our study was not powered to compare 
differences in clinical outcomes or their association with 
̇ 
V O 2peak. In this context, three observations 
changes in 
can be made. Firstly, for all clinical endpoints, preopera- 
tive HIIT was consistently associated with fewer adverse 
outcomes in the exercise group. Secondly, some of the 
non- significant differences were of a sufficient size, with 
p values <0.10, and of sufficient clinical relevance, to war- 
rant further investigation. These include the impact of 
HIIT on postoperative complications, quality of life, and 
length of stay. Finally, some of these improvements have 
recently been confirmed in two RCTs, which were appro- 
priately powered to identify differences in postoperative 
complications. A RCT of 124 patients undergoing abdom- 
inal aneurysm surgery demonstrated that a multi- modal 
moderate- intensity aerobic exercise program resulted 
in fewer patients with complications (41.9% v 22.6% 
(p = 0.021)) and a reduced median hospital stay from 8 
to 7 days (p = 0.025).18 Similarly, a RCT of 144 patients 
undergoing major abdominal surgery demonstrated that 
a multi- modal HIIT program resulted in fewer patients 
with complications (62% v 31% (p = 0.001)) and a reduced 
mean hospital stay from 13 to 8 days (p = 0.078).25 These 
results are consistent with the 45% mean reduction in the 
number of complications, and the one- day median reduc- 
tion of hospital stay in our study. 
While overall there was no significant difference in 
the PCS of the SF- 36 for all time periods combined, we 
were interested in assessing changes at individual time 
points because of their clinical relevance. The PCS score 
includes questions examining what you can physically do 
(Physical Function), your ability to accomplish different 
tasks (Physical Role), and your assessment of your health 
(General Health). When measured postoperatively, it 
therefore provides a good measurement of physical recov- 
ery from surgery. Our results at 6 weeks after surgery sug- 
gest that participants in the HIIT group recovered more 
rapidly. The ability of prehabilitation to improve the speed 
of physical recovery after surgery is an important clinical 
observation, both for patients and healthcare providers, 
which needs to be further assessed. 
Challenges in performing this RCT have been dis- 
cussed previously.26 There were difficulties randomiz- 
ing patients to standard care. As most patients enrolled 
because their imminent surgery and the study provided 
motivation to exercise, randomization to standard 
care came as a disappointment. This contributed to

withdrawals, poor protocol adherence, and not attend- 
ing the second CPET. For example, three participants 
initiated preoperative aerobic exercise programs that in- 
cluded (but were not limited to) training at a gymnasium 
or walking daily up a steep hill. This is the reason for 
the smaller difference between groups in the ITT anal- 
ysis. We would recommend that future studies provide 
alternative preoperative programs for the control group, 
such as strength and balance classes, walking programs, 
or breathing exercises. 
Limitations include the inability to blind patients. It 
is therefore possible that the psychological effect of being 
included in the exercise group contributed to differences 
in the quality of life scores. Another limitation is that our 
data do not provide a basis for how preoperative HIIT can 
be best applied to a complete surgical cohort, including 
less motivated and non- adherent patients. We did, how- 
ever, perform an analysis assessing if all enrolled patients, 
or a subset of surgical patients would benefit from HIIT. 
This found no evidence against the hypothesis that the 
benefits of preoperative HIIT are shared by both average 
and high- risk patients. 


We demonstrated that a brief- duration, high- frequency 
program of HIIT resulted in a significant improvement 
̇ 
V O 2peak. Though underpowered, our study identified 
in 
clinically important, but statistically insignificant im- 
provements in postoperative outcomes. Differences in 
some of these clinical outcomes have subsequently been 
identified by others.18,25 Based on these findings, a lack of 
adverse events, and minimal cost, we believe preoperative 
HIIT training should be encouraged for patients receiv- 
ing major abdominal surgery. Larger RCTs powered to 
detect clinical outcomes, including complications, LOS, 
and recovery of physical function after surgery, should be 
performed.
