Objective: To assess the effects of a 3-week community-based exercise
program on 30-day postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colorectal resection for (pre)malignancy.
Summary Background Data: Patients with a low preoperative aerobic
fitness undergoing colorectal surgery have an increased risk of postoperative
complications. It remains, however, to be demonstrated whether prehabilitation in these patients reduces postoperative complications.
Methods: This 2-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial
was carried out in 2 large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients (�60

activity questionnaire were randomly assigned to the prehabilitation group or
the usual care group by using block-stratified randomization. An oxygen
uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold <11 mL/kg/min at the baseline
cardiopulmonary exercise test was the final inclusion criterion. Inclusion was
based on a power analysis. Patients in the prehabilitation group participated in
a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, nine sessions in total) supervised
exercise program given in community physical therapy practices before
colorectal resection. Patients in the reference group received usual care.
The primary outcome was the number of patients with one or more complications within 30 days of surgery, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo
classification. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Results: Between February 2014 and December 2018, 57 patients [30 males
and 27 females; mean age 73.6 years (standard deviation 6.1), range 61–88
years] were randomized to either prehabilitation (n ¼ 28) or usual care (n ¼
29). The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the prehabilitation
group (n ¼ 12, 42.9%) than in the usual care group (n ¼ 21, 72.4%, relative
risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.37–0.96, P ¼ 0.024).
Conclusions: Exercise prehabilitation reduced postoperative complications
in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo elective colon resection for
(pre)malignancy. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in
high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also rectal,
surgery.

olorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide,
with an estimated 1.8 million new cases diagnosed and 881,000
# C
deaths associated with the disease in 2018.[1] Surgical resection of the
tumor remains the cornerstone of curative treatment.[2] However,
approximately one third of patients who undergo colorectal resection
experience postoperative complications,[3,4] which can delay recovery,
prolong hospitalization, cause unplanned hospital readmission and
chronic illness, and severely impair short- and long-term physical
functioning andhealth-related qualityoflife.[5] Reducingcomplications
would considerably reduce the patient burden and costs.[3] More than
65% of patients with colorectal cancer are older than 65 years.[6] In the
elderly, the physiological function and reserves of multiple organ
systems gradually decline, which affects their tolerance to surgery,[7,8]
with patients with a low preoperative aerobic fitness [oxygen uptake
(VO2) at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) <11mL/kg/min]
being particularly at increased risk of postoperative complications.[9,10]

These high-risk, less physically fit patients might therefore benefit
from preoperative exercise training (prehabilitation) to optimize their
aerobic fitness to reduce their risk of morbidity and to facilitate a
prompt recovery of physical functioning.[11,12]
To date, studies have provided inconclusive evidence that
prehabilitation reduces postoperative complications, as most studies

tended to be underpowered, heterogeneous, and biased towards
patients with a low risk of postoperative complications.[5,12–15] A
recent systematic review of Thomas and colleagues[12] found that
prehabilitation before major intra-abdominal cancer surgery[16,17]
improved postoperative outcomes. They concluded that future prehabilitation research should focus more on the adequate selection of
high-risk surgical patients and provide personalized, and probably
multimodal, (partly)supervised prehabilitation at home or in a community-based setting with the objective monitoring of a patient’s
progress.[12] Here, we describe a randomized clinical trial to study the
effects of a 3-week community-based exercise program on 30-day
postoperative complications in high-risk patients (VO2 at the VAT
<11 mL/kg/min) scheduled for elective colorectal resection for
(pre)malignancy.

##### METHODS

 Study Design and Participants
This prospective, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was
carried out at 2 large Dutch teaching hospitals (Medisch Spectrum
Twente in Enschede and Ziekenhuisgroep Twente in Almelo). Trial
methodology and experimental intervention were designed to conform state-of-the-art recommendations (using the Cochrane risk of
bias tool and CONTENT scale, respectively), as well as by using a
clinical decision rule to select the right (high-risk) patients for
prehabilitation[18]; this way, methodological risk of bias is minimized[19] and therapeutic validity is ensured.[20] The trial started in
February 2014 and inclusion was completed in December 2018.
Patients with colorectal cancer or premalignant colorectal lesions
(polyps with grade I-III dysplasia that could not be removed endoscopically) scheduled for elective colorectal resection were recruited.
Eligible patients were �60 years, had a life expectancy >6 months as
estimated by the surgeon, had a metabolic equivalent of task (MET)
score �7 on the veterans-specific activity questionnaire (VSAQ),
were willing to perform community-based prehabilitation at a physical therapy practice in the catchment area of both hospitals, and were
able to perform a progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).
The VSAQ was used to preselect those patients with a potentially low
preoperative aerobic fitness.[21] We obtained written informed consent
from all patients who met the inclusion criteria and were willing to
participate. For definite inclusion, patients also had to have a low
preoperative aerobic fitness (high risk for postoperative complications) at the baseline CPET, defined as a VO2 at the VAT <11 mL/kg/
min. Patients in the prehabilitation group and in the usual care group
were all treated within an enhanced recovery pathway according to
the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.[22] The study was
approved by the local medical ethics committee Twente in Enschede
and by the institutional review boards of Ziekenhuisgroep Twente,
the Netherlands (registration number P13–18), and was registered in
the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR4032). The trial followed the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting
guideline[23] and was conducted according with the ethical standards
of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. A complete overview of the
study protocol has been published.[24]

##### Randomization
All patients were identified at multidisciplinary oncology
meetings and were enrolled at the outpatient clinic by the surgeon
via the following procedure: patients with a VSAQ score �7 METs
were invited to participate in the study and, after providing their
informed consent, they were randomly assigned to the prehabilitation
group or the usual care group by block-stratified randomization.[25]
After randomization, all participants performed a CPET to verify
study eligibility (VO2 at the VAT <11 mL/kg/min). A research nurse


who did not help recruit patients or perform data analyses performed
the randomization by using sealed opaque envelopes, based on
computer-generated randomization lists. Randomization was stratified by disease and treatment type: (1) patients with colon cancer or
premalignancy, (2) patients with rectal cancer who would receive
1 week of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and (3) patients with rectal
cancer who would receive 5 weeks of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Participants were unaware of the study hypothesis: they knew
they were allocated to one of 2 groups to assess the effects of physical
fitness on postoperative outcome, but they did not know that 1
program was developed as an intervention and the other as a control.
Subsequently, patients in the prehabilitation group were informed
about all aspects of the study. No advice about preoperative exercise
training was offered to patients in the usual care group to avoid the
risk that these patients initiated preoperative exercise interventions
themselves, and they were planned for surgery at the earliest
convenience (with explicit permission from the medical ethics
committee). Participants and care providers were not masked to
randomization, because of the type of intervention. Data collection
and analysis were performed blinded to the group allocation of
the patients.

##### Intervention
Ideally, the baseline assessment of the patients was performed
within a week of their first visit at the outpatient clinic. Patients in the
prehabilitation group were reassessed after the preoperative exercise
program a few days before the surgical procedure. Patients in the
usual care group underwent surgery as soon as possible (normally
within 2–3 weeks). Usual care consisted of nutritional counseling
and advice on smoking cessation.
Patients in the prehabilitation group participated in a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, 9 sessions in total) supervised
exercise program before colorectal resection. These exercises were
executed and/or supervised by a group of trained physical therapists,
under the guidance of HK and PW, in community physical
therapy practices in the catchment area of both hospitals. Patients
with colon (pre)malignancy participated in the prehabilitation program during the period between the decision to undergo surgery and
the actual procedure, whereas patients with rectal cancer receiving
neoadjuvant therapy completed the prehabilitation program before
radiotherapy (in case of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, 5 � 5 Gy) or in the
12-week period after completing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (in
week 10–12). Each 60-minute training session consisted of moderate-to-high intensity interval training on a cycle ergometer (TechnoGym, Bike Med, Gambettola, Italy) to improve aerobic fitness
(40 minutes), and resistance training to improve peripheral muscle
strength (20 minutes). Detailed information about the intervention

##### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the number of patients with one or
more complications within 30 days of surgery. Complications were
divided into surgical and nonsurgical complications and graded
according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.[26,27] Intermediate outcome measures were changes in preoperative aerobic fitness (the VO2
at the VAT) in the prehabilitation group, length of hospital stay, and
unplanned readmissions within 30 and 90 days after surgery.
At baseline,participants inbothgroups underwenta progressive
CPET (Oxycon Pro, Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany in both hospitals) on
a calibrated electronically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoline, Ergoselect 100, Bitz, Germany at Medisch Spectrum Twente and Lode
Excalibur Sport, Lode BV, Groningen, the Netherlands at Ziekenhuisgroep Twente). Throughout the CPET, breath-by-breath measurement

of VO2, carbon dioxide production, respiratory flow, and volume
parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiography was performed to verify
study eligibility, to assess baseline aerobic fitness (eg, the VO2 at the
VAT), to check for potential contraindications, and to personalize
the interval training program.[24] Additional information concerning the
interpretation of the CPET data can be found in Supplemental Digital
[Content 2, http://links.lww.com/SLA/C841.](http://links.lww.com/SLA/C841)
Muscle strength assessment included handgrip strength and
quadriceps strength.[24] In addition to clinical history and physical
examination, the following descriptive tests were also included (see
for detailed information our study protocol)[24]: timed up-and-go test,
short nutritional assessment questionnaire, and the Groningen frailty
indicator. Only the prehabilitation group performed the second CPET
after the 3-week exercise program.

##### Sample Size Calculation
On the basis of morbidity rates in colorectal patients reported
in the Dutch ColoRectal Audit (30%)[2] and the literature (21% in
nonfrail patients, 40% in prefrail patients, and 58% in frail
patients),[28] we hypothesized that the complication rate in high-risk
patients (VO2 at the VAT <11 mL/kg/min) undergoing colorectal
surgery without prehabilitation would be around 50%, and after
prehabilitation about 20%. To detect a statistically significant difference between groups, we calculated that 43 patients in each group
would be required (a of 0.0492, due to 1 interim analysis, ß of 80%,
taking a 10% drop out rate into account). Our interim analysis (date
July 11, 2017), with a stopping rule according to O’Brien-Fleming
that aimed to test if the study should be stopped due to superiority or
futility,[29] showed a significantly lower incidence of complications
(33% vs 73%; P ¼ 0.0096) in patients in the prehabilitation group (n
¼ 21) than in patients in the usual care group (n ¼ 22). These data
were used to recalculate our sample size, with explicit permission
from the Medical Ethics Committee. Now, 27 patients in each group
were required to detect statistically significant differences between
groups (a of 0.0492, ß of 80%, taking a 10% dropout rate into
account). See Supplemental Digital Content 3 for more information,
[http://links.lww.com/SLA/C842.](http://links.lww.com/SLA/C842)

##### Statistical Analysis
Data (coded on study code) were analyzed with the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (version 23.0; IBM,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). For continuous variables, independent
samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate, were
performed to analyze differences between the 2 groups. For categorical variables, this was done with chi-squared tests or Fisher exact
tests, as appropriate. Variables were tested for their association with
postoperative complications (P < 0.05), using the t-test, Mann
Whitney U test, Fisher exact test, or Chi[2] test, as appropriate. A
repeated measurements analysis (mixed models) was performed to
assess changes over time in continuous variables. A multivariable
logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent
predictors of a postoperative complication, using a forward stepwise
procedure (P in 0.05, P out 0.10). If there was multicollinearity
between variables, the variable that produced the best model fit
(based on the –2 log-likelihood) was included in the model. A new
logistic regression model was made (method: enter) incorporating
the selected significant variables, to utilize the maximum number of
observations. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to
assess the independent ability of predictive variables to discriminate
between patients with and without a postoperative complication. All
tests were performed on both the intention-to-treat population and
the perprotocol population. Because of the interim analysis, the final
P-value considered to be statistically significant was reduced to
<0.0492 (2-sided).


##### RESULTS
Between February 1, 2014 and the final inclusion on December
31, 2018, 682 potential participants were assessed for study participation. Of these, 132 met the inclusion criteria, of which 74 (56%) gave
their consent to participate (Fig. 1). Of these 74 patients, 17 were
excluded from the analysis (n ¼ 12 had a VO2 at the VAT >11mL/kg/
min and n ¼ 5 did not undergo surgery). Of the remaining 57 patients
{30 males, 27 females; mean age 73.6 years [standard deviation (SD)
6.1], range 61–88 years}, 28 were randomized to the prehabilitation
group and 29 to the usual care group. Of the 57 patients, 3 had rectal
cancer, of which 2 received neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
Baseline characteristics of study participants are presented in
Table 1 and were largely similar between both groups, except for
time between inclusion and surgery (P < 0.001).
Median time between the first visit at the outpatient clinic and
the baseline CPETwas 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3–6). Mean
time between the second CPET and surgery for patients in the
prehabilitation group was 2.4 days (SD 1.6). In the prehabilitation
group, VO2 at the VAT had improved by 10.1% [þ0.97 mL/kg/min (n
¼ 24), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–1.6; P ¼ 0.006] and
VO2peak had improved by 8.8% [þ1.3 mL/kg/min (n ¼ 16), 95%
CI –0.006 to 2.6; P ¼ 0.051] after the 3-week program; see Figure 2.
Ten (36%) patients showed no or minimal improvement (<þ0.5 mL/
kg/min VO2 at the VAT) at the second CPET. Quadriceps strength
had increased on average by 2.1% [þ6.6 Newton (n ¼ 23), 95% CI –
21.4 to 8.2; P ¼ 0.37]. None of the patients reported adverse events
during the exercise program and none were observed by the physical
therapists. Patients attended 8.1 (SD 2.4) of the 9 supervised exercise
training sessions (90%).
The overall complication rate in the full cohort was 58%. One
patient randomized to prehabilitation died as a result of complications arising from a leaking anastomosis. However, this patient had
withdrawn from the study directly after randomization because his
surgery had been planned during the study period and he did not want
to postpone surgery. Both patients with rectal cancer who received
neoadjuvant chemoradiation and who were randomized to the prehabilitation group had grade 2 complications. The third patient with
rectal cancer, who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy, was randomized to the usual care group and also had a postoperative complication (grade 1).
The complication rate in patients in the prehabilitation group
(n ¼ 12, 42.9%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the
usual care group (n ¼ 21, 72.4%, P ¼ 0.024, Table 2). There were no
differences in the type of complications between the 2 groups.
Analysis showed that prehabilitation had a protective role against
overall postoperative complications (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–
0.96). No differences in hospital readmission rates were found
between the 2 groups (n ¼ 4, 14.3% in the prehabilitation group
vs n ¼ 5, 17.2% in the usual care group; P > 0.99).
In the univariable analysis of all baseline characteristics (see
Table 1), hemoglobin level (P ¼ 0.002), age-adjusted Charlson score
(P ¼ 0.024), and SNAQ score (P ¼ 0.084) were associated with
postoperative complications. In the final multivariable model including hemoglobin level and prehabilitation, a higher preoperative
hemoglobin level [odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% CI 0.18–0.75; P ¼
0.006] and prehabilitation (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06–0.79; P ¼ 0.021)
were individually associated with a decreased 30-day risk of postoperative complications. Patients with a 1.0 mmol/L higher hemoglobin level were 3 times less likely to have a postoperative
complication than patients with a lower hemoglobin level. ROC
analysis for predicting patients with a postoperative complication
based on the hemoglobin level and prehabilitation gave an AUC of
0.77 (95% CI 0.65–0.89; P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3).

##### DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first state-of-the-art
randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of a 3-week community-based and personalized prehabilitation program for patients
scheduled for surgery for colorectal (pre)malignancy who were
considered to be at high risk of postoperative complications, as
established with a preoperative clinical decision rule. Within a
relatively short period of 3 weeks, prehabilitation improved aerobic
fitness by approximately 10% and patients subsequently experienced
an almost 50% decrease in the incidence of postoperative complications. The program thus seems to make patients more resistant to
the potentially negative consequences of some or all ingredients and
perceptions of the perioperative trajectory, so that they experience
fewer postoperative complications.
With regard to the overall complication rate in this study
(58%), one has to bear in mind that the population under study is a
high-risk population, known to demonstrate incidences of about 50%
or even more. For instance, comparable studies like that of West et al[9]
showed an overall morbidity rate after major colorectal surgery of
65% in patients with a low preoperative aerobic fitness (oxygen
consumption at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold <11 mL/kg/min).
Moreover, Barberan-Garcia et al[17] found an overall incidence of
complications of 46% in high-risk patients (age >70 years, ASA
score III/IV, and Duke activity status index score �46) undergoing


major abdominal surgery. Although prehabilitation cannot prevent
all complications, the impact of a postoperative complication might
also be reduced in patients with a higher physical fitness,[12,30] as
previously indicated in coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
pancreatic surgery.[31,32]
Barberan-Garcia and colleagues[17] reported that prehabilitation before elective major abdominal surgery significantly improved
preoperative aerobic fitness and significantly reduced the number of
high-risk patients with postoperative complications (RR 0.5, 95% CI
0.3–0.8), as compared to usual care. However, they selected highrisk patients based on age, ASA score, and Duke activity status index
score and not on formal (cardiopulmonary) exercise testing. Moreover, Carli et al[15] recently showed that prehabilitation in (pre)frail
patients (based on the Fried frailty index)[33] who underwent colorectal cancer resection did not reduce postoperative complications.
Patients with a low preoperative aerobic fitness would be expected
to benefit the most from prehabilitation.[11,12] Therefore, after making
a preselection of potentially high-risk patients (eg, with the VSAQ),
further selection of high-risk patients on the basis of CPET findings
might be the risk screening strategy of choice. In our study, patients
with a lower preoperative hemoglobin level were at greater risk of
postoperative complications. This suggests that the preoperative
hemoglobin level should also be taken into consideration when
stratifying patients by risk. Preoptimization of iron deficiency anemia by means of iron supplements in surgical patients undergoing

major abdominal surgery increases preoperative hemoglobin concentrations, decreases the need for transfusion,[34] and results in a
shorter hospital stay.[35] Use of erythropoietin is not recommended,
because it potentially increases the risk of thrombosis, mortality,[36]
and tumor growth.[37]

Our study followed current recommendations regarding the
use of a clinical decision rule to minimize the risk of bias and to
ensure therapeutic validity.[18–20] Nevertheless, our prehabilitation
approach could be improved. First, patient inclusion was challenging, and we had a low participation rate (56%) among patients who
met (preliminary) inclusion criteria. The main reasons given for nonparticipation were no inclination to participate, inability to perform
cycling exercises, considered self to be physically fit, or desire for
surgery as soon as possible (Fig. 1). This suggests that it is important
to present preoperative risk stratification and prehabilitation as an
integral part of the perioperative care package for high-risk patients,


in which patients, their relatives, and their (in)formal caregivers
should be adequately informed about the importance of physical
activity and physical fitness before and after surgery in relation to
surgical outcomes. Moreover, the context of delivering prehabilitation should be well-considered, as patients prefer home-based preoperative physical exercise training, supervised once a week,[38]
ideally by a dedicated and competent community physical therapist.
Second, our prehabilitation program was a unimodal program,
focusing on exercise, whereas a recent systematic review by Thomas
and colleagues[12] reported that multimodal programs including exercise training, nutritional support, psychological support, and the
interaction between these components might be most effective
and should be considered in further research. However, definitive
clinical evidence of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of multimodal prehabilitation is currently very limited, and should be
investigated further.[12,39] Third, we did not objectively assess whether

and how a patient’s physical fitness (aerobic and muscular fitness)
improved during prehabilitation. Instead, we adjusted the program
each week in a standardized way. When measured objectively and on
multiple occasions, training intensity can be adjusted according to
the improvement in physical fitness, to maintain an effective training
stimulus. Moreover, frequent monitoring of progress is essential to
identify nonresponders or noncompliant individuals as soon as
possible, because of the short time window available for the intervention before surgery.[12] Strous and colleagues recently showed that
prehabilitation programs can safely be extended because a prolonged
treatment delay did not lead to poorer overall or cancer-free survival
in patients with primary colorectal cancer who underwent curative
surgical treatment.[40] In the present study, 10 of the 28 patients in the
prehabilitation group were considered post hoc to be nonresponders
(n ¼ 7) or minimal responders (<þ0.5 mL/kg/min, n ¼ 3), based on
the VO2 at the VAT at the second CPET. Of these 10 patients, 6 had a
postoperative complication (60%), whereas this was 43% of the total
prehabilitation group and 72% of the usual care group. Ideally,
aerobic fitness should improve in all high-risk patients, and achieving
this will be a challenge for future research. If we had monitored
progress to adjust the intervention as needed, we might have seen a
greater effect of prehabilitation.
The study had some other limitations. Although adequately
powered, the patient group was small and selective. Moreover, the
ROC analysis was performed in a small cohort and might therefore
not be very robust. Since only 3 patients with rectal cancer were
included in the study, their findings possibly cannot be generalized to
this patient group. Lastly, the decision not to include the 5 patients
who were randomized but who ultimately did not undergo surgery in
the intention-to-treat analysis is debatable.
In future research, attempts should be made to ensure that all
eligible high-risk patients are willing and able to participate in
prehabilitation programs. Moreover, as mentioned before, prehabilitation should ideally be performed in high-risk patients selected
with a preoperative CPET, and must be multimodal, personalized,
(partly) supervised, and home- or community-based, with frequent
objective monitoring of progress and subsequent consideration of
adjustment of training frequency and/or intensity. We suggest using a


stepped wedge design, with modern data techniques, to implement
and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prehabilitation in real-life care
of high-risk patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
In conclusion, our study showed that community-based exercise prehabilitation reduced the risk of postoperative complications
in high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon resection for
(pre)malignancy. Probably, this is also true for high-risk patients
undergoing rectal resection; however, the small number of patients
with rectal cancer included in this study makes it impossible to draw
conclusions about the effectiveness of prehabilitation in this specific
patient group. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in
high-risk patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also
rectal, surgery.
