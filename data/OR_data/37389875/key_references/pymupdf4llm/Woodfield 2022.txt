**Purpose: Improving cardiopulmonary reserve, or peak oxygen consumption(V[̇]**
O2peak), may reduce postoperative complications; however, this may be difficult to
achieve between diagnosis and surgery. Our primary aim was to assess the efficacy
of an approximate 14-­session, preoperative high-­intensity interval training(HIIT)
program to increase V[̇] O2peak by a clinically relevant 2 ml·kg[−1]·min[−1]. Our secondary aim was to document clinical outcomes.
**Methodology:** In this prospective study, participants aged 45–­85 undergoing
major abdominal surgery were randomized to standard care or 14 sessions of
HIIT over 4 weeks. HIIT sessions involved approximately 30 min of stationary
cycling. Interval training alternated 1 min of high (with the goal of reaching 90%
max heart rate at least once during the session) and low/moderate-­intensity cycling. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing(CPET) measured the change in V[̇] O2peak
from baseline to surgery. Clinical outcomes included postoperative complications, length of stay(LOS), and Short Form 36 quality of life questionnaire(SF-­36).
**Results: Of 63 participants, 46 completed both CPETs and 50 completed clinical**
follow-­up. There was a significant improvement in the HIIT group's mean ± SD V[̇]
O2peak (HIIT 2.87 ± 1.94 ml·kg[1]·min[−1] vs standard care 0.15 ± 1.93, with an overall
difference of 2.73 ml·kg[1]·min[−1] 95%CI [1.53, 3.93] p < 0.001). There were no sta
tistically significant differences between groups for clinical outcomes, although
the observed differences consistently favored the exercise group. This was most
notable for total number of complications (0.64 v 1.16 per patient, p = 0.07), SF-­
36 physical component score (p = 0.06), and LOS (mean 5.5 v 7.4 days, p = 0.07).
**Conclusions: There was a significant improvement in V[̇]** O2peak with a four-­week
preoperative HIIT program. Further appropriately powered work is required to
explore the impact of preoperative HIIT on postoperative clinical outcomes.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

Postoperative complications are common after major abdominal surgery, occurring in up to 40% of patients.[1,2]
Unfortunately, important risk factors, such as the number
of pre-­existing comorbidities, the extent of the underlying
pathology, and the magnitude of the required operation,
cannot be changed prior to surgery. Most modifiable risk
factors, such as smoking cessation[3] and optimizing specific medical problems, will improve the outcome in only
a subset of patients. Cardiopulmonary fitness is the one
modifiable risk factor that it may be possible to improve
in a larger proportion of patients, by the introduction of
preoperative aerobic exercise training. A peak oxygen
consumption (V[̇] O2peak) below 18.6 mL·kg[−1]·min[−1] [4] or an
anaerobic threshold (AT) of <10–­11 ml·kg[−1]·min[−1] [4–­6] is
associated with significantly higher rates of postoperative
complications. High-­intensity interval training (HIIT) and
moderate-­intensity continuous training (MICT) are the
most common methods of improving cardiopulmonary
fitness. Studies in clinical populations have shown that
HIIT results in substantial[5] and rapid[6,7] improvement in

_V̇_ O2peak and is safe in those with coronary artery disease
and cardiac failure.[7] HIIT is also appealing for preoperative patients because rapid improvement is important
where there is a limited period of time between diagnosis
and surgery.
There is an increasing body of evidence indicating that
preoperative aerobic exercise can improve peak oxygen
consumption. We identified eleven studies that document
the impact of preoperative aerobic exercise on either peak
oxygen consumption or AT in a four to six-­week period
before surgery.[8–­18] All studies were conducted in patients
undergoing major abdominal or thoracic procedures. All
except two[14,16] demonstrated an improvement in oxygen
consumption. All but one[18] had a small sample size, with
26 or fewer patients being exercised. Only four studies
were randomized,[10,11,16,18] and only one was designed to
prospectively assess postoperative complications.[18] Of the
three studies that based their exercise program around the
principles of HIIT,[8,11,16] two showed a significant improvement in V[̇] O2peak of at least 2.0 ml·kg[−1]·min[−1],[8,11] while
one showed no change in V[̇] O2peak.[16] In this context, we
believe that further well-­designed randomized studies
are required to confirm the extent of the impact of preoperative HIIT on oxygen consumption and the volume of
HIIT required to increase V[̇] O2peak. An important practical
question is whether HIIT can be used to benefit the large
number of major abdominal surgery patients whose time
between diagnosis and surgery is brief (e.g., 4 weeks).
In terms of complications, although we know that fitter patients do better,[4,19,20] there are conflicting results in
the literature when assessing the impact that improving


preoperative cardiopulmonary fitness has on postoperative complications.[21] While some studies suggest that
prehabilitation could reduce hospital stay[22,23] and the risk
of specific complications such as chest infection,[22] the results of most reviews have been equivocal.[24] However, two
recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs),[18,25] powered
to assess complications, have demonstrated a statistically
significant and clinically important reduction of complications after 6 weeks preoperative exercise. While these
strengthen the evidence for prehabilitation to reduce complications, patients often have less than 6 weeks between
diagnosis and surgery due to the urgency of required
surgery.
In an effort to understand whether a short course of
exercise “prehabilitation” can provide the benefits demonstrated in longer exercise interventions, this RCT compares
a 4 weeks exercise program using HIIT against standard
preoperative care for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The overarching objective of this study was
to examine the impact of a focused, individualized HIIT
exercise program over a 4 week period on both cardiopulmonary fitness and postoperative clinical outcomes.
The primary hypothesis was that an individualized and
supervised preoperative HIIT program would result in a
clinically relevant increase in V[̇] O2peak of 2 mL·kg[−1]·min[−1]
when compared to standard care.[8,11] The secondary hypothesis was that a HIIT program that delivers a clinically
significant increase in cardiopulmonary fitness would
also result in an improvement in clinical outcomes.

### 2 | METHODS

We performed a single center, two arm, parallel, prospective RCT comparing an exercise program using
HIIT against standard preoperative care for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The study was approved by the Southern Health and Disability Ethics
Committee (reference number 15/STH/116) and was
registered with the Australasian Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12617000587303). An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 1 and in our protocol paper.[26]
The inclusion criteria were patients aged 45–­85 undergoing major abdominal surgery, who lived close enough to
the hospital to attend multiple exercise sessions. Major
abdominal surgery included a procedure expected to last
two hours, or with an anticipated blood loss of greater
than 500ml.[27] This included gastrointestinal resections,
liver surgery, large abdominal wall hernia repair, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hysterectomy, radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and nephrectomy. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: (A) Inability to perform a CPET
or a contraindication to exercise found on CPET such as


-----

an arrhythmia or ST segment changes. (B) Medical conditions where exercise may contribute to adverse events.
These included symptomatic angina, a myocardial infarction in the last three months, and uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease
with no symptomatic angina or with successful revascularization were included. Other medical contraindications included uncontrolled hypertension (BP>180/100),
aortic aneurysm >6.5 cm, and severe obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1<1.0 liters. (C) Receiving medical therapy which could change oxygen consumption at
the same time as the proposed exercise program. This
included treatment of anemia and receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. (D) Inability to follow
instructions or to provide consent.
Potentially eligible patients were interviewed by a research nurse and assessed by the study anesthetist After

consent, CPET was performed on a stationary cycle ergometer (Quark Ergoline). The CPET protocol has been
previously published.[26] Tests were terminated when the
participant achieved a maximal effort or for medical reasons.[28] Evidence of a maximal effort test included a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of ≥1.1 or a plateau in the V[̇]
O2 with increasing workload. V[̇] O2peak, resting and maximal heart rate (HRmax), maximal workload in Watts, and
the workload required to elicit 60% and 90% HRmax were
recorded. A cardiologist checked the electrocardiogram
results. Randomization was performed using a computer-­
generated sequence of numbers kept in sealed envelopes
that were sequentially opened. The randomization ratio
was 1:1 for the first 40 participants. This was changed to 2
for standard care and 1 for HIIT for the remainder of the
study (due to lack of adherence in attending the second
CPET in the control group) [26]


-----

For those randomized to exercise, the protocol included 14 sessions of HIIT over 4 weeks. Each session
included approximately 30 min of stationary cycling
on a cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 828E) under
the supervision of an exercise physiologist. The session began with 5 min of warm-­up cycling, followed by
20 min of interval training and 5 min of pedaling against
a light load. The interval training was based around ten
1 min intervals of high-­intensity cycling against a high
resistance with the objective of reaching 90% HRmax
(determined via CPET) at least once during the session.
Intense intervals were alternated with 1 min intervals
of active rest, defined as cycling against minimal resistance at ≥60% HRmax. The duration of intense training
did not exceed 10 min. Once 90% HRmax was achieved,
we aimed to achieve this target in as many intense intervals as possible, and in sustaining this for a longer proportion of the interval. Individualization of the protocol
included increasing the training load or the duration of
intense intervals, with the aim of achieving five 2 min
intervals followed by 1–­2 min of lower intensity cycling.
Individualization also included the ability to start with
shorter periods of intense exercise in those with medical
comorbidities. Participants on beta blockers had pulse
and level of perceived exertion monitored using the 6–­20
Borg scale.[29] Patient heart rate was recorded using Polar
heart rate monitors. Standard care for all participants included anesthetic preassessment, hospital orientation to
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) targets,[30] treatment of identified medical problems, advice on stopping
smoking and reducing alcohol consumption, and advice
on healthy living, including diet and being encouraged to exercise more before surgery. An independent
safety monitoring committee, including an anesthetist,
surgeon, and cardiologist, independently reviewed the
study protocols and any adverse events.
The primary outcome was change in V[̇] O2peak, defined
as the highest oxygen consumption measured over a 20 s
interval during the CPET.[31] Secondary physiological outcomes included peak work rate and AT. Adherence was
determined by the number of HIIT sessions attended, and
the number of sessions where a target HR of >90% HRmax
was reached. As we were unable to perform a study large
enough to use complications as our primary outcome, we
included a range of clinical outcomes as secondary endpoints to assess their relationship to HIIT training. Length
of stay was the number of postoperative days in hospital, with day zero being the day of surgery. Postoperative
complications, using standard definitions,[32,33] were documented in hospital and up to 6 weeks after discharge.
In-­hospital complications were prospectively identified
in the ward, and a validated questionnaire[34] was sent
6 weeks later to identify complications that developed after


discharge from hospital. We also collected data using three
postoperative surveys. The postoperative morbidity survey
(POMS), which assesses postoperative adverse events in
nine different domains according to predefined criteria,[35]
was performed on postoperative day 5. The surgical recovery scale (SRS), which assesses 13 items including energy
levels, feeling of fatigue, and a number of practical physical activities[36] was performed on postoperative day five
and 6 weeks after surgery. Quality of life (QoL) was measured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-­36).[37]
This documented the impact of HIIT on the patients’ QoL
and enabled us to assess differences in physical function
(PCS score) after surgery. QoL was documented on four
occasions: at randomization, before surgery, 6 weeks
after surgery, and 12 weeks after surgery. With respect
to blinding, although the exercise physiologist was not
blinded, two researchers always performed the CPET. The
assessor of the clinical endpoints was blinded to the group
the participant was in.
For patient demographics, mean and standard deviation were used for normally distributed continuous
variables, median and interquartile range for other continuous variables. Differences in changes of V[̇] O2peak between
groups were compared using linear mixed model analysis
and the Student's t-­test. For secondary endpoints, differences in the number of postoperative complications and
in the number of POMS events per person were compared
using the Wilcoxon rank-­sum tests. Differences in the
number of patients with a postoperative complication and
an identified POMS event were compared using Pearson's
chi-­squared tests. Differences in the length of stay were
compared using the Student's t-­test. Differences between
groups were also compared using appropriate models depending on the categorical or continuous nature of the
endpoint and the distribution of the data. These adjusted
for age, operative severity, and ASA score. For endpoints
recorded on more than one occasion (the SF-­36 and the
surgical recovery scale scores), linear mixed models were
used to give an overall comparison between groups. An
analysis was also performed for individual time points,
comparing the change in score from baseline between
groups with the Student's t-­test using Bonferroni corrections. Both per-­protocol (PP) and intention-­to-­treat (ITT)
analyses were performed, with PP being the main planned
analysis.[26] Statistical analysis was performed using R
4.0.2,[38] and significance was determined by two-­sided
_p < 0.05. In order to provide 80% power to detect a differ-_
ence of 2 ml·kg[−1]·min[−1] in the change in V[̇] O2peak between
groups, using a two-­sided test at the 0.05 level, a sample
size of 20 participants per group was required. Based on
a dropout rate of 1 in 3, we aimed to enroll 60 patients.

### 3 | RESULTS

Sixty-­three patients were enrolled between September
2015 and February 2019. This included 30% of those contacted. Reasons for non-­enrollment are outlined in the
Supplemental Digital Content p1, Patient Recruitment.
Participants randomized into the exercise and control
groups were not different with respect to age, sex, smoking status, ASA score, medical comorbidities, medications,
and the type of surgery performed (Table 1). Drop out
after randomization (Table 2) ranged from 19% to 32% for
different endpoints. Of those randomized to exercise, 75%
(21/28) completed the exercise program. Reasons for withdrawal included acute respiratory infection, chest pain in
the initial exercise session, anxiety, discomfort sitting on a
bike seat because of previous surgery, and competing time
commitments. In the control group, five patients did not
attend their second CPET, two withdrew as “there was
no point being in the study if they were not exercised,”
and three patients set up their own well-­designed aerobic
exercise programs. These three patients were included in
the ITT, but not the PP analysis. Two adverse events were
documented: a new arrhythmia diagnosed during the initial CPET and an episode of chest pain during HIIT. Both
events resolved on stopping the intervention without additional sequel.
For those who completed the exercise program, adherence for attending exercise sessions was 85% (on average
participants completed 12 of their 14 sessions). The main
reason for not completing 14 sessions was limited time
before surgery. Adherence to reaching 90% HR max at
least once during an exercise session was 97.5%. On average, participants trained 3.7 times a week and performed
8 min of intense exercise per session, resulting in approximately 100 min of intense exercise throughout the exercise program.
The results for the primary endpoint, change in _V[̇]_
O2peak, are summarized in Table 3. The difference in
the mean improvement of _V[̇]_ O2peak between groups
was 2.73 mL·kg[−1]·min[−1], 95% CI [1.53–­3.93], _p < 0.001._
Comparable changes in V[̇] O2peak were found for the ITT
analysis (Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content p5).
Improvements in _V[̇]_ O2peak were seen in both average
and high-­risk patients (Table S7, Supplemental Digital
Content p8). The peak work rate during CPET increased
significantly in the exercise group in comparison with the
control group (p = 0.037 PP, p = 0.05 ITT analysis).
The results for complications, POMS, and LOS are
presented in Table 4 Although there were no significant

on the effect of preoperative HIIT on clinical outcomes.
These effects were not different between average and
high-­risk participants (Table S8, Supplemental Digital
Content p9).
The PCS scores at baseline, after HIIT, 6 weeks after
surgery, and 12 weeks after surgery are presented in
Table 5, Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content p4, and
illustrated in Figure 2. The overall difference in PCS for
all time periods combined, when adjusting for repeated
measures, age, ASA, and operative severity was not significantly different (p = 0.057). Although after HIIT there

**TABLE 2** Patient enrollments and attrition after randomization


was an improvement in PCS, the difference was greatest
6 weeks after surgery (p = 0.015, see supplemental digital
content Table S2) due to the decrease in PCS being greater
in the control group than in the exercise group. By three
months after surgery, both groups were similar to their
baseline.
Further results for clinical outcomes are presented in
the supplement. Tables S1–­S2 pp 3–­4 present the PP results, and Tables S3–­S5 Supplemental Digital Content
pp5–­7 the ITT results.

### 4 | DISCUSSION

This RCT confirms that preoperative HIIT increases aerobic capacity. Novel findings are that these benefits are
realized after a brief training program (average 12 sessions) that can be achieved in the short time period (average 3.7 sessions a week) before surgery. This study was
not powered to detect changes in postoperative outcomes;
however, the observed differences in several outcomes, including length of stay and the number of complications,
were numerically lower in the exercise groups (p < 0.1). If
these findings are substantiated in larger RCTs, it would
suggest that a brief, intense period of preoperative exercise, aimed at improving patient outcomes, should be
considered as an addition to standard preoperative care
before major abdominal surgery.
Our 2.7 mL·kg[−1]·min[−1] improvement in aerobic capacity with HIIT involved approximately 100 min of intense
exercise. Participants were supervised and attained the
target heart rate of 90% HRmax in >95% of the attended
exercise sessions. This improvement is comparable with

with a total of 40 min of intense exercise, did not change

_V̇_ O2peak. As many cancer patients do not have 6 weeks between diagnosis and surgery, we needed to achieve a high-­
intensity training volume comparable to West et al.[8] in a
shorter period of time. Achieving approximately 100 min
of high-­intensity activity during their training period required our participants to train an average of 3.7 times per
week, rather than three sessions per week as described by
others.[4] An obvious criticism is that this exceeds, in an already compromised cohort, the ACSM recommendation
of three days per week of vigorous activity.[39] We would
note, however, that the program was well attended and
tolerated by participants with minimal adverse events.
We believe the observed differences in postoperative
clinical outcomes between study groups should be interpreted carefully. Our study was not powered to compare
differences in clinical outcomes or their association with
changes in V[̇] O2peak. In this context, three observations
can be made. Firstly, for all clinical endpoints, preoperative HIIT was consistently associated with fewer adverse
outcomes in the exercise group. Secondly, some of the
non-­significant differences were of a sufficient size, with
_p values <0.10, and of sufficient clinical relevance, to war-_
rant further investigation. These include the impact of
HIIT on postoperative complications, quality of life, and
length of stay. Finally, some of these improvements have
recently been confirmed in two RCTs, which were appropriately powered to identify differences in postoperative
complications. A RCT of 124 patients undergoing abdominal aneurysm surgery demonstrated that a multi-­modal
moderate intensity aerobic exercise program resulted


in fewer patients with complications (41.9% v 22.6%
(p = 0.021)) and a reduced median hospital stay from 8
to 7 days (p = 0.025).[18] Similarly, a RCT of 144 patients
undergoing major abdominal surgery demonstrated that
a multi-­modal HIIT program resulted in fewer patients
with complications (62% v 31% (p = 0.001)) and a reduced
mean hospital stay from 13 to 8 days (p = 0.078).[25] These
results are consistent with the 45% mean reduction in the
number of complications, and the one-­day median reduction of hospital stay in our study.
While overall there was no significant difference in
the PCS of the SF-­36 for all time periods combined, we
were interested in assessing changes at individual time
points because of their clinical relevance. The PCS score
includes questions examining what you can physically do
(Physical Function), your ability to accomplish different
tasks (Physical Role), and your assessment of your health
(General Health). When measured postoperatively, it
therefore provides a good measurement of physical recovery from surgery. Our results at 6 weeks after surgery suggest that participants in the HIIT group recovered more
rapidly. The ability of prehabilitation to improve the speed
of physical recovery after surgery is an important clinical
observation, both for patients and healthcare providers,
which needs to be further assessed.
Challenges in performing this RCT have been discussed previously.[26] There were difficulties randomizing patients to standard care. As most patients enrolled
because their imminent surgery and the study provided
motivation to exercise, randomization to standard
care came as a disappointment This contributed to

withdrawals, poor protocol adherence, and not attending the second CPET. For example, three participants
initiated preoperative aerobic exercise programs that included (but were not limited to) training at a gymnasium
or walking daily up a steep hill. This is the reason for
the smaller difference between groups in the ITT analysis. We would recommend that future studies provide
alternative preoperative programs for the control group,
such as strength and balance classes, walking programs,
or breathing exercises.
Limitations include the inability to blind patients. It
is therefore possible that the psychological effect of being
included in the exercise group contributed to differences
in the quality of life scores. Another limitation is that our
data do not provide a basis for how preoperative HIIT can
be best applied to a complete surgical cohort, including
less motivated and non-­adherent patients. We did, however, perform an analysis assessing if all enrolled patients,
or a subset of surgical patients would benefit from HIIT.
This found no evidence against the hypothesis that the
benefits of preoperative HIIT are shared by both average
and high-­risk patients.

### 5 | PERSPECTIVE

We demonstrated that a brief-­duration, high-­frequency
program of HIIT resulted in a significant improvement
in V[̇] O2peak. Though underpowered, our study identified
clinically important, but statistically insignificant improvements in postoperative outcomes. Differences in
some of these clinical outcomes have subsequently been
identified by others.[18,25] Based on these findings, a lack of
adverse events, and minimal cost, we believe preoperative
HIIT training should be encouraged for patients receiving major abdominal surgery. Larger RCTs powered to
detect clinical outcomes, including complications, LOS,
and recovery of physical function after surgery, should be
performed.
