**OBJECTIVE To determine whether multimodal prehabilitation before colorectal cancer**
surgery can reduce postoperative complications and enhance functional recovery.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PREHAB randomized clinical trial was an**
international, multicenter trial conducted in teaching hospitals with implemented enhanced
recovery after surgery programs. Adult patients with nonmetastasized colorectal cancer were
assessed for eligibility and randomized to either prehabilitation or standard care. Both arms
received standard perioperative care. Patients were enrolled from June 2017 to December
2020, and follow-up was completed in December 2021. However, this trial was prematurely
stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**INTERVENTIONS The 4-week in-hospital supervised multimodal prehabilitation program**
consisted of a high-intensity exercise program 3 times per week, a nutritional intervention,
psychological support, and a smoking cessation program when needed.

**MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) score, number of**
patients with CCI score more than 20, and improved walking capacity expressed as the
6-minute walking distance 4 weeks postoperatively.

**RESULTS In the intention-to-treat population of 251 participants (median [IQR] age, 69**

[60-76] years; 138 [55%] male), 206 (82%) had tumors located in the colon and 234 (93%)
underwent laparoscopic- or robotic-assisted surgery. The number of severe complications
(CCI score >20) was significantly lower favoring prehabilitation compared with standard care
(21 of 123 [17.1%] vs 38 of 128 [29.7%]; odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P = .02).
Participants in prehabilitation encountered fewer medical complications (eg, respiratory)
compared with participants receiving standard care (19 of 123 [15.4%] vs 35 of 128 [27.3%];
odds ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.26-0.89]; P = .02). Four weeks after surgery, 6-minute walking
distance did not differ significantly between groups when compared with baseline (mean
difference prehabilitation vs standard care 15.6 m [95% CI, −1.4 to 32.6]; P = .07). Secondary
parameters of functional capacity in the postoperative period generally favored
prehabilitation compared with standard care. **Author Affiliations: Author**

sive burden to patients and the health care system.[1] Colorectal cancer is third in rank among global cancer incidence rates
and was the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
2020.[2] Despiteremarkableadvancementsinperioperativecare,
30-day morbidity did not significantly improve with morbidity rates between 19.7% to 37.4%.[3] Furthermore, many patients experience new or worsening impairments, which can
persist for months after surgery.[4,5] Therefore, reducing the risk
of postoperative complications and functional decline is of the
utmost importance.
Functional capacity is a strong determinant of a favorable outcome after surgery,[6,7] leading to a compelling rationale to improve physical, nutritional, and mental status before surgery. After the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, time to
surgery usually comprises several weeks, a salient time ideally suited for multimodal prehabilitation.[8,9]

Trials that have suggested that prehabilitation may lead
to clinically meaningful improvements in the patient’s preoperative condition and surgical outcome[10-16] lack sufficient
power and have heterogeneous design.[17-20] To date, recommendations on the implementation of prehabilitation in standard care are weak.[21]

Therefore, we conducted an international multicenter randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect of a multimodal prehabilitation program on functional capacity recovery and postoperative complications within 30 days after
surgery of patients with nonmetastasized colorectal cancer.

### Methods

#### Trial Design and Procedures
The PREHAB trial is an open-label international, multicenter,
parallel-arm, randomized, controlled study comparing
multimodal prehabilitation with standard preoperative care.
The protocol was previously published[22] and is available in
[Supplement 1 and approved by the local institutional review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2023.0198?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamasurg.2023.0198)
board at each trial site. Participants provided written informed consent before any study-related procedures commenced. An independent data safety monitoring board consisting of an epidemiologist, 2 physicians, and an exercise
physiologist monitored the safety and efficacy of the trial. EnrollmentbeganonJune6,2017,waspausedinMarch2020during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was prematurely stopped on
December 15, 2020. We followed the Consolidated Standards
[of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.[23]](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/)

The study population consisted of adult patients scheduled for elective surgical resection of primary colorectal cancer. The presence of metastases or another primary tumor,
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 4 or
higher, chronic kidney failure (creatinine >2.83 mg/dL [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4] or dialysis), indication for abdominoperineal resection, and the impossibility to wait 4 weeks for surgery represented exclusion criteria.
Furthermore,patientswerenoteligibleiftheyhadmedicalcon

ditions and/or cognitive impairments that contraindicated the
intervention and/or illiteracy or language barriers. No data on
race and ethnicity were collected.
Participating sites were teaching hospitals and secondary
or tertiary care centers performing approximately 200 to 300
colorectal resections per year. Seven sites enrolled patients, of
which 6 were originally members of an international consor[tium (eAppendix in Supplement 2).](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2023.0198?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamasurg.2023.0198)
Investigatorsidentifiedpatientsatthesurgicalclinicorduring weekly multidisciplinary team meetings. After obtaining
written informed consent, the research team assessed eligibility by performing a complete medical history and a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The conduction and interpretation of CPET results followed clinical guidelines.[24]

Participants standardly underwent functional assessments at baseline, before surgery (approximately 4 weeks after baseline), and 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. A complete list
[of assessments is available in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2023.0198?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamasurg.2023.0198)
The local prehabilitation teams directly involved in the
study procedures consisted of qualified health care professionals such as physicians, kinesiologists or physiotherapists,dietitians,andpsychology-trainedpersonnel.Seriousand
adverse events related to the intervention were collected.

#### Multimodal Prehabilitation
Interventions in this trial have been specifically developed for
patients awaiting colorectal cancer surgery.[26] The intervention consists of a 4-week personalized in-hospital supervised
preoperative program including exercise, nutritional, and psychological support. If indicated, a smoking cessation intervention was included. In-hospital entailed outpatient appointments to hospital affiliated training departments or facilities.


-----

The supervised training consisted of a 1-hour session of
aerobic and strength exercises 3 times per week with resting
days in between. The aerobic part, preferably performed on a
bicycle, consisted of a high-intensity interval training using
baseline CPET-derived variables. It consisted of 4 intervals of
2-minute high-intensity bouts conducted at 85% to 90% of
peak power, alternated with 4 intervals of 4-minute moderateintensity bouts at 30% of peak power. Resistance exercise consisted of 2 series of 10 repetitions targeting major muscle
groups. The intensity was set at 65% to 70% of the calculated
baseline indirect 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Professional
strength equipment, body weight, elastic bands, and/or calibrated dumbbells were used.
Based on nutritional assessment and dietary habits, a registered dietitian provided a full nutritional intervention. The
program aimed to balance macronutrients and to achieve a
daily amount of proteins of 1.5 g per kg. Additionally, participantswereprovidedwithawheyproteinsupplementandwere
instructedtoingest30gwithin1hourafterthein-hospitaltrainingsessionand1hourbeforesleepingdaily.VitaminDandmultivitamin supplements were also provided.
Anxiety-coping interventions consisted of relaxation techniques and deep breathing exercises provided by psychologytrained personnel in a 1-to-1 session. If a high risk of mental
distresswasdetectedbymedicalhistoryand/orbaselinescores
oftheGeneralizedAnxietyDisorder7-itemscaleof10orhigher
or Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item of 15 or higher, participants were additionally referred to a medical psychologist.
Asmokingcessationprogramwasoffered,ifindicated.Theprogram consisted of individual counseling and nicotine replacement therapy.

#### Standard Care
Participants were treated per local perioperative standard of
care. All study sites followed a well-adopted enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway to minimize heterogeneity
in perioperative care.[27] Scheduling of surgery was not affected by study participation. Participants in the standard care
group did not receive any additional counseling on exercise,
nutrition, or mental health.

#### Primary Outcomes
The coprimary outcomes were 30-day postoperative complications determined using the Comprehensive Complication
Index (CCI) and postoperative 6-minute walking distance
(6-MWD) that was measured with the 6-minute walking test
(6-MWT).
The CCI is a validated measurement of postoperative morbidity/mortality that weighs all complications using the
Clavien-Dindo classification into a sum score ranging from 0
(no complication) to 100 (death).[28] Based on our preliminary
studies using a similar surgical population,[29] a CCI score more
than 20 was chosen to define severe complication that impacted postoperative surgical outcome. (This is deviating from
the analyses planned in the protocol because the CCI is a zeroinflated highly skewed distribution that cannot be correctly
analyzed as a continuous variable with tests for comparing locations. We will include the results of the initially planned


analysis among the sensitivity analyses.) Functional capacity
was measured with the 6-MWT, which reliably quantified exercise tolerance in the colorectal surgical population.[30,31] Our
end point was the change in meters walked over the 6 minutes (6-MWD) between baseline and 4 weeks after surgery.

#### Secondary Outcomes
Prespecified secondary outcomes consisted of surgical and
functional end points and health-related quality of life. In additiontothe6-MWD,functionalcapacitywasanalyzedbymeasuring domains of physical, nutritional, and mental status.
CPET, a criterion standard test for cardiorespiratory fitness,[24]

defined the oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold
(V[˙] O2AT) and at peak exercise (peak V[˙] O2). Strength was determined with the indirect 1 RM and handgrip strength. Nutritional status was assessed using the Patient-Generated
SubjectiveGlobalAssessment.[32] Mentalhealthstatuswasmeasured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and
the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item. Finally, healthrelated quality of life was determined with the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality
Of Life Of Cancer Patients C30 Module global health status
subscale.
These assessments were performed at baseline, preoperatively (approximately 4 weeks after baseline), and 4 and (exceptforCPET)8weeksaftersurgery.Surgicaloutcomes,evaluated 30 days after surgery, included length of hospital stay,
readmissions, and mortality.
Compliance to the exercise training was assessed as follows. Participants could receive a maximum of 12 supervised
sessions (including both baseline and preoperative assessment). When at least 9 of these 12 sessions were completed,
participants were considered to be compliant to the exercise
intervention (regardless of reasons for missing sessions). Subsequently, the period between baseline 6-MWT and preoperative 6-MWT had to be between 3 and 8 weeks.

#### Sample Size
Sample size calculation was based on the mean (SD) CCI
(10.4 [14]) in our population. We considered a decrease of the
CCI of 30% as clinically meaningful. Using an α of 0.05, power
of 0.80 (2-sided test), and expecting a dropout rate of 10%, an
estimated 714 (357 per arm) sample size was aimed for. This
sample size was considered to be sufficient to demonstrate a
difference in the coprimary outcome (6-MWD).

#### Premature Termination of the Trial
Due to the intercurrent COVID-19 pandemic, continuation of
the trial was deemed unsafe and not feasible due to restrictions imposed by governments and downscaling of nonemergent care. The trial was therefore put on hold for an indefinite
period of time. As any perspective on full resumption of inclusion was lacking, the principal investigators decided to terminate the trial prematurely.

#### Data Collection and Monitoring
Data were collected by local investigators or professional data
managers and entered into an electronic case report form cre

ated in ResearchManager. Due to the behavioral nature of the
intervention, blinding was not feasible for either participants, investigators, or health care professionals prescribing
or delivering prehabilitation. Outcome assessors who performed medical record reviews to score postoperative complications were blinded. The database was monitored, queried,cleaned,andvalidatedbytheNetherlandsComprehensive
Cancer Organisation.

#### Statistical Analyses
Summary statistics were reported per arm. Medians with IQRs
for numeric variables, counts and percentages for categorical
data, and percentages for missing data were reported. An intention-to-treat approach was used.
The binary outcome variables were analyzed with the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to estimate an odds ratio (OR)
corrected for sites. For the cross-sectional numerical outcome variable, a generalized linear model with a gamma distributionandidentitylinkfunctionwasused,correctedforsite.
The longitudinal outcome variables were analyzed with generalizedestimatingequationsusingtheempiricalsandwichestimator,thenormaldistribution,theidentitylinkfunction,and
an exchangeable variance-covariance working matrix. The factors time and site were treated as fixed effects.
The primary analyses were repeated in a per-protocol
analysis, excluding patients with an ASA score of IV, with minimal surgery, from the Danish sites (Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group Performance Scale score >0), and 2 patients
in the control who completed the prehabilitation program.
We also performed a Mann-Whitney U test on the CCI
scores and compared the occurrence of medical and surgical
complications with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. For the
6-MWD, we conducted a missing not at random imputation.
In addition, we repeated the primary analyses on subgroups:
high/lower risk (CPET) and colonic/rectal cancer. We applied
a significance level of α = 0.05 for all tests. All analyses were
conducted with the SAS software package, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute).

### Results

Of 1240 patients screened between June 2017 and December
2020, 269 participants consented to study participation. They
were randomly assigned to either prehabilitation or standard
care. Follow-up was completed in December 2021. A total of
18 participants were excluded from analysis because they did
not undergo colorectal surgery (prehabilitation, n = 2; standard care, n = 2), they did not have any surgery at all (prehabilitation, n = 10; standard care, n = 3), or data were completelymissingduetotheCOVID-19pandemic(prehabilitation,
n = 1) (Figure 1). Hence, 251 participants were included in the
intention-to-treat population (prehabilitation, n = 123; standard care, n = 128). Seven of 123 participants (5.7%) experienced adverse events consisting mainly of lightheadedness or
nausea due to the exercise intervention (n = 4) or protein
supplements (n = 3), respectively. However, no serious adverse events related to the program occurred. A total of 95 of


123 (77.2%; missing n = 5) were considered to be compliant to
the exercise intervention.
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median
(IQR) age was 69 (60-76) years. Cancer was located in the colon in 206 of 251 participants (82.1%). Most surgical proceduresoccurredviaaminimalinvasiveoperativetechnique(234
of 251 participants [93.2%]). Overall baseline functional capacity was similar between groups.

#### Primary Outcomes
Complications
At 30 days after surgery, 149 complications had occurred in 93
of 251 patients (37.1%). The rate of severe complications was

38 of 128 [29.7%]; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P = .02). The
post hoc power was observed to be only 64%. Overall, 39 of
123 patients (31.7%) in prehabilitation experienced complications vs 54 of 128 (42.2%) in standard care (OR, 0.62 [95% CI,
0.37-1.05]; P = .07), with comparable grading (median [IQR]

Functional Walking Capacity
The mean difference in 6-MWD between the 2 arms 4 weeks
postoperatively after correcting for baseline was 15.6 m
(95% CI, −1.4 to 32.6; P = .07; Table 2).

#### Secondary Outcomes
Surgical Outcomes
There was no difference in length of hospital stay (median

[IQR], 3 [3-5] days in prehabilitation vs 3 [3-4] days in standard care; P = .20) or hospital readmission rate (prehabilitationgroup:4of123[3.3%];standardcaregroup:8of128[6.3%];
OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.15-1.72]; P = .26). Admission to the intensive care unit was less frequent after prehabilitation (4 of 123

[3.3%] in the prehabilitation group vs 14 of 128 [10.9%] in the
control group; OR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.09-0.89]; P = .02). One participant in the prehabilitation group died within 30 days after
surgery as a result of colorectal anastomotic leakage.

### Discussion

The findings of the present randomized clinical trial showed
a reduced rate of severe and medical complications following
a 4-week multimodal prehabilitation program. Postoperative
walking capacity, 1 RM, CPET, and handgrip strength were
greater in the prehabilitation group.
Fordecades,researchhasfocusedoninterventionstolower
postoperative complications. Prehabilitation aims to increase functional capacity and fasten postoperative recovery. Two recently published randomized clinical trials describe a 50% reduction of complications after prehabilitation
in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal and colorectal surgery.[10,33] Meanwhile, other trials studying both unimodal and multimodal prehabilitation programs for colorectal (cancer) surgery did not find any differences regarding
complication rate.[34-36] Such discrepancy might be explained
by the low sample size studied and heterogeneous design.
In the present study, the number of severe complications
(CCI score >20 considered clinically meaningful) dropped by

almost 50% after prehabilitation.[22,29] A reduction of medical
complications was also reported by others and it aligns with
thehypothesisthatprehabilitationespeciallyaddressesthecardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic balance.[37] However, the
exact mechanisms are unclear.
Improved cardiorespiratory fitness before surgery is believed to increase physiological reserve and the patient’s resilience to withstand any stress related to surgery.[38] Furthermore, higher functional capacity is independently associated
with a lower risk of developing postoperative complications
in patients with colorectal cancer.[29,38,39] While other researchgroupsdemonstratedimproved6-MWDorCPETparameters in the preoperative period due to prehabilitation,[15,33] the
current study only showed a nonsignificant improvement in
anaerobic threshold.
An important aim of prehabilitation is to improve functional capacity to enhance postoperative recovery. Three randomized clinical trials containing a similar multimodal prehabilitation program were included in a recently published
Cochrane review.[20] The review concluded that the data were
heterogeneous. However, multimodal prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity both preoperatively
andpostoperativelywithmeandifferencesexceedingtheclinically meaningful 20-m cutoff level determined with the
6-MWT.[32]

The current study results show an enhanced recovery of
functional capacity in the postoperative period. Although not
significant, mean walking distance 4 weeks postoperatively remained above baseline level in the prehabilitation group but
seemed to drop beneath baseline results in the control group.
Thenumberofpatientsimprovingatleast20mcomparedwith
baseline was higher after multimodal prehabilitation. During
the assessment 8 weeks after surgery, 6-MWD differed statistically between groups, in favor of prehabilitation.
The V[˙] O2AT and peak V[˙] O2 values significantly differed between groups 4 weeks after surgery favoring the prehabilitation group. While the prehabilitation group improved on their
baseline test results, the control group did not. In addition, in

also differed significantly between groups considering the
change from baseline during assessment 8 weeks after surgery. All in all, prehabilitation leads to faster recovery to baseline, even exceeding baseline values and this was not seen in
the control patients.
To our knowledge, the current study is the largest RCT on
multimodal prehabilitation for colorectal cancer surgery thus
far. The high-intensity supervised in-hospital prehabilitation
program is deemed safe, as only 5.7% minor adverse events
and no serious adverse events occurred. Mean CCI score and
length of hospital stay were relatively low in our population,
perhaps partially explained by the large number of right col

ectomies (49.8%) and the fact that nearly all patients received minimal invasive surgery. The low overall mean CCI
score contrasts with other studies.[33,35,36] The interobserver
variability in reporting CCI score can account for some of the
CCI score differences. Length of hospital stay was also consid

erably lower compared with another study.[36] The participating hospitals had ERAS protocols in place for several years and

decades. While ERAS interventions mainly focus on perioperative and postoperative factors, prehabilitation is an intuitive
addition to this approach.

#### Limitations
Thefindingsofthecurrenttrialshouldbeinterpretedwithcaution.Themainlimitationisthefactthattheprespecifiedsample
size was not reached. Consequently, lack of power may distort the effect of prehabilitation on our primary and main secondary outcomes. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, trial completion was deemed unfeasible within a
reasonable period. It was deemed unsafe for patients to have
frequent in-hospital sessions. Therefore, we decided to terminate the study prematurely. Adjusting the protocol to a
home-based program was not an option as a large heterogeneity regarding the interventions was anticipated. Additionally,studypopulationswerelikelydifferentcomparedwiththe
pre–COVID-19 period since patients became more inactive due
to government restrictions. A delay in treatment as a result of
downscaling non–COVID-19 health care might also have re

sulted in more advanced tumors.[40] We did not include an unforeseen circumstances scenario in our study protocol, perhaps a learning point for future trial initiators.
Another limitation is the open-label design of the trial. Participants and the outcome assessors (except for the CCI score)
were not blinded, partially due to the nature of the interventions. Risk of performance bias can therefore not be excluded. Finally, missing values were more frequent than anticipated for the coprimary and secondary outcomes, although
secondary analyses with imputation confirmed the results of
the main analyses.

### Conclusions

A 4-week in-hospital multimodal prehabilitation program for
patients undergoing elective resection of nonmetastasized colorectal cancer decreased the number of severe and medical
