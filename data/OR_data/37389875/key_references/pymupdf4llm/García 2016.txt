**Abstract**
**Objectives: To investigate the effects of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme in patients**
with lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
**Design: Randomized, single-blind controlled trial.**
**Setting: Teaching hospital.**
**Subjects: Patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.**
**Intervention:** Participants were randomized to either a prehabilitation group or a control group.
Participants in the prehabilitation group underwent a combination of moderate endurance and resistance
training plus breathing exercises three to five times per week.
**Main measures: The primary outcome of the study was exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were**
muscle strength (Senior Fitness Test), health-related quality of life (Short-Form 36) and the postoperative
outcomes. Patients were evaluated at baseline (before randomization), presurgery (only the prehabilitation
group), after surgery and three months post-operatively.
**Results: A total of 40 patients were randomized and 22 finished the study (10 in the prehabilitation group**
and 12 in the control group). Three patients were lost to follow-up at three months. After the training,
there was a statistically significant improvement in exercise tolerance (+397 seconds, _p = 0.0001), the_
physical summary component of the SF-36 (+4.4 points, p = 0.008) and muscle strength (p < 0.01). There
were no significant differences between groups after surgery. However, three months postoperatively,
significant differences were found in the mean change of exercise capacity (p = 0.005), physical summary
component (p = 0.001) and upper and lower body strength (p = 0.045 and p = 0.002).
**Conclusions: A pulmonary rehabilitation programme before video-assisted thoracic surgery seems to**
improve patients’ preoperative condition and may prevent functional decline after surgery.

## Introduction


Lung resection surgery is regarded as the optimal
treatment for non-small cell lung cancer,[1] but considerable morbidity is associated especially among
individuals with poor preoperative status.[2] Newly
diagnosed lung cancer patients are known to frequently exhibit poor cardiopulmonary fitness, low
physical activity levels and an impaired healthrelated quality of life that can be further aggravated after lung resection surgery.[3] Both the
health-related quality of life and the preoperative
cardiorespiratory fitness are two modifiable factors in the preoperative period that are strongly
associated with postoperative mortality, morbidity
and overall survival in patients with early nonsmall cell lung cancer.[4,5] Preoperative pulmonary
rehabilitation has been recommended as a preoptimization measure before thoracic surgery[6] and
preliminary studies have shown that pulmonary
rehabilitation can improve exercise tolerance,
functional capacity and pulmonary function.[7,8]
Furthermore, a recent systematic review and metaanalysis has found that preoperative exercise training can reduce hospital stay and postoperative
complications in patients undergoing thoracotomy
for non-small cell lung cancer.[9] However, none of
these studies have been conducted exclusively in
patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures, which are known to ameliorate the impact
associated with lung resection surgery and enhance
postoperative recovery. Thus, with the advent of
video-assisted thoracic surgery to resect lung
tumours, there is an urge to determine whether or
not pulmonary prehabilitation should be encouraged in this particular context.
Therefore, the aims of this study were: (1) to
assess the effects of a preoperative pulmonary
rehabilitation programme on exercise capacity,
muscle strength and health-related quality of life in
patients awaiting lung cancer surgery; and (2) to
determine the effectiveness of the intervention in


enhancing postoperative recovery after videoassisted thoracic surgery in comparison with the
standard care.

## Materials and methods

 Design

This study was a randomized (1:1), assessor-blind
controlled trial conducted at the University
Hospital of A Coruña (Spain). The research protocol was designed according to the CONSORT
guidelines (see CONSORT checklist) and was
approved by the local Ethics Committee (CEIC
Galicia, 2011/395). The protocol was registered in
the database of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov)
under the registration number NCT01963923.

## Participants

From October 2013 to April 2015, lung cancer
patients who were considered for lung resection
surgery at the Thoracic Surgery Department of the
University Hospital of A Coruña were assessed for
eligibility. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are
summarized in Table 1.
Potentially eligible patients were contacted by
phone and then scheduled for an interview with a
specialized physiotherapist. Those who agreed to
participate gave written informed consent prior to
any formal testing.

## Randomization and blinding

Randomization was undertaken using a randombased computer programme (Epidat[®] v3.1 Xunta
de Galicia, 2005) with an allocation ratio of 1:1.
Individual allocations were placed in consecutively
numbered and sealed opaque envelopes by a third
person not involved in the study.

**Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.**

Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria



- Adults (⩾18 years old)

- Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC.

- At least one of the following: (a) FEV1 ⩽80% of
predicted value; (b) BMI ⩾30; (c) age ⩾75 years or (d)
two or more co-morbidities identified in the Colinet
Comorbidity Score.

- Distance to the facility centre ⩽80 km.

NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; FEV1: forced expiratory volume in the 1 second; BMI: body mass index.


The baseline assessment was performed by the
physiotherapist supervising the training programme; however, group allocation was only
revealed to the physiotherapist after the initial evaluations were completed, ensuring the blindness of
the assessment. Postoperative evaluations were
performed by two independent physiotherapists
who were specifically trained to perform the outcome measurements and who were unaware of the
patients’ allocation.

## Sample size estimation

This study was powered to detect a difference in
exercise capacity of 100 seconds between groups
during the first postoperative evaluation (three
weeks after surgery). This difference has been previously reported as the minimal clinically important
difference for this outcome.[10] To detect this difference with a probability of α = 0.05 and power = 80%,
using a bilateral hypothesis and estimating a 10%
drop-out rate, 11 patients were required per group.
Sample size calculation was performed using the
Epidat[®] v3.1 Xunta de Galicia, 2005.

## Intervention

Eligible patients were randomly allocated to the
preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme
(prehabilitation group) or to the standard care (control group). Participants in the control group
received usual care (no exercise training), while the
prehabilitation group engaged in a one-hour supervised pulmonary rehabilitation programme three to
five times per week depending on the surgery date.


The pulmonary rehabilitation programme took
place in the rehabilitation room at the University
Hospital of A Coruña and consisted of a combination of moderate endurance and resistance training
according to the current guidelines.[11] The intervention was supervised by a highly specialized physiotherapist with an expertise in respiratory
physiotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation.
Endurance training was performed using a calibrated cycle-ergometer (Monark 818 E, Monark
Exercise AB, Sweden) with an initial targeted
duration of 30 minutes. Training load (Watts) was
determined after a symptom-limited incremental
cycle test performed according to the international
guidelines.[12] Patients were asked to discontinue the
test owing to increased dyspnoea, muscle fatigue
or any symptom of discomfort and the maximal
workload maintained for at least 30 seconds was
recorded as the peak work load (Wpeak). Heart rate
and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored during the test; blood pressure, rate of dyspnoea and leg fatigue were only recorded at the
beginning and at the end of the test. For each training session patients were encouraged to perform
30 minutes of interval training (one minute at high
intensity (80% of Wpeak) plus four minutes of active
rest (performed at 50% of Wpeak)). A five-minute
warm-up and a four-minute cool down at 30% of
the Wpeak were also included in the 30-minute time.
At the beginning and at the end of the training,
dyspnoea and leg fatigue were logged using the
modified version of the Borg Scale.[13] After the
tenth session, intensity was re-examined during a
new incremental cycle test to adjust the Wpeak in
order to maintain an optimal training stimuli.


-----

Resistance training was performed using elastic
bands (Thera-Band[®], The Hygienic Corporation,
Akron, Ohio, USA) and body-weight exercises.
Four different bands of 1.25-m long were used in
this investigation, each one providing a different
resistance. Training load was determined using a
25-maximum repetition test, meaning that the
patient could not perform more repetitions with the
correct technique.[14] Each training session patients
performed six different exercises targeting the
main muscle groups involved in daily life activities. The goal was to perform three sets of 15 repetitions for each exercise with a 45-second rest
between sets. From the tenth onwards, the number
of repetitions was maintained and the number of
sets was increased to four if tolerated. Patients
were encourage to maintain a moderate perceived
rate of exhaustion according to the OMNIResistance Scale, which has been validated to be
use with elastic bands.[15]
In addition, patients were asked to perform
breathing exercises twice daily at home using a
volume-oriented incentive spirometer (Coach 2
Incentive Spirometer[®] 22-4000 HD, Smith
Medicals, USA). The protocol consisted of 30 sustained inspirations at 80% of the maximal Vital
Capacity (measured previously with the same
device) with an end-inspiratory hold of two to three
seconds. Patients were instructed to perform six
cycles of five repetitions each, with a one-minute
rest between cycles.

## Outcomes

The primary outcome for this study was exercise
capacity measured with a Constant-load Cycle
Endurance Test performed at 80% of the Wpeak.
To perform the test, after two minutes of unloading pedalling, patients were instructed to exercise for as long as possible until maximal
exhaustion was achieved or the patient was unable to maintain the minimal pedalling rate. If
exercise endurance exceeded more than 15 minutes the test was terminated.[16] Dyspnoea and leg
fatigue were recorded at the beginning and at the
end of the test. Heart rate and oxygen saturation
were recorded every minute.


Secondary outcomes included functional
capacity, muscle strength and the health-related
quality of life. Functional capacity was assessed
with a 6-minute walk test. The test was performed
according to the international recommendations.[17]
Duplicate tests were completed at baseline for
reliability and the maximum distance was used
for the analysis. The values achieved during the
test were compared against the Spanish reference
equations.[18]
Upper and lower body strength were also measured using two items included in the Senior Fitness
_Test initially designed by Rikli and Jones:[19] the_
_Arm Curl Test and the_ _30’s Chair-to-Stand Test._
Both tests were adapted to the metric measures
according to authors’ recommendations.
Health-related quality of life was assessed using
the second version of the Short-Form 36 Health
Survey (SF-36v2) and the results were compared
against the Spanish reference values.[18]
Postoperative outcomes, including length of
hospital stay, and the incidence of postoperative
pulmonary complications were also recorded.
Postoperative pulmonary complications were classified according to the Melbourne Group Scale,
which was specifically designed to identify those
complications that were more likely to be prevented with a physiotherapy intervention.[20]
Finally, medical and relevant sociodemographic
data including age, gender, weight, height, history
of smoking, the Colinet Co-morbidity Score
(CCS),[21] symptomatology and pulmonary function
tests were collected from the medical charts.
Patients were evaluated three times during the
study period: At baseline, after hospital discharge
and three months post-operatively. Patients in the
prehabilitation group were also evaluated immediately after the programme and before surgery.

## Statistical analysis

A descriptive analysis of the main variables in the
study was conducted for each group prior to further
analyses. Distribution was assessed using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test for each quantitative
variable in each group. Changes in the primary and
secondary variables pre- to postintervention in the


-----

prehabilitation group were assessed using a pair
_t-test (variables normally distributed). Inter-group_
comparisons for the primary and secondary outcomes (exercise capacity, muscle strength and
health-related quality of life domains) were performed using independent _t-tests. Comparison of_
length of hospital stay between groups was performed using a Mann-Whitney test. The incidence
of postoperative complications between groups
was assessed using a chi square test.
All statistical analyses were calculated using the
SPSS package for Windows (Version 22, IBM
Corporation, Chicago IL, USA) and a _p value of_
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

During the 18-month recruitment period, 319
patients were scheduled for lung resection surgery
for suspected or confirmed lung cancer at our hospital. Of those, 68 potentially eligible patients
(21.3%) were contacted and 46 (67.6%) signed
the informed consent. Six patients (13%) withdrew before randomization, therefore 40 patients
were randomized and 22 (55%) completed at least
one postoperative evaluation and were analysed
(10 patients in the prehabilitation group and 12 in
the control group). At three months, two patients
in the control group and one in the prehabilitation
group were lost to follow-up. A flow diagram of
the study selection is shown in Figure 1. The
study was closed according to the pre-approved
funding schedule.
The baseline characteristics of the participants
included in the study are shown in Table 2. Despite
the randomization, patients in the prehabilitation
group tended to have a higher body mass index,
lower pulmonary function and lower peak exercise capacity.
Mean time (SD) from baseline assessment to
surgery was 54.5 days (15.4) in the prehabilitation
group and 53.5 (20) in the control group (p = 0.899).
Patients in the prehabilitation group attended a
median of 16 sessions (range 8–25) with no adverse
events being reported. Median time from surgery
to the first and second evaluation for both groups
were 3.5 weeks (interquartile range: 1.5–4.9) and


14 weeks (interquartile range: 13.1–15.7), respectively. No significant differences were observed
between groups (p = 0.093 and _p = 0.842). All_
patients underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery
through one or two ports performed by highly
experienced surgeons. The operation report was
checked after the surgery to ensure that the surgery
was performed with the same technique. There was
only one reconversion to thoracotomy (control
group) and the patient was excluded from the
analysis.
Results of the preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme in the prehabilitation group are
shown in Table 3, while the inter-group comparison can be found in Table 4. Although no significant differences between groups were observed at
three weeks in any of the variables analysed, three
months postoperatively there were statistically significant differences in the mean change for the
exercise capacity, the physical component summary and the upper and lower muscle strength
assessment leading to two opposite trends in
patients’ recovery: While patients in the prehabilitation group were able to maintain and/or increase
their baseline values in all the parameters examined, patients in the control group exhibited a progressive decline throughout the follow-up,
especially in exercise capacity.
Finally, no significant differences were found in
the postoperative outcomes between groups.
Hospital stay was similar for both groups (two vs.
three median days in the prehabilitation and control
group respectively; _p = 0.539). Any patient was_
diagnosed with a postoperative pulmonary complication according to the Melbourne Group Scale
although 50% (n = 5) of the patients in the prehabilitation group and 66% (n = 8) in the control
group scored positively in at least one of the items
of the scale (p = 0.361).

## Discussion

The results found in our study suggest that a preoperative exercise-based programme before lung
resection surgery can effectively improve patients’
preoperative status by increasing exercise capacity,
muscle strength and the physical component of the

comparison with the standard care, it seems that
preoperative exercise training can also minimize
the physical deconditioning associated with lung
resection and accelerate functional recovery after
video-assisted thoracic surgery. However, this was
a small study with a high number of drop-outs thus
our findings must be interpreted carefully.
Nevertheless, they are proof of the principle that


preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation before
video-assisted thoracic surgery may play an important role in preventing functional decline after surgery similarly to what has been observed after open
thoracotomies.
Pulmonary rehabilitation has been recently
acknowledged as a cornerstone in the management
of patients with lung cancer.[22] To date, several
studies have consistently shown that preoperative

exercise training can increase exercise capacity,[8,23–26] functional capacity[7,25–27] and pulmonary
function[7,24,25,27] in patients with lung cancer awaiting lung resection surgery both pre to postintervention and comparing with a control group.[7,28] In our
study, we also found a significant and clinically
meaningful improvement in exercise capacity
(endurance time) of 369.6 seconds (197) pre- to
posttraining, which corresponds to a 123% increase
compared with baseline. More importantly, patients
were able to maintain this improvement after the
surgery throughout the first three months, which
contrasts with the control group who showed a progressive decline over the study period. In a similar
investigation, Coats et al.[26] also found a 60%
improvement in exercise capacity after a four-week
home-based training programme in patients awaiting video-assisted thoracic surgery. Interestingly,
in this investigation, the authors did not report any
significant change in the maximum oxygen uptake
after the training suggesting that incremental exercise tests may not be the more responsive to detect
exercise-related changes.
In addition to exercise capacity, we also found a
significant improvement both in upper and lower
muscle strength after the training. In a previous
pilot study, our group already showed that elastic
bands were an effective way to improve muscle
strength in patients with lung cancer.[29] Although
resistance training is more commonly delivered
using free weights or weight machines, the use of
low-tech equipment is gaining more popularity.
Several studies have found that elastic bands are as
effective as traditional equipment to improve muscle strength in sedentary older adults[30] and those
with chronic respiratory diseases,[31] including
patients with lung cancer.[32] The results obtained in
this randomized controlled trial are in line with
these previous investigations and further reinforce
that low-cost training is a valid alternative for
improving muscle strength in this population.
On the other hand, the effects of exercise
training in health-related quality of life appear
less clear. Previous systematic reviews conducted among patients with lung cancer have
highlighted the lack of consistency among studies regarding the effectiveness of exercise


training on this outcome.[9,33] The results of this
randomized controlled trial, however, indicate
that a preoperative intervention focused on
endurance and strength training can significantly
improve the physical role and the physical component summary prior to lung resection surgery.
This finding is of great interest given that the
preoperative physical component summary is
associated with overall and cancer-specific survival in patients with stage I Non-Small Cell
Lung Cancer.[5] More importantly, the increase in
the physical component summary was also sustained throughout the first three months after the
surgery in comparison with the control group
who showed the opposite tendency.
Finally, preoperative exercise training has
shown the potential of enhancing postoperative
recovery and reduce in-hospital costs in patients
undergoing cardiothoracic and abdominal surgery.[9,34] Particularly, in patients undergoing lung
resection surgery, our group found that there was
a reduction of almost five days in hospital stay
(mean difference = 4.83 days, 95% CI: 3.8 to 5.9)
and a 55% reduction in the relative risk for postoperative complications in those patients undergoing preoperative exercise training.[9] However,
in this study, we could not find any significant
difference between groups neither in hospital
stay nor in the postoperative complications. This
finding can be explained by several factors
including the experience of the thoracic surgery
team plus the low-risk profile of the patients
included in our study.
Our study has several limitations that must be
acknowledged. First of all, the study included
patients with suspected (clinical) or confirmed
lung cancer (histological biopsy), which resulted in
some patients being diagnosed with lung metastases or benign disease. Despite randomization,
patients in the prehabilitation group had poorer
pulmonary function and a higher body mass index,
which resulted in a higher percentage of them
undergoing a sub-lobar resection than those in the
control group. However, the differences were not
statistically significant (p = 0.229) and a univariate
general linear model showed no interaction
between the exercise capacity and the extent of the


-----

resection (data not shown). It is also important to
acknowledge the high number of drop-outs in this
study and the potential implications. Of the 20
patients randomized to the prehabilitation group,
only 50% completed the study, which lead us to
perform a per-protocol analysis instead of an intention-to-treat analysis owing to the large percentage
of patients with relevant missing data. On the
bright side, this low completion rate had little to do
with the preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation
programme, which was well tolerated and related
to no adverse events.


**Clinical messages**

- Our results suggest that a preoperative
exercise-based programme can improve
exercise capacity, muscle strength and
the physical component of the healthrelated quality of life in patients with
lung cancer.

- In these patients, preoperative exercise
training could play an important role in
preventing functional decline after surgery enhancing postoperative recovery.
