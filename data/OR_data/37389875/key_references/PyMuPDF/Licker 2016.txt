Abstract  (Word count = 270) 
Background: Impairment in aerobic fitness is a potential modifiable risk factor for 
postoperative complications. In this randomized controlled trial, we hypothesized that a high-
intensity interval training (HIIT) program enhances cardiorespiratory fitness before lung 
cancer surgery and therefore reduces the risk of postoperative complications.  
Methods: Patients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC, 
N=77) or preoperative rehabilitation based on HIIT (Rehab, N=74). Maximal 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the six-minute walk test were performed twice before 
surgery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and in-hospital 
postoperative complications. . 
Results: Groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the 
preoperative waiting period (median 25 days), the peak oxygen consumption (peakVO2) and 
the six-minute walking distance increased (respectively, median +15 % [IQ 25-75%, +9 to 
+22%] P=0.003 and +15% [IQ25-75, +8 to +28%], P<0.001) in the Rehab group whereas 
VO2peak declined in the UC group (median -8% [IQ25-75, -16 to 0%], P=0.005). The primary 
endpoint did not differ significantly between the two groups: 27 of the 74 patients (35.5%) in 
the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6%) in the UC group developed at least one 
postoperative complication (P=0.080). Noteworthy, the incidence of pulmonary complications 
was lower in the Rehab compared with the UC group (23% vs 44%, P=0.018), owing to a 
significant reduction in atelectasis (12.2% vs 36.4%, P<0.001) and this was accompanied by a 
shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (median -7 hours, IQ25-75% -4 to -10). 
Conclusions: In this RCT, preoperative HIIT resulted in significant improvement in aerobic 
performances but failed to reduce early complications after lung cancer resection.

Introduction  
Currently, surgical resection remains the best treatment in the early stages of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).1 Advanced age, cancer stage, associated illnesses and impaired 
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are predictive factors of major postoperative complications 
and long term survival.2,3  
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) represents the gold standard for evaluating CRF 
and the response to rehabilitation program.4 Peak oxygen uptake (peakVO2) reflects the 
integrative ability of the pulmonary, circulatory and autonomic neural systems to maximally 
deliver oxygen towards the working skeletal muscles. Cut-off values around 16 ml.kg-1.min-1 
peakVO2 peak and 10-12 ml/kg/min anaerobic threshold (AT) have been shown helpful to 
discriminate patients at low risk from those at higher risk of major postoperative 
complications.2,5  
In patients with lung cancer, peakVO2 is on average 25% to 30% lower than in age-and 
gender matched non-cancer individuals.2,6,7 Although implementation of exercise-based 
rehabilitation programs has been shown effective in improving CRF and quality of life of 
these patients, rehabilitation is largely underutilized because of scarce scientific evidence and 
uncertainties regarding the modalities on how to implement physical therapy over the limited 
preoperative time period.8-11 Recent evidence has highlighted the potential of low-volume, 
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for inducing a protective cardiopulmonary phenotype 
while enhancing oxygen extraction in skeletal muscle by increasing capillary density and 
mitochondrial oxidative capacity.12,13 
In this trial, we aimed to evaluate and compare short-term preoperative HIIT to usual care in 
patients undergoing NSCLC resection by assessing CRF parameters and the incidence of 
postoperative complications. We hypothesized that exercise-induced improvement in CRF

would enhance protective defense mechanisms among surgical candidates making them more 
resistant to physiological alterations consequent to surgical stress.  
Methods 
Study Design 
The Lung Cancer Rehabilitation Study was a prospective randomized open blinded end point 
controlled trial (PROBE) using assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. It was 
registered at the National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT01258478).and 
conducted at the University Hospital of Geneva and the Hospital of Valais.  
Patients 
After approval by the Local Ethics Committees (protocol n° 06-225), written informed 
consent was obtained from all eligible adult patients with proven or suspected NSCLC, stage 
IIIA or less. The criteria of resectability were based on the recommendations of the European 
Respiratory Society and the European Society of Thoracic Surgery (ERS and ESTS).4 
Exclusion criteria were any contraindication to perform CPET (e.g., uncontrolled cardiac 
disease, severe pulmonary hypertension), limitations impeding cycling or the inability to 
adhere to a rehabilitation program.  
Randomization  
Consenting patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis into a Rehabilitation arm (Rehab) and a 
Usual Care arm (UC) using permuted block of 4. The randomization sequence was developed 
before the initiation of the trial and concealed until after enrollment.  
Interventions  
Adapted from previous published data,14 the HIIT program was designed in cooperation with 
experienced physical therapists specialized in rehabilitation. Participants in the Rehab group

exercised on a cycling ergometer in the outpatient clinic, two to three times a week under the 
supervision of physiotherapists. After a 5 min warm-up period at 50% of peak work rate 
(WR) the patients completed two 10 min long series of 15 sec sprint intervals (at 80-100% 
peakWR) interspersed by 15 sec pauses and a 4 min rest between the two series. The patients 
then cooled down with a 5 min active recovery period at 30% peakWR. The work rate was 
adjusted by the physiotherapist on each session to target near maximal heart rates towards the 
end of each series of sprints based on the individual’s exercise response. Additional exercises 
were proposed on an individual basis, such as leg press, leg extension, back extension, seat 
row, biceps curls or chest-and-shoulder press.  
Patients in the two groups were given advices regarding active mobilization (at least four 30-
min walk per week) and risk factor management (e.g., healthy nutrition, smoking and alcohol 
cessation).  
Lung resections were performed by open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery and, 
standardized perioperative interventions included antibiotic prophylaxis, restrictive fluid 
management, thoracic epidural analgesia and protective lung ventilation.15 After surgery, 
patients were managed in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were transferred to the 
surgical ward when the discharge criteria were met.16 Routine postoperative physiotherapy 
consisted in deep breathing using an incentive spirometer, coughing exercise and assistance 
with ambulation. 
Measurements and Outcomes 
The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was conducted by physiotherapists according to the ERS 
and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.17 A symptom-limited CPET was 
performed on an upright electronically braked cycle ergometer with breath-by-breath expired 
gas analysis (SensorMedics Model 2200 SP; Yorba Linda, CA); peakHR and peakVO2 were 
determined as the highest average values over 30 sec and peakWR was identified at the

highest exercise level or, interpolated if the last stage was not maintained for two minutes.18 
Peak oxygen pulse (peakO2pulse) was calculated by dividing peakV̇ O2 by the peakHR. The 
AT was determined using the V-slope method as primary criterion and the first rise in the 
ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO2) as a secondary criterion.19  
All respiratory function tests and physiologic measurements were performed according to the 
ATS and ERS standards, and expressed as absolute and predicted values (%) based on age, 
sex, and weight of the patients.20 Age and sex-specific predicted distances during the 6MWT 
were calculated from the Enright’s equation.21 
On the day of enrollment, collected data included demographic and clinical information as 
well as the results of lung functional and blood laboratory tests. The Revised Cardiac Risk 
Index was computed for each patient.22 Two to four days before surgery (after the 
rehabilitation or control period), the CPET and the 6MWT were repeated and a multi-axis 
accelerometer (ActiSmile SA, Baar, Switzerland) was used to estimate daily physical activity 
(average value of the last three days prior to surgery).  
Surgical and anesthetic data were extracted from the electronic Patient Data Management 
System. Postoperatively, patients were followed until hospital discharge to report any adverse 
events according to a modified version of the Thoracic Mortality and Morbidity (TMM) 
classification system (see supplemental material).23 
The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of postoperative morbidity (30-day mortality 
or any complications TMM grades > 2). Secondary outcomes were the preoperative changes 
in CPET parameters (peakVO2, AT, peakHR) and in 6MWT (in meters, m), the incidence of 
postoperative complications TMM grades > 2, the length of stay in PACU and the admission 
rate in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A positive response to rehabilitation was defined by 
meaningful changes in VO2peak (>10%) or in 6MWT (>30 m) occurring between the first and

the second preoperative measurements.17,24 Adherence to the HIIT program was defined as the 
ratio of the number of attended-to-prescribed sessions. All serious adverse events (SAE) 
during the HIIT were reported to the study coordinator and the data monitoring and safety 
committee (DMSC) 
Sample size 
Based on a previous cohort study, we assumed an incidence of 22% complications and 
expected a 50% reduction of postoperative morbidity after implementing preoperative 
rehabilitation.15 A sample of 178 patients per group was required (80% power; 2-sided test; 
type I error of 0.05) and to allow for dropouts, we intended to randomize 400 patients (200 
per group). Given concerns regarding the occurrence of SAE and a possible changing pattern 
of clinical outcome, two interim analyses were planned after the inclusion of 120 and 240 
patients as recommended by the DMSC. Stopping/continuing rules were based on the 
followings: SAE related to the HIIT, changes in the rate of postoperative complications and 
between-group difference in primary endpoint or in at least 2 secondary endpoints. The first 
interim showed an overall incidence of 46% complications, therefore 44 additional patients 
were deemed necessary to complete the study. 
Statistical Analysis 
All data were analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 
USA) and tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov for normality. Summary descriptive statistics 
were expressed as frequencies (and percentages, %), medians (and interquartile range, IQ25-
75%), or means (and standard deviations, SD). Intergroup differences were analyzed by two-
sided unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, or χ2 test with Yates corrections where appropriate. 
Physiologically important changes were estimated as effect sizes (ES) using Cohen’s 
guidelines,25 whereby a value of 0.2 denotes a small, 0.5 a medium, and 0.8 a large effect size.

The ES induced by the intervention was calculated by subtracting the mean changes in the UC 
group from the mean change in the Rehab group divided by the pooled standard deviation. 
Prespecified analyses using a generalized linear model were conducted to explore 
modification of HIIT response by patient’s characteristics and cancer stages as well as the 
impact of these variables on the occurrence of postoperative complications. All statistical tests 
were 2-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level.

Results 
Study population 
Between October 2011 and October 2014, 189 patients were screened, 164 provided consent 
and 13 were excluded (Figure 1). Therefore, 151 patients were analyzed, 77 in the UC group 
and 74 in the Rehab group. The time delay from the date of enrollment to surgery was similar 
in the two groups (median of 26 days [IQ25-75, 21-33] in the Rehab group and median of 25 
days [IQ25-75, 20-40] in the UC group). 
The two groups did not differ regarding preoperative demographic, clinical and functional 
data (Tables 1 and 2). Surgical characteristics and anesthetic management were also similar in 
the two groups: more than 80% of patients underwent major lung resection through open 
thoracotomy and received thoracic epidural analgesia (Table 3). In the Rehab group, 
adherence to the prescribed training sessions was 87±18% (median 8 sessions, IQ25-75 [7-
10]) and no serious adverse event was reported during the HIIT sessions. The daily step count 
tended to be higher in the Rehab group (7’243±3’934 steps versus 6’315±3’690 steps in the 
UC group, P=0.082).  
Primary Outcome  
In-hospital clinical outcome data were available in all participants. As shown in Table 4, a 
total of 66 patients reached the composite postoperative mortality-morbidity endpoint 
including 27 of the 74 patients (35.5%) in the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6%) in 
the UC group (Relative Risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.48 – 1.02). 
Secondary outcomes 
Compared with baseline measurements, significant changes in CPET and 6MWT parameters 
occurred at the end of the preoperative waiting period (table 5). In the UC group, the peakVO2 
declined during the preoperative waiting period (median -8% [IQ25-75, -16 to 0%], P=0.005).

In contrast, in the Rehab group, there were significant increases in peakVO2 (median +15 % 
[IQ25-75%, +9 to +22%], P=0.004), in peakWR (median +6% [IQ25-75, 0 to +17%]; 
P=0.003), and in walking distance at the 6MWT (median +15% [IQ25-75, +8 to +28%], 
P<0.001) with a non-significant increase in AT (median +8 % [IQ25-75, -7 to + 20%, 
P=0.083)]. The effect size of the Rehab intervention was significant regarding peakVO2 (0.46, 
95%CI 0.26 to 0.66) and walking distance (0.49, 0.24 to 0.74), and non-significant regarding 
the AT (0.20, -0.95 to 0.45), peak O2 pulse (0.29, -0.99 to 0.59), peakHR (0.15, -0.94 to 0.36) 
and peakWR (0.28, -0.98 to 0.58). The target physiological endpoints were achieved in 75.7% 
of rehabilitated patients and this functional improvement was consistent regardless of patient 
characteristics and cancer stages (Figure 2). Attendance to the prescribed training sessions did 
not differ between responders and non-responders (89% vs 81%).  
The incidence of cardiovascular and surgical complications as well as the rate of admission in 
the ICU and the hospital length of stay did not differ between the two groups. In contrast, the 
incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was lower in the Rehab group (23% vs 
44% in the UC group P=0.018), owing to a reduced rate of atelectasis (12.2% vs 36.4%, 
P<0.001) and this was accompanied by a shorter stay in the PACU (median -7 hours, IQ25-
75% -4 to -10) compared with the UC group. Subgroup analysis revealed that the beneficial 
effect of Rehab on postoperative pulmonary complications was larger among “responders” 
than in “non-responders” (RR 0.25, 95%CI [0.12-0.53]) and consistent among men, elderly, 
overweight subjects, patients with cardiac risks factors, those with preserved aerobic capacity 
and regardless of the presence or absence of COPD (Figure 3).  
Regression analysis showed that independent predictors of postoperative pulmonary 
complications were: preoperative peakVO2, rehabilitation intervention, and COPD (Wald = 
10.0, 7.5, and 4.1; P= 0.002, 0.006 and, 0.043, respectively).

Discussion 
This study demonstrates that preparing patients before lung cancer resection with a HIIT 
program enhances their physical fitness but fails to improve postoperative clinical outcome.   
At patient enrollment, the mean peakVO2 (20 ml/kg/min) and the mean 6MWT distance (383 
m) were on average, respectively 18% and 42% below values expected for age- and sex-
matched sedentary individuals. In a multicenter trial including 346 patients with NSLC, 
Loewen et al. reported even greater preoperative impairment in aerobic capacity (mean 
VO2peak of 15.8 ml/kg/min) and a larger proportion of patients with low preoperative VO2peak 
that has been shown to be predictive of major cardiopulmonary complications.2,26 In contrast 
to chronic conditions such as COPD and cardiovascular disease, poor aerobic fitness, as well 
as heavy smoking and alcohol absorption are amenable to targeted risk-reducing strategies. 
Therefore, our short-term HIIT program was intended to augment preoperative physiological 
reserves and to facilitate postoperative functional recovery. The delay from “decision-to-treat” 
to surgery was within the maximal waiting time of 28 days recommended by the British 
Thoracic Society.27 During the three to four weeks waiting period, patients receiving usual 
care exhibited a mild decline in CPET parameters and walking capacity that could be 
attributed to the inflammatory component associated with lung cancer, COPD and other 
chronic illnesses.28 This impairment in aerobic functional capacity was successfully offset in 
76% patients who were enrolled in a HIIT program. After attending 7 to 13 supervised 
training sessions, both peakVO2 and walking capacity improved by a median value of 15%, 
regardless of patient preoperative characteristics.  Baseline physiological values as well as the 
intensity, the type and the duration of exercise training are key factors determining CRF 
changes. Endurance training classically entails moderate intensity efforts during daily 
sessions lasting 60 to 120 min and scheduled over a prolonged period of 6 to 12 weeks. Such 
“high volume” training has been shown to improve aerobic performances as a result of blood

volume expansion, higher cardiac output and enhanced muscle oxygen extraction.28 In 
contrast, the “low-volume” HIIT (40 min, 2-3 times a week, 3-4 weeks) has been shown to 
produce similar or larger gains in peakVO2 owing to enhanced skeletal muscle oxidative 
capacity, independent of any changes in cardiac performances and in blood-oxygen carrying 
capacity.29,30 Even a few sessions of HIIT appear sufficient to stimulate transcriptional 
mitochondrial biogenesis, inducing aerobic phenotypic changes characterized by increased 
mitochondrial expression/activity of proteins involved in fat oxidation, tricarboxylic acid 
cycle and electron transport chain.31  
In the current trial, we reported all TMM complications graded II to IV. Hence, the incidence 
of postoperative complications (overall 37%) was higher than expected from our previous 
work and higher than reported by others.15,32 The TMM classification has been derived from 
the Dindo-Clavien scoring system in order to standardize the reporting of adverse outcome 
and to overcome the limitations of considering each complication separately.33 This 
composite measure is well validated and widely applied in perioperative medicine to grade 
the severity of postoperative complications, considering the intensity of therapeutics and 
resources. In a study involving a majority of video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection, 
Beck-Schimmer et al recently reported a 15% incidence of postoperative complications 
graded III to IV.34 Besides the different threshold to capture postoperative morbidity, our 
study population was also at greater risk of postoperative complications given the more 
invasive surgical approach (81% thoracotomies) and a higher proportion of extended 
resection (e.g., 20% pneumonectomy/bilobectomy). 
Although peakVO2, peakWR and walking distance were all increased after 5 to 10 HIIT 
sessions, this enhanced aerobic condition did not translate into better clinical outcome, except 
a lower rate of atelectasis coupled with a shorter length of stay in the PACU.

Several arguments can be given to explain these findings and, at the same time, to highlight 
the limitations of this trial. One may argue that the relative risk reduction in primary outcome 
(approximately -30%) would have been statistically significant if the study had been 
continued to enroll a total of 362 patients. Down-sizing the study sample was justified by the 
interim analysis showing a higher than expected incidence of postoperative complications 
(46% instead of 22% initially estimated). Noteworthy, the majority of patients enrolled after 
the interim analysis underwent lung resection via VATS instead of open thoracotomy. This 
lesser invasive surgical approach contributed to reduce the rate of postoperative complications 
over the last 6 month of this study, regardless of group allocation.  
Cardiovascular complications did not differ between the two groups. The standard risk 
reducing strategies that were applied (e.g., preoperative patient assessment, thoracic epidural 
analgesia and fluid restriction) resulted in a low rate of myocardial infarct and heart failure (< 
5%). Not surprisingly, tachy-arrhythmias, the most frequent cardiac adverse event, were not 
responsive to the effects of rehabilitation as they are mainly related to surgical inflammation, 
autonomic nerve injuries and cardiac overload.35 Moreover, concerns have been raised about 
the pro-arrhythmic effects of HIIT although the effectiveness of long term endurance training 
has been clearly established in improving endothelial dysfunction, myocardial remodeling, 
cardiac autonomic control and β-adrenoceptor balance.36,37  
Interestingly, pulmonary complications were reduced by 45% in the Rehab group, the greatest 
impact being on atelectasis and particularly among patients who exhibited a positive response 
to HIIT. Even if atelectasis graded II are often considered benign, the initiation of corrective 
therapy with CPAP or NIV in the PACU is justified in order to correct oxygenation 
disturbances and to prevent further extension and the development of infection. In the Rehab 
group, the lesser incidence of atelectasis was associated with a slight reduction in PACU 
length of stay (median -7h), compared with the usual care group.

Reversal of respiratory muscle dysfunction is an attractive mechanism underlying the 
protective effects of HIIT in thoracic surgical patients. Indeed, weakness of the respiratory 
muscles has been consistently reported in patients with low preoperative peakVO2 and 
COPD.38 two features that were identified as independent predictors of pulmonary 
complications in the current trial. Using similar short-term total-body aerobic reconditioning 
programs, Dunham et al reported up to 40% increase in maximal inspiratory pressure, the 
HIIT modality providing a time-efficient alternative to endurance training in increasing both 
CRF and respiratory muscle function.39 
Recent systematic reviews suggest that preoperative, -but not postoperative-, interventions 
including moderate-intense aerobic exercise may contribute to improve functional capacity 
and to reduce postoperative pulmonary morbidity.40,41 However, no firm conclusions could be 
drawn given the heterogeneity of patient populations, the variety of interventional approaches, 
the lack of standardized criteria defining morbidity outcomes and the small numbers of 
enrolled patients. To date, only 5 randomized controlled trials including a total of 196 patients 
have been published and none was powered to detect meaningful clinical differences.41 The 
current study including 151 patients is the largest trial conducted so far. 
Even though this trial presents negative results regarding the primary outcome, the positive 
impact on the development of atelectasis should not be ignored nor overemphasized. Our 
results are consistent with the hypothesis that HIIT-induced CRF improvement enables 
patients to better withstand respiratory derangements, namely muscular weakness resulting 
from surgical stress and the residual effects of anesthetic agents while facilitating lung 
reexpansion postoperatively. The study was underpowered to detect meaningful difference in 
major pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or ARDS. Moreover, 25 % of 
rehabilitated patients failed to experience any benefit in terms of aerobic fitness or walking 
capacity despite attending the prescribed training sessions. Non-response to specialized

rehabilitative interventions has been attributed to genetic factors, physical disabilities, 
adjunctive chemotherapy and low volume/low intensity of exercise.42,43 Psycho-social 
interventions, inspiratory muscle training and nutritional support could favorably complement 
the rehabilitation programs.44  
In conclusion, we demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of a short-term exercise training 
program in improving aerobic performances in patients awaiting lung cancer surgery. 
However, this HIIT rehabilitation modality failed to produce significant difference in 
composite morbidity-mortality index, compared with usual care. Adequately powered 
randomized studies including high-risk patients and focusing on clinical outcome endpoints 
should question the benefits of preoperative rehabilitation interventions.
