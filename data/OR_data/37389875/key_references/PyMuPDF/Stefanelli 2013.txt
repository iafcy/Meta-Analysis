Abstract
OBJECTIVES: Peak VO2, as measure of physical performance is central to a correct preoperative evaluation in patients with both non-
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) because it is closely related both to operability criteria
and the rate of postoperative complications. Strategies to improve peak VO2, as a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme
(PRP), should be considered favourably in these patients. In order to clarify the role of pulmonary rehabilitation, we have evaluated the
effects of 3-week preoperative high-intensity training on physical performance and respiratory function in a group of patients with both
NSCLC and COPD who underwent lobectomy.
METHODS: We studied 40 patients with both NSCLC and COPD, age < 75 years, TNM stages I–II, who underwent lobectomy. Patients
were randomly divided into two groups (R and S): Group R underwent an intensive preoperative PRP, while Group S underwent only lob-
ectomy. We evaluated peak VO2 in all patients at Time 0 (T0), after PRP/before surgery in Group R/S (T1) and 60 days after surgery, respect-
ively, in both groups (T2).
RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in peak VO2 at T0, while a signiﬁcant difference was observed both at T1 and T2. In
Group R, peak VO2 improves signiﬁcantly from T0 to T1: 14.9 ± 2.3–17.8 ± 2.1 ml/kg/min ± standard deviation (SD), P < 0.001 (64.5 ± 16.5–
76.1 ± 14.9% predicted ± SD, P < 0.05) and deteriorates from T1 to T2: 17.8 ± 2.1–15.1 ± 2.4, P < 0.001 (76.1 ± 14.9–64.6 ± 15.5, P < 0.05),
reverting to a similar value to that at T0, while in Group S peak VO2 did not change from T0 to T1 and signiﬁcantly deteriorates from T1 to
T2: 14.5 ± 1.2–11.4 ± 1.2 ml/kg/min ± SD, P < 0.00001 (60.6 ± 8.4–47.4 ± 6.9% predicted ± SD, P < 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: PRP was a valid preoperative strategy to improve physical performance in patients with both NSCLC and COPD and this
advantage was also maintained after surgery.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory function has always been considered crucial for pre-
operative evaluation of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). On the other hand, despite improvements in surgical
techniques and perioperative care, the reduction of respiratory
function after surgery is inevitable. Therefore, the preoperative
evaluation of respiratory lung function is one of the most import-
ant factors to determine operability, particularly in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1–4].
Until 2007, surgical candidates with NSCLC were evaluated
according to the guidelines of the British Thoracic Society [5], and
the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians
[6, 7]. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was performed only
in selected cases. More recently, the guidelines of the European
Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Society of Thoracic
Surgery (ESTS) [8] strongly recommended the evaluation of patients’
physical performance. These guidelines suggest the extensive use of
VO2 peak evaluation by means of CPET even in the presence of a
slight functional alteration detected by basal tests (forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV1) and/or diffusion lung capacity of CO
(DLCO) < 80% of the predicted value). Indeed, the VO2 peak, which
is an indicator of physical performance, has proved to be the best
independent predictor of the surgical complication rate [9].
Increasing the VO2 peak value and the patient’s tolerance to exer-
cise should be the most important preoperative goal. The latter can
be achieved by means of optimal medical treatment and rehabilita-
tion, which should both be used to add to their synergic beneﬁcial
effects. It has long been known that preoperative respiratory re-
habilitation ameliorates the physical performance of patients with

COPD [10]. Similarly, the possibility of reducing the perception of
dyspnoea and increasing exercise tolerance and quality of life (the
impact of morbidity and mortality has yet to be deﬁned) in patients
with emphysema undergoing lung volume reduction surgery has
been recognized [11, 12]. Instead, only a few studies evaluated the
effects of preoperative respiratory rehabilitation in patients with
both COPD and NSCLC [13–15].
The aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects of a pre-
operative pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on peak VO2 as
measure of physical performance in a group of COPD patients
with NSCLC undergoing lobectomy. The secondary goal was the
evaluation of the postoperative impact of PRP on physical per-
formance up to 60 days after surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Forty COPD patients (23 males—17 females; age 65 ± 7 years) with
a Stage I/II NSCLC undergoing lobectomy were enrolled in the
study from February 2010 until December 2011. The criteria for
operability and resectability were based on the preoperative
staging test and the recommendations of the ERS/ESTS guidelines
[8]. The lobectomy was performed by means of open thoracot-
omy. All patients signed informed consent before enrolling in the
study. All the patients enrolled in the study were treated with long-
term bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists and/or anticholinergic) or
with an association of beta-2 agonists/inhaled corticosteroids; the
therapy was not modiﬁed at the enrolment and remained un-
changed for the period of the study in order not to inﬂuence the
results of the PRP. The patients in Group S were excluded from the
PRP, despite the evidence of a favourable effect on postoperative
morbidity and mortality, because they were within the operability
criteria.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.
Study design
Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The patients in
the ﬁrst group (rehabilitation, R) underwent a 3-week preoperative
outpatient intensive PRP based on high-intensity training of both
upper- and lower-limb muscles. Conversely, the patients in the
second group (surgery, S) did not participate in the preoperative
PRP and underwent only surgery according to the normal stand-
ard preoperative protocol.
All patients had a baseline evaluation at the time of enrolment
in the study (T0), an intermediate evaluation (T1) at the end of the
PRP for Group R and immediately before surgery for Group S,
respectively. The ﬁnal evaluation (T2) was performed 60 days after
lobectomy for both groups. We studied: respiratory function, by
means of FEV1, FVC and DLCO; dyspnoea by means of Borg scale;
physical performance by means of CPET peak VO2 measure.
Pulmonary rehabilitation program
The PRP was divided into 15 3-h sessions, from Monday to Friday,
for 3weeks. The programme consisted of respiratory exercises on
the bench, mattress pad and wall bars, respectively, followed by a
high intensity training of the upper limbs with the rowing ergom-
eter and the lower limbs by means of the treadmill and the ergo-
metric bicycle. The exercise work load for each patient was set
according to the results of the CPET, starting with 70% of the
maximum score reached at the CPET and increased by 10 W
when the patient was able to tolerate the set load for 30 min.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test and evaluation
of dyspnoea
CPET was performed at T0, T1 and T2 by means of the loading
ramp test with the ergometric bicycle (ergoline ergoselect, Sensor
Medics, Milan, Italy) connected to computerized analyser Vmax
encore 29c (Sensor Medics, Milan, Italy), with the breath-by-
breath method. In brief, the patient was monitored measuring the
blood pressure every 2 min; the SO2 by means of pulse oximeter;
continuous 12 lead EKG; exhaled gas O2 and CO2 breath-by-
breath at the mouth of the patient. The test started with a 2 min
evaluation of the patient at rest followed by a warm-up period
during which the patient cycled freely for 2 min. Then, the inten-
sity of the cycling was increased with ramp loading of the preset
watts, lasting 8–10 min until the end of the test. The loading ramp
was planned according to the predicted patient workload result-
ing from patient’s age, sex, weight, and diet besides the grade of
obstruction diagnosed at spirometry. The CPET was interrupted
when the patient reached the maximum predicted cardiac rate or
the occurrence of other kinds of limitations. At the end of the test,
the grade of dyspnoea was measured with the BORG scale. The
maximum consumption of O2 at exercise peak (VO2 peak) was
recorded measuring the absolute value expressed in ml/kg/min
and the percentage of the predicted values.
Respiratory function tests
The respiratory function tests were performed using a plethysmo-
graph box (V6200 Autobox, Sensor Medics, Milan, Italy) con-
nected to a dry spirometer (Vmax 22, Sensor Medics, Milan, Italy).
The spirometer was interfaced with a computer equipped with
the speciﬁc software for the analysis of respiratory function tests
(Vmax, Sensor Medics Milan, Italy). All respiratory function tests
and measurements were performed according to American
Thoracic and European Respiratory Societies [7]. FEV1, FVC, and

FEV1/FVC ratio were all expressed as absolute (ml) and percentage
values according to predicted values for age, sex, weight and
height of the patients. Diffusion lung of CO was expressed as ml/
mmHg/min.
Statistical analysis
The inter-groups analysis was performed at T0, T1 and T2 by a
t-test for independent samples while the intragroup analysis was
performed by a t-test for dependent samples for all the different
parameters evaluated at T0, T1 and T2: comparisons were per-
formed between T0 and T1, T0 and T2 and T1 and T2 and a
P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Inter-group comparisons
At T0, the two groups did not signiﬁcantly differ in age
(years ± SD, Group R vs S: 65.5 ± 7.4 vs 64.8 ± 7.3, P = NS), BMI
(Group R vs S: 25.6 ± 4.5 vs 27.6 ± 3.5, P = NS), FEV1 and peakVO2
(Table 2).
No difference between groups was observed in pulmonary
function, by means FEV1, also at T1 and T2 (Table 2), while a sig-
niﬁcant difference was evident in peak VO2 value after PRP at T1:
[Group R vs S peak VO2, ml/kg/min ± SD (% predicted value ± SD):
17.8 ± 2.1 vs 14.5 ± 1.2 (76.1 ± 14.9 vs 60.6 ± 8.4), P < 0.0001
(<0.05), Fig. 1, Table 2] and this difference was maintained also 60
days after surgery at T2: [peak VO2, ml/kg/min ± SD (% predicted
value ± SD): 15.1 ± 2.4 vs 11.4 ± 1.2 (64.6 ± 15.5 vs 47.4 ± 6.9),
P < 0.05 (<0.05), Fig. 2, Table 2].
Intragroup analysis: Group R
Peak VO2 improved signiﬁcantly after PRP and signiﬁcantly dete-
riorated after surgery, going back to a similar value to that at base-
line: peak VO2, ml/kg/min ± SD (% predicted value ± SD), T0 vs T1:
14.9 ± 2.3 vs 17.8 ± 2.1, P < 0.001 (64.5 ± 16.5–76.1 ± 14.9, P < 0.05);

did not change signiﬁcantly from T0 to T1 and deteriorated signiﬁ-
cantly after surgery (Table 3).

are listed in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
On the basis of the data obtained, it is possible to state that pre-
operative high-intensity PRP improves the degree of physical per-
formance of patients with COPD and NSCLC undergoing surgical
resection compared with similar surgical patients who did not
undergo preoperative PRP. These differences were not present at
the baseline evaluation and became obvious after PRP, and con-
tinued to be observed after surgery. In fact, the possibility of im-
proving the physical performance of patients with COPD by
means of preoperative PRP has long been known [16]. Similarly,
preoperative PRP reduced the perception of dyspnoea and
increased both exercise capacity and quality of life of patients with
pulmonary emphysema undergoing lung volume reduction
surgery, even if the impact of preoperative PRP on morbidity and
mortality needs to be better clariﬁed in this subset of patients [11,
12]. On the other hand, there were no data on the beneﬁcial
effects of preoperative PRP on patients with COPD and NSCLC
undergoing surgery. Actually, despite the scarce data in the litera-
ture, the results of our study show that preoperative PRP is an im-
portant strategy, together with optimization of the pharmacological
therapy and quitting smoking, in order to improve the surgical
outcome of this subset of patients. This approach seems to be even
more crucial since preoperative PRP increases the number of these
patients eligible for surgery. In this regard, it is important to under-
line the role of CPET in risk stratiﬁcation [9]. CPET is performed
according the current ERS/ESTS guidelines when the ﬁrst-level re-
spiratory functional test (FEV1 and DLCO) shows some anomalies
[8]. This test (more than the respiratory functional tests performed
with the patient at rest) measures the maximal oxygen consump-
tion, or peak VO2 oxygen, which represents the sum of the integrate
functions of different organs and apparatus involved in the muscu-
lar oxygenation [17, 18].
The clinical importance of this test is based on the observation
that the cardiorespiratory functional evaluation at rest does not
often correlate with the maximal exercise capability of the patient.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the stress test is more reliable

than the functional respiratory tests at rest like spirometry and
echocardiography. The results of this study clearly demonstrated
the central role of CPET in the preoperative evaluation of patients
with COPD and NSCLC, according to ERS/ESTS guidelines.
In the last 10 years, complex algorithms and better predictors of
perioperative and/or postoperative complications have been
developed with the objective of improving the risk stratiﬁcation of
patients with NSCLC eligible for surgery. The results of a large
meta-analysis published in 2007 showed that there is an inverse
relationship between the perioperative and/or postoperative
complication rates and the VO2 peak measured by means of car-
diorespiratory stress test [19]. Therefore, the risk stratiﬁcation by
means of the measurement of the physical performance has
become crucial to the point that the ERS/ESTS Task Force con-
cluded that the exercise capability has a reverse correlation with
the postoperative complications rate (Grade 1+) [8]. Other tests
used for the evaluation of the physical performance, like the
6-min walking test, the shuttle walking test, and the stair-climbing
test have proved to be less reliable with respect to CPET, which
should then be considered the gold standard [20, 21]. The shuttle
walking test correlates only partially with the VO2 values. Patients
with lung cancer eligible for surgery who are unable to walk <250
m on two different occasions are considered at high risk for both
perioperative and/or postoperative complications and mortality
since the estimated VO2 is <10 ml/kg/min [22, 23].
In the stair climbing test the patient climbs one or more ramps
of stairs. This test has proved to be the best alternative to CPET
since it is a good predictor of both perioperative and/or post-
operative complications. Those patients who are able to climb ﬁve
ﬂights of stairs are good surgical candidates since the estimated
value of VO2 will be >20 ml/kg/min. However, this test has some
limitations which affect its reproducibility and repeatability
(height and numbers of steps, speed of climbing etc) [22–25]. The
studies which used the 6-min walking test did not show univocal
results and therefore this is not recommended for patients with
NSCLC who are surgical candidates [24].
The results of this study highlighted that the beneﬁcial effects
obtained by means of a high-intensity preoperative RPP persist
even after surgery: those patients who underwent preoperative re-
spiratory rehabilitation had a better physical performance with
respect to the group of patients who did not undergo preopera-
tive PRP on both pre- and post-surgical evaluation. Currently,
other studies are needed to demonstrate that the patients who
undergo preoperative PRP could have also a better quality of
life, less postoperative complications and a longer survival after
surgery.
