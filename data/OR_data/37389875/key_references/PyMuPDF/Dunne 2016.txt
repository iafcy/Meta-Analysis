Background: Patients with low fitness as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) have
higher mortality and morbidity after surgery. Preoperative exercise intervention, or prehabilitation, has
been suggested as a method to improve CPET values and outcomes. This trial sought to assess the
capacity of a 4-week supervised exercise programme to improve fitness before liver resection for colorectal
liver metastasis.
Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of a 4-week (12 sessions) high-intensity
cycle, interval training programme in patients undergoing elective liver resection for colorectal liver
metastases. The primary endpoint was oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold. Secondary endpoints
included other CPET values and preoperative quality of life (QoL) assessed using the SF-36®.
Results: Thirty-eight patients were randomized (20 to prehabilitation, 18 to standard care), and 35 (25
men and 10 women) completed both preoperative assessments and were analysed. The median age was
62 (i.q.r. 54–69) years, and there were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups.
Prehabilitation led to improvements in preoperative oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (+1⋅5 (95 per
cent c.i. 0⋅2 to 2⋅9) ml per kg per min) and peak exercise (+2⋅0 (0⋅0 to 4⋅0) ml per kg per min). The oxygen
pulse (oxygen uptake per heart beat) at the anaerobic threshold improved (+0⋅9 (0⋅0 to 1⋅8) ml/beat), and
a higher peak work rate (+13 (4 to 22) W) was achieved. This was associated with improved preoperative
QoL, with the overall SF-36® score increasing by 11 (95 per cent c.i. 1 to 21) (P = 0⋅028) and the overall
SF-36® mental health score by 11 (1 to 22) (P = 0⋅037).
Conclusion: A 4-week prehabilitation programme can deliver improvements in CPET scores and QoL
before liver resection. This may impact on perioperative outcome. Registration number: NCT01523353

Introduction
Patients with lower oxygen uptake (V O2) at the anaer-
obic threshold (AT), as assessed by cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (CPET), have higher mortality, higher
morbidity and longer hospital stay when undergoing
major surgery1,2. In patients with cancer, postoperative
rehabilitative exercise therapy improves physical func-
tion, peak oxygen consumption and quality of life (QoL).
There are, however, limitations. Following surgery, indi-
viduals may be fatigued, worried about the effects of
exercise on the healing process, or anxious while awaiting
adjuvant treatments3.
Postoperative
rehabilitation
also
fails to add any of the benefits of exercise therapy to the
immediate perioperative period4. Preoperative exercise
intervention, or prehabilitation, has been proposed as
a more timely intervention in a patient’s management
pathway, as it may bring the benefits of exercise therapy
to bear on the intended operative intervention4,5. The use
of prehabilitation in addition to rehabilitation has been
shown to increase preoperative walking capacity and to aid
functional recovery following colorectal resection6.
Currently no randomized study of prehabilitation has
delivered improved fitness, as measured objectively with

CPET, in a cancer population. The largest randomized
trial of prehabilitation to date failed to demonstrate an
advantage of a home-based exercise programme over a con-
trol arm of walking and breathing exercises5. A number of
non-randomized studies7–9 have demonstrated that super-
vised exercise programmes, typically of 6 weeks or more,
could deliver clinically relevant improvements in fitness.
However, this delay is not always feasible when treating
malignant disease. This randomized clinical trial sought
to assess the feasibility of a 4-week supervised preopera-
tive exercise programme in patients awaiting surgery for
colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), assessing the impact
on preoperative fitness, QoL, perioperative outcomes and
subsequent postoperative course.
Methods
This was a randomized clinical trial conducted with ethical
approval from the UK Research Ethics Service (Integrated
Research Application System ID: 65982), and registered on
Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01523353).
Participants
All patients with CRLM referred to the tertiary hepato-
biliary service at Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool,
UK, were screened for potential eligibility. Patients with
resectable CRLM were eligible for recruitment if aged
over 18 years, able to give informed consent, partake
in cycle-based exercise, and complete the exercise pro-
gramme before the proposed surgery date. Resectability
was defined in the multidisciplinary meeting at the tertiary
hepatobiliary centre as: metastases deemed surgically treat-
able with curative intent (either 1- or 2-stage resection).
Patients were ineligible for recruitment if they had known
pre-existing chronic liver disease.
Potentially eligible candidates were given details of the
study at the first clinic attendance, but were invited to
participate only once a decision to proceed to surgery had
been made, and full informed consent obtained. Ethical
approval stipulated that recruitment to the study must not
result in delayed surgical care. Consequently patients were
potentially eligible only when the provisional operative
date allowed at least 4 weeks for prehabilitation.
Randomization
Candidates were randomized to either a prehabilitation
exercise programme or standard care by means of a random
number block randomization list created at the trial outset.
An individual, independent of the study group, held this
list and provided e-mail results of randomization following
recruitment.
Interventions
Prehabilitation consisted of 12 interval exercise sessions
over a 4-week period. The programme was developed
within an exercise laboratory, and validated in a healthy
population10. Two recovery exercise sessions were included
at the end of the first and fourth weeks (sessions 3
and 12). The interval sessions included a warm-up and
warm-down, and 30 min of interval training alternating
between exercise of moderate (less than 60 per cent V O2
at peak exercise) and vigorous (more than 90 per cent V O2
at peak) intensity11. The sessions were delivered using
a cycle ergometer (Optibike; Ergoline, Bitz, Germany).
The exercise programme was personalized to candidates
following a standardized equation based on the work
rate at their anaerobic threshold on baseline CPET. No
restrictions were placed on candidates in either arm of the
study, and they were encouraged to follow clinical advice
on exercise before surgery.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
The
methodology
for
performing
CPET
has
been
described previously12. Clinical physiologists performed
the tests. Patients were asked to continue their normal
medication before the test. CPET was performed on an
electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoselect
200; Ergoline). The protocol consisted of 3 min of rest,
followed by 3 min of freewheel pedalling, then a ramped,
incremental protocol until volitional termination. This
was followed by 5 min of recovery. Ventilation and gas
exchange variables were measured using a metabolic cart
(Geratherm Respiratory; Love Medical, Manchester, UK).
Pulse rate, 12-lead ECG, non-invasive BP and pulse
oximetry were monitored throughout. The exercise ramp
gradient was set to 10–25 W per min, based on a calcula-
tion described by Wasserman et al.13 using predicted V O2
at unloaded pedalling, predicted V O2 at peak exercise,
height and patient age.
CPET-derived variables included V O2 at AT (ml per kg
per min), V O2 at peak (ml per kg per min), V E/V CO2 (pul-
monary ventilation during exercise/carbon dioxide out-
put) at AT, absolute oxygen uptake at AT (V O2 at AT
(l/min)), absolute oxygen uptake at peak exercise (V O2 at
peak (l/min)), heart rate at AT (beats/min) and heart rate at
peak (beats/min). These variables were defined as described
by Wasserman and colleagues13.
The AT was estimated using a conventional cluster of
variables (breakpoint in the V CO2–V O2 relationship) with
increases in the ventilatory equivalent of oxygen (V E/V O2)
and end-tidal oxygen tension, but no increase in V E/V CO2
or fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension. V O2 at peak
was taken as the highest V O2 attained over a 30-s average.

Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram for the study. CPET, cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Evaluation of AT was undertaken independently by two
experienced assessors, blinded to each other’s assessments,
with disagreement resolved by a third assessor.
Patients were considered high-risk if their baseline V O2
at AT was less than 11 ml per kg per min. High-risk patients
were admitted routinely to critical care after surgery, and
had increased intraoperative monitoring and support14 .
Primary outcome measure
The primary aim of the study was to improve preoperative
V O2 at the AT by 1⋅5 ml per kg per min. This was consid-
ered achievable and clinically relevant. If delivered across
a patient population14, it could reduce the proportion of
patients considered high-risk (V O2 at AT of less than 11 ml
per kg per min) by 30 per cent.
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcome measures included changes in the
other preoperative CPET measures, and changes in the
preoperative QoL score, assessed using the Short Form
36 (SF-36®; QualityMetric, Lincoln, Rhode Island, USA)
questionnaire15. Data were also collected on operative
intervention, perioperative outcomes and subsequent post-
operative progress. The study was not statistically powered
for formal assessment of differences in perioperative or
long-term outcome, and these data are descriptive.
Blinding
Clinicians providing care were blinded to the intervention
received by patients, and to the results of all but the baseline
CPET values. This blinding included anaesthetists, sur-
geons, ward staff and staff reporting the CPET results.
Sample size
Preliminary data suggested that the target population had
a mean(s.d.) V O2 of 12⋅0(2⋅0) ml per kg per min. To

a power of 0⋅8 and a type I error probability of 0⋅05,
15 pairs of subjects were required. Assuming an attrition
rate of 25 per cent9, a total recruitment of 38 patients
was required.
Statistical analysis
Continuous normally distributed data were analysed using
a t test, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for con-
tinuous data with a non-normal distribution. Categorical
data were analysed with the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test,
as appropriate. All statistical tests were conducted using
SPSS® version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).
Results
The first candidate was recruited in August 2011, and the
trial closed in February 2013, when planned recruitment
was achieved. Of 193 consecutive patients assessed for
eligibility, 115 were deemed potentially eligible. Some 104
patients were approached, of whom 38 agreed to partici-
pate and were randomized. One of the commonest reasons
for ineligibility (38 patients) or failure to recruit (7)

programme before the surgery date. Forty-four patients
declined to participate owing to the distance from the ter-
tiary centre. One patient withdrew before completing the
baseline assessment, before being informed of the results of
randomization, and was excluded from the analysis (Fig. 1).
Study cohort demographics
There were no significant differences in baseline demo-
graphic characteristics (Table 1), cardiopulmonary exercise
test variables or QoL scores between the prehabilitation
and standard care arms. Based on the V O2 at AT, nine
patients were defined as high-risk in the prehabilitation
arm, and eight in the standard care arm. One of the
high-risk patients on standard care discontinued the study
following baseline assessment, leaving seven in that arm for
subgroup analysis.

before the second assessment. One patient in the pre-
habilitation arm developed an unrelated malignancy and
underwent emergency surgery. One patient withdrew
from the standard care arm upon hearing the results of
randomization, as this patient wished to participate only
if randomized to the exercise programme. Of patients
within the exercise arm, 18 of 19 completed 100 per
cent of the exercise sessions, with one patient missing
two sessions whilst having emergency colonic stenting
for an obstructing primary tumour. Of the 35 patients
(25 men and 10 women) who completed both CPET
assessments, 34 underwent surgical intervention. One
patient was found to have advanced extrahepatic dis-
ease during investigation for abdominal pain, and did
not proceed to surgery. This patient was included in
analysis of the prehabilitation effect but excluded from
the operative intervention analysis. Of 34 patients who
had surgery, five underwent laparotomy without liver
resection because of the intraoperative identification of
unresectable disease. This comprised three patients with
peritoneal metastases, one patient with multiple additional
hepatic metastases, and one with chemotherapy-induced
liver injury that precluded extended resection. There
were no reported adverse outcomes of the exercise
intervention.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test variables
Prehabilitation led to an improvement in V O2 at AT of
1⋅5 ml per kg per min (P = 0⋅023), as well as an improve-
ment in V O2 at peak (2⋅0 ml per kg per min) (P = 0⋅047),
oxygen pulse at AT (0⋅9 ml/beat) (P = 0⋅050) and a higher
peak work rate (13 W) (P = 0⋅005) compared with values in
the standard care arm (Table 2).
Within the prehabilitation arm there were significant
improvements in a number of CPET variables, includ-
ing V O2 at peak, heart rate reserve and oxygen pulse at
AT (Table 2). By comparison, there were no significant
improvements within the standard care arm. No patient
in the standard care arm had a significant improvement in
V O2 at AT, and four had a deterioration in excess of 1⋅5 ml
per kg per min. Overall, there was a non-significant trend
towards worse V O2 at AT (P = 0⋅088).
Quality-of-life changes
Changes in the preoperative QoL measures are summa-
rized in Table 2 and Fig. 2. Within the prehabilitation arm
there were significant improvements in the SF-36® scores,
but not in the standard care arm.
When the study arms were compared, prehabilitation
was associated with improvements in overall SF-36® QoL
(+11, 95 per cent c.i. 1 to 21; P = 0⋅028) and SF-36® mental
health (+11, 1 to 22; P = 0⋅037) scores. There was also a
trend toward greater SF-36® physical health (+8, −1 to
16; P = 0⋅102).
Subgroup analysis of high-risk patients
A subgroup analysis of patients deemed high-risk on base-
line CPET demonstrated similar results to those for the
overall cohort (Table 3). Mean V O2 at AT in the prehabili-
tation arm improved by 2⋅3 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅3 to 4⋅2) ml
per kg per min (P = 0⋅029), so that the mean V O2 at AT was
above the 11⋅0 ml per kg per min threshold considered to
indicate high risk. Of the nine patients defined as high-risk
at baseline, five were no longer considered to be so.
Trends towards improvement that approached statistical

tion, was seen in patients managed on standard care.
Perioperative intervention and outcomes
Surgical interventions and perioperative outcomes are
summarized in Table 4; there was no statistically significant
difference in any postoperative outcomes between the
two arms. Complications are summarized in Table S1
(supporting information). Again, there were no significant
differences in complication types between study arms.
Discussion
This randomized study demonstrates that a short preop-
erative prehabilitation programme can deliver consider-
able improvements in preoperative CPET scores. Better
CPET-derived variables are associated with lower mor-
bidity, mortality and hospital stay after major abdominal
surgery2. Although the impact of improved CPET scores
on operative morbidity and mortality has yet to be demon-
strated, this study suggests that patients deemed high-risk14
for major abdominal surgery may be able to modulate their
risk by means of prehabilitation.
The prehabilitation programme achieved its primary
objective of a 1⋅5-ml per kg per min improvement in
V O2 at AT, in comparison with standard care. This is
an important achievement given the failures of previous
attempts to deliver this result within a similar time
interval5. Patients of poorer fitness, deemed high-risk on
baseline assessment, had considerable gains in V O2 at AT.
This suggests that these patients may have more to benefit
from prehabilitation, certainly if the operative risk can
be brought into line with the patients of higher baseline
V O2 at AT. Within the prehabilitation arm, a number
of measures of preoperative fitness seen as potentially
relevant to predicting outcome16 also improved.
An unexpected finding was the marked deterioration
in some patients randomized to standard care. Crucially,
this raises the question about timing of any preoperative
CPET. Many studies of CPET fail to report on the timing
of the test in relation to surgery1,2 . CPET 4 weeks before
surgery that suggests a patient is low-risk may in fact be
inaccurate by the time of operation, representing a major
confound to the literature.
The variation in response to the standard exercise pro-
gramme is interesting and in keeping with the theory of
‘responder/non-responder’ based on genetic markers17.
This variation in response to a prehabilitation programme
means that it is difficult to justify delaying surgical
intervention. Future work should focus on identifying
individuals in whom benefit is likely to be greatest, so that
more resources can be dedicated to their prehabilitation.

responded to the exercise programme in terms of increas-
ing V O2 at AT; however, it may be that the programme
prevented the ‘non-responders’ from deteriorating as
seen in the standard care group. The prehabilitation pro-
gramme may have delivered other established exercise
benefits, including improved muscle bulk, insulin resis-
tance and preoperative psychological status, which could
all contribute to an improved outcome18–20.
Most of the improvement in QoL was the result of
improvements in mental health, particularly emotional and
social functioning, in concordance with other studies of
exercise in patients with cancer21. It is, however, interest-
ing that a 4-week programme of just 12 sessions was able
to achieve similar improvements to programmes typically
of much longer duration22. The improvements in QoL
are probably related to participation in the exercise pro-
gramme, rather than improved physical function. In the
control arm, in comparison to the deterioration in CPET
values, QoL values were largely unchanged, suggesting that
QoL was independent of physical fitness. This suggests that
improvements in physical fitness do not necessarily cor-
relate with improved QoL, although participation in the
exercise programme itself seemed to be key. This is simi-
lar to previous findings, although the mechanism for this
improvement is not clear23.
Study completion and attendance was high in comparison
to that in other studies5,9. The high adherence suggests that
the exercise intervention is acceptable, and that patients in
the study cohort were highly motivated. This is likely mul-
tifactorial, including the supervised nature of the exercise
and the interval-based nature of the training programme,
with interval training shown to be more enjoyable than
constant load programmes24.
The results of this study offer an interesting avenue for
future development, but some limitations must be consid-
ered. Importantly, although the study demonstrates that it
is possible to deliver major improvements in CPET val-
ues, and it would appear logical to assume this will deliver
the benefits associated with improved fitness1,2, confirma-
tion is required in a larger trial. A potential recruitment
bias may limit generalizability to the wider population. The
study cohort was younger than a typical patient group,
suggesting that a preoperative exercise intervention may
be more appealing to the younger patient population14.
However, younger patients often have more aggressive
disease25, which may explain the rate of failure to progress
to liver resection.
This study focused on improving the aerobic capacity
of patients. However, a number of other patient factors,
including nutritional status, conditioning and physiological
status, can also affect outcome26–28. Some studies6,29 have
examined a multimodal prehabilitation programme. Utiliz-
ing the 6-min walk test (6MWT), these have consistently
demonstrated an advantage over control arms in improving
functional capacity. More recently, a pilot study30 showed
that the addition of whey supplementation to a nutrition-
ally controlled diet can lead to improved 6MWT capacity.
The optimal components of prehabilitation and rehabilita-
tion programmes are yet to be established.
Prehabilitation offers an opportunity to improve preop-
erative education that is a key pillar of enhanced recov-
ery after surgery (ERAS)26. The additional time spent
with patients during the exercise programme provides an
opportunity for education, which can reduce preoperative
anxiety, improving postoperative gut motility and wound
healing26–28. The benefits of improved fitness, alongside
the potential benefits of increased preoperative education,
are consistent with the goals and mechanisms underpin-
ning ERAS programmes, and warrant evaluation in a larger
randomized study.
