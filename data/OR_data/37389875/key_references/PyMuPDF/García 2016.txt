Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the effects of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme in patients 
with lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Design: Randomized, single-blind controlled trial.
Setting: Teaching hospital.
Subjects: Patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Intervention: Participants were randomized to either a prehabilitation group or a control group. 
Participants in the prehabilitation group underwent a combination of moderate endurance and resistance 
training plus breathing exercises three to five times per week.
Main measures: The primary outcome of the study was exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were 
muscle strength (Senior Fitness Test), health-related quality of life (Short-Form 36) and the postoperative 
outcomes. Patients were evaluated at baseline (before randomization), presurgery (only the prehabilitation 
group), after surgery and three months post-operatively.
Results: A total of 40 patients were randomized and 22 finished the study (10 in the prehabilitation group 
and 12 in the control group). Three patients were lost to follow-up at three months. After the training, 
there was a statistically significant improvement in exercise tolerance (+397 seconds, p = 0.0001), the 
physical summary component of the SF-36 (+4.4 points, p = 0.008) and muscle strength (p < 0.01). There 
were no significant differences between groups after surgery. However, three months postoperatively, 
significant differences were found in the mean change of exercise capacity (p = 0.005), physical summary 
component (p = 0.001) and upper and lower body strength (p = 0.045 and p = 0.002).
Conclusions: A pulmonary rehabilitation programme before video-assisted thoracic surgery seems to 
improve patients’ preoperative condition and may prevent functional decline after surgery.

Introduction
Lung resection surgery is regarded as the optimal 
treatment for non-small cell lung cancer,1 but con-
siderable morbidity is associated especially among 
individuals with poor preoperative status.2 Newly 
diagnosed lung cancer patients are known to fre-
quently exhibit poor cardiopulmonary fitness, low 
physical activity levels and an impaired health-
related quality of life that can be further aggra-
vated after lung resection surgery.3 Both the 
health-related quality of life and the preoperative 
cardiorespiratory fitness are two modifiable fac-
tors in the preoperative period that are strongly 
associated with postoperative mortality, morbidity 
and overall survival in patients with early non-
small cell lung cancer.4,5 Preoperative pulmonary 
rehabilitation has been recommended as a preopti-
mization measure before thoracic surgery6 and 
preliminary studies have shown that pulmonary 
rehabilitation can improve exercise tolerance, 
functional capacity and pulmonary function.7,8 
Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-
analysis has found that preoperative exercise train-
ing can reduce hospital stay and postoperative 
complications in patients undergoing thoracotomy 
for non-small cell lung cancer.9 However, none of 
these studies have been conducted exclusively in 
patients undergoing minimally invasive proce-
dures, which are known to ameliorate the impact 
associated with lung resection surgery and enhance 
postoperative recovery. Thus, with the advent of 
video-assisted thoracic surgery to resect lung 
tumours, there is an urge to determine whether or 
not pulmonary prehabilitation should be encour-
aged in this particular context.
Therefore, the aims of this study were: (1) to 
assess the effects of a preoperative pulmonary 
rehabilitation programme on exercise capacity, 
muscle strength and health-related quality of life in 
patients awaiting lung cancer surgery; and (2) to 
determine the effectiveness of the intervention in 
enhancing postoperative recovery after video-
assisted thoracic surgery in comparison with the 
standard care.
Materials and methods
Design
This study was a randomized (1:1), assessor-blind 
controlled trial conducted at the University 
Hospital of A Coruña (Spain). The research proto-
col was designed according to the CONSORT 
guidelines (see CONSORT checklist) and was 
approved by the local Ethics Committee (CEIC 
Galicia, 2011/395). The protocol was registered in 
the database of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) 
under the registration number NCT01963923.
Participants
From October 2013 to April 2015, lung cancer 
patients who were considered for lung resection 
surgery at the Thoracic Surgery Department of the 
University Hospital of A Coruña were assessed for 
eligibility. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
summarized in Table 1.
Potentially eligible patients were contacted by 
phone and then scheduled for an interview with a 
specialized physiotherapist. Those who agreed to 
participate gave written informed consent prior to 
any formal testing.
Randomization and blinding
Randomization was undertaken using a random-
based computer programme (Epidat® v3.1 Xunta 
de Galicia, 2005) with an allocation ratio of 1:1. 
Individual allocations were placed in consecutively 
numbered and sealed opaque envelopes by a third 
person not involved in the study.

The baseline assessment was performed by the 
physiotherapist supervising the training pro-
gramme; however, group allocation was only 
revealed to the physiotherapist after the initial eval-
uations were completed, ensuring the blindness of 
the assessment. Postoperative evaluations were 
performed by two independent physiotherapists 
who were specifically trained to perform the out-
come measurements and who were unaware of the 
patients’ allocation.
Sample size estimation
This study was powered to detect a difference in 
exercise capacity of 100 seconds between groups 
during the first postoperative evaluation (three 
weeks after surgery). This difference has been pre-
viously reported as the minimal clinically important 
difference for this outcome.10 To detect this differ-
ence with a probability of α = 0.05 and power = 80%, 
using a bilateral hypothesis and estimating a 10% 
drop-out rate, 11 patients were required per group. 
Sample size calculation was performed using the 
Epidat® v3.1 Xunta de Galicia, 2005.
Intervention
Eligible patients were randomly allocated to the 
preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme 
(prehabilitation group) or to the standard care (con-
trol group). Participants in the control group 
received usual care (no exercise training), while the 
prehabilitation group engaged in a one-hour super-
vised pulmonary rehabilitation programme three to 
five times per week depending on the surgery date. 
The pulmonary rehabilitation programme took 
place in the rehabilitation room at the University 
Hospital of A Coruña and consisted of a combina-
tion of moderate endurance and resistance training 
according to the current guidelines.11 The interven-
tion was supervised by a highly specialized physi-
otherapist with an expertise in respiratory 
physiotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation.
Endurance training was performed using a cali-
brated cycle-ergometer (Monark 818 E, Monark 
Exercise AB, Sweden) with an initial targeted 
duration of 30 minutes. Training load (Watts) was 
determined after a symptom-limited incremental 
cycle test performed according to the international 
guidelines.12 Patients were asked to discontinue the 
test owing to increased dyspnoea, muscle fatigue 
or any symptom of discomfort and the maximal 
workload maintained for at least 30 seconds was 
recorded as the peak work load (Wpeak). Heart rate 
and oxygen saturation were continuously moni-
tored during the test; blood pressure, rate of dysp-
noea and leg fatigue were only recorded at the 
beginning and at the end of the test. For each train-
ing session patients were encouraged to perform 
30 minutes of interval training (one minute at high 
intensity (80% of Wpeak) plus four minutes of active 
rest (performed at 50% of Wpeak)). A five-minute 
warm-up and a four-minute cool down at 30% of 
the Wpeak were also included in the 30-minute time. 
At the beginning and at the end of the training, 
dyspnoea and leg fatigue were logged using the 
modified version of the Borg Scale.13 After the 
tenth session, intensity was re-examined during a 
new incremental cycle test to adjust the Wpeak in 
order to maintain an optimal training stimuli.

Clinical Rehabilitation ﻿
Resistance training was performed using elastic 
bands (Thera-Band®, The Hygienic Corporation, 
Akron, Ohio, USA) and body-weight exercises. 
Four different bands of 1.25-m long were used in 
this investigation, each one providing a different 
resistance. Training load was determined using a 
25-maximum repetition test, meaning that the 
patient could not perform more repetitions with the 
correct technique.14 Each training session patients 
performed six different exercises targeting the 
main muscle groups involved in daily life activi-
ties. The goal was to perform three sets of 15 rep-
etitions for each exercise with a 45-second rest 
between sets. From the tenth onwards, the number 
of repetitions was maintained and the number of 
sets was increased to four if tolerated. Patients 
were encourage to maintain a moderate perceived 
rate of exhaustion according to the OMNI-
Resistance Scale, which has been validated to be 
use with elastic bands.15
In addition, patients were asked to perform 
breathing exercises twice daily at home using a 
volume-oriented incentive spirometer (Coach 2 
Incentive 
Spirometer® 
22-4000 
HD, 
Smith 
Medicals, USA). The protocol consisted of 30 sus-
tained inspirations at 80% of the maximal Vital 
Capacity (measured previously with the same 
device) with an end-inspiratory hold of two to three 
seconds. Patients were instructed to perform six 
cycles of five repetitions each, with a one-minute 
rest between cycles.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for this study was exercise 
capacity measured with a Constant-load Cycle 
Endurance Test performed at 80% of the Wpeak. 
To perform the test, after two minutes of unload-
ing pedalling, patients were instructed to exer-
cise for as long as possible until maximal 
exhaustion was achieved or the patient was una-
ble to maintain the minimal pedalling rate. If 
exercise endurance exceeded more than 15 min-
utes the test was terminated.16 Dyspnoea and leg 
fatigue were recorded at the beginning and at the 
end of the test. Heart rate and oxygen saturation 
were recorded every minute.
Secondary 
outcomes 
included 
functional 
capacity, muscle strength and the health-related 
quality of life. Functional capacity was assessed 
with a 6-minute walk test. The test was performed 
according to the international recommendations.17 
Duplicate tests were completed at baseline for 
reliability and the maximum distance was used 
for the analysis. The values achieved during the 
test were compared against the Spanish reference 
equations.18
Upper and lower body strength were also meas-
ured using two items included in the Senior Fitness 
Test initially designed by Rikli and Jones:19 the 
Arm Curl Test and the 30’s Chair-to-Stand Test. 
Both tests were adapted to the metric measures 
according to authors’ recommendations.
Health-related quality of life was assessed using 
the second version of the Short-Form 36 Health 
Survey (SF-36v2) and the results were compared 
against the Spanish reference values.18
Postoperative outcomes, including length of 
hospital stay, and the incidence of postoperative 
pulmonary complications were also recorded. 
Postoperative pulmonary complications were clas-
sified according to the Melbourne Group Scale, 
which was specifically designed to identify those 
complications that were more likely to be pre-
vented with a physiotherapy intervention.20
Finally, medical and relevant sociodemographic 
data including age, gender, weight, height, history 
of smoking, the Colinet Co-morbidity Score 
(CCS),21 symptomatology and pulmonary function 
tests were collected from the medical charts.
Patients were evaluated three times during the 
study period: At baseline, after hospital discharge 
and three months post-operatively. Patients in the 
prehabilitation group were also evaluated immedi-
ately after the programme and before surgery.
Statistical analysis
A descriptive analysis of the main variables in the 
study was conducted for each group prior to further 
analyses. Distribution was assessed using the 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test for each quantitative 
variable in each group. Changes in the primary and 
secondary variables pre- to postintervention in the 

Sebio García et al.

prehabilitation group were assessed using a pair 
t-test (variables normally distributed). Inter-group 
comparisons for the primary and secondary out-
comes (exercise capacity, muscle strength and 
health-related quality of life domains) were per-
formed using independent t-tests. Comparison of 
length of hospital stay between groups was per-
formed using a Mann-Whitney test. The incidence 
of postoperative complications between groups 
was assessed using a chi square test.
All statistical analyses were calculated using the 
SPSS package for Windows (Version 22, IBM 
Corporation, Chicago IL, USA) and a p value of 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
During the 18-month recruitment period, 319 
patients were scheduled for lung resection surgery 
for suspected or confirmed lung cancer at our hos-
pital. Of those, 68 potentially eligible patients 
(21.3%) were contacted and 46 (67.6%) signed 
the informed consent. Six patients (13%) with-
drew before randomization, therefore 40 patients 
were randomized and 22 (55%) completed at least 
one postoperative evaluation and were analysed 
(10 patients in the prehabilitation group and 12 in 
the control group). At three months, two patients 
in the control group and one in the prehabilitation 
group were lost to follow-up. A flow diagram of 
the study selection is shown in Figure 1. The 
study was closed according to the pre-approved 
funding schedule.
The baseline characteristics of the participants 
included in the study are shown in Table 2. Despite 
the randomization, patients in the prehabilitation 
group tended to have a higher body mass index, 
lower pulmonary function and lower peak exer-
cise capacity.
Mean time (SD) from baseline assessment to 
surgery was 54.5 days (15.4) in the prehabilitation 
group and 53.5 (20) in the control group (p = 0.899). 
Patients in the prehabilitation group attended a 
median of 16 sessions (range 8–25) with no adverse 
events being reported. Median time from surgery 
to the first and second evaluation for both groups 
were 3.5 weeks (interquartile range: 1.5–4.9) and 
14 weeks (interquartile range: 13.1–15.7), respec-
tively. No significant differences were observed 
between groups (p = 0.093 and p = 0.842). All 
patients underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery 
through one or two ports performed by highly 
experienced surgeons. The operation report was 
checked after the surgery to ensure that the surgery 
was performed with the same technique. There was 
only one reconversion to thoracotomy (control 
group) and the patient was excluded from the 
analysis.
Results of the preoperative pulmonary rehabili-
tation programme in the prehabilitation group are 
shown in Table 3, while the inter-group compari-
son can be found in Table 4. Although no signifi-
cant differences between groups were observed at 
three weeks in any of the variables analysed, three 
months postoperatively there were statistically sig-
nificant differences in the mean change for the 
exercise capacity, the physical component sum-
mary and the upper and lower muscle strength 
assessment leading to two opposite trends in 
patients’ recovery: While patients in the prehabili-
tation group were able to maintain and/or increase 
their baseline values in all the parameters exam-
ined, patients in the control group exhibited a pro-
gressive 
decline 
throughout 
the 
follow-up, 
especially in exercise capacity.
Finally, no significant differences were found in 
the postoperative outcomes between groups. 
Hospital stay was similar for both groups (two vs. 
three median days in the prehabilitation and control 
group respectively; p = 0.539). Any patient was 
diagnosed with a postoperative pulmonary compli-
cation according to the Melbourne Group Scale 
although 50% (n = 5) of the patients in the preha-
bilitation group and 66% (n = 8) in the control 
group scored positively in at least one of the items 
of the scale (p = 0.361).
Discussion
The results found in our study suggest that a preop-
erative exercise-based programme before lung 
resection surgery can effectively improve patients’ 
preoperative status by increasing exercise capacity, 
muscle strength and the physical component of the

health-related quality of life. More importantly, in 
comparison with the standard care, it seems that 
preoperative exercise training can also minimize 
the physical deconditioning associated with lung 
resection and accelerate functional recovery after 
video-assisted thoracic surgery. However, this was 
a small study with a high number of drop-outs thus 
our findings must be interpreted carefully. 
Nevertheless, they are proof of the principle that 
preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation before 
video-assisted thoracic surgery may play an impor-
tant role in preventing functional decline after sur-
gery similarly to what has been observed after open 
thoracotomies.
Pulmonary rehabilitation has been recently 
acknowledged as a cornerstone in the management 
of patients with lung cancer.22 To date, several 
studies have consistently shown that preoperative

exercise training can increase exercise capac-
ity,8,23–26 functional capacity7,25–27 and pulmonary 
function7,24,25,27 in patients with lung cancer await-
ing lung resection surgery both pre to postinterven-
tion and comparing with a control group.7,28 In our 
study, we also found a significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in exercise capacity 
(endurance time) of 369.6 seconds (197) pre- to 
posttraining, which corresponds to a 123% increase 
compared with baseline. More importantly, patients 
were able to maintain this improvement after the 
surgery throughout the first three months, which 
contrasts with the control group who showed a pro-
gressive decline over the study period. In a similar 
investigation, Coats et  al.26 also found a 60% 
improvement in exercise capacity after a four-week 
home-based training programme in patients await-
ing video-assisted thoracic surgery. Interestingly, 
in this investigation, the authors did not report any 
significant change in the maximum oxygen uptake 
after the training suggesting that incremental exer-
cise tests may not be the more responsive to detect 
exercise-related changes.
In addition to exercise capacity, we also found a 
significant improvement both in upper and lower 
muscle strength after the training. In a previous 
pilot study, our group already showed that elastic 
bands were an effective way to improve muscle 
strength in patients with lung cancer.29 Although 
resistance training is more commonly delivered 
using free weights or weight machines, the use of 
low-tech equipment is gaining more popularity. 
Several studies have found that elastic bands are as 
effective as traditional equipment to improve mus-
cle strength in sedentary older adults30 and those 
with chronic respiratory diseases,31 including 
patients with lung cancer.32 The results obtained in 
this randomized controlled trial are in line with 
these previous investigations and further reinforce 
that low-cost training is a valid alternative for 
improving muscle strength in this population.
On the other hand, the effects of exercise 
training in health-related quality of life appear 
less clear. Previous systematic reviews con-
ducted among patients with lung cancer have 
highlighted the lack of consistency among stud-
ies regarding the effectiveness of exercise 
training on this outcome.9,33 The results of this 
randomized controlled trial, however, indicate 
that a preoperative intervention focused on 
endurance and strength training can significantly 
improve the physical role and the physical com-
ponent summary prior to lung resection surgery. 
This finding is of great interest given that the 
preoperative physical component summary is 
associated with overall and cancer-specific sur-
vival in patients with stage I Non-Small Cell 
Lung Cancer.5 More importantly, the increase in 
the physical component summary was also sus-
tained throughout the first three months after the 
surgery in comparison with the control group 
who showed the opposite tendency.
Finally, preoperative exercise training has 
shown the potential of enhancing postoperative 
recovery and reduce in-hospital costs in patients 
undergoing cardiothoracic and abdominal sur-
gery.9,34 Particularly, in patients undergoing lung 
resection surgery, our group found that there was 
a reduction of almost five days in hospital stay 
(mean difference = 4.83 days, 95% CI: 3.8 to 5.9) 
and a 55% reduction in the relative risk for post-
operative complications in those patients under-
going preoperative exercise training.9 However, 
in this study, we could not find any significant 
difference between groups neither in hospital 
stay nor in the postoperative complications. This 
finding can be explained by several factors 
including the experience of the thoracic surgery 
team plus the low-risk profile of the patients 
included in our study.
Our study has several limitations that must be 
acknowledged. First of all, the study included 
patients with suspected (clinical) or confirmed 
lung cancer (histological biopsy), which resulted in 
some patients being diagnosed with lung metasta-
ses or benign disease. Despite randomization, 
patients in the prehabilitation group had poorer 
pulmonary function and a higher body mass index, 
which resulted in a higher percentage of them 
undergoing a sub-lobar resection than those in the 
control group. However, the differences were not 
statistically significant (p = 0.229) and a univariate 
general linear model showed no interaction 
between the exercise capacity and the extent of the

resection (data not shown). It is also important to 
acknowledge the high number of drop-outs in this 
study and the potential implications. Of the 20 
patients randomized to the prehabilitation group, 
only 50% completed the study, which lead us to 
perform a per-protocol analysis instead of an inten-
tion-to-treat analysis owing to the large percentage 
of patients with relevant missing data. On the 
bright side, this low completion rate had little to do 
with the preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation 
programme, which was well tolerated and related 
to no adverse events.
Clinical messages
••
Our results suggest that a preoperative 
exercise-based programme can improve 
exercise capacity, muscle strength and 
the physical component of the health-
related quality of life in patients with 
lung cancer.
••
In these patients, preoperative exercise 
training could play an important role in 
preventing functional decline after sur-
gery enhancing postoperative recovery.
