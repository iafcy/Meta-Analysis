Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of personalized
prehabilitation on postoperative complications in high-risk patients under-
going elective major abdominal surgery.
Summary Background Data: Prehabilitation, including endurance exercise
training and promotion of physical activity, in patients undergoing major
abdominal surgery has been postulated as an effective preventive intervention
to reduce postoperative complications. However, the existing studies provide
controversial results and show a clear bias toward low-risk patients.
Methods: This was a randomized blinded controlled trial. Eligible candidates
accepting to participate were blindly randomized (1:1 ratio) to control
(standard care) or intervention (standard care þ prehabilitation) groups.
Inclusion criteria were: i) age >70 years; and/or, ii) American Society of
Anesthesiologists score III/IV. Prehabilitation covered 3 actions: i) motiva-
tional interview; ii) high-intensity endurance training; and promotion of
physical activity. The main study outcome was the proportion of patients
suffering postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included the
endurance time (ET) during cycle-ergometer exercise.
Results: We randomized 71 patients to the control arm and 73 to intervention.
After excluding 19 patients because of changes in the surgical plan, 63
controls and 62 intervention patients were included in the intention-to-treat
analysis. The intervention group enhanced aerobic capacity [DET 135 (218)
%; P < 0.001), reduced the number of patients with postoperative compli-
cations by 51% (relative risk 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3–0.8; P ¼
0.001) and the rate of complications [1.4 (1.6) and 0.5 (1.0) (P ¼ 0.001)] as
compared with controls.
Conclusion: Prehabilitation enhanced postoperative clinical outcomes in
high-risk candidates for elective major abdominal surgery, which can be
explained by the increased aerobic capacity.

ajor abdominal surgery is associated with high rate of post-
operative complications.1 Moreover, a transient but marked
postoperative reduction of functional capacity is observed in these
patients, even in the absence of complications.2
Individual aerobic capacity determines preoperative func-
tional reserve which, in turn, is negatively associated with post-
operative morbi-mortality.3,4 Accordingly, it can be hypothesized
that preoperative interventions aiming at enhancing maximum oxy-
gen uptake and increasing physical activity, such as prehabilitation,
may contribute to reduce postoperative complications.
Prehabilitation is defined as a preparatory intervention aiming
at reducing perioperative complications wherein both enhanced
aerobic capacity, through supervised endurance exercise training,
and promotion of physical activity play central roles.5
A comprehensive systematic review on elective intracavity
surgery6 acknowledges positive effects of prehabilitation on patients’
fitness, but indicates limited evidence of impact on postoperative
clinical outcomes in candidates for elective cardiac, abdominal and
pulmonary surgical procedures. Moreover, available studies are
clearly biased toward assessment of low-risk candidates for surgery
and their methodological heterogeneity7,8 results in limited compa-
rability. Therefore, there is a clear need for randomized control trials
(RCT) to assess the effects of prehabilitation in candidates for major
surgery showing high risk for perioperative complications.
The present research relies on the assumption that elderly
patients with multimorbidities are prone for perioperative compli-
cations and, consequently, they are the most likely to benefit from

prehabilitation programs. Accordingly, the aim of the present inves-
tigation was to evaluate the impact of a personalized preoperative
holistic intervention having high-intensity endurance exercise train-
ing and promotion of physical activity as key actionable factors to
prevent postoperative complications in high-risk patients undergoing
elective major abdominal surgery.
METHODS
Study Design
The research was designed as a randomized blinded controlled
trial carried out at Hospital Clı´nic de Barcelona. The Ethics Com-
mittee for Clinical Research of Hospital Clı´nic de Barcelona
approved the study (CEIC 2013/8579). The informed consent was
understood, accepted, and signed by all subjects included in the trial.
The study protocol is displayed at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02024776.
Subjects
A consecutive sample of high-risk candidates for elective
major abdominal surgery was recruited from the outpatient’s clinics
of Hospital Clı´nic de Barcelona. All eligible patients fulfiled the
following inclusion criteria: i) candidate to elective major abdominal
surgery; ii) high risk for surgical complications defined by: age > 70
years and/or American Society of Anesthesiologists score III/IV9; iii)
duke Activity Status Index score  4610; and iv) preoperative
schedule allowing for at least 4 weeks for the prehabilitation
intervention. Exclusion criteria encompassed: i) nonelective surgery;
ii) unstable cardiac or respiratory disease; iii) locomotor limitations
precluding exercise training; and iv) cognitive deterioration imped-
ing adherence to the program.
Randomization and Masking
Following the routine practice in our institution, candidates for
elective major abdominal surgery were scheduled for a preoperative
assessment with an anesthesiologist. During the visit, eligible can-
didates were randomized and invited to participate in the study and
those who agreed were enrolled in the trial after signature of the
informed consent. For oncologic patients, this visit was just after
confirmation of cancer diagnosis even when the study of cancer stage
was not yet completed.
Patients were blindly randomized to the 2 study arms using a
1:1 ratio: i) standard preoperative care (control group) or ii) standard
preoperative care þ prehabilitation (intervention group). Assignment
to group allocation was carried out by means of a computer-gener-
ated random number through a web-based centralized procedure with
an https security protocol hosted by the Biostatistics and Data
Management Platform from our Institution. The randomization
was done by means of the SAS Proc Plan System procedure (version
9.1.3 Service Pack 3 or superior). The collaborating anesthesiologists
and surgeons who attended and followed the patients to register
perioperative incidents by daily chart review were blinded to the
patients’ group allocation.
Procedures
Baseline assessment of the patients was done within 1 week
after the preoperative assessment visit. Prehabilitation was initiated
in the intervention group immediately after baseline assessment.
Moreover, all participants were reassessed the week before the
surgical procedure.
Standard care consisted of physical activity recommendation,
nutritional counseling, and advices on smoking cessation and
reduction of alcohol intake. Moreover, patients suffering from
iron-deficiency anemia received intravenous iron and in those at
high-risk of malnutrition (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool
211) nutritional intervention was done by a registered dietician.
The intervention group underwent a personalized prehabili-
tation program based on their health conditions and social circum-
stances.12 The program was mostly performed in the community
setting. Accordingly, the prehabilitation intervention encompassed 3
major steps: i) motivational interview to assess patient’s adherence
profile and to codesign the characteristics of the physical activity
program with the patient; ii) personalized program to promote daily
physical activity; and iii) supervised high-intensity endurance exer-
cise training program. The intervention was tailored to each patient
by a specialized physiotherapist taking into account several charac-
teristics of the patient, namely clinical complexity (primary disease
and co-morbidities), fitness, logistics (proximity to the hospital,
facilitators and barriers for physical activity including degree of
patient’s dependence, among others) and adherence profile of the
candidate assessed through the motivational interview. An additional
aim of the interview was to reinforce patients’ motivation and to raise
the compromise with the behavior change regarding the program
objectives. In a constructive atmosphere, the physiotherapist shaped
the interview with the goal to optimize the patient’s potential to drive
the change toward a more active lifestyle. The interview was done
according to the following rules: i) avoid the passive speech format,
imperative forms, discussions, and situations generating resistance;
ii) allow the subject to expose his/her fears, barriers, and doubts and
empathize to understand his/her situation and therefore facilitate
accomplishment of the specific needs; and iii) generate summaries of
the information obtained while highlighting the positive aspects and
fostering
self-efficacy.
Additional
patient
empowerment
was
reinforced during the supervised training sessions described below.
The nonsupervised program promoting physical activity was
mainly focused on 2 objectives: i) increasing patient’s steps per day,
measured by a pedometer (Walking style X; Omron; Kyoto, Japan);
and/or ii) optimization of walking intensity, assessed by the Borg
scale.13 International recommendations on step-based physical
activity14,15 were used as a theoretical frame to set up the objectives.
Moreover, patients with severely reduced aerobic capacity and/or
physical activity were empowered on home-based functional exer-
cises (ie, sit-to-stand exercise, stairs climbing, elastic bands, indoor
walking, among others) to decrease sedentary behavior at home.
Patients were asked to report in a diary on a daily basis the number of
steps per day, the intensity of non-supervised walks and/or home-
based functional exercises during the entire prehabilitation period.
The information was reviewed out and registered by the physio-
therapist during the outpatient training sessions described below.
The supervised program consisted of a high-intensity endur-
ance training performed on the cycle-ergometer stationary bicycle
(Jaeger ER 550; Wu¨erzburg, Germany). The program was 1 to 3
sessions per week and personalized to the subject. Each session
included 5 minutes of warm-up cycling at 30% of the peak work-rate
achieved in a standard cardiopulmonary exercise testing (WR), 37
minutes of interval training, and 5 minutes of cool-down pedaling at
20% of peak WR. The interval training combined 2 minutes of high-
intensity pedaling and 3 minutes of active rest. Work-rate progress
during the prehabilitation period was tailored on individual basis,
according to subjects’ symptoms, to maximize the training effect.
During the first 2 weeks, high-intensity pedaling interval was at least
70% of peak WR and the active rest interval was at least 40% of peak
WR. Thereafter, work-rate was increased by approximately 5% every
week up to a maximum of 85% of peak WR during the last week for
the high-intensity period and 50% of peak WR for the active rest. The
cycling rate during the sessions was maintained at 60 to 70 rpm.
Pulseoximetry (Konica-Minolta; Pulsox-300; Osaka, Japan) and
levels of self-perceived exertion13 were monitored during the

sessions. As described above, the supervised training sessions were
also used to reinforce the personalized objectives codesigned in the
motivational interview. Those objectives were revisited and modi-
fied, if necessary, to optimize patient’s performance.
Outcomes
The primary outcome variable of the study was the number of
patients with postoperative complications defined as any deviation
from the normal postoperative course and classified following the
standards of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and European
Society of intensive Care Medicine.16 Secondary outcome variables
were: i) number and severity of postoperative complications using
Dindo-Clavien classification17; and ii) hospital and intensive care unit
(ICU) days of stay. Other outcome variables included: i) endurance
time (ET) measured by a cycling constant work-rate exercise testing at
80% of peak oxygen uptake18 (Ergocard Professional; Medisoft;
Sorinnes, Belgium); ii) distance covered in the 6-minute walking
test19; iii) physical activity by the Yale physical activity survey
(YPAS)20; iv) self-perceived health status by the Short Form (36)
health survey (SF-36)21; and v) psychological status by the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression scale.22 In addition to clinical history and
physical examination, the following descriptive tests were also
included: i) standard cardiopulmonary exercise testing on cycle-ergo-
meter23 (Ergocard Professional); and ii) Resting pulmonary function
testing (BodyBox Plethysmography; Medisoft; Sorinnes, Belgium).
Statistical Analysis

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Group
Between February 3rd, 2013, and June 13th, 2016, we
assessed for eligibility a total of 209 candidates to be included in
the research, as displayed in the study flow (Fig. 1). From the initial
sample of patients, 65 were considered as ineligible because they did
not meet inclusion criteria. Therefore, 144 high-risk patients (69%)
were subsequently randomized, 71 allocated to the control group and
73 to the intervention. Nineteen of the 144 patients did not receive an
operation and thus were excluded from all analysis. Baseline charac-
teristics of participants, including complexity and duration of the
surgical approach, in the intention-to-treat population were balanced
across the 2 study groups (Table 1).
Prehabilitation Intervention
Themeandurationoftheprehabilitationprogramwas6(2)weeks
and during this period patients attended 12 (5) supervised exercise
trainingsessions.Nointerventionpatientreportedanyrelevantincidence

intervention group showed an improvement of 135 (218) % in ET (P <
0.001) and 37 (16) points in the YPAS (P < 0.001) but not in quality of
life or psychological status. However, baseline values of all variables
remained unchanged in the control group (Table 2).

requirement of vasoactive drugs during surgery, as compared with the
control group (P ¼ 0.053) (Table 3).
The incidence of complications in the overall sample of
patients was 46%. When stratifying by groups, the intervention
group showed a lower rate of complications, 31% versus 62%, than
the control group (P ¼ 0.001). Accordingly, the estimated relative
risk (RR) for complications demonstrated that prehabilitation inter-
vention has a protective role for postoperative complications: RR 0.5,
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3–0.8 (Table 4).
Among the secondary outcomes, the intervention group
showed lower mean number of complications per patient: lower rate
of cardiovascular complications (RR 0.1, 95% CI, 0.1–1.0), less
infection of uncertain source (not possible to calculate RR), and
lower rate of paralytic ileus (not possible to calculate RR) when
compared with control group (Table 4). Moreover, the intervention
significantly reduced the length of stay in the ICU, as showed in the
sensitivity analysis including only those patients admitted in the ICU
[(n ¼ 44) 3 (2) vs 12 (20) days for intervention and control group
respectively; P ¼ 0.046].
The sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with compli-
cations showed a protective role of prehabilitation for having >1
complication (n ¼ 58; RR 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3–1.1). Nevertheless, no
effects on severity of complications were observed using the Clavien-
Dindo classification.
Likewise, similar results for primary outcomes were achieved
in by-protocol analysis (110 (88%) of 125 patients in the intention-to-
treat population).
DISCUSSION
This is the first randomized blinded controlled trial assessing
the impact of a prehabilitation intervention on perioperative com-
plications in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
The main finding of the study showed that prehabilitation was a
protective factor for postoperative complications in high-risk can-
didates for elective major abdominal surgery. Moreover, the sensi-
tivity analysis reinforced the role of prehabilitation preventing >1
complication and reducing the days of ICU stay. Our investigation
demonstrated that high-intensity endurance exercise training is
feasible and safe in elderly and/or multimorbid candidates to major
abdominal surgery.
Available reports on prehabilitation programs for candidates
to elective surgery show heterogeneous designs in terms of duration
of the intervention and modalities of exercise training. The duration
of the prehabilitation program is dependent upon the interval of time
before surgical date, which, in turn, is highly modulated by organ-
izational aspects of healthcare providers, as well as by type of
surgical intervention. Reported lengths of the prehabilitation pro-
grams range from 3 to 6 weeks in cancer abdominal surgery8 and
from 2 to 10 weeks in cardiac surgery.7,24
Regarding the modalities of exercise training carried out in
prehabilitation programs, the reports include endurance exercise
training, resistance training, inspiratory muscle training, or a com-
bination of all these approaches.7,8,24–27 In a recent systematic
review, Katsura et al24 concluded that preoperative inspiratory
muscle training seems to be effective to reduce pulmonary compli-
cations and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing cardiac or
major abdominal surgery. However, the impact of enhanced aerobic
capacity on undesirable postoperative clinical events has been poorly
documented.6 To our knowledge, there is only 1 robust RCT7
including endurance training as part of the prehabilitation program.
In this trial, O’Doherty et al7 assessed the impact of enhanced aerobic
capacity in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft
surgery showing positive effects on both hospital and ICU length of
stay; however, the rate of complications did not differ between the
groups. However, in major intra-abdominal surgery, the trials assess-
ing the effect of enhanced aerobic capacity on postoperative com-
plications
failed
to
find
differences
between
control
and
prehabilitation groups probably because of methodological weak-
nesses like poor statistical power and/or low-to-moderate intensity of
exercise training.8 The methodological strengths of the present study
overcome limitations observed in previous reports and provides
evidence to support a relationship between enhanced aerobic
capacity (increased ET) and reduction of surgical complications
induced by prehabilitation (Tables 2 and 4). The sensitivity analysis
performed in the present study showed prehabilitation as a protective
intervention for having >1 complication (n ¼ 58; RR 0.6; 95% CI,
0.3–1.1) and reducing ICU days of stay [n ¼ 44; 12 (20) vs 3 (2)
days; P ¼ 0.046]. It is of note that the intervention had no detectable
effects on quality of life and psychological status (Table 2). It could
be argued that the short duration of the program [mean 6 (2) weeks]
and the absence of specific psychological intervention may explain
the lack of impact of the program on both quality of life and
psychological status.
The present study encompasses a wide spectrum of major
abdominal surgeries representative of the palette of conditions
attended in a digestive surgery department. The study design

provides valuable information about the real impact that a preha-
bilitation service could represent being implemented in the clinical
practice. Moreover, the recruitment of consecutive patients in a
prospective manner reinforces external validity of the results. It is
important to highlight that the robustness of our findings is
warranted as the by-protocol analyses are consistent with those
from the intention-to-treat approach and there were no missing data
in the complications register (main study outcome). Furthermore,
in the current trial, the sample size was powered for postoperative
complications, there was a blinded evaluation, and there was no
contamination among study groups. Furthermore, this study pro-
vides a thorough characterization of the patients with a detailed
analysis of perioperative aspects, which further facilitates the
interpretation of the results and enhances comparability with
other studies.
Nevertheless, the current investigation shows a design limita-
tion. The trial is not double-blinded but a randomized trial that cannot
be double-blinded because of the type of intervention. However,
while acknowledging this fact, there was no contamination among
groups as we used 2 different informed consents and, therefore, each
group did not know about the existence of the other. It is important to
highlight that clinicians collecting perioperative outcomes were
blinded to group status.
Lately, information and communication technologies (ICTs)
have been postulated as enabling tools for the integrated healthcare
model enhancing patient’s management within programs and pro-
viding prospective follow-up.28,29 The rather low use of technology
in the present study suggests that the role of ICT as enabler of
enhanced efficiencies in the integrated assessment of surgical risk
and perioperative strategies should be further explored.

This investigation provides encouraging findings which are
supposed to have a positive impact on the healthcare value chain;
however, large-scale adoption of the service requires studies proving
cost-effectiveness, introducing reimbursement strategies and specific
business models allowing sustainability.
We strongly believe that the present work should prompt a
major consideration of prehabilitation as a core intervention to carry
out in the preoperative setting in high-risk patients undergoing major
elective surgery.
