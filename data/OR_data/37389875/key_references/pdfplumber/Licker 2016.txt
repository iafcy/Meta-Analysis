Abstract (Word count = 270)
Background: Impairment in aerobic fitness is a potential modifiable risk factor for
postoperative complications. In this randomized controlled trial, we hypothesized that a high-
intensity interval training (HIIT) program enhances cardiorespiratory fitness before lung
T
cancer surgery and therefore reduces the risk of postoperative complications.
P
I
Methods: Patients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC,
R
N=77) or preoperative rehabilitation based on HIIT (Rehab, N=74). Maximal
C
cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the six-minute walk test were performed twice before
S
surgery. The primary outcome measure was a composUite of death and in-hospital
postoperative complications. . N
A
Results: Groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the
M
preoperative waiting period (median 25 days), the peak oxygen consumption (peakVO ) and
2
the six-minute walking distance increasedD (respectively, median +15 % [IQ 25-75%, +9 to
+22%] P=0.003 and +15% [IQ25-75,E +8 to +28%], P<0.001) in the Rehab group whereas
T
VO declined in the UC group (median -8% [IQ25-75, -16 to 0%], P=0.005). The primary
2peak
P
endpoint did not differ significantly between the two groups: 27 of the 74 patients (35.5%) in
E
the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6%) in the UC group developed at least one
C
postoperative complication (P=0.080). Noteworthy, the incidence of pulmonary complications
C
was lower in the Rehab compared with the UC group (23% vs 44%, P=0.018), owing to a
A
significant reduction in atelectasis (12.2% vs 36.4%, P<0.001) and this was accompanied by a
shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (median -7 hours, IQ25-75% -4 to -10).
Conclusions: In this RCT, preoperative HIIT resulted in significant improvement in aerobic
performances but failed to reduce early complications after lung cancer resection.

Introduction
Currently, surgical resection remains the best treatment in the early stages of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).1 Advanced age, cancer stage, associated illnesses and impaired
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are predictive factors of major postoperative complications
T
and long term survival.2,3
P
I
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) represents the gold standard for evaluating CRF
R
and the response to rehabilitation program.4 Peak oxygen uptake (peakVO ) reflects the
2
C
integrative ability of the pulmonary, circulatory and autonomic neural systems to maximally
S
deliver oxygen towards the working skeletal muscles. Cut-off values around 16 ml.kg-1.min-1
U
peakVO
2 peak
and 10-12 ml/kg/min anaerobic threshold N(AT) have been shown helpful to
discriminate patients at low risk from those atA higher risk of major postoperative
complications.2,5 M
In patients with lung cancer, peakVO is on average 25% to 30% lower than in age-and
2 D
gender matched non-cancer individuals.2,6,7 Although implementation of exercise-based
E
rehabilitation programs has been Tshown effective in improving CRF and quality of life of
these patients, rehabilitation isP largely underutilized because of scarce scientific evidence and
E
uncertainties regarding the modalities on how to implement physical therapy over the limited
C
preoperative time period.8-11 Recent evidence has highlighted the potential of low-volume,
C
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for inducing a protective cardiopulmonary phenotype
A
while enhancing oxygen extraction in skeletal muscle by increasing capillary density and
mitochondrial oxidative capacity.12,13
In this trial, we aimed to evaluate and compare short-term preoperative HIIT to usual care in
patients undergoing NSCLC resection by assessing CRF parameters and the incidence of
postoperative complications. We hypothesized that exercise-induced improvement in CRF
3

would enhance protective defense mechanisms among surgical candidates making them more
resistant to physiological alterations consequent to surgical stress.
Methods
Study Design
T
The Lung Cancer Rehabilitation Study was a prospective randomized open blinPded end point
I
controlled trial (PROBE) using assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. It was
R
registered at the National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT01258478).and
C
conducted at the University Hospital of Geneva and the Hospital of Valais.
S
U
Patients
N
After approval by the Local Ethics Committees (protocol n° 06-225), written informed
A
consent was obtained from all eligible adult patients with proven or suspected NSCLC, stage
M
IIIA or less. The criteria of resectability were based on the recommendations of the European
D
Respiratory Society and the European Society of Thoracic Surgery (ERS and ESTS).4
E
Exclusion criteria were any contraindication to perform CPET (e.g., uncontrolled cardiac
T
disease, severe pulmonary hypertension), limitations impeding cycling or the inability to
P
adhere to a rehabilitation program.
E
Randomization C
C
Consenting patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis into a Rehabilitation arm (Rehab) and a
A
Usual Care arm (UC) using permuted block of 4. The randomization sequence was developed
before the initiation of the trial and concealed until after enrollment.
Interventions
Adapted from previous published data,14 the HIIT program was designed in cooperation with
experienced physical therapists specialized in rehabilitation. Participants in the Rehab group
4
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
exercised on a cycling ergometer in the outpatient clinic, two to three times a week under the
supervision of physiotherapists. After a 5 min warm-up period at 50% of peak work rate
(WR) the patients completed two 10 min long series of 15 sec sprint intervals (at 80-100%
peakWR) interspersed by 15 sec pauses and a 4 min rest between the two series. The patients
T
then cooled down with a 5 min active recovery period at 30% peakWR. The work rate was
P
adjusted by the physiotherapist on each session to target near maximal heart rates towards the
I
R
end of each series of sprints based on the individual’s exercise response. Additional exercises
C
were proposed on an individual basis, such as leg press, leg extension, back extension, seat
S
row, biceps curls or chest-and-shoulder press.
U
Patients in the two groups were given advices regarding active mobilization (at least four 30-
N
min walk per week) and risk factor management (e.g., healthy nutrition, smoking and alcohol
A
cessation).
M
Lung resections were performed by open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery and,
D
standardized perioperative interventions included antibiotic prophylaxis, restrictive fluid
E
management, thoracic epidural analgesia and protective lung ventilation.15 After surgery,
T
patients were managed in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were transferred to the
P
surgical ward when the discharge criteria were met.16 Routine postoperative physiotherapy
E
consisted in deep breathing using an incentive spirometer, coughing exercise and assistance
C
with ambulation. C
A
Measurements and Outcomes
The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was conducted by physiotherapists according to the ERS
and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.17 A symptom-limited CPET was
performed on an upright electronically braked cycle ergometer with breath-by-breath expired
gas analysis (SensorMedics Model 2200 SP; Yorba Linda, CA); peakHR and peakVO were
2
determined as the highest average values over 30 sec and peakWR was identified at the
5
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
highest exercise level or, interpolated if the last stage was not maintained for two minutes.18
Peak oxygen pulse (peakO 2pulse) was calculated by dividing peakV̇ O2 by the peakHR. The
AT was determined using the V-slope method as primary criterion and the first rise in the
ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (V /VO ) as a secondary criterion.19
E 2
T
All respiratory function tests and physiologic measurements were performed according to the
P
ATS and ERS standards, and expressed as absolute and predicted values (%I) based on age,
R
sex, and weight of the patients.20 Age and sex-specific predicted distances during the 6MWT
C
were calculated from the Enright’s equation.21
S
On the day of enrollment, collected data included demographic and clinical information as
U
well as the results of lung functional and blood laboratoNry tests. The Revised Cardiac Risk
Index was computed for each patient.22 Two to Afour days before surgery (after the
M
rehabilitation or control period), the CPET and the 6MWT were repeated and a multi-axis
accelerometer (ActiSmile SA, Baar, Switzer land) was used to estimate daily physical activity
D
(average value of the last three days prior to surgery).
E
Surgical and anesthetic data wereT extracted from the electronic Patient Data Management
System. Postoperatively, patienPts were followed until hospital discharge to report any adverse
E
events according to a modified version of the Thoracic Mortality and Morbidity (TMM)
C
classification system (see supplemental material).23
C
The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of postoperative morbidity (30-day mortality
A
or any complications TMM grades > 2). Secondary outcomes were the preoperative changes
in CPET parameters (peakVO , AT, peakHR) and in 6MWT (in meters, m), the incidence of
2
postoperative complications TMM grades > 2, the length of stay in PACU and the admission
rate in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A positive response to rehabilitation was defined by
meaningful changes in VO (>10%) or in 6MWT (>30 m) occurring between the first and

the second preoperative measurements.17,24 Adherence to the HIIT program was defined as the
ratio of the number of attended-to-prescribed sessions. All serious adverse events (SAE)
during the HIIT were reported to the study coordinator and the data monitoring and safety
committee (DMSC)
T
Sample size
P
I
Based on a previous cohort study, we assumed an incidence of 22% complications and
R
expected a 50% reduction of postoperative morbidity after implementing preoperative
C
rehabilitation.15 A sample of 178 patients per group was required (80% power; 2-sided test;
S
type I error of 0.05) and to allow for dropouts, we intended to randomize 400 patients (200
U
per group). Given concerns regarding the occurrence of SNAE and a possible changing pattern
of clinical outcome, two interim analyses were planAned after the inclusion of 120 and 240
M
patients as recommended by the DMSC. Stopping/continuing rules were based on the
followings: SAE related to the HIIT, change s in the rate of postoperative complications and
D
between-group difference in primary endpoint or in at least 2 secondary endpoints. The first
E
interim showed an overall incidence of 46% complications, therefore 44 additional patients
T
were deemed necessary to complete the study.
P
E
Statistical Analysis
C
All data were analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
C
USA) and tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov for normality. Summary descriptive statistics
A
were expressed as frequencies (and percentages, %), medians (and interquartile range, IQ25-
75%), or means (and standard deviations, SD). Intergroup differences were analyzed by two-
sided unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, or χ2 test with Yates corrections where appropriate.
Physiologically important changes were estimated as effect sizes (ES) using Cohen’s
guidelines,25 whereby a value of 0.2 denotes a small, 0.5 a medium, and 0.8 a large effect size.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
The ES induced by the intervention was calculated by subtracting the mean changes in the UC
group from the mean change in the Rehab group divided by the pooled standard deviation.
Prespecified analyses using a generalized linear model were conducted to explore
modification of HIIT response by patient’s characteristics and cancer stages as well as the
T
impact of these variables on the occurrence of postoperative complications. All statistical tests
P
were 2-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level.

Results
Study population
Between October 2011 and October 2014, 189 patients were screened, 164 provided consent
and 13 were excluded (Figure 1). Therefore, 151 patients were analyzed, 77 in the TUC group
and 74 in the Rehab group. The time delay from the date of enrollment to surgePry was similar
I
in the two groups (median of 26 days [IQ25-75, 21-33] in the Rehab group and median of 25
R
days [IQ25-75, 20-40] in the UC group).
C
The two groups did not differ regarding preoperative demograpShic, clinical and functional
U
data (Tables 1 and 2). Surgical characteristics and anesthetic management were also similar in
N
the two groups: more than 80% of patients underwent major lung resection through open
A
thoracotomy and received thoracic epidural analgesia (Table 3). In the Rehab group,
M
adherence to the prescribed training sessions was 87±18% (median 8 sessions, IQ25-75 [7-
10]) and no serious adverse event was repoDrted during the HIIT sessions. The daily step count
tended to be higher in the Rehab grouEp (7’243±3’934 steps versus 6’315±3’690 steps in the
T
UC group, P=0.082).
P
Primary Outcome
E
In-hospital clinical outcome data were available in all participants. As shown in Table 4, a
C
total of 66 patieCnts reached the composite postoperative mortality-morbidity endpoint
including 27 ofA the 74 patients (35.5%) in the Rehab group and 39 of 77 patients (50.6%) in
the UC group (Relative Risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.48 – 1.02).
Secondary outcomes
Compared with baseline measurements, significant changes in CPET and 6MWT parameters
occurred at the end of the preoperative waiting period (table 5). In the UC group, the peakVO
2
declined during the preoperative waiting period (median -8% [IQ25-75, -16 to 0%], P=0.005).

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
In contrast, in the Rehab group, there were significant increases in peakVO (median +15 %
2
[IQ25-75%, +9 to +22%], P=0.004), in peakWR (median +6% [IQ25-75, 0 to +17%];
P=0.003), and in walking distance at the 6MWT (median +15% [IQ25-75, +8 to +28%],
P<0.001) with a non-significant increase in AT (median +8 % [IQ25-75, -7 to + 20%,
T
P=0.083)]. The effect size of the Rehab intervention was significant regarding peakVO (0.46,

95%CI 0.26 to 0.66) and walking distance (0.49, 0.24 to 0.74), and non-significant regarding

C
and peakWR (0.28, -0.98 to 0.58). The target physiological endpoints were achieved in 75.7%
S
of rehabilitated patients and this functional improvement was consistent regardless of patient
U
characteristics and cancer stages (Figure 2). Attendance to the prescribed training sessions did
N
not differ between responders and non-responders (89% vs 81%).

The incidence of cardiovascular and surgical complications as well as the rate of admission in
M
the ICU and the hospital length of stay did not differ between the two groups. In contrast, the
D
incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was lower in the Rehab group (23% vs
E
44% in the UC group P=0.018), owing to a reduced rate of atelectasis (12.2% vs 36.4%,
T
P<0.001) and this was accompanied by a shorter stay in the PACU (median -7 hours, IQ25-
P
75% -4 to -10) compared with the UC group. Subgroup analysis revealed that the beneficial
E
effect of Rehab on postoperative pulmonary complications was larger among “responders”
C
than in “non-responders” (RR 0.25, 95%CI [0.12-0.53]) and consistent among men, elderly,
C
overweight subjects, patients with cardiac risks factors, those with preserved aerobic capacity
A
and regardless of the presence or absence of COPD (Figure 3).
Regression analysis showed that independent predictors of postoperative pulmonary
complications were: preoperative peakVO rehabilitation intervention, and COPD (Wald =

10.0, 7.5, and 4.1; P= 0.002, 0.006 and, 0.043, respectively).

Discussion
This study demonstrates that preparing patients before lung cancer resection with a HIIT
program enhances their physical fitness but fails to improve postoperative clinical outcome.
At patient enrollment, the mean peakVO (20 ml/kg/min) and the mean 6MWT distance (383
2 T
m) were on average, respectively 18% and 42% below values expected for age- and sex-
P
I
matched sedentary individuals. In a multicenter trial including 346 patients with NSLC,
R
Loewen et al. reported even greater preoperative impairment in aerobic capacity (mean
C
VO of 15.8 ml/kg/min) and a larger proportion of patients with low preoperative VO
2peak 2peak
S
that has been shown to be predictive of major cardiopulmonary complications.2,26 In contrast
U
to chronic conditions such as COPD and cardiovascular dNisease, poor aerobic fitness, as well
as heavy smoking and alcohol absorption are amenablAe to targeted risk-reducing strategies.
M
Therefore, our short-term HIIT program was intended to augment preoperative physiological
reserves and to facilitate postoperative functional recovery. The delay from “decision-to-treat”
D
to surgery was within the maximal waiting time of 28 days recommended by the British
E
Thoracic Society.27 During the thrTee to four weeks waiting period, patients receiving usual
care exhibited a mild declinPe in CPET parameters and walking capacity that could be
E
attributed to the inflammatory component associated with lung cancer, COPD and other
C
chronic illnesses.28 This impairment in aerobic functional capacity was successfully offset in
C
76% patients who were enrolled in a HIIT program. After attending 7 to 13 supervised
A
training sessions, both peakVO and walking capacity improved by a median value of 15%,
2
regardless of patient preoperative characteristics. Baseline physiological values as well as the
intensity, the type and the duration of exercise training are key factors determining CRF
changes. Endurance training classically entails moderate intensity efforts during daily
sessions lasting 60 to 120 min and scheduled over a prolonged period of 6 to 12 weeks. Such
“high volume” training has been shown to improve aerobic performances as a result of blood
11
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
volume expansion, higher cardiac output and enhanced muscle oxygen extraction.28 In
contrast, the “low-volume” HIIT (40 min, 2-3 times a week, 3-4 weeks) has been shown to
produce similar or larger gains in peakVO owing to enhanced skeletal muscle oxidative
2
capacity, independent of any changes in cardiac performances and in blood-oxygen carrying
T
capacity.29,30 Even a few sessions of HIIT appear sufficient to stimulate transcriptional
P
mitochondrial biogenesis, inducing aerobic phenotypic changes characterized by increased
I
R
mitochondrial expression/activity of proteins involved in fat oxidation, tricarboxylic acid
C
cycle and electron transport chain.31
S
In the current trial, we reported all TMM complications graded II to IV. Hence, the incidence
U
of postoperative complications (overall 37%) was higher than expected from our previous
N
work and higher than reported by others.15,32 The TMM classification has been derived from
A
the Dindo-Clavien scoring system in order to staMndardize the reporting of adverse outcome
and to overcome the limitations of considering each complication separately.33 This
D
composite measure is well validated and widely applied in perioperative medicine to grade
E
the severity of postoperative complications, considering the intensity of therapeutics and
T
resources. In a study involving a majority of video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection,
P
Beck-Schimmer et al recently reported a 15% incidence of postoperative complications
E
graded III to IV.34 Besides the different threshold to capture postoperative morbidity, our
C
study population wCas also at greater risk of postoperative complications given the more
invasive surgicAal approach (81% thoracotomies) and a higher proportion of extended
resection (e.g., 20% pneumonectomy/bilobectomy).
Although peakVO , peakWR and walking distance were all increased after 5 to 10 HIIT
2
sessions, this enhanced aerobic condition did not translate into better clinical outcome, except
a lower rate of atelectasis coupled with a shorter length of stay in the PACU.

Several arguments can be given to explain these findings and, at the same time, to highlight
the limitations of this trial. One may argue that the relative risk reduction in primary outcome
(approximately -30%) would have been statistically significant if the study had been
continued to enroll a total of 362 patients. Down-sizing the study sample was justified by the
T
interim analysis showing a higher than expected incidence of postoperative complications
P
(46% instead of 22% initially estimated). Noteworthy, the majority of patients enrolled after
I
R
the interim analysis underwent lung resection via VATS instead of open thoracotomy. This
C
lesser invasive surgical approach contributed to reduce the rate of postoperative complications
S
over the last 6 month of this study, regardless of group allocation.
U
Cardiovascular complications did not differ between the two groups. The standard risk
N
reducing strategies that were applied (e.g., preoperative patient assessment, thoracic epidural
A
analgesia and fluid restriction) resulted in a low raMte of myocardial infarct and heart failure (<
5%). Not surprisingly, tachy-arrhythmias, the most frequent cardiac adverse event, were not
D
responsive to the effects of rehabilitation as they are mainly related to surgical inflammation,
E
autonomic nerve injuries and cardiac overload.35 Moreover, concerns have been raised about
T
the pro-arrhythmic effects of HIIT although the effectiveness of long term endurance training
P
has been clearly established in improving endothelial dysfunction, myocardial remodeling,
E
cardiac autonomic contCrol and b -adrenoceptor balance.36,37
C
Interestingly, pulmonary complications were reduced by 45% in the Rehab group, the greatest
A
impact being on atelectasis and particularly among patients who exhibited a positive response
to HIIT. Even if atelectasis graded II are often considered benign, the initiation of corrective
therapy with CPAP or NIV in the PACU is justified in order to correct oxygenation
disturbances and to prevent further extension and the development of infection. In the Rehab
group, the lesser incidence of atelectasis was associated with a slight reduction in PACU
length of stay (median -7h), compared with the usual care group.

Reversal of respiratory muscle dysfunction is an attractive mechanism underlying the
protective effects of HIIT in thoracic surgical patients. Indeed, weakness of the respiratory
muscles has been consistently reported in patients with low preoperative peakVO and
2
COPD.38 two features that were identified as independent predictors of pulmonary
T
complications in the current trial. Using similar short-term total-body aerobic reconditioning
P
programs, Dunham et al reported up to 40% increase in maximal inspiratory pressure, the
I
R
HIIT modality providing a time-efficient alternative to endurance training in increasing both
C
CRF and respiratory muscle function.39
S
Recent systematic reviews suggest that preoperative, -but not postoperative-, interventions
U
including moderate-intense aerobic exercise may contribute to improve functional capacity
N
and to reduce postoperative pulmonary morbidity.40,41 However, no firm conclusions could be
A
drawn given the heterogeneity of patient populatioMns, the variety of interventional approaches,
the lack of standardized criteria defining morbidity outcomes and the small numbers of
D
enrolled patients. To date, only 5 randomized controlled trials including a total of 196 patients
E
have been published and none was powered to detect meaningful clinical differences.41 The
T
current study including 151 patients is the largest trial conducted so far.
P
Even though this trial presEents negative results regarding the primary outcome, the positive
impact on the developCment of atelectasis should not be ignored nor overemphasized. Our
C
results are consistent with the hypothesis that HIIT-induced CRF improvement enables
A
patients to better withstand respiratory derangements, namely muscular weakness resulting
from surgical stress and the residual effects of anesthetic agents while facilitating lung
reexpansion postoperatively. The study was underpowered to detect meaningful difference in
major pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or ARDS. Moreover, 25 % of
rehabilitated patients failed to experience any benefit in terms of aerobic fitness or walking
capacity despite attending the prescribed training sessions. Non-response to specialized
14
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
rehabilitative interventions has been attributed to genetic factors, physical disabilities,
adjunctive chemotherapy and low volume/low intensity of exercise.42,43 Psycho-social
interventions, inspiratory muscle training and nutritional support could favorably complement
the rehabilitation programs.44
T
In conclusion, we demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of a short-term exercise training
P
program in improving aerobic performances in patients awaiting lungI cancer surgery.
R
However, this HIIT rehabilitation modality failed to produce significant difference in
C
composite morbidity-mortality index, compared with usual care. Adequately powered
S
randomized studies including high-risk patients and focusing on clinical outcome endpoints
U
should question the benefits of preoperative rehabilitation interventions.
