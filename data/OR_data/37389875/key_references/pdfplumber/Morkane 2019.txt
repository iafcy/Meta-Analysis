Abstract:
Background: Time spent on the waiting list prior to liver transplantation (LT) provides an
opportunity to optimise recipient fitness through prehabilitation; potentially reducing the
physiological impact of major surgery. We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a six-
D
week exercise programme in patients with cirrhotic liver disease awaiting LT.
Methods: This single centre, prospective cohort, feasibility study, enrolled patients awaiting
E
LT to a six week period of thrice weekly, supervised exercise on a static bike.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to objectively assess cardiopulmonary
T
fitness at baseline and after six weeks of exercise. A follow-up CPET was performed at 12
weeks. CPET-derived measures were used to guide prescription of the training programme. A
P
non-randomised control cohort of LT patients were selected to match the exercise group
based on specific demographic data. AlloEcation to study arms was primarily based on the
distance participants lived from the hospital where training occurred. Both groups received
C
structured nutritional advice.
Results: The exercise programme was feasible, with 9/16 (56%) patients completing the full
C
programme of six weeks. Peak oxygen consumption (VO peak) in the exercise group rose
2
from a mean (SD) of 16.2 (± 3.4) ml/kg/min at baseline to 18.5 (±4.6) ml/kg/min at week 6
A
(p=0.02). In the control group VO peak decreased from a mean (SD) of 19.0 (± 6.1)
2
ml/kg/min to 17.1 (±6.0) at week 6 (p=0.03).
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that it is feasible to engage patients awaiting LT in an
intensive aerobic exercise programme with a signal of improvement in fitness being detected.

Background:
Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD),
with a one- and five-year survival of 93.8% and 81.3% respectively across UK liver
transplant centres.1 Malnutrition is a frequent burden in ESLD; reported in more than 50% of
D
patients with decompensated liver disease and long recognised as a prognostic and
therapeutic determinant in ESLD.2 Physical deconditioning and sarcopenia result from the
E
combined effects of impaired dietary intake, altered macronutrient and micronutrient
metabolism, chronic inflammation and low physical activity.3 Frailty is the end result of
T
prolonged sarcopenia and physical deconditioning. The frailty syndrome is itself associated
with a higher rate of complications in the perioperative period, including susceptibility to
P
infection, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and is an independent predictor of lower survival in
cirrhosis and in patients undergoing livEer transplantation.4,5 Measures should be taken to
address poor physical fitness and frailty in this cohort. Attention is turning towards the
C
development of effective exercise/lifestyle intervention programmes known as
‘prehabilitation’ for patients awaiting LT, where involvement of a liver multidisciplinary
C
team is essential, particularly in respect to tailored physical and nutritional intervention.
Recent studies have shown a beneficial impact of preoperative exercise for patients with
colon A and rectal cancer6–8 in terms of cardiorespiratory fitness,7 respiratory muscle
endurance,6 fatigue and physical health perceptions.8 A reduction in postoperative hospital
length of stay in the intervention group has been demonstrated when prehabilitation has been
used in both cardiac and major vascular surgery.9
There is currently limited data available to determine the effects of exercise in the complex
cohort of patients with ESLD awaiting LT. A 2018 meta-analysis sought to assess the effects
of exercise on patients with cirrhosis,10 revealing only four small studies with 81 patients
included. A limited range of clinical conditions were studied and heterogenous outcome

measures reported. Associations with improvement in peak oxygen consumption
(VO peak),11 exercise capacity11–13 quality of life,13 reduced fatigue11 and hepatic venous
2
pressure gradient (HVPG)14 were found.
Knowledge pertaining to the field of exercise training prior to LT is still at an early stage;
D
indeed, there is no existing evidence that patients with decompensated liver disease awaiting
transplantation would simply comply with a prehabilitation programme. There is
E
considerable scope for further evaluation to define the optimal prehabilitation programme to
keep patients well on the liver transplant waiting list. This single-centre study was designed
T
to address the issue of feasibility and it forms the first stage in a larger programme of work to
investigate the impact of perioperative exercise training on patients awaiting LT.
P
We wanted to know whether it would be possible to engage patients in a programme of
intense supervised aerobic exercise, in Ea hospital setting over a period of six weeks. We
designed a simple feasibility study to determine this, to understand fitness levels in patients
C
awaiting LT and to see if there were any signals of fitness improvement when compared to a
group of matched patients not involved in an exercise programme.
C
Methods:
Study design
A
This single centre cohort study assessed the feasibility of a six-week, structured,
prehabilitation programme in patients awaiting LT. It also compared levels of fitness before
and after the programme to a demographically matched control group awaiting LT who did
not undergo exercise training. Ethical approval for this study was granted by London
Bromley Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/0762). Local NHS permission was granted by
the Royal Free London NHS Trust. Written consent was obtained for all patients. Trial
registration was not considered necessary for this non-randomised internal feasibility study.

Study setting / participants:
Patients aged 18 years and over with a diagnosis of cirrhotic liver disease awaiting LT at the
Royal Free Hospital were invited to join a six-week exercise training programme. The study
ran from June 2016 to December 2017. Patients were eligible for inclusion once they were
D
formally listed for LT. Invitation to the exercise programme was based on the distance
potential participants lived from the hospital as the exercise intervention was delivered within
E
the hospital in an outpatient clinic. It was assumed that those patients living a long distance
from the hospital would be unable to make this journey three times a week for six weeks. The
T
study was limited to cirrhotic patients given the high prevalence of physical inactivity,
compounded by multiple other factors including malnutrition, decreased hepatic protein
P
synthesis, hypermetabolism, low testosterone and an increase in inflammatory cytokines,
alongside cardiac and skeletal muscle Edeconditioning and the potential for an exercise
intervention to limit decline.
C
Specific exclusion criteria were: non-cirrhotic liver disease, an oncological diagnosis as the
primary reason for transplantation and a contraindication to exercise training or testing
C
(according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest
Physicians (ACCP) guidelines.15 Given that the primary aim of this study was feasibility,
A
formal randomisation was not considered necessary and the study was not designed to detect
differences in outcomes. The ‘standard care’ cohort of patients (no exercise programme) were
matched to those in the exercise group according to specific demographic criteria: age, sex
and disease severity (model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score). Once patients were
matched, allocation to study arms was a function of geographical location and logistical
ability to commit to attending hospital three times per week.

Assessment of fitness:
Self-reported activity status was assessed at baseline using the Duke activity status index
(DASI) score.16 Serial CPET was used to objectively assess change in cardiopulmonary
fitness at the following time points: baseline (week 0), at the midpoint of the exercise training
D
to guide the subsequent exercise prescription (week 3; exercise group only), at the end of the
6 week exercise programme and a final CPET at week 12. All CPETs were performed using
E
an electromagnetically-braked cycle ergometer (Corival, Lode, Gronigen, the Netherlands)
and a breath-by-breath analysis system (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). The CPET testing
T
protocol involved patients resting for 3 minutes, undergoing 3 minutes unloaded exercise on
a static bike, then between 6-10 minutes of appropriate incrementally ramped exercise
P
(dependent on patient fitness), during which cycling intensity was gradually increased.
Patients were fitted with a facemask Eto enable continuous measurement of respiratory
variables. Finger prick haemoglobin concentration was routinely measured prior to each
C
CPET test (Hemocue, Ängelholm, Sweden). CPET data were analysed by the same two
trained practitioners (one was blinded to patient identification). Anaerobic threshold (AT)
C
and VO peak were used to assess changes in fitness. Where disagreement in AT
2
interpretation of > 10% occurred, a third blinded expert was asked to interpret AT position.
A
Exercise programme:
Following the baseline CPET, patients were asked to attend thrice weekly exercise training
sessions for 6 weeks. Outpatient sessions were held at the Royal Free Hospital, London, UK
and patients travelled from home for each appointment. Each training session consisted of 40
minutes (including 5 min warm-up and 5 min cool-down) of interval training on an
electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Optibike Ergoselect 200; Ergoline, GmbH, Bitz,
Germany). The exercise training intensities were formulated according to an individual’s
CPET data at weeks 0 and 3, and altered according to measured work rates at VO for AT
2

and VO peak. The interval training protocol consisted of alternating moderate (80% of work
2
rate at VO at AT: 4 x 3 minute intervals) to severe (50% of the difference in work rates
2
between VO at peak exercise and VO at AT: 4 x by 2 minute intervals) intensities (total 20
2 2
min) for the first two sessions. This was then increased to 40 minutes (6 x 3 minute intervals
D
at moderate intensity and 6 x 2 minute intervals at severe intensity).
Power intervals were calculated for each subject as follows:
E
Moderate-intensity exercise: (work load at VO and AT −2/3 of work ramp) × 80 %
2
Severe-intensity exercise: ((Work load at VO Peak- work load at AT −2/3 of work
2
T
ramp) × 50 %) + work load at AT
Comparison (control) group:
P
A comparator ‘usual care’ group was created by selecting patients matched to those in the
exercise group according to age, sex anEd MELD (model of end-stage liver disease) score.
These patients underwent CPET at 0, 6 and 12 weeks but no exercise programme was
C
initiated. Once patients were demographically matched, allocation to study groups was based
on geography and logistics; the patient living furthest from the hospital was allocated to the
C
control group to avoid any logistical issues in thrice weekly hospital visits.
Nutritional assessment:
A
Both the groups received standardised nutritional assessment and advice, at baseline and at 6
weeks. Difficulties in the accurate assessment of nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis
are widely recognised, given that many of the markers associated with malnutrition are
intrinsically affected in liver disease (e.g. albumin and lymphopenia). Therefore skeletal
muscle evaluation provides an objective means to determine nutritional status.3,17
Assessment was made and nutritional advice given by the same specialist liver transplant
dietitian at baseline (prior to first CPET) and again prior to the week six CPET for all patients
in both the exercise and comparator groups. The RFH Global Assessment Data Collection

Form was used which encompasses measures of body mass index (BMI), mid-arm muscle
circumference (MAMC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), hand-grip strength combined with
details of dietary intake18 (see supplementary material). The Royal Free Hospital (RFH)
Global Assessment Data Collection Form has been validated as a nutritional assessment
D
method specifically for this patient population.18
Usual recent dietary intake was assessed using a self-reported diet history. Details of any
E
dietary restrictions and nutritional support supplements were recorded. These data were used
to provide an overall impression of the adequacy of the diet in relation to estimated daily
T
requirements, for energy (35-40 kcal/kgBW/d) and protein (1.2-1.5 g/kgBW/d).19–22 Intakes
were categorised as adequate if they met estimated requirements, inadequate if they did not
P
meet estimated requirements but exceeded 500 kcal/d, or negligible if they provided fewer
than 500 kcal/d.18 E
Anthropometric assessment:
C
An estimated dry weight was determined using clinical assessment, previously documented
weights, ascitic volumes removed at paracentesis, and published guidelines. BMI was
calculated from thC e estimated dry weight and height18 Mid-arm circumference (MAC) and
triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) were measured on the nondominant arm using
A
Holtain/Tanner Whitehouse skinfold callipers (Holtain, Crymych, UK) and a tape measure.
Mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) was then calculated as per the formula:
MAMC = MAC – (TSF x 0.3142)23
MAMC and TSF measurements were compared with published standards24 and MAMC
expressed in relation to the 5th percentile, for the appropriate age and gender category.18

Follow up assessment:
All participants were invited to a follow up CPET at 12 weeks after baseline if they were still
awaiting LT. The purpose of this was to determine any alteration in level of fitness from
week 6 to 12.

Results
C
A total of 16 patients were recruited to the exercise group and 17 to the standard care group
(a total of 33 patients); there were no differences in demographic data between groups (table
C
1). There were no differences in self-reported activity status between groups at baseline as
reflected in the DASI score. Baseline mean haemoglobin concentration was lower in the
A
exercise group at 108.6 (20.8) g/l versus 117.6 (19.8) g/l in controls (p=0.21). Nine of the 16
patients in the exercise group completed the 6-week exercise programme (56%). In the
control group, 11 out of 17 patients (65%) completed CPET tests at week six. Transplantation
and clinical deterioration were the predominant reasons for patient drop-out (see figure 1 for
study flow diagram); no patient dropped out of the intervention group due to an inability to
complete the exercise prescribed to them. Deterioration was largely the result of obstructive
cholangiopathy and need for hospitalisation.
10

Of the 20 patients (61%) completing the 6 week study period (9 in the exercise arm and 11 in
the control group), a further 5 (25%) did not complete the 12 week follow-up CPET (4 were
in the control group); transplantation being the primary reason for this with 3 patients
receiving a liver. One patient withdrew from the control arm as they did not want to do a
D
third CPET test and another control arm patient deteriorated due to profound decompensation
of cirrhotic liver disease necessitating hospitalisation.
E
There were no incidents of worsening cirrhotic decompensation as a result of the exercise and
no adverse incidents related to exercise training were reported. Compliance with the
T
prescribed exercise training was high with 127 out of the overall total of 135 exercise
sessions (94%) completed by the 9 patients finishing the exercise intervention.
P
CPET measures at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12 are displayed in table 2. There was an
increase in VO peak in the exercise groEup from a mean (SD) of 16.2 (± 3.4) ml/kg/min at
2
baseline rising to 18.5 (±4.6) ml/kg/min at week 6 (p=0.02). By week 12 (6 weeks after
C
exercise cessation) the mean VO peak reduced to 17.4 (±3.0) ml/kg/min. In the control
2
group, VO peak decreased from a mean of 19.0 (± 6.1) ml/kg/min to 17.1 (±6.0) at week 6
2
C
(p=0.03). Figure 2 illustrates VO at AT and peak across both exercise and comparator
2
groups at baseline, weeks 6 and 12. There was a significant increase in mean VE/VCO (ratio
2
A
of ventilation to carbon dioxide output) at AT in the control group, rising from a baseline
value of 30.9 (4.0) to 33.6 (4.5) at week 6.
The anthropometric measures (as per the RFH global assessment tool) at baseline and week 6
assessments, are displayed in table 3. There was no overall change in BMI (dry weight) in
either group across the study period; patients in the exercise group had a higher BMI than
controls at baseline. An increase in mean handgrip strength from 26.4 (±7.5) kg at baseline to
29.4 (±6.4) kg at week 6 was observed in the exercise group (p=0.05), whilst handgrip in the
control group was 29.1 (±10.7) kg at baseline and 30.5 (±13) kg at week 6 (p=0.80). There
11

was no change in MAC over the six-week study period in either group. The mean MAMC in
the exercise group was 28.6 (±4.6) cm at baseline and 29.9 (±5.7) cm after 6 weeks of
training (p=0.22), indicating an increase in muscle mass, whereas, the mean MAMC in the
control group was 24.2 (±3.3) cm at baseline and 23.5 (±3.7) cm at week 6 (p=0.16).
D
Of the 20 patients that completed the six-week study period, 16 had received their liver
transplants with one patient still on the waiting list one year after the end of the study. Two
E
patients (one in the exercise and one in the control group) were delisted as they clinically
improved hence no longer met transplantation criteria and one control patient went on to be
T
delisted due to profound decompensation and deterioration. The mean time to transplant with
respect to completion of the six-week exercise training period was 165 (118) days in the
P
exercise group and 192 (211) days in the controls.
There were no deaths in the postoperatEive period until hospital discharge in either group.
Post-transplant outcome data is presented in table 4. The median (IQR) hospital length of stay
C
for the index transplant admission in the exercise group was 13 (6) days and 30 (13) days in
the control group, a difference of 13 days (p=0.02).

Discussion
This study demonstrated that it was safe and feasible to engage patients with cirrhotic liver
A
disease awaiting LT surgery in an intense, supervised exercise programme comprised of three
sessions a week in a hospital outpatient clinic for a total of for six-weeks. Whilst the study
was not designed or powered to detect differences in secondary outcomes we observed an
increase in VO peak in patients who underwent the exercise programme, which declined six
2
weeks after cessation of the programme. This suggests exercise has the potential to improve
aerobic fitness but that this gain is lost and deconditioning occurs once exercise stops. In
contrast, a decline in VO peak was observed in a matched control group, suggesting that this
2
patient group becomes progressively more unfit over time, probably as a result of their
12

underlying disease and lack of exercise. In addition, handgrip strength improved in the
exercise group, suggesting that lower limb exercise may have a more systemic impact.
This study demonstrated that it was feasible to motivate patients to attend hospital three times
a week and participate in an aerobic exercise training programme whilst awaiting LT. We
D
observed a high rate of compliance with exercise sessions in our centre in those selected
based on the distance they lived from the hospital. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that
E
compliance would be far less were patients to have lived further away, as was the case in the
comparator group of this study. Given that many patients awaiting LT nationally live a
T
substantial distance from their transplant centre, such an intense method of exercise
intervention may not be appropriate for all of them due to the logistics of travel. A modified
P
approach to training patients in their local hospital, a local gymnasium or within their own
home could be viable alternatives. FutEure research should seek to address this area and
involve patients with the design of studies to optimise what will work best for them in this
C
regard.
This study has a number of limitations. Due to the feasibility design, participants were not
C
randomised, there was no observer blinding and the sample size was not powered to detect
differences in physiological or postoperative outcomes. All these factors increase the chance
A
of confounding and a type 2 error in the presented data. The purpose of collecting these data,
however, were to determine the level of fitness in patients awaiting LT in our centre, the
heterogeneity in that measure and whether there was a signal of improvement in fitness in the
exercised group versus the non-exercised group. All of this information will be essential for
the design of a more comprehensive study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an exercise
intervention. A further limitation of this study was the notable drop out rate of participants,
with 13 patients (39.4%) in total (7 in exercise and 6 in control) failing to complete the six
week study period. This information is also crucial for the design of future studies. Five of
13

these patients were transplanted shortly after recruitment, which is an inherent, unpredictable
risk specific to the study population. Likewise, attrition due to patient medical deterioration is
also not an unexpected finding given the comorbid nature of the cohort. What is important to
note, however, is that no patients in the exercise cohort dropped out because they were
D
physically or logistically unable to complete the programme. This demonstrates that the
amount of exercise prescribed was tolerable by all patients. Postoperative outcomes
E
following LT are highly multifactorial and attributing the significant reduction in hospital
length of stay to preoperative exercise in the context of an inadequately powered trial would
T
be but inappropriate, particularly given the lag time from completion of exercise to
transplantation. However, it is an association that merits further research.
P
Existing LT literature demonstrates consistently that malnutrition adversely impacts upon
post transplant morbidity and mortalEity20,25–27; likewise, an association between low
cardiopulmonary reserve and 90-day post-transplant mortality has been shown.28 We have
C
demonstrated that a preoperative exercise training programme alongside structured nutritional
advice, may aid in maintaining muscle mass and strength. It follows that close attention to
C
nutrition and physical optimisation on the liver transplant waiting is essential and is indeed an
emerging research target.
A
Having demonstrated that intense aerobic exercise training is feasible in patients with
cirrhosis awaiting LT and that there may be measurable improvements in fitness, urgent
follow up research is required in this area. Modification of our design with the input of
patients could result in a deliverable intervention that will have a tangible effect on the long-
term outcomes of this patient population. A greater understanding of the dose-response
relationship of exercise and outcomes is required, along with a more detailed understanding
of factors that determine ongoing patient engagement with complex interventions such as
this. Our collaborative interdisciplinary approach sets a precedent for future studies to build

upon and a multi-centre study to assess efficacy is now required. Exercise has been shown to
be effective in improving the health and well being of almost every patient group it has been
applied to29 and it is highly likely this could be the case for patients with end-stage liver
disease who are awaiting transplantation surgery.
