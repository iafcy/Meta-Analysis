Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the effects of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation programme in patients
with lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Design: Randomized, single-blind controlled trial.
Setting: Teaching hospital.
Subjects: Patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Intervention: Participants were randomized to either a prehabilitation group or a control group.
Participants in the prehabilitation group underwent a combination of moderate endurance and resistance
training plus breathing exercises three to five times per week.
Main measures: The primary outcome of the study was exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were
muscle strength (Senior Fitness Test), health-related quality of life (Short-Form 36) and the postoperative
outcomes. Patients were evaluated at baseline (before randomization), presurgery (only the prehabilitation
group), after surgery and three months post-operatively.
Results: A total of 40 patients were randomized and 22 finished the study (10 in the prehabilitation group
and 12 in the control group). Three patients were lost to follow-up at three months. After the training,
there was a statistically significant improvement in exercise tolerance (+397 seconds, p = 0.0001), the
physical summary component of the SF-36 (+4.4 points, p = 0.008) and muscle strength (p < 0.01). There
were no significant differences between groups after surgery. However, three months postoperatively,
significant differences were found in the mean change of exercise capacity (p = 0.005), physical summary
component (p = 0.001) and upper and lower body strength (p = 0.045 and p = 0.002).
Conclusions: A pulmonary rehabilitation programme before video-assisted thoracic surgery seems to
improve patients’ preoperative condition and may prevent functional decline after surgery.
