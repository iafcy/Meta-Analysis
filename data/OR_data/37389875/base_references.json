            "title": "The Role and Effect of Multimodal Prehabilitation Before Major Abdominal Surgery: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      For patients undergoing abdominal surgery, multimodal prehabilitation, including nutrition and exercise interventions, aims to optimize their preoperative physical and physiological capacity. This meta-analysis aims to explore the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on surgical and functional outcomes of abdominal surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Medline, Embase and CENTRAL were searched for articles about multimodal prehabilitation in major abdominal surgery. Primary outcomes were postoperative complications with a Clavien-Dindo score ≥3, and functional outcomes, measured by the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT). Secondary outcome measures included the quality-of-life measures. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated, with DerSimonian and Laird random effects used to account for heterogeneity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-five studies were included, analysing 4,210 patients across 13 trials and 12 observational studies. Patients undergoing prehabilitation had significantly fewer overall complications (RR = 0.879, 95% CI 0.781-0.989, p = 0.034). There were no significant differences in the rates of wound infection, anastomotic leak and duration of hospitalization. The 6MWT improved preoperatively in patients undergoing prehabilitation (SMD = 33.174, 95% CI 12.674-53.673, p = 0.005), but there were no significant differences in the 6MWT at 4 weeks (SMD = 30.342, 95% CI - 2.707-63.391, p = 0.066) and 8 weeks (SMD = 24.563, 95% CI - 6.77-55.900, p = 0.104) postoperatively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      As preoperative patient optimization shifts towards an interdisciplinary approach, evidence from this meta-analysis shows that multimodal prehabilitation improves the preoperative functional capacity and reduces postoperative complication rates, suggesting its potential in effectively optimizing the abdominal surgery patient. However, there is a large degree of heterogenicity between the prehabilitation interventions between included articles; hence results should be interpreted with caution."

Seven of these patients underwent coronary angiography, and one had significant coronary artery disease. Postoperative troponin elevation occurred in 14 patients. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of troponin elevation in those patients with positive DSE versus those with negative DSE. No significant difference was identified in the prevalence of troponin elevation when comparing those patients with cardiac risk factors who underwent DSE with those patients with no risk factors and no DSE performed. DSE had a sensitivity of 0.2 and a specificity of 0.9 for myocardial injury. The prevalence of intraoperative hemodynamic instability was significantly higher in patients who had evidence of myocardial injury, but hemodynamic instability was no more common in patients who had a positive DSE.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      When used in accordance with our protocol a positive DSE does not reliably identify patients at high cardiac risk during liver transplantation, but a negative DSE is strongly predictive of no myocardial injury."

Of the 13 patients, 7 (54%) reported the same symptoms preoperatively; and of these, 5 had ARCA. Postoperative morbidity occurred in 16 (67%), including pericardial effusion (n = 11), wound infection (n = 2), and development of mild aortic insufficiency (n = 4).

            "abstract": "In pulmonary hypertension, exercise is limited by an impaired right ventricular (RV) stroke volume response. We hypothesized that improvement in exercise capacity after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is paralleled by an improved RV stroke volume response. We studied the extent of PEA-induced restoration of RV stroke volume index (SVI) response to exercise using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Patients with CTEPH (n = 18) and 7 healthy volunteers were included. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cMRI were performed before and 1 year after PEA. For cMRI studies, pre- and post-operatively, all patients exercised at 40% of their preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing-assessed maximal workload. Post-PEA patients (n = 13) also exercised at 40% of their postoperative maximal workload. Control subjects exercised at 40% of their predicted maximal workload. Preoperatively, SVI (n = 18) decreased during exercise from 35.9 ± 7.4 to 33.0 ± 9.0 ml·m(2) (p = 0.023); in the control subjects, SVI increased (46.6 ± 7.6 vs 57.9 ± 11.8 ml·m(-2), p = 0.001). After PEA, the SVI response (ΔSVI) improved from -2.8 ± 4.6 to 4.0 ± 4.6 ml·m(2) (p <0.001; n = 17). On exercise at 40% of the postoperative maximal workload, SVI did not increase further and was still significantly lower compared with controls. Moreover, 4 patients retained a negative SVI response, despite (near) normalization of their pulmonary hemodynamics. The improvement in SVI response was accompanied by an increased exercise tolerance and restoration of RV remodeling. In conclusion, in CTEPH, exercise is limited by an impaired stroke volume response. PEA induces a restoration of SVI response to exercise that appears, however, incomplete and not evident in all patients."

Fifty-two patients completed questionnaires and an incremental walking stress test pre-operatively and 6-months after THA. Twenty-four age-matched control subjects completed the same stress test. Fifty-one patients had less pain 6-months after THA compared to pre-operative levels. Forty-three patients showed an improvement of at least one walking duration category. Patients had compromised cardiovascular fitness compared to the control group with a tendency to improve after THA. Hence, 6-months following THA, deficits exist other than reduced strength as reported in the literature. Prior to THA, the ability to walk longer is compromised by pain and not by poor cardiovascular fitness. Studies on specific rehabilitation programs of varying intensities may demonstrate opportunities to improve the cardiovascular fitness of this population."

Research was supported by patient and public involvement.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Systematic review of longitudinal studies showed that moderate to severe long-term pain affects about 7–23% of patients after THR and 10–34% after TKR. In our cohort study, 10% of patients with hip replacement and 30% with knee replacement showed no clinically or statistically significant functional improvement. In our review of pain assessment few research studies used measures to capture the incidence, character and impact of long-term pain. Qualitative studies highlighted the importance of support by health and social professionals for patients at different stages of the joint replacement pathway. Our review of longitudinal studies suggested that patients with poorer psychological health, physical function or pain before surgery had poorer long-term outcomes and may benefit from pre-surgical interventions. However, uptake of a pre-operative pain management intervention was low. Although evidence relating to patient outcomes was limited, comorbidities are common and may lead to an increased risk of adverse events, suggesting the possible value of optimising pre-operative management. The evidence base on clinical effectiveness of pre-surgical interventions, occupational therapy and physiotherapy-based rehabilitation relied on small RCTs but suggested short-term benefit. Our feasibility studies showed that definitive trials of occupational therapy before surgery and post-discharge group-based physiotherapy exercise are feasible and acceptable to patients. Randomised trial results and systematic review suggest that patients with THR should receive local anaesthetic infiltration for the management of long-term pain, but in patients receiving TKR it may not provide additional benefit to femoral nerve block. From a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective, local anaesthetic infiltration was a cost-effective treatment in primary THR. In qualitative interviews, patients and health-care professionals recognised the importance of participating in the RCTs. To support future interventions and their evaluation, we conducted a study comparing outcome measures and analysed the RCTs as cohort studies. Analyses highlighted the importance of different methods in treating and assessing hip and knee osteoarthritis. There was an inverse association between radiographic severity of osteoarthritis and pain and function in patients waiting for TKR but no association in THR. Different pain characteristics predicted long-term pain in THR and TKR. Outcomes after joint replacement should be assessed with a patient-reported outcome and a functional test.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The RESTORE programme provides important information to guide the development of interventions to improve long-term outcomes for patients with osteoarthritis receiving THR and TKR.

The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of rest and stress echocardiography for perioperative and late cardiac events in 110 patients undergoing limb revascularization. All patients underwent preoperative clinical and echocardiographic evaluation at rest and by dipyridamole stress testing to assess cardiac risk. Patients with > or =3 clinical Eagle markers, low left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, or positive dipyridamole stress test results were considered at high cardiac risk. To record adverse cardiac events, all patients were monitored during and after surgery, and followed for at least 1 year after hospital discharge. Cardiac complications occurred in 10 patients (9.7%) perioperatively (2 fatal myocardial infarctions), and in 13 (13%) at 1-year follow-up (7 fatal myocardial infarctions). Echocardiographic evaluation was the best predictor of early (p <0.00003) and late (p <0.0003) cardiac complications. No patient with a negative dipyridamole stress test result and good left ventricular ejection fraction had cardiac complications, either postoperatively or during follow-up. Clinical evaluation does not appear sufficiently sensitive for predicting perioperative cardiac events, but was valuable in predicting late cardiac complications (p <0.0002). Our data show that echocardiographic evaluation of resting dysfunction and of the ischemic response to dipyridamole is a good predictor of perioperative cardiac risk, and is superior to generally available clinical data. Echocardiographic evaluation is useful in defining a low-risk group of patients who can safely undergo limb revascularization, whichever surgical procedure is proposed."

We used the three-equation method (3EQ-DL(CO)), a modification of the single breath DL(CO) technique to determine DL(CO) during exercise in 57 patients undergoing lung resection at Vancouver General Hospital from October 1998 to May 1999. 3EQ-DL(CO) was determined during steady-state exercise at 35% and 70% of the maximal workload reached in a progressive exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max), DL(CO) at rest, and the increase in DL(CO) during exercise were compared in relation to postoperative complications. Patients with complications had lower resting values of DL(CO) (R-DL(CO)), a smaller increase in DL(CO) from rest to 70% of maximal workload expressed as a percent of the predicted DL(CO) at rest ([70% - R]-DL(CO)%), and a lower VO(2)max than did patients without complications. Results suggested that (70% - R)-DL(CO)% was the best preoperative predictor of postoperative complications; a cutoff limit of 10% was the best index to identify complications, yielding a complication rate of 100% in patients with (70% - R)-DL(CO)% < 10% as compared with a complication rate of 10% in patients with (70% - R)-DL(CO)% >/= 10% (sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 100%).

At-risk patients are recommended to undergo split lung function studies to estimate the residual parenchyma function after surgery. In patients with borderline estimated values, a cardiopulmonary exercise test is recommended to stratify further risk. Preventive interventions of postoperative pulmonary complications, including pain control, respiratory chest physiotherapy and continuous positive airway pressure may effectively reduce the occurrence of pulmonary complications.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Pulmonary functional assessment is relevant in patients candidates for surgery. The prevention of the postoperative pulmonary complications is one of the most important goals of the treatment of patients undergoing surgery."

            "abstract": "This study assessed Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) in predicting oncological outcomes, post-operative recovery and complications in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) cytoreductive surgery. We reviewed all patients who had CPET prior to AOC cytoreductive surgery with evidence of upper abdominal disease on preoperative imaging at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB) between August 2016 and July 2019. Patients were stratified by AT and maximum VO2 levels. 43 patients were identified. AT showed no relationship with major complications. 100% of patients in the AT ≥11 group received R0 (n = 21, 91.30%), or R1 (n = 2, 8.70%) cytoreduction, whereas in the AT <11 group, only 75.00% achieved and R0 or R1 resection (p = .02). Surgical complexity was higher in the AT ≥11 group (p = .001) and the VO2 ≥15 group (p = .0006). No other correlations were seen between AT or VO2 max and complications or readmissions. No difference in overall survival was seen if R0 resection was achieved.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? CPET testing allows pre-operative assessment of functional capacity to generate variables that can be used as a risk-stratification tool for major surgery. Whilst CPET testing has been shown to predict morbidity in non-gynaecological surgery, it remains unproven in cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer surgery despite being increasingly utilised.What do the results of study add? Our data suggest that CPET testing does not predict complication rates or survival in AOC. Patients with poor CPET performance are more likely to receive suboptimal cytoreductive outcomes from surgery.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? CPET results should not be used to discount patients from cytoreductive surgery further research should address the interplay with nutrition, haematological markers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CPET performance."

All patients had an exercise tolerance test preoperatively and at 6, 18, and 36 months follow-up.

The usual approach of an unstructured patient interview does not predict outcomes. Structured interviews that incorporate validated questionnaires (Duke Activity Status Index) or standardized questions about physical activity (ability to climb stairs) do predict moderate-or-severe complications and cardiovascular complications.

The utility of CPET in this role is dependent on the technology being able to identify accurately and reliably those patients at increased risk of perioperative events when compared with existing risk stratification tools. This article identifies and reviews systematically the current literature regarding the use of CPET as a preoperative tool for stratifying risk in major non-cardiopulmonary surgery. Specifically, it focuses on evaluating the capacity of CPET variables to predict the risk of postoperative complications and mortality in comparison to other methods of risk assessment. Furthermore, the potential for combining results from CPET and non-CPET methods of risk prediction to enhance the capacity to identify high risk patients is considered. The review indicates that CPET can identify patients at increased risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. However, the selection of variables and threshold values to indicate high risk differ for different surgical procedures and underlying conditions. Furthermore, the available data suggest that CPET variables outperform alternative methods of preoperative risk stratification. Several studies also identify that CPET variables may be used in combination with non-CPET variables to increase perioperative risk prediction accuracy. These findings illustrate that CPET has the capacity to identify patients at increased risk of adverse outcome before a range of non-cardiopulmonary surgical procedures. Further research is required to optimise its use, potentially by combining CPET results with alternative methods of risk stratification."

We included randomized controlled trials that compared patients receiving exercise training with those receiving usual care or sham training before cardiac, lung, esophageal, or abdominal surgery. PPCs were the main outcome; secondary outcomes were preoperative functional changes and postoperative mortality, cardiovascular complications, and hospital length of stay. The study was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews).Results: From 29 studies, 2,070 patients were pooled for meta-analysis. Compared with the control condition, preoperative exercise training was associated with a lower incidence of PPCs (23 studies, 1,864 patients; relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.66; grading of evidence, moderate); Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed effectiveness, and there was no evidence of difference of effect across surgeries, type of training (respiratory muscles, endurance or combined), or preoperative duration of training. At the end of the preoperative period, exercise training resulted in increased peak oxygen uptake (weighted mean difference [WMD], +2 ml/kg/min; 99% CI, 0.3 to 3.7) and higher maximal inspiratory pressure (WMD, +12.2 cm H2O; 99% CI, 6.3 to 18.2). Hospital length of stay was shortened (WMD, -2.3 d; 99% CI, -3.82 to -0.75) in the intervention group, whereas no difference was found in postoperative mortality.Conclusions: Preoperative exercise training improves physical fitness and reduces the risk of developing PPCs while minimizing hospital resources use, regardless of the type of intervention and surgery performed.Systematic review registered with https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ (CRD 42018096956)."

            "abstract": "Patients requiring surgery for locally advanced esophagogastric cancer often require neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), which may have a detrimental impact on cardiorespiratory reserve. The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of a 5-week preoperative high-intensity interval training program after NAT, and to assess the potential effects of the training protocol on exercise capacity, muscle function, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). We prospectively studied consecutive patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal and gastric cancer in whom NAT was planned (chemo- or chemoradiotherapy). Feasibility was assessed with the TELOS (Technological, Economics, Legal, Operational, and Scheduling) components, and data on exercise tolerability (attendance and occurrence of adverse or unexpected events). Exercise capacity was assessed with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline, post-NAT, and following completion of a high-intensity interval exercise training (25 sessions). Changes in muscle strength and HRQL were also assessed. Of 33 recruited subjects (mean age 65 years), 17 received chemoradiotherapy and 16 chemotherapy. All the TELOS components were addressed before starting the intervention; from a total of 17 questions considered as relevant for a successful implementation, seven required specific actions to prevent potential concerns. Patients attended a mean of 19.4 (6.4) exercise sessions. The predefined level of attendance (≥15 sessions of scheduled sessions) was achieved in 27 out of 33 (81.8%) patients. Workload progression was adequate in 24 patients (72.7%). No major adverse events occurred. VO2peak decreased significantly between baseline and post-NAT (19.3 vs. 15.5 mL/Kg/min, P < 0.05). Exercise led to a significant improvement of VO2peak (15.5 vs. 19.6 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05). Exercise training was associated with clinically relevant improvements in some domains of HRQL, with the social and role function increasing by 10.5 and 11.6 points, respectively, and appetite loss and fatigue declining by 16 and 10.5, respectively. We conclude that a structured exercise training intervention is feasible and safe following NAT in patients with esophagogastric cancer, and it has positive effects to restore exercise capacity to baseline levels within 5 weeks with some improvements in HRQL."

Total work performed, maximal power achieved, exercise time and maximal oxygen uptake were significantly greater in patients after partial or complete repair than in patients without repair. Systemic arterial blood oxygen saturations at rest and during exercise were directly related to the degree of repair. Although heart rate at rest in the three study groups was similar to that in a separate group of normal control subjects, patients in all three study groups had a blunted heart rate response to exercise. The ventilatory equivalent for oxygen was increased both at rest and during exercise for patients without conduit repair and those with a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit without ventricular septal defect closure but was similar to that of control subjects in the group with conduit insertion and septal defect closure. This study indicates that patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect have decreased exercise tolerance both before and after corrective surgery. Exercise tolerance improves significantly after placement of a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery with or without ventricular septal defect closure. Although no further improvement in exercise tolerance occurs with closure of the septal defect, ventilatory function and systemic arterial blood oxygen saturation are improved."

The number and severity of episodes of rejection and infection after transplantation were also similar in the two groups 1, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. When recipient ideal weight was used in the analysis, right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions (EFs) were within normal limits (RVEF greater than 40%; LVEF greater than or equal to 45%) and similar in the two groups. When recipient actual weight was used in the analysis, the LVEF measured at 12 months after heart transplantation was higher in the oversized than in the undersized group (52 +/- 11 vs 46 +/- 10; p less than 0.05). Postoperative hemodynamic values and exercise tolerance were similar in the two groups regardless of whether recipient weight or ideal body weight were used in the analysis. Forty-six recipients died 0 to 46 months (median, 7 months) after orthotopic heart transplantation. In a Cox regression model, recipients with donor weight greater than recipient ideal weight had a significantly greater risk of death within the follow-up period than did recipients with donor weight less than recipient ideal weight (relative risk = 2.19; p less than 0.05). When percent donor weight/recipient ideal weight mismatch was used as a continuous variable, donor heart oversizing was negatively related to survival, independent of preoperative transpulmonary gradient values (p less than 0.05). In contrast to common belief, oversizing of donor hearts does not improve the outcome of orthotopic heart transplant recipients who have reversible preoperative pulmonary hypertension. Acceptance of undersized donor hearts is not detrimental to allograft function and recipient survival. Use of undersized donor hearts may maximize the use of critically scarce donor organs."

We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a 6-week exercise program in patients with cirrhotic liver disease awaiting LT.\n## METHODS\nThis single-center, prospective cohort, feasibility study, enrolled patients awaiting LT to a 6-week period of thrice weekly, supervised exercise on a static bike. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to objectively assess cardiopulmonary fitness at baseline and after 6 weeks of exercise. A follow-up CPET was performed at 12 weeks. CPET-derived measures were used to guide prescription of the training program. A nonrandomized control cohort of LT patients were selected to match the exercise group based on specific demographic data. Allocation to study arms was primarily based on the distance participants lived from the hospital where training occurred. Both groups received structured nutritional advice.\n## RESULTS\nThe exercise program was feasible, with 9 of 16 (56%) patients completing the full program of 6 weeks. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) in the exercise group rose from a mean (SD) of 16.2 (±3.4) mL/kg/min at baseline to 18.5 (±4.6) mL/kg/min at week 6 (P = 0.02). In the control group, VO2peak decreased from a mean (SD) of 19.0 (±6.1) mL/kg/min to 17.1 (±6.0) at week 6 (P = 0.03).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated that it is feasible to engage patients awaiting LT in an intensive aerobic exercise program with a signal of improvement in fitness being detected.\n"

Our hypothesis was that in patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation exposed by exercise-induced ischaemia, the acute transient ischaemia plays a principal causal role, and that in these patients surgical myocardial revascularization alone might be an effective treatment. Among 1100 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) 30 patients (2.7%) characterized by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation at the symptom-limited exercise tests prior to revascularization were studied prospectively. All patients had exercise-induced angina pectoris or ischaemic ST-segment depression preceding at least one of the arrhythmic events. In addition, eight of these 30 patients had experienced syncope during out-of-hospital exertional activities. After surgical revascularization, the 28 patients surviving to hospital discharge were followed for 1.6 to 86 months (mean 29 +/- 29 months) as outpatients and underwent between one to eight exercise tests (mean 2.6 +/- 1.9). One of these patients died suddenly of unknown causes at 14 months, another from cancer at 53 months. Twenty-six patients experienced a total of 34 episodes of ventricular tachycardia before revascularization. Two of these patients, both having residual ischaemia, had arrhythmia recurrences during follow-up; odds ratio (OR) 84.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-381.9; P = < 0.010.

            "abstract": "Background. Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. Surgery is the primary approach for curative treatment. Postoperative complications are common, and physiotherapy is often routinely provided for their prevention and treatment, even though the evidence is limited. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of in-hospital physiotherapy on postoperative physical capacity, physical activity, and lung function among patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Methods. A total of 107 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery were included in a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, and randomized to a study group, receiving in-hospital physiotherapy treatment, or a control group, not receiving in-hospital physiotherapy treatment. The patients were assessed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. The in-hospital physiotherapy treatment consisted of early mobilization, ambulation, breathing exercises, and thoracic range of motion exercises. Physical capacity was assessed with the 6-minute walk test. Level of physical activity was objectively assessed with an accelerometer and subjectively assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Modified for the Elderly. Results. Physical capacity for the whole sample was significantly decreased 3 months postoperatively compared with preoperative values (P = .047). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding physical capacity, physical activity, spirometric values, or dyspnea. However, patients in the study group increased their level of self-reported physical activity from preoperatively to 3 months postoperatively, while the patients in the control group did not. Conclusions. No difference in physical capacity, physical activity, or lung function was found 3 months postoperatively in lung cancer surgery patients receiving in-hospital physiotherapy compared with control patients."

The most common complication in both groups was pneumonia (29/132, 22%, compared with 22/81, 27%), but this could be predicted only in the group that underwent thoracoabdominal resection. Significant risk factors in this group were: an abnormal chest radiograph preoperatively (p = 0.0007), a high risk predicted by the anaesthetist (p = 0.005), and signs of obstruction on spirometry (p = 0.002). In the thoracoabdominal group a history of pulmonary disease, the patient's age, and general physical performance assessed by the exercise test significantly predicted a high risk of postoperative death. Risk profile curves for mortality were generated for patients aged 55, 65, or 75 years with and without pre-existing pulmonary disease and adjusted for working capacity (W) so that patients at high risk of dying after thoracoabdominal resection could easily be identified. Any patient with a history of pulmonary disease and a working capacity of less than 80 W whatever their age should be advised against thoracoabdominal resection, whereas in those without a history of pulmonary disease and a working capacity of more than 80 W, a good recovery may be anticipated. The cut off point for working capacity seems to be 80 W.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      With simple clinical guidelines it is possible to draw risk profiles for patients about to undergo thoracoabdominal resections for carcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction."

Pre-operative identification of patients at risk of developing peri-operative myocardial ischaemia is often difficult or even impossible due to the inability of the patient to perform an exercise test. For those unable to perform physical exercise a system has recently been described combining transoesophageal echocardiography with simultaneous transoesophageal atrial pacing via the same probe to detect pacing-induced wall motion abnormalities, a sign of coronary artery disease. In a prospective study, 20 patients with clinically suspected coronary artery disease undergoing hip replacement were examined pre-operatively by transoesophageal stress echocardiography. During the subsequent operation the incidence of intra-operative ischaemia was evaluated again in all 20 patients by transoesophageal echocardiography. In eight of the 20 patients (40%) wall motion abnormalities could be induced by transoesophageal stress echocardiography pre-operatively. Intra-operative wall motion abnormalities occurred in six of these eight patients. In two patients with wall motion abnormalities induced by transoesophageal stress echocardiography no abnormalities occurred during surgery. However, in those in whom wall motion abnormalities did occur during operation they occurred in the same left ventricular segment as those initiated by stress echocardiography. None of the patients without pre-operatively inducible wall motion abnormality developed them during surgery. No patient developed a myocardial infarction intra- or post-operatively. Thus, preoperative transoesophageal stress echocardiography is a valuable technique for the detection of patients who may develop ischaemic wall motion abnormalities during surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Although many patients prefer (unsupervised) home-based prehabilitation, adherence can be problematic. Combining home-based prehabilitation with tele-monitoring might demonstrate a higher adherence than unsupervised prehabilitation; however, evidence on its feasibility and effectiveness in patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective surgery who are at high risk for postoperative complications is lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a bimodal tele-prehabilitation program in patients with colorectal cancer at high risk for postoperative complications.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      High-risk patients (oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold ≤11 mL/kg/min or oxygen uptake at peak exercise ≤ 18 mL/kg/min) with colorectal cancer were included in a home-based bimodal tele-prehabilitation program. The program consisted of a personalized tele-monitored moderate to high-intensity interval training intervention and nutritional counseling. Feasibility was measured by participation rate, dropout rate, adherence to the physical exercise training session's frequency, intensity, and time, and retention rate. Patient appreciation was measured by a patient appreciation questionnaire. Changes in preoperative physical fitness as secondary outcomes were quantified by time to exhaustion on a constant work rate (cycle) test, number of repetitions on the 30-s chair-stand test, and walking speed on the 4-m gait speed test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The participation rate was 81%, there were no adverse events, and all participants managed to complete the tele-prehabilitation program (retention rate of 100%).

Several previous studies have recommended surgery for selected patients with supraglottic involvement, but these have mainly been based on case reports or on very few patients. This study is the second larger-scale study that documents the positive effect of supraglottoplasty as treatment of EILO in terms of reduced respiratory symptoms and decreased laryngeal obstruction assessed by post-operative CLE test. We suggest that surgery is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for selected EILO patients with moderate to severe supraglottic obstruction during exercise and a high level of physical activity."

Seventy-two patients with complete data were assessed preoperatively 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcomes were the Western Ontario McMasters Arthritis Index and Oxford Hip Scores.

No significant differences were observed for 10-meter walk test, EuroQoL, and radiographic analyses. Subgroup analysis for surgeon 1 identified that the DAA group had shorter acute hospital stay, less postoperative opiate requirements, and smaller wounds. However, this was offset by increased operative time, higher intraoperative blood loss, and weaker hip flexion at 2 and 6 weeks. Subgroup analysis of items on the Western Ontario McMasters Arthritis Index and Oxford Hip Score identified that hip flexion activity favored the DAA group up to 6 weeks postoperatively. There was an 83% incidence of lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh neuropraxia at the 12-week mark in the DAA group. No neuropraxias occurred in the PA group. One dislocation occurred in each group. A single patient from the DAA group required reoperation for leg-length discrepancy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      DAA total hip arthroplasty (THA) has comparable results with PA THA.

In the group with suspected CAD, the proportion of female patients was higher (p = 0.001), in the group with known CAD the proportion of male patients was higher (p = 0.002). SE showed an ischemic reaction in 35 patients, hibernation in 24 patients, no ischemic reaction in 56 patients and was inconclusive in 8 patients. The consequence of SE was recommendation for diagnostic coronary angiography (n = 27), revascularisation (n = 10), abstention from any invasive intervention (n = 77), noncardiac surgery (n = 9) and electrophysiological investigation (n = 1). During the investigated period, 955 bicycle stress-tests, 677 Thallium scintigrams and 987 coronary angiograms were carried out. During the follow-up (15 +/- 2.9 months) 4 patients died.

Twenty-two of the long-term survivors performed an exercise test at the end of their follow-up period. These tests revealed that bypass surgery in such patients results in significantly enhanced myocardial oxygen consumption with concomitant increase in effort level and duration.

Outcomes were pain measured on a visual analog scale, Knee Society's (KSS) clinical and functional scores, Oxford knee scores, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores. Patients were blinded to group assignment. Since most data were non-normally distributed non-parametric tests were used. Groups were compared with Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous variables). Association between continuous variables was evaluated with Spearman`s rank correlation coefficient.

On the second postoperative day, pain while walking dropped from a mean of 6.1 to a mean of 4.9 in the intensive group and from 6.4 to 5.4 in the standard group. Results for pain at rest were 3.3 to 2.2, respectively, for the intensive group and 4.0 to 3.0 for the standard group. At 2 weeks, pain at rest was 2.8 in both groups, and pain while walking was 3.0, respectively, for the intensive group and 3.4 for the standard group. At 2 weeks, mean (SD) KSS clinical and KSS function scores were, respectively, 74.9 (12.5) and 51.6 (16.2) in the intensive group and 71.2 (14.3) and 46.3 (16.1) in the standard group. Older age correlated with decreasing knee function (rS=-0.43, P<0.001), and less knee flexion correlated with preoperatively higher state anxiety (rS=-0.37, P=0.005) and trait anxiety (rS=-0.29, P=0.027).

Nuclear ventriculograms were used to assess ventricular function in 47 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery who were randomly assigned to receive blood (23 patients) or crystalloid cardioplegia (24 patients). Data were acquired at rest and during maximal exercise (bicycle ergometer) 1 month before surgery (PRE), 5 months after surgery (POST), and perioperatively at rest 3 to 5 hr after operation (PERI). Perioperatively, blood cardioplegia decreased ischemic injury (less elevation in creatine kinase-MB fraction and aspartate aminotransferase; p less than .05), preserved ventricular performance (lower stroke work index at higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume index after crystalloid than blood cardioplegia; p = .02 by analysis of covariance [ANOCOVA]) and preserved systolic function (higher left ventricular end-systolic volume index [LVESVI] at similar systolic blood pressure after crystalloid than blood cardioplegia; p = .02 by ANOCOVA). Postoperatively, resting ventricular performance and systolic function were not different with blood and crystalloid cardioplegia and were similar to preoperative measurements. Postoperatively, the response to exercise was similar between the two groups and was improved compared with that at PRE.

The few small studies in patients undergoing surgery within an ERAS program describe less fit individuals having a greater incidence of morbidity and mortality. There is evidence of increasing adoption of perioperative CPET, particularly in the UK. Although CPET-derived variables have been used to guide clinical decisions about choice of surgical procedure and level of perioperative care as well as to screen for uncommon comorbidities, the ability of CPET-derived variables to guide therapy and thereby improve outcome remains uncertain. Recent studies have reported a reduction in CPET-defined physical fitness following neoadjuvant therapies (chemo- and radio-therapy) prior to surgery. Preliminary data suggest that this effect may be associated with an adverse effect on clinical outcomes in less fit patients. Early reports suggest that CPET-derived variables can be used to guide the prescription of exercise training interventions and thereby improve physical fitness in patients prior to surgery (i.e., prehabilitation). The impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Perioperative CPET is finding an increasing spectrum of roles, including risk evaluation, collaborative decision-making, personalized care, monitoring interventions, and guiding prescription of prehabilitation.

This may be because no study has been large enough to determine if pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the Pex population are significantly different from the normal population, and none has assessed improvement in pulmonary function after Nuss bar removal.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The authors studied PFT results in 408 Pex patients before repair and in a subset of 45 patients after Nuss procedure and bar removal.

Patients older than 11 years at the time of surgery had lower preoperative values and larger mean post-bar removal improvement than the younger patients. An older patient with a preoperative FEF25-75 score of 80% of normal would be predicted by these data to have a postoperative FEF25-75 of 97%, indicating almost complete normalization for this function.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results demonstrate that preoperatively Pex patients as a group have decreased lung function relative to normal patients.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) workflow using ankle-worn IMUs measuring impact load, limb impact load asymmetry and knee range of motion in combination with patient-reported outcome measures. (Methods) A pilot cohort of 14 patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis was prospectively enrolled. RPM in the community was performed weekly from 2 up to 6 weeks post-operatively using wearable IMUs. The following data were collected using IMUs: mobility (Bone Stimulus and cumulative impact load), impact load asymmetry and maximum knee flexion angle. In addition, scores from the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Five-dimension (EQ-5D) with EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) and 6 Minute Walk Test were collected. (Results) On average, the Bone Stimulus and cumulative impact load improved 52% (p = 0.002) and 371% (p = 0.035), compared to Post-Op Week 2. The impact load asymmetry value trended (p = 0.372) towards equal impact loading between the operative and non-operative limb. The mean maximum flexion angle achieved was 99.25° at Post-Operative Week 6, but this was not significantly different from pre-operative measurements (p = 0.1563). There were significant improvements in the mean EQ-5D (0.20; p = 0.047) and OKS (10.86; p < 0.001) scores both by 6 weeks after surgery, compared to pre-operative scores. (Conclusions) This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a reliable and low-maintenance workflow system to remotely monitor post-operative progress in knee arthroplasty patients. Preliminary data indicate IMU outputs relating to mobility, impact load asymmetry and range of motion can be obtained using commercially available IMU sensors. Further studies are required to directly correlate the IMU sensor outputs with patient outcomes to establish clinical significance."

From October 1999 to October 2002, 12 emphysema patients who underwent volume reduction surgery were studied. Systolic and diastolic pulmonary pressures were measured 2 days before surgery through cardiac catheterization and 2 days after removal of the chest tubes through Swan Ganz catheters placed in the operating room just before surgery. Patients were stable and breathed without assistance during the postoperative pressure measurement. Blood gas analysis, lung function tests, and a 6-minute walk test were performed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The two sets of data were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. There was no significant change in pulmonary hemodynamics, although pulmonary function improved. The improvement in pulmonary function after volume reduction surgery is not related to pulmonary hemodynamics."

The goal of this review is to discuss the implications of recent studies that have evaluated the processes-of-care and outcomes related to preoperative anesthesia consultation.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      An increasing proportion of surgical patients undergo outpatient preoperative anesthesia consultation. These consultations effectively communicate information to anesthesia providers in operating rooms, reduce the time required to complete preoperative assessments, improve patients' education about perioperative care, and increase patient acceptance of regional anesthesia. Recent population-based data also demonstrate that consultations are associated with reductions in hospital length-of-stay, but not postoperative mortality. In addition, rates of specialized preoperative cardiac testing are increased following anesthesia consultation but the value of these tests remains debatable.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative anesthesia consultations have become increasingly common and have shown some clear beneficial effects on perioperative care and outcomes. Further research remains needed to identify efficacious interventions for reducing perioperative risk, measure the prognostic value of specialized preoperative tests, and compare the safety of different models for performing preoperative consultations."

            "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a life-saving technology that can cure otherwise incurable diseases, but imposes significant physiologic stress upon recipients. This stress leads to short-term toxicity and mid- to long-term physical function impairment in some recipients. Exercise interventions have demonstrated preliminary efficacy in preserving physical function in HCT recipients, but the role of these interventions prior to HCT (prehabilitative) is less known. We tested a 5- to 12-week, prehabilitative higher intensity home-based aerobic exercise intervention in a randomized study of alloHCT candidates. Of 113 patients screened, 34 were randomized to control or intervention groups, 16 underwent pre- and post-intervention peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) testing, and 12 underwent pre- and post-intervention 6-min walk distance (6MWD) testing. No significant differences in VO2peak or 6MWD were seen pre- to post-intervention between intervention and control groups, but final numbers of evaluable participants in each group were too small to draw inferences regarding the efficacy of the intervention. We conclude that the design of our prehabilitative intervention was not feasible in this pilot randomized study, and make recommendations regarding the design of future exercise intervention studies in alloHCT."

Components of these programs often include exercise, nutritional supplementation, and psychological interventions. This meta-analysis examines the impact of prehabilitation programs on both surgical and patient outcomes among gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients undergoing surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all published randomized control trials (RCT) evaluating the use of prehabilitation programs (with one or more interventions) in GI cancer surgery patients.

Although functional changes, such as lung function and exercise capacity changes, are observed in patients, there are no detailed studies examining this. The aim was to compare preoperative and postoperative pulmonary function and exercise capacity in patients undergoing on-pump CABG with a multidimensional index (BODE index). Demographic and surgical characteristics of patients were recorded. Pulmonary function test, six-minute walk test (6MWT), and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score were assessed and BODE index were calculated in preoperative and at six months postoperatively. A total of 75 patients were included with a mean ± standard deviation age of 59.8±10.0 years. The male to female ratio was 57/18. There was a statistically significant decrease in the forced expiratory flow at 25-75% (FEF25-75%) value after CABG. Other pulmonary function test values were also lower in the postoperative period compared to the preoperative period, but these changes were not significant. The mean distance achieved in the 6MWT (p=0.02) and the mMRC dyspnea score (p=0.001) were significantly better postoperatively. The BODE index, which combines these parameters, had increased in the postoperative period.

We analyzed 43 patients over 65 years undergoing major surgery. Longitudinally continued evolution of functional status by analyzing six variables, activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), the get up and walk test, functional reach test of arm, strength of handgrip and walking speed, measured before surgery (baseline measurement) and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after discharge. The objectives were to estimate the impact that surgery has on functional status in the elderly, determine how long each of the measurements returned to preoperative values at 4 months follow-up. Recovery curves compared the baseline AIVD, grip strength and hand speed on the fly, between two groups defined by baseline walking speed in slow (< 0.8 m/s) and fast (> 0.8 m/s). The impact of surgery on physical fitness showed a statistically significant decrease in ADL, IADL, and the get up and walk test and walking speed, with variable time recovery beyond convalescence. All return to baseline at 4 months except test walking speed that exceeded the baseline. Functional status can be evaluated quickly and should be included in the preoperative evaluation, since it allows planning strategies to meet the needs and limitations of patients and their families, in the immediate postoperative period."

Twenty-seven patients had a perioperative cardiac event (cardiac death in 5, nonfatal infarction in 12, unstable angina pectoris in 10); all 27 patients had positive stress test results (positive predictive value 38%, negative predictive value 100%). The semiquantitative assessment of the extent and severity of ischemia did not provide additional prognostic information in patients with positive test results. In contrast, the heart rate at which ischemia occurred defined a high risk group with a low ischemic threshold (38 patients with 20 events [53%]) and an intermediate risk group with a high ischemic threshold (34 patients with 7 events [21%]). All 5 patients with a fatal outcome and 8 of 12 with a nonfatal myocardial infarction were in the high risk group with a low ischemic threshold.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical variables identify 33% of patients at very low risk for perioperative complications of vascular surgery in whom further testing is redundant.

Risk stratification with a combination of clinical assessment and pharmacologic stress echocardiography has the potential to facilitate clinical decision making and conserve resources."

Patient-perceived health status was determined with use of the Nottingham Health Profile and General Well Being examinations. Factors associated with longevity were determined by a Cox proportional hazards model. Twenty-six patients are alive and 14 have died. The mean age at transplant was 32.4 +/- 12 years and the current age (or age at death) is 46.1 +/- 12.8 years. Actuarial freedom from rejection was similar to that of patients surviving less than 10 years (p = 0.8), but freedom from all types of infection was less (p = 0.005). Immunosuppressive drugs include cyclosporine (11/26 patients), azathioprine (24/26), and prednisone (26/26, mean dose 12.7 mg/day). Catheterization hemodynamic data show well-preserved graft function at a mean follow-up of 11.7 +/- 3.3 years. Graft coronary artery disease prevalence is 51.0% +/- 8%. Exercise test results are as follows: duration 8.7 +/- 3.5 minutes (range 2 to 16 minutes), maximum heart rate/expected rate 77.3% +/- 11% (50% to 92%), maximum systolic blood pressure 171 +/- 23 mm Hg (140 to 208 mm Hg), and metabolic equivalents 9.2 +/- 2.3 units (5.5 to 12.9 units), or about 84% of predicted. Mean score on the General Well Being examination was 75.3 +/- 21.6 (normal). Nottingham Health Profile scores were nearly normal, except for in the 50- to 64-year-old age group in categories of mobility, pain, sleep quality, and energy level. Causes of death were coronary artery disease in 7 of 14, infection in 4 of 14, lymphoma in 1 of 14, and nonlymphoid cancer in 2 of 14. In the Cox regression, variables most associated with survival (t > 2.0, multivariate p = 0.0005) were age at transplantation (t = 3.26), preoperative duration of illness (t = 3.57), postoperative cytomegalovirus infection (t = 2.16), and ejection fraction at 12 months after operation (t = -2.62). We conclude that cardiac transplantation can provide patients with end-stage cardiac failure an acceptable general medical condition, functional status, and perceived quality of life well into the second decade after operation."

Mean follow-up times (mean +/- SD) were 22.4 +/- 9.7 and 12.4 +/- 10.9 months, respectively. Each of the groups was further divided into subgroups according to the preoperative existence of of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) or paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (PSVT). During follow-up, the fallback started through a given cycle of ventricular pacing at a upper-rate limit (URL) to avoid a continuous high-rate tracking during the arrhythmias specifically in the patients with PSVT (0/4) (p = 0.0004). The fallback, however, sometimes started in the patients who had AVB not associated with either PAF or PSVT (4/21) during normal exercise because the fallback algorithm did not distinguish a normal P wave from the abnormal atrial waves. To further clarify the behavior of the fallback, a treadmill test was conducted in 25 of the 45 patients. The fallback start was observed in 12 of the 17 patients with AVB (Group 2). In such patients, the use of a long fallback delay and/or a high URL setting prevented the fallback starts during normal exercise. These results suggest that, in DDD pacing, the algorithm in Chorus I is useful in patients with SSS or AVB to avoid highrate tracking of the ventricle during transient supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, but special care must be taken to avoid the fallback starts during the normal exercise in AVB patients."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation produced by exercise-induced ischemia exhibit any premonitory electrocardiographic indicators of arrhythmia propensity and whether arrhythmia suppression by myocardial revascularization abolished these changes. High-quality exercise electrocardiograms (50 mm/sec) from 30 case patients with ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation produced by exercise-induced ischemia were studied before and after surgical revascularization. These results were compared with those obtained from 30 control patients matched for age, sex, heart disease, and preoperative exercise capacity. The resting and peak exercise electrocardiograms were examined separately in a blinded manner with respect to QRS duration, ST-segment depression, and JT intervals. Patients with bundle branch block patterns were excluded. The QRS duration at rest was similar in case and control patients preoperatively and increased significantly with exercise in both groups. However, the QRS prolongation was larger in the case group, in which it was 11 +/- 3 msec compared with 4 +/- 2 msec in the control group (p = 0.043). QRS prolongation > or = 15 msec predicted ischemia-related ventricular arrhythmias in 73% of the patients. After surgical revascularization, there was no QRS prolongation with exercise in either group.

The objective here is to describe the two-stage strategy for the osseointegrated reconstruction of amputated limbs and discuss the clinical outcomes of the procedure. This is a prospective case series of 37 post-traumatic unilateral transfemoral amputees with a minimum 2-yr follow-up. Outcome measures included the Questionnaire for persons with a Transfemoral Amputation (Q-TFA), the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests. Adverse events including infection, revision surgery, fractures, and implant failures were reported. Clinical outcomes for all outcome measures were significantly improved at follow-up. Twelve participants were wheelchair bound pre-operatively; however, all 12 were able to ambulate after osseointegrated reconstruction. Sixteen patients experienced infection episodes but were managed successfully without the need for implant removal. One periprosthetic fracture occurred due to increased activity, which was revised successfully.

            "title": "Why exercise capacity does not improve after pulmonary valve replacement.",
            "abstract": "Optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) for pulmonary regurgitation is a debated topic. It is logical that maximal aerobic capacity (VO2peak) would decline when a PVR is needed, but a diminished VO2peak is not always present before PVR, and previous studies show no improvement in VO2peak after PVR. This study aimed to evaluate changes in resting spirometry from pre- to post-PVR sternotomy, to determine the limiting factors of VO2peak before and after PVR, and to determine whether changes in resting lung function after PVR may explain the lack of improvement in VO2peak after surgery. For 26 patients (age, 19.7 ± 7.8 years) with a history of right ventricular outflow tract revision, the study prospectively evaluated echocardiograms, resting spirometry, and maximal exercise tests before PVR and then an average of 15 months after PVR. Flow volume loops were reviewed by a pulmonologist and categorized as obstructive, restrictive, both obstructive and restrictive, or normal. Exercise tests were interpreted using Eschenbacher's algorithm to determine the primary factors limiting exercise. No change in VO2peak or spirometry after PVR was observed. Before PVR, many patients had abnormal resting lung functions (85 % abnormal), which was unchanged after PVR (86 5 % abnormal). The majority of the patients had a ventilatory limitation to VO2peak before PVR (66.7 %), whereas 28.5 % had a cardiovascular limitation, and 4.8 % had no clear limitation. After PVR, 65.2 % of the patients had a ventilatory limitation, whereas 30.4 % had a cardiovascular limitation, and 4.4 % had no clear limitation to VO2peak. Pulmonary function did not change up to 15 months after surgical PVR. The frequency of pulmonary limitation to VO2peak after PVR did not increase. The effect of pulmonary function on exercise-related symptoms must be considered in this patient population. Improved cardiac hemodynamics are unlikely to improve VO2peak in a primarily pulmonary-limited patient."

The sit-to-stand test only predicted SF-36 Physical Function at 6 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Suboptimal postoperative mobilization after surgical resection for lung cancer negatively affects physical fitness at discharge. Our results underline the importance of adherence to early postoperative mobilization protocols. Measuring physical fitness at discharge may be useful to inform clinicians on elective referral of patients for postdischarge rehabilitation."

All patients were evaluated clinically by the same cardiologist and had exercise stress testing and dipyridamole-thallium imaging before admission for surgery. Ten patients were excluded from the study because they had evidence of severe ischemia when tested (ST segment depression greater than 2 mm on exercise testing, severe multivessel disease on thallium imaging). The remaining 60 patients were operated on (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 40; aortobifemoral repair, 17; femorofemoral graft, 3). The test results were withheld from the surgeon, anesthetist, and cardiologist before surgery. A total of 22 patients experienced major cardiac complications postoperatively (acute pulmonary edema, 17; acute myocardial, infarction, 5; cardiac death, 2). Thallium imaging showed myocardial ischemia in 31/60 patients. Exercise testing was positive (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST segment depression) in 10/60 patients. Dipyridamole-thallium imaging with a high sensitivity and reasonable specificity is the initial test of choice. Exercise testing is a poor screening test because of its low sensitivity. The combination of the two tests gives the highest positive predictive value and the greatest likelihood ratio. Thus patients assessed initially and found to have positive thallium scan results may be further stratified by exercise testing."

Currently, we lack data for the success of either approach. There is also a knowledge gap concerning the use of internet-based care for cervical disc disease. The scarcity of these data, and the high proportion of patients with various degrees of incapacity following ACDF, warrant increased efforts to investigate and improve cost-effective rehabilitation. The objective is to compare the effectiveness of a structured, internet-based NSE programme, versus PPA following ACDF surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      This is a prospective, randomised, multicentre study that includes 140 patients with remaining disability (≥30% on the Neck Disability Index, NDI) following ACDF for radiculopathy due to cervical disc disease. Patient recruitment occurs following attendance at routine clinical appointments, scheduled at 3 months postsurgery. Patients are then randomised to one of two groups (70 patients/group) for a 3-month treatment programme/period of either internet-based NSE or PPA. Questionnaires on background data, pain and discomfort, physical and mental capacity, satisfaction with care, and health and workplace factors are completed, along with physical measures of neck-related function conducted by independent test leaders blinded to randomisation. Measures are collected at inclusion, after the 3-month treatments (end of treatment) and at a 2-year follow-up. Radiography will be completed at the 2-year follow-up. Preoperative data will be collected from the Swedish Spine Registry. Data on healthcare consumption, drug use and sick leave will be requested from the relevant national registers.\n    \n\n\n          Ethical considerations:\n        \n      \n      This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Linköping Ref. 2016/283-31 and 2017/91- 32. The scientists are independent with no commercial ties. Patients are recruited after providing written informed consent. Patient data are presented at group level such that no connection to any individual can be made. All data are anonymised when reported, and subject to the Swedish Official Secrets Health Acts. The test leaders are independent and blinded for randomisation. Exercises, both general and neck-specific, have been used extensively in clinical practice and we anticipate no harm from their implementation other than a risk of muscle soreness. Both randomisation groups will receive care that is expected to relieve pain, although the group receiving NSE is expected to demonstrate a greater and more cost-effective improvement versu s the PPA group. Any significant harm or unintended effects in each group will be collected by the test leaders. All questionnaires and test materials are coded by the research group, with code lists stored in locked, fireproof file cabinets, housed at the university in a room with controlled (card-based) access. Only individuals in receipt of a unique website address posted by the researchers can access the programme; patients can neither communicate with each other nor with caregivers via the programme.Study participation might lead to improved rehabilitation versus non-participation, and might therefore be of benefit.

However, none of them was a predictor for complications. Better tools to predict postoperative complications for patients with bronchiectasis who are candidates for lung resection are needed.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical trial registration number:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01268475."

Surgery was followed by immobilization in a weightbearing below-the-knee plaster cast for 2 weeks followed by a stepwise increasing strength training program. Strength measurements (peak torque and total work) were done preoperatively (Week 0) and at 16, 26, and 52 weeks postoperatively. We measured isokinetic concentric plantar flexion strength at 90 and 225 deg/sec and eccentric flexion strength at 90 deg/sec on both the injured and noninjured sides. Preoperatively, concentric and eccentric strength were significantly lower on the injured side at 90 and 225 deg/sec. Postoperatively, concentric peak torque on the injured side decreased significantly between Weeks 0 and 16 and increased significantly between Weeks 26 and 52 at 90 deg/sec but was significantly lower than that on the noninjured side at all periods and at both velocities. The eccentric strength was significantly lower on the injured side at Week 26 but increased significantly until at Week 52 no significant differences between the sides could be demonstrated. It seems, therefore, that the recovery in concentric and eccentric calf muscle strength after surgery for Achilles tendinosis is slow. We saw no obvious advantages in recovery of muscle strength with a short immobilization time (2 weeks) versus a longer (6 weeks) period used in a previous study."

The patient had a one-vessel coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction and intervention in the LAD in 2004. Due to the progression of the disease subsequent operative myocardial revascularization in a minimal-invasive LIMA-to-LAD followed 6 years earlier. Since that time, the patient reported an increasingly decrease in exercise capacity and dyspnea at low level of physical stress.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical investigations:\n        \n      \n      The patient was in a good general condition. The status after the operative myocardial revascularization showed no evidence for the progression of coronary heart disease. However, the electrocardiographic findings were currently impaired compared to preoperative findings. The left ventricular ejection function was severly restricted with diffuse hypokinesia of all segements of the left ventricle and enlargement of all cardiac chambers. A paradoxical septal motion emerged after surgery. Doppler and color Doppler examinations showed a mitral valve insufficiency I and tricuspid valve insufficiency I.\n    \n\n\n          Treatment and course:\n        \n      \n      The medical treatment was intensified by additional treatment with torsemide 10 mg 2 × 1. The given diagnostic findings indicate the implantation of a defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden and arrhytmogenic cardiac death. Furthermore, a spinal cord stimulation (SCS) had a positive influence. Subsequently, a neurostimulator was successfully placed. No interaction could be detected after implantation or follow-up examinations after month 1 and 4.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A therapeutic combination of an ICD and a neurostimulator to reduce pain is possible. Interferences may arise during the later follow-up."

Early after the surgical replacement of the aortic valve a significant decline in pulmonary function was observed, which was followed by a decline in skeletal muscle function in the subsequent weeks of recovery. These date reiterate, despite restoration of aortic valve function, the need for a tailored rehabilitation programme for the respiratory and peripheral muscular system.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      Suboptimal post-operative improvements in functional capacity are often observed after minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR). It remains to be studied how AVR affects the cardiopulmonary and skeletal muscle function during exercise to explain these clinical observations and to provide a basis for improved/tailored post-operative rehabilitation. Twenty-two patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) (aortic valve area (AVA) <1.0 cm²) were pre-operatively compared to 22 healthy controls during submaximal constant-workload endurance-type exercise for oxygen uptake ( V̇O2 ), carbon dioxide output ( V̇CO2 ), respiratory gas exchange ratio, expiratory volume ( V̇E ), ventilatory equivalents for O2 ( V̇E / V̇O2 ) and CO2 ( V̇E / V̇CO2 ), respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (Vt ), heart rate (HR), oxygen pulse ( V̇O2 /HR), blood lactate, Borg ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and exercise-onset V̇O2 kinetics. These exercise tests were repeated at 5 and 21 days after AVR surgery (n = 14), along with echocardiographic examinations. Respiratory exchange ratio and ventilatory equivalents ( V̇E / V̇O2 and V̇E / V̇CO2 ) were significantly elevated, V̇O2 and V̇O2 /HR were significantly lowered, and exercise-onset V̇O2 kinetics were significantly slower in AS patients vs. healthy controls (P < 0.05). Although the AVA was restored by mini-AVR in AS patients, V̇E / V̇O2 and V̇E / V̇CO2 further worsened significantly within 5 days after surgery, accompanied by elevations in Borg RPE, V̇E and RR, and lowered Vt . At 21 days after mini-AVR, exercise-onset V̇O2 kinetics further slowed significantly (P < 0.05). A decline in pulmonary function was observed early after mini-AVR surgery, which was followed by a decline in skeletal muscle function in the subsequent weeks of recovery.

CPET provides an objective assessment of exercise capacity preoperatively and identifies the causes of exercise limitation. This information may be used to assist clinicians and patients in decisions about the most appropriate surgical and non-surgical management during the perioperative period. Information gained from CPET can be used to estimate the likelihood of perioperative morbidity and mortality, to inform the processes of multidisciplinary collaborative decision making and consent, to triage patients for perioperative care (ward vs critical care), to direct preoperative interventions and optimization, to identify new comorbidities, to evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant cancer therapies, to guide prehabilitation and rehabilitation, and to guide intraoperative anaesthetic practice. With the rapid uptake of CPET, standardization is key to ensure valid, reproducible results that can inform clinical decision making. Recently, an international Perioperative Exercise Testing and Training Society has been established (POETTS www.poetts.co.uk) promoting the highest standards of care for patients undergoing exercise testing, training, or both in the perioperative setting. These clinical cardiopulmonary exercise testing guidelines have been developed by consensus by the Perioperative Exercise Testing and Training Society after systematic literature review.

In this randomized controlled trial, we hypothesized that a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program enhances cardiorespiratory fitness before lung cancer surgery and therefore reduces the risk of postoperative complications.\n## METHODS\nPatients with operable lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC) (n = 77) or preoperative rehabilitation based on HIIT (Rehab) (n = 74). Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the 6-minute walk test were performed twice before surgery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and in-hospital postoperative complications.\n## RESULTS\nThe groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the preoperative waiting period (median 25 days), the peak oxygen consumption and the 6-minute walking distance increased (median +15%, interquartile range, 25th to 75 percentile [IQR25%-75%, %] = +9% to +22%, p = 0.003 and +15%, IQR25%-75% = +8% to +28%, p < 0.001, respectively) in the Rehab group, whereas peak oxygen consumption declined in the UC group (median -8%, IQR25%-75% = -16% to 0%], p = 0.005).

The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. A meta-analysis by Li et al. showed that patients who received a preoperative rehabilitation programme (PRP) had reduced incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) (odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.71), reduced length of stay (LOS) (-4.23 days, 95% CI -6.14 to -2.32 days) and improved 6-min walking distance (71.25 m, 95% CI 39.68-102.82) and peak oxygen uptake consumption (VO2 peak) (3.26, 95% CI 2.17-4.35). A meta-analysis by Steffens et al. showed that PPCs were reduced in patients with PRP (relative risk 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.73) and reduced LOS (-2.86 days, 95% CI -5.40 to -0.33). The results of 3 additional meta-analyses, 4 randomized controlled trials and 1 observational study all provide further support to PRP in enhanced recovery after surgery and the improvement in exercise capacity. We conclude that PRP improves exercise capacity in patients undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer. Moderate quality evidence supports preoperative exercise providing significant reduction in PPCs and hospital LOS.

Preoperative examination included medical history and physical examination, lung function testing, electrocardiography, laboratory testing, and chest radiography. All patients underwent stairs climbing with pulse oximetry before the operation with the number of steps climbed and the time to complete the test recorded. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured every 20 steps. Data on postoperative complications including oxygen use, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and early postoperative mortality were collected.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-seven of 101 patients (86%) had at least one postoperative complication. The type of surgery was significantly associated with postoperative complications (25.5% patients with lobectomy had no early postoperative complications), while age, gender, smoking status, postoperative oxygenation, and artificial ventilation were not. There were more postoperative complications in more extensive and serious types of surgery (P<0.001). The stairs climbing test produced a significant decrease in oxygen saturation (-1%) and increase in pulse rate (by 10/min) for every 20 steps climbed. The stairs climbing test was predictive for postoperative complications only in lobectomy group, with the best predictive parameter being the quotient of oxygen saturation after 40 steps and test duration (positive likelihood ratio [LR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-3.38; negative LR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.76).

Morbid obesity is associated with chronic systemic inflammation which increases the risk of comorbidities. Bariatric surgery (BS) is considered an effective intervention for obese patients. However, BS is associated with dietary restriction, potentially limiting physical activity. Whole-body neuromuscular electrical stimulation (WBS) could represent an innovative option for the rehabilitation of BS patients, especially during the early postoperative phase when other conventional techniques are contraindicated. WBS is a safe and effective tool to combat sarcopenia and metabolic risk as well as increasing muscle mass, producing greater glucose uptake, and reducing the proinflammatory state.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have used preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing to improve risk assessment of pulmonary resection for lung cancer. These studies have demonstrated inconsistent correlation between peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and postoperative complications but have not systematically examined other methods of risk stratification. We analyzed the findings in 42 patients who had cardiopulmonary exercise testing prior to lung cancer resection. Preoperative clinical data combining pulmonary factors (obesity, productive cough, wheezing, tobacco use, ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s over the forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] < 70 percent, and PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg), and an established cardiac risk index were used to generate a cardiopulmonary risk index (CPRI). When analyzed using the risk index, the incidence of postoperative complications increased with higher CPRI scores. Those with a CPRI of 4 or greater were 22 times more likely to develop a complication, compared to a CPRI of less than 4 (p < 0.0001). We found that patients with a peak VO2 less than 500 ml/m2/min (body surface area) were 6 times more likely to experience a cardiopulmonary complication (p < 0.05). With multiple logistic regression analysis, peak VO2 was not an independent predictor of postoperative complications. Analysis also demonstrated that a CPRI of 4 or greater was associated with significant reductions in peak VO2. We conclude that both the peak VO2 during cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a multifactorial CPRI are highly predictive of complications after lung resection. Adding the peak VO2 did not enhance the risk estimation generated by the CPRI. The association between postoperative complications and peak VO2 may be explained by the correlation between identifiable cardiopulmonary disease (CPRI) and reduced oxygen uptake with exercise."

The 6-min walk test distance was performed pre-operatively, while simultaneously using a portable cardiopulmonary testing device. The transition of oxygen uptake kinetics from rest to exercise was recorded to calculate oxygen uptake kinetics fitting a monoexponential regression model. Oxygen uptake at steady state, constant time, and mean response time corrected by work rate were analysed.

From a clinically applicable perspective, a threshold of 66% of pre-operative predicted 6-min walk test distance indicated slower kinetics, which leads to longer intensive care unit and post-surgery hospital length of stay. Implications for rehabilitation Coronary artery bypass grafting is a treatment aimed to improve expectancy of life and prevent disability due to the disease progression; The use of pre-operative submaximal functional capacity test enabled the identification of patients with high risk of complications, where patients with delayed oxygen uptake kinetics exhibited worse short-term outcomes; Our findings suggest the importance of the rehabilitation in the pre-operative in order to \"pre-habilitate\" the patients to the surgical procedure; Faster oxygen uptake on-kinetics could be achieved by improving the oxidative capacity of muscles and cardiovascular conditioning through rehabilitation, adding better results following cardiac surgery."

We therefore studied preoperative physical activity levels of patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, and performed an exploratory analysis of the influence of physical activity on postoperative outcome. The Short Questionnaire to Assess Health (SQUASH) was used to assess physical activity among 100 patients, of mean (SD) age 65.4 (7.6) years. Additionally, handgrip strength was measured, and the get-up-and-go test was conducted. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed, and a computerised cognitive test battery was used to assess cognitive performance preoperatively, and three months after surgery. Preoperatively, 76% of patients met the recommended national guidelines for physical activity. The incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, and other pre-operative patient features were similar in active and inactive patients. Preoperative physical activity was significantly inversely related to the logistic EuroSCORE. The level of physical activity was also significantly inversely related with preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and peak postoperative CRP, but physical activity did not appear to be associated with any adverse postoperative outcomes or extended length of hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD) at 3 months postoperatively was 26%. Cognitive performance was not related with physical activity levels. In summary, this was the first study to assess activity levels of cardiac surgical patients with the SQUASH questionnaire. The majority of patients were physically active. Although physical activity was associated with lower levels of inflammation in this pilot study, it was not associated with an improved clinical or cognitive postoperative outcome."

It has been suggested that preoperative exercise training could render patients with borderline functional parameters eligible for surgery, improve perioperative outcomes and that these benefits might reduce healthcare costs. Nevertheless, given the substantial heterogeneity of the available studies, no specific guidelines for preoperative exercise training have been released so far. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the potential benefits of exercise training in the preoperative period as a central intervention for lung cancer patients. In detail, the effects of exercise (with different regimens) were evaluated in terms of physical functions, patients' eligibility for curative surgery, postoperative complications and length of stay, with an exploratory focus on healthcare costs and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, a feasible approach for every-day clinical practice is proposed in order to increase the expected benefit deriving from a more extensive and methodical application of prehabilitation exercise, ideally in the context of a comprehensive approach to lung cancer patients, including nutritional and psychological support."

In this study, we hypothesized that exercise oxygen desaturation (EOD) and heart rate change results in a stair-climbing test (SCT) would predict postoperative cardiopulmonary complications for patients with NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined 171 patients (41 females and 130 males) with NSCLC by preoperative SCT from January 2010 to July 2015. Among them, 27 underwent wedge resection, 122 underwent lobectomy, and 22 underwent pneumonectomy. The correlation between postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and parameters of SCT and pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The overall 30-day postoperative morbidity of the patients was 46/171 (26.9%), with death occurring in 3/171(1.8%). The age, FEV1%, MVV, height of climbing, EOD, and heart rate change were found to be significantly different between the group with postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and those without. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that EOD and heart rate change were independently correlated with postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. In addition, a model predicting the probability of postoperative cardiopulmonary complication based on logistic regression for multivariable analysis was used to confirm our findings. CONCLUSIONS A symptom-limited SCT with oxygen saturation monitoring is a safe, simple, and low-cost method to evaluate cardiopulmonary function preoperatively."

Estimates of peri-operative VO2 changes are uncertain in earlier publications and have limited generalisability in the current high-risk surgical population. In a prospective non-interventional observational study in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal procedures, we investigated the change of VO2 after induction of anaesthesia and secondarily, the further changes during and after surgery in relation to DO2 and estimated oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) by routine monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      VO2 was determined by indirect calorimetry (QuarkRMR) in 20 patients more than 65 years (ASA II to IV), scheduled for elective open upper abdominal surgery with combined epidural and general anaesthesia. Data were collected during 20-minute periods pre-operatively and after anaesthesia induction, with subsequent measurements during surgery and postoperatively. Simultaneously, DO2 was monitored using LiDCOplus. The O2ER was estimated from arterial-central venous oxygen content calculation. Mixed models were used to analyse the peri-operative changes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      VO2 decreased after induction of anaesthesia by a mean of 34% (95% CI, 28 to 39). After 2 h of surgery, VO2 was reduced by 24% (95% CI, 20 to 27) compared with the awake baseline measurements. Pre-operative mean DO2 was 440 (95% CI, 396 to 483) ml min m and decreased by a mean of 37% (95% CI, 30 to 43) during anaesthesia. The estimated O2ER did not change intra-operatively 0.24 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.26) but increased postoperatively to 0.31 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.36).

Standardized ratings of both psychiatric morbidity and functional capacity were made before, 3 months (n = 82) and 12 months (n = 81) after surgery. One year after surgery men in the atenolol group had a significantly shorter treadmill exercise time than those on placebo (7.21 +/- 0.28 min vs 8.32 +/- 0.40 min; p less than 0.05), but the frequency of reported anginal attacks during the year was similar in both drug groups. Improvement in functional capacity (measured in exercise time) in the 71 men following surgery was related to both physical and psychological variables assessed before the operation. Men with more severe occlusive disease, lower neuroticism and higher extraversion scores pre-operatively showed greater percentage improvement in exercise time after surgery. Women had significantly levels of psychiatric morbidity and shorter treadmill exercise time than men both before and after surgery. Of the psychiatric and psychological variables, only ratings of Type A behaviour fell significantly in the atenolol group (170.9 +/- 5.3 vs 163.0 +/- 5.2; p less than 0.05). This change, which is probably not clinically important, occurred independently of any reduction in either overall psychiatric morbidity score or ratings of somatic symptoms mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. The atenolol group reported more side-effects of both psychological and physical symptoms than the placebo group. We do not recommend the routine use of atenolol after bypass graft surgery. Our findings failed to support the suggestion that Type A characteristics may reflect an underlying sympathetic nervous system reactivity."

Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of surgery and to facilitate recovery. The authors previously demonstrated the limited impact of a prehabilitation program using exercise alone. They propose an expanded trimodal prehabilitation program that adds nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and anxiety reduction to a moderate exercise program. This study aimed to estimate the impact of this trimodal program on the recovery of functional capacity compared with standard surgical care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Consecutive patients were enrolled in this pre- and postintervention study over a 23-month period.

            "abstract": "Introduction Operable oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma management in the UK includes three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by resection. Determination of oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (AT) with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to objectively measure cardiorespiratory reserve. Oxygen uptake at AT predicts perioperative risk, with low values associated with increased morbidity. Previous studies indicate NAC may have a detrimental impact on cardiorespiratory reserve. Methods CPET was completed by 30 patients before and after a standardised NAC protocol. The ventilatory AT was determined using the V-slope method, and the peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide measured. Median AT before and after chemotherapy was compared using a paired Student's t-test. Results Median oxygen uptake at AT pre- and post-NAC was 13.9±3.1 ml/kg/min and 11.5±2.0 ml/kg/min, respectively. The mean decrease was 2.4 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.85; p<0.001). Median peak oxygen delivery also decreased by 2.17 ml/kg/min (95% CI 1.02-3.84; p=0.001) after NAC. Ventilatory equivalents were unchanged. Conclusions This reduction in AT objectively quantifies a decrease in cardiorespiratory reserve after NAC. Patients with lower cardiorespiratory reserve have increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Preventing this decrease in cardiorespiratory reserve during chemotherapy, or optimising the timing of surgical resection after recovery of AT, may allow perioperative risk-reduction."

Many of these complications occur because of postoperative loss of stamina and poor mobility. Preoperative exercise may better prepare these vulnerable patients for surgery. We present the protocol for our ongoing randomized trial to assess the impact of a preoperative walking intervention with remote coaching and pedometer on outcomes of stamina (six-minute walk distance- 6MWD) and mobility (postoperative steps) in older adults with frailty traits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will be conducting a randomized clinical trial with a total of 120 patients permitting up to a 33% rate of attrition, to reach a final sample size of 80 (with 40 patients for each study arm).

Using block randomization stratified on baseline 6MWD, we will assign patients to wear a pedometer. At the end of three baseline days, an athletic trainer (AT) will provide a daily step count goal reflecting a 10-20% increase from baseline. Subsequently, the AT will call weekly to further titrate the goal or calls more frequently if the patient is not meeting the prescribed goal. Controls will receive general walking advice.

We postulated that the Ross technique results in minimal restrictions on patient's lifestyle as compared to normal controls and we expected the patients to have good quality of life (QoL). On the other hand QoL may be affected by the risk of the homograft degeneration and the need of reoperation in the future. The aim of the study was to assess the QoL of patients after Ross operation because of aortic valve stenosis. Postoperative condition of the patients was judged by resting transthoracic echo, 24 hour ECG recording, maximal exercise test on bicycle ergometer. The mean age of patients was 31.1 (N=50; 18 female, 32 male). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years. We applied the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) for assessment of QoL. The results of psychological tests were compared with age, gender and education matched control group without underlying cardiac disease. Overall QoL (QoL index) did not vary between patients and control group. The only significant difference concerned physical sum score and subtests of physical functioning (scale 1) and general health perception (scale 8). There were no differences in psychological health sum score. We concluded that in general, patients after the Ross operation enjoy a normal life style. The results of our study are consistent with well known advantages of Ross procedure. This study also implies the need for more detailed information concerning patient's lifestyle after the operation. Patient's family and doctors who are to take care of the patient after leaving hospital ought to be instructed as well. Education should specify patient's ability to perform different everyday abilities, especially physical ones. The aim of the education is to eliminate negative self-assessment of patient's own physical abilities which probably originate from preoperative period and stress connected with operation."

A dominant ventricle was of the morphologically right type in 81% of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 9 of the 52 patients died early. Two patients died in the intermediate term. Postoperative exercise testing showed maximum oxygen uptake of 26.4 ± 5.8 ml/kg/min (anaerobic threshold 18.3 ± 3.2 ml/kg/ min). The cardiac index was 3.1 ± 0.9 l/min/m(2) at 1 year after TCPC, with no fundamental change at 5 years (3.1 ± 0.8 l/min/m(2)). The end-diastolic volume of the dominant ventricle was 130% ± 74% of the anticipated normal value at 1 year and 93% ± 27% at 5 years after TCPC, with ejection fractions of 48% ± 13% and 49% ± 9%, respectively. When these parameters were plotted for the individual patients, the ejection fraction increased during the first postoperative year, with the percent end-diastolic volume decreasing in 31 survivors; the trend appeared atypical in the remaining 12 survivors. Even in these patients, however, the parameters eventually changed toward favorable circumstances 5 years after TCPC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Change in ventricular function was not necessarily pessimistic after TCPC in patients with reduced ventricular contraction preoperatively."

Apart from this the time of waiting for the operation, the pre- and postoperative medication and the problem of the fitness for work and the calculation of the pension were analysed postoperatively. In the study 61 patients were included, in whom an aortocoronary bypass operation was carried out in the period from 1980 to 1988. Postoperatively, the risk factor abuse of nicotine was reduced by most patients, whereas obesity and disturbances of the fat metabolism practically remained uninfluenced. Postoperatively a permanent need of nitrangin was existing only in exceptional cases. An improvement of the functional capacity could be proved only in about half the patients. This partly explained that only one third of the patients became again fit for work after operation. On the other hand, the long time of waiting for the operation which in most cases included a long preoperative inability to work was also decisive for the great number of calculations of the pension after operation."

Consecutive 120 patients were included for analysis (median age 65 years, 100 male, 75 neoadjuvant therapy). Median AT in the cohort developing major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification >2) was 10.4 mL/kg/min compared with 11.3 mL/kg/min with no major morbidity (P = 0.048). Median V˙O2Peak in the cohort developing major morbidity was 17.0 mL/kg/min compared with 18.7 mL/kg/min in the cohort (P = 0.009).

Group preoperative demographics and operative characteristics were similar.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The operative mortality rate after coronary bypass/transmyocardial revascularization was 1.5% (2/132) versus 7.6% (10/131) after coronary bypass alone (P =.02). Patients undergoing both coronary bypass and transmyocardial revascularization required less postoperative inotropic support (30% vs 55%, P =.0001) and had a trend toward fewer insertions of intra-aortic balloon pumps (4% vs 8%, P =.13) than did patients having coronary bypass alone. Multivariable predictors of operative mortality were coronary artery bypass alone (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-25.7; P =.04) and increased age (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1. 0-1.2; P =.03). One-year Kaplan-Meier survival (95% vs 89%, P =.05) and freedom from major adverse cardiac events defined as death or myocardial infarction (92% vs 86%, P =.09) favored the combination of coronary bypass and transmyocardial revascularization.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      People with hip osteoarthritis are likely to limit physical activity (PA) engagement due to pain and lack of function. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) reduces pain and improves function, potentially allowing increased PA. PA of THA patients was quantified to 12 months postoperation. The hypothesis was that postoperatively levels of PA would increase.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PA of 30 THA patients (67 ± 7 years) was objectively measured preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperation. Harris Hip Score (HHS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were recorded. Mixed linear modelling was used to examine relationships of outcomes with time, baseline body mass index (BMI), age, gender, and baseline HHS.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Time was not a significant factor in predicting volume measures of PA, including sit-to-stand transitions, upright time, and steps. Notably, baseline BMI was a significant predictor of upright time, steps, largest number of steps in an upright bout, HHS, and 6MWT. Baseline HHS helped predict longest upright bout, cadence of walking bouts longer than 60 seconds, and OHS. The significant effect of participant as a random intercept in the model for PA outcomes suggested habituation from presurgery to postsurgery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Volume measures of PA did not change from presurgery to 12 months postsurgery despite improvement in HHS, OHS, and 6MWT.

Ninety seven patients were prospectively and consecutively examined. All patients had preoperative maximal exercise test and dynamic spirometry. Postoperative complications and causes of death were registered. Logistic regression was used and models explaining the relationship between preoperative variables and postoperative complications and deaths were constructed. We found significant differences in preoperative maximal workload and carbon dioxide output between groups, with and without cardiopulmonary-related complications, but not in spirometry variables. Logistic regression showed maximal workload to be the only predictor of cardiopulmonary complications. Maximal oxygen uptake was predictive of cardiopulmonary deaths. Maximal oxygen uptake and forced expiratory volume were predictive of postoperative complications. A maximal oxygen uptake <50% predicted was associated with high risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that maximal oxygen uptake was correlated to long-term survival, while spirometric variables were not. Exercise testing can be used in the preoperative evaluation of patients with nonmetastatic bronchogenic carcinoma. A combination of the results of variables from spirometry and exercise testing is proposed to be used as a preoperative criterion for operability."

We aim to recruit 1723 participants. Prior to surgery, participants undergo symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer, complete the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire, undergo blood sampling to measure serum NT pro-BNP concentration and have their functional capacity subjectively assessed by their responsible doctors. Participants are followed for 1 year after surgery to assess vital status, postoperative complications and general health utilities. The primary outcome is all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery, and the secondary outcome is all-cause death within 1 year after surgery. Both receiver-operating-characteristic curve methods and risk reclassification table methods will be used to compare the prognostic accuracy of preoperative subjective assessment, peak oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Duke Activity Status Index scores and serum NT pro-BNP concentration.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      The METS Study has received research ethics board approval at all sites.

            "abstract": "This study prospectively evaluated 75 consecutive patients (mean age 69 +/- 9 years) undergoing major vascular surgery to test the hypothesis that dobutamine stress echocardiography can be used to predict perioperative cardiac events. A positive test was defined as a new or worsening wall motion abnormality in at least 2 of 18 wall segments. Up to 40 micrograms/kg/min of dobutamine was administered. All readings were done by physicians unaware of the patients' symptoms and electrocardiographic response. In addition, physicians caring for the patients were unaware of the test result. End points of the study were unstable angina with documented electrocardiographic changes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death. The perioperative ischemic event rate was 7% (5 of 75 patients). Three patients developed unstable angina and 2 sustained nonfatal myocardial infarctions. All of these patients had positive results on dobutamine stress echocardiography (sensitivity 100%). However, 22 patients who also had positive results on dobutamine stress echocardiography did not have perioperative events (specificity 69%). The corresponding positive predictive value was 19%. None of the 48 patients who had negative results on dobutamine stress echocardiography had events (negative predictive value 100%). In conclusion, dobutamine stress echocardiography can be used to predict perioperative events with great sensitivity, but its positive predictive value in this patient population in low, likely due to the low incidence of perioperative events in patients with known coronary artery disease and the imperfect specificity of dobutamine stress echocardiography in identifying significant coronary stenosis. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is most useful in this setting when negative, because it predicts safety from complications with confidence."

            "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing has a number of medical applications, including the assessment of heart failure and the investigation of unexplained breathlessness. Over the past decade, it has become an important preoperative assessment tool to evaluate functional capacity and predict outcomes in patients undergoing both cardiac and noncardiac surgery. A CPX test is an incremental exercise test during which respiratory variables, including oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion are measured and the ECG is monitored. Among the variables reported from a CPX test are oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen uptake. A limited functional capacity as indicated by a low anaerobic threshold or VO(2peak) has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of perioperative complications in a number of surgical settings. Other reported variables, including the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen (VE/VO(2)) and carbon dioxide (VE/VCO(2)) and the millilitre of oxygen delivered per heartbeat or oxygen pulse [VO(2)/heart rate (HR)] may give indications as to the reasons for exercise limitation. ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia with increasing workload is also an important indicator of increased perioperative risk. As a noninvasive, low-risk, test of the integrated responses to increasing cardiovascular stress, anaesthesiologists involved in preoperative assessment should have an understanding of its current uses and test outcomes. This review presents the physiological basis for CPX testing, methodology, advantages over other preoperative tests of cardiovascular function and guidance on the interpretation of CPX results in the perioperative setting."

Whether this also applies to other types of cardiac surgery is unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assessed postoperative rhythm by means of repeated exercise tolerance testing, ambulatory electrocardiography, and non-invasive testing of autonomic function between 1 and 12 months after four types of cardiac surgery. Fourteen patients without structural cardiac disease and medically refractory AF underwent the maze III procedure, 11 patients with mitral valve disease and preoperative AF underwent valvar surgery combined with a (simplified) maze III procedure, and 8 patients with mitral valve disease in sinus rhythm (SR) underwent isolated valvar surgery. The control group consisted of eight patients with sinus rhythm who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One month after surgery, the chronotropic response to exercise was depressed, mean heart rate was high, and heart rate variability (HRV) was low, especially after maze III, combined surgery, and isolated valvar surgery. Twelve months after surgery, moderate improvements were observed. After CABG, considerably fewer abnormalities were observed, and HRV parameters recovered to a large extent. Non-invasive testing of autonomic function indicated disturbed vagal modulation of heart rate in all three groups with atrial incision.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Thus, attenuation of HRV and vagal modulation of sinus node function are not confined to maze surgery but also apply to isolated mitral valve surgery. Atrial incision therefore appears to be crucial and presumably produces autonomic nervous damage followed by partial reinnervation. Nevertheless, cardiac surgery in general seems initially to impair sinus node function with partial recovery in the consecutive 12 months."

            "abstract": "In the near future, over 40% of patients with lung cancer will be over 70 years old at the time their disease is diagnosed. Age per se, however, should not lead to the denial of a potentially curative surgical intervention. It has been shown that older patients (over 70 years), as well as patients over 80 years of age, may tolerate a lobectomy or even a pneumonectomy quite well. Most patients with lung cancer are present or former smokers and have underlying pulmonary problems, especially chronic obstructive lung disease. They are at high risk of both morbidity and mortality from surgery due to significant cardiovascular disease. The indications for surgical intervention should be based on reliable preoperative tumor staging and pulmonary assessment by an experienced interdisciplinary panel of physicians, taking into consideration the individual cardiopulmonary status of the patient. This assessment, combined with the American Society of Anesthesiologists risk classification and the overall clinical assessment by the surgeon, will provide the best available evidence for carefully weighing the benefits and risks of an operation. The responsibility for this assessment must be viewed-in the case of early stage lung cancer-in relation to the relative lack of alternative treatments for surgical intervention with comparable 5-year survival rates (>50%)."

Although three studies reported post-intervention forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), we did not perform meta-analysis on this outcome due to significant statistical heterogeneity (I² = 93%) across the studies. Data were not available for fatigue or dyspnoea.

Overall, we found that the risk of bias in the included studies was high, and the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low. Pooled data from four studies demonstrated that preoperative exercise training reduced the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication by 67% (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.61). The number of days patients in the exercise group needed an intercostal catheter was lower than in the non-exercise group (mean difference (MD) -3.33 days, 95% CI -5.35 to -1.30 days; two studies); postoperative length of hospital stay was also lower in the exercise group (MD -4.24 days, 95% CI -5.43 to -3.06 days; four studies). Pooled data from two studies demonstrated that compared to the non-exercise group, post-intervention 6-minute walk distance (MD 18.23 m, 95% CI 8.50 to 27.96 m), and post-intervention FVC (MD 2.97% predicted, 95% CI 1.78 to 4.16% predicted) were higher in the exercise group.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative exercise training may reduce the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication, the duration of intercostal catheter use, postoperative length of hospital stay, and improve both exercise capacity and FVC in people undergoing lung resection for NSCLC.

Myocardial scintigraphy was related to overall mortality only in intermediate-risk patients (HR=2.8, CI 1.5-5.1, P=0.007).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CV risk stratification based on myocardial stress testing is useful only in patients with just one risk factor. Screening may avoid unnecessary testing in 60% of patients, help stratifying for risk of events and provide an explanation for the inconsistent performance of myocardial scintigraphy."

Therefore, this study aimed to compare 2-minute walk test (2MWT) and Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG) results between UKA and TKA for isolated medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). We hypothesized that UKA yields faster functional recovery than TKA as measured with the 2MWT and TUG.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing medial UKA and TKA in patients with isolated medial knee OA. A total of 110 patients were enrolled; after 11 exclusions, 99 patients (50 UKA, 49 TKA) were included in the final analysis. The patients were tested using the 2MWT and TUG preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were also evaluated.

Clinical characteristics were recorded for each patient before each of the two radionuclide ventriculograms. Global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated for each patient at rest. A definite change in LVEF was defined as 0.08 or more points and a probable change as 0.04 or more points. Only patients with a resting LVEF of 0.50 or less were eligible for the study. There was no significant group change in LVEF (0.39 +/- 0.08 before surgery vs 0.38 +/- 0.11 after surgery; difference not significant).

It is unclear if preoperative exercise training, and the potential resultant improvement in exercise capacity, may improve postoperative outcomes. This review updates our initial 2017 systematic review.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      1. To evaluate the benefits and harm of preoperative exercise training on postoperative outcomes, such as the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication and the postoperative duration of intercostal catheter, in adults scheduled to undergo lung resection for NSCLC. 2. To determine the effect on length of hospital stay (and costs associated with postoperative hospital stay), fatigue, dyspnoea, exercise capacity, lung function and postoperative mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was from 28 November 2016 to 23 November 2021.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which study participants who were scheduled to undergo lung resection for NSCLC were allocated to receive either preoperative exercise training or no exercise training.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication; 2. postoperative duration of intercostal catheter and 3.\n    \n\n\n          Safety:\n        \n      \n      Our secondary outcomes were 1. postoperative length of hospital stay; 2. postintervention fatigue; 3. postintervention dyspnoea; 4. postintervention and postoperative exercise capacity; 5. postintervention lung function and 6. postoperative mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Along with the five RCTs included in the original version, we identified an additional five RCTs, resulting in 10 RCTs involving 636 participants. Preoperative exercise training results in a large reduction in the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication compared to no preoperative exercise training (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 573 participants; high-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on postoperative intercostal catheter duration (MD -2.07 days, 95% CI -4.64 to 0.49; I2 = 77%, 3 studies, 111 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training is likely safe as studies reported no adverse events. Preoperative exercise training likely results in a reduction in postoperative length of hospital stay (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.64 to -0.85; I2 = 85%; 9 studies, 573 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training likely increases postintervention exercise capacity measured by peak oxygen consumption (MD 3.36 mL/kg/minute, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.02; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 191 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); but the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on postintervention exercise capacity measured by the 6-minute walk distance (MD 29.55 m, 95% CI 12.05 to 47.04; I2 = 90%; 6 studies, 474 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training may result in little to no effect on postintervention lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second: MD 5.87% predicted, 95% CI 4.46 to 7.28; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 197 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative exercise training results in a large reduction in the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication compared to no preoperative exercise training for people with NSCLC. It may also reduce postoperative length of hospital stay, and improve exercise capacity and lung function in people undergoing lung resection for NSCLC. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias. Research investigating the cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes associated with preoperative exercise training in NSCLC is warranted."

We report an analysis of the effects of thromboendarterectomy for post-embolic pulmonary arterial hypertension on exercise functional parameters. A patient (62 years) had post-embolic pulmonary hypertension documented by pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization (PAP mean: 48 mmHg). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated a decreased aerobic capacity (59% predicted), significant hyperventilation (VE/VO(2) at peak 82) and a dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/Vt) increased at rest (0.55) and remaining high at peak exercise (0.48). Thromboendarterectomy was performed and led to a dramatic improvement in dyspnoea (NYHA class II to I), a gradual improvement in aerobic capacity, and a significant decrease of VD/Vt (0.26) and hyperventilation (VE/VO(2) at peak: 38) on exercise. This observation illustrates the fact that an increase in the physiological dead space on exercise is associated with significant hyperventilation and consequently dyspnoea of effort."

Post-operative changes in VO2max correlated with preoperative exercise-induced contractile reserve (r = 0.72, P < .0001), preoperative ERO (r = 0.49, P < .05), and preoperative ejection fraction at rest (r = 0.42, P < .05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In patients with severe organic MR but mild or no symptoms, cardiopulmonary performance improves after successful minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair.

Sixty-eight patients, 36 males and 32 females, with either patellar tendon graft (34 patients) or hamstring graft (34 patients) were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly allocated to either early (the 4th postoperative week) or late (the 12th postoperative week) start of OKC exercises for the quadriceps, resulting in four subgroups: patellar tendon reconstruction, early start (P4) or late start (P12) of OKC quadriceps exercises, hamstring tendon reconstruction, early start (H4) or late start (H12) of quadriceps OKC exercises. Prior to surgery and 3, 5 and 7 months later, assessments of range of motion (goniometer), anterior knee laxity (KT-1000), postural sway (KAT 2000), thigh muscle torques (Kin-Com dynamometer) and anterior knee pain (anterior knee pain score) were evaluated. No significant group differences were found in terms of range of motion 3, 5 and 7 months postoperatively. The H4 group showed a significantly higher mean difference of laxity over time of 1.0 mm (CI: 0.18-1.86) than the P4 group (P=0.04). Within the same type of surgery, the H4 against the H12, the mean difference over time was 1.2 mm (0.37-2.1) higher in the H4 group than in the H12 group (P=0.01). There were no significant group differences in terms of postural sway or anterior knee pain at the different test occasions. Significant differences in trends (changes over time) were found when comparing the four groups, for both quadriceps muscle torques (P<0.001) and hamstring muscle torques (P<0.001). All groups, except the P4 group, reached preoperative values of quadriceps muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up. In the H4 and the H12 groups, significantly lower hamstring muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up compared with preoperative values were found. In conclusion, early start of OKC quadriceps exercises after hamstring ACL reconstruction resulted in significantly increased anterior knee laxity in comparison with both late start and with early and late start after bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the early introduction of OKC exercises for quadriceps did not influence quadriceps muscle torques neither in patients operated on patellar tendon nor hamstring tendon grafts. On the contrary, it appears as if the choice of graft affected the strength of the specific muscle more than the type of exercises performed. Our results could not determine the appropriate time for starting OKC quadriceps exercises for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft. Future studies of long-term results of anterior knee laxity and functional outcome are needed."

            "abstract": "Fontan patients have a reduced exercise capacity, primarily owing to limitations in the ability to augment pulmonary blood flow and stroke volume. To date, the mechanism of peak exercise pulmonary blood flow restriction has not been elucidated. We performed a single-center, prospective, crossover trial of supine and upright exercise in Fontan patients and healthy controls to determine the mechanisms of exercise limitation in the Fontan-palliated patient. A total of 29 Fontan patients and 16 control subjects completed the protocol. The duration of exercise, percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and peak work were reduced in the Fontan group, regardless of posture (p < or = 0.03). The percentage of predicted oxygen pulse, a surrogate for pulmonary stroke volume, was not increased with supine posture in the Fontan cohort (upright, 82.3 + or - 18.8% vs supine, 82.4 + or - 19.7%; p = 0.6). In both groups, the percentage of predicted peak VO(2) was lower with supine exercise than with upright exercise (p < or =0.002). Diastolic dysfunction was present in 57% of the Fontan patients and was associated with a reduced percentage of predicted peak VO(2) (p = 0.04) and supine peak work (p = 0.008). Six Fontan patients who underwent supine exercise with indwelling catheters failed to demonstrate the expected decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance characteristically seen with peak exercise (at rest, 2.8 + or - 0.7 mm Hg/L/min/m(2) vs at peak, 2.8 + or - 0.9 mm Hg/L/min/m(2); p = 0.9). In conclusion, supine exercise in Fontan patients does not result in an increased VO(2) or oxygen pulse, suggesting that inadequate venous return might not be the primary limitation of exercise capacity in this population. Diastolic dysfunction and relatively excessive peak exercise pulmonary vascular resistance might be more important factors in Fontan exercise limitation."

Prospective outcome data were collected on 600 consecutive patients who had renal transplantation between 1996 and 1998 at our institution at 42 +/- 12 months after surgery. Stress single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging was performed in 174 patients before surgery, 136 (78%) of whom had diabetes mellitus. There were a total of 59 events: 17 cardiac deaths, 14 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 28 noncardiac deaths. There were 12 cardiac events and 11 noncardiac deaths among those who had SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. In a multivariate analysis that included important risk factors, age (p = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively) and diabetes (p = 0.02 and 0.005, respectively) were the predictors of total events and cardiac events in patients who did not undergo stress SPECT perfusion imaging. In the subgroup who had stress perfusion imaging, an abnormal perfusion SPECT study was the only predictor of cardiac events (p = 0.006). The 42-month cardiac event-free survival rate was 97% in patients with normal SPECT images and 85% in patients with abnormal SPECT images (RR 5.04, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 17.6, p = 0.006). Thus, there is a 2.8% event rate per year after renal transplantation, and approximately 50% of these events are noncardiac.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The comprehensive Aristotle score has been proposed as an individualized measure of the complexity of a given surgical procedure and has been reported to significantly correlate with postoperative morbidity and mortality after the Norwood procedure. An important factor leading to postoperative morbidity and mortality is low cardiac output. We studied the correlation between the comprehensive Aristotle score and cardiac output (CO) in infants after the Norwood procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Respiratory mass spectrometry was used to continuously measure systemic oxygen consumption (VO(2)) in 22 infants for 72 hours postoperatively. Arterial, superior vena caval and pulmonary venous blood gases were measured at 2 to 4 hour intervals to calculate CO. The comprehensive Aristotle score was collected. Hospital mortality was 4.5%. The comprehensive Aristotle score ranged from 14.5 to 23.5 and negatively correlated with CO (P = 0.027). Among the patient-adjusted factors, myocardial dysfunction (n = 10), mechanical ventilation to treat cardiorespiratory failure (n = 9) and atrioventricular valve regurgitation (n = 4) (P = 0.01) negatively correlated with CO (P = 0.06 to 0.07). Aortic atresia (n = 9) was associated with a lower CO (P = 0.01) for the first 24 hours which linearly increased overtime (P = 0.0001). No correlation was found between CO and other factors (P > 0.3 for all).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Comprehensive Aristotle score significantly negatively correlates with CO after the Norwood procedure. A preoperative estimation of the comprehensive Aristotle score, particularly in association with myocardial dysfunction, mechanical ventilation to treat cardiorespiratory failure, atrioventricular valve regurgitation and aortic atresia may help to anticipate a high postoperative morbidity with low cardiac output syndrome."

            "abstract": "Retrospectively were evaluated clinical findings of 151 patients with condition after replacement of artificial cardiac valves (Björk-Shiley), who were treated in our department of cardiology in 1986. The patients with mitral valve replacement (MVR) and mitral valve and aortic valve replacement showed the highest rate of individualisation in comparison to aortic valve replacement. 18 patients showed complications and acute deteriorations, respectively, two of which had a fatal course. In 53 patients the bicycle-ergometric exercises were performed with measurement of the pulmonary pressure. Of these patients the majority indeed subjectively improved in their behaviour, however, the objective exercise tolerance was altogether low and the rate of invalidisation increased in comparison to the preoperative rate. The pulmonary pressure at rest in the majority of the patients was reduced mostly in dependence on the initial values. Increases appeared only sporadically. Under exercise, however, particularly the patients with mitral valve replacement showed pathological increases of pressure. Altogether the best results showed patients with aortic valve replacement also with regard to the shrinking of the radiologically established size of the heart."

Patients with complications had significantly lower VO2max. The incidence of complications in relation to the amount of oxygen consumption showed that with the progressive decrease of oxygen consumption there was a progressive increase in frequency of complications. In particular patients with VO2max < 50% of predicted should be considered at high risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiopulmonary causes. This predictive capacity of VO2max was more evident in patients with a preoperative FEV1 less than 70% of predicted.

Preoperative physical activity was examined by means of 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and a medical interview. Patients were divided into two groups, according to when independence in walking was attained: early group <3 days (n = 36) and late group ≥3 days (n = 31), and the pre-, intra-, and postoperative recovery data were compared. There were no significant differences in patient baseline characteristics or intraoperative data between the two groups. The number of patients engaging in preoperative regular physical activity and 6MWD were significantly greater (p = 0.042 and p = 0.034, respectively) in the early group than in the late group. In addition, time to hospital discharge was significantly shorter in the early group than in the late group (p = 0.031). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative regular physical activity was the only independent factor for identifying patients in the early group (odds ratio 2.769, 95 % confidence interval 1.024-7.487, p = 0.045).

Those receiving standard of care deteriorated. The specific role of nutritional prehabilitation alone on functional recovery is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study was undertaken to estimate the impact of nutrition counseling with whey protein on preoperative functional walking capacity and recovery in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial at a single university-affiliated tertiary center located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

In a district general hospital there is usually a logistical problem in performing compartmental pressure measurement.

The present investigation was aimed to quantitatively analyze the degree of functional recovery in bipedal locomotion of bonnet macaques after inflicting spinal cord hemisection lesion. To measure the degree of locomotor recovery, we recorded four gait variables, viz., tip of opposite foot (TOF), print length (PL), toe spread (TS), and intermediary toes (IT) using a footprint analyzing technique. Monkeys were trained preoperatively to perform the monopedal hop or bipedal locomotion on runways. Footprints of trained monkeys were recorded using the nontoxic ink and white paper before and after surgery. Surgical hemisection was induced unilaterally in the right side of spinal cord at T12-L1 level of trained monkeys. In hemiplegic monkeys, initially there was a substantial decrease in TOF and PL variables of the paretic limb, which then gradually increased for longer duration and reached the near presurgical values by the 7th and 5th postoperative month, respectively. In contrast to TOF and PL, the recovery of TS and IT variables was quicker, which dramatically increased at first and then slowly recovered to levels not significantly different from the corresponding preoperative values by the 4th postoperative month. The nonparetic limb has also showed mild alterations in all footprint variables but reached the normal values much faster compared to the paretic limb. The alterations in footprint variables of hemiplegic monkeys were examined for a postoperative period of up to 1 year. The findings of this study suggest that the mechanisms underlying locomotor recovery of lesioned macaques may be correlated to the mature function of spinal pattern generator for locomotion under the impact of residual descending and afferent connections. Further, this study also indicates the functional contribution of progressive strengthening of undamaged nerve fibers through a collateral sprouts/synaptic plasticity formed in partially lesioned cord of macaques."

Aim This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the ability of prehabilitation to prevent post-surgical complications in cardiac patients. Methods We selected studies conducted among patients who were waiting for non-urgent cardiac surgical procedures, where a comparison between prehabilitation and standard treatment was made.

Postoperative complications (within 30 days) occurred in 9 (34.6%) patients of whom one died (overall mortality rate was 3.8%). There was no relationship between the presence of complication and physiologic tests (PFT, DLCO). The patients were divided three groups according to peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)/kg peak) (mL/kg/min) (< 10, 10-20, > 20 mL/kg/min). There was no significantly difference among these groups and complication rates (p= 0.056), but the complication rate was higher in the group of VO(2)/kg peak < 10 mL/kg/min (75%). On the other hand, there was a significantly relationship between the presence of only pulmonary complication and VO2/kg peak (p= 0.034).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We think that the preoperative functional evaluation in the patients with lung resection candidate is prominent to reduce the postoperative mortality and morbidity and especially cardiopulmonary exercise testing has an important role to suggest the postoperative pulmonary complications as a major complication."

            "abstract": "Prehabilitation aims to increase the endurance capacity of patients who are awaiting major surgery. However, there are no studies investigating the implementation of this demanding and expensive intervention in low-income countries. This study aimed to assess the impact of a 4-week trimodal prehabilitation program on the physical and psychological health of patients waiting for colorectal surgery compared with a control group managed according to enhanced recovery after surgery principles supplemented by nutritional care. This study was a single-centre, randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measures for the physical aspects were 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and incentive spirometry, whereas the psychological elements were measured using the 36-item short form survey questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression score. In total, data from 149 patients were analysed (77 in the prehabilitation group and 72 in the control group). At the time of surgery, patients in the prehabilitation group had improved 6MWD and incentive spirometry compared with the control group (median (IQR [range]) percentage improvement 131% (112-173 [68-376]) vs. 107% (99-120 [63-163]); p < 0.001 and 113% (100-125 [75-200]) vs. 100% (100-112 [86-167]); p < 0.001 respectively). Patients in the prehabilitation group also had reduced anxiety scores compared with the control group (mean (SD) anxiety score (4 (3) vs. 5 (3) respectively; p = 0.032). However, these effects did not translate into improvements in postoperative mortality and morbidity, or a reduction in duration of hospital stay. Trimodal (physical, emotional and nutritional) prehabilitation is able to improve functional status as well as some parameters of emotional and physical well-being of patients waiting for colorectal surgery."

            "abstract": "The ability to successfully exercise has been used to assess the cardiopulmonary risk of thoracotomy for lung cancer. Because of musculoskeletal, neurologic, peripheral vascular, or behavioral problems, not all patients presenting for pulmonary resection are capable of exercising. Using a multifactorial cardiopulmonary risk index (CPRI) consisting of a cardiac risk index (CRI) and a pulmonary risk index, we studied 74 patients (60 capable of exercising and 14 incapable of exercising) who underwent thoracotomy for lung cancer resection. The groups were similar in reference to history of pulmonary disease, preoperative pulmonary function, and pulmonary risk index score. The no-exercise patients were more likely to have a history of cardiac disease (64 vs 28%; p < 0.01) and had a higher CRI score (2.0 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.1; p < 0.05). Cardiopulmonary postoperative complications (POCs) and mortality were more likely among those in the no-exercise group vs those in the exercise group (POCs, 79 vs 35%, p < 0.01; mortality, 21 vs 2%, p < 0.05). Among the eight no-exercise patients with a CPRI of 4 or more, all eight suffered a POC (100%) and three died (38%). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, both the CPRI score and the inability to exercise were independently associated with increased risk for POCs. We conclude that patients unable to perform even minimal preoperative exercise are at substantially increased risk for morbidity and mortality after lung resection. This results both from greater identifiable preoperative cardiopulmonary risk factors (as assessed by the CPRI) and from an independent effect related to the inability to exercise."

            "abstract": "Purpose: The effects of preoperative respiratory muscle training (RMT) on postoperative complications in patients with pulmonary resection have recently attracted the attention of researchers. More studies are obviously needed to clarify the effects of RMT after pulmonary resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intense RMT in addition to chest physiotherapy after pulmonary resection in terms of respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, and length of hospital stay rather than postoperative complications. Methods: Forty subjects undergoing pulmonary resection were included in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups using a simple randomization method. The subjects in the study group (SG; n = 20) received RMT in addition to regular chest physiotherapy in the postoperative period. The subjects in the control group (CG; n = 20) received only regular chest physiotherapy. Respiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure [PImax and PEmax]) was measured pre-postoperatively and before discharge, and exercise capacity, which was measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT), was assessed preoperatively and before discharge. The length of hospital stay was also recorded. Results: There were no differences between groups in terms of demographic and surgical characteristics. The nonsignificant change of PImax from the preoperative to the discharge value was 65.1 ± 15.5 to 68.2 ± 19.2 cmH2O in SG and 59.2 ± 13.7 to 44.3 ± 14.8 cmH2O in CG (p > 0.05, p > 0.05, respectively). The change of PEmax from the preoperative to the discharge value was 80.4 ± 24.9 to 81.5 ± 24.9 cmH2O in SG (nonsignificant) and 85.4 ± 38.2 to 61.3 ± 25.4 cmH2O in CG (p > 0.05, p = 0.002, respectively). There was a significant difference between SG and CG in terms of RMT effect (PImax: 11.05 [21.84; 0.25] cmH2O p = 0.045; PEmax: 25.23 [42.83; 7.62] cmH2O p = 0.006). A significant difference was found in the 6MWT when the mean differences were compared between the groups (85.72 [166.15; 5.28] m p = 0.037). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the SG (number of days for SG 9.1 ± 3 and for CG 12.9 ± 4.2 [p = 0.002]). Conclusion: The addition of RMT to chest physiotherapy after pulmonary resection can have positive effects on respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, and length of hospital stay."

One of the relevant risk factors for LVRS is the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of this study is to assess the postoperative changes in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) after LVRS for patients with severe pulmonary emphysema compared with preoperative measures. N = 61 consecutive patients with severe pulmonary emphysema and preoperative evidence for PAH (pulmonary arterial systolic pressure [PASP] ≥ 35 mmHg) were prospectively included into this study. In all patients, thoracoscopic LVRS was performed. PASP was assessed by echocardiography before surgery, early postoperatively, and 3 months after surgery. Data were prospectively recorded and analyzed retrospectively. Primary end points were the postoperative changes in PASP as well as the 90 day mortality rate. Secondary endpoints included: pulmonary function test, exercise capacity, quality of life, and dyspnea symptoms (Borg scale). Early after surgery, a significant reduction in PASP was observed at the day of discharge and at 3 month follow-up. In n = 34 patients, no tricuspid valve regurgitation was detectable anymore suggesting normal PAP. In n = 3 patients, venovenous extracorporeal lung support (VV ECLS) was already implemented preoperatively. In the remaining cases, VV ECLS was applied intraoperatively and continued postoperatively. Mean duration of postoperative ECLS support was 2 days. Four patients died due to acute right heart failure, two patients from sepsis with multiorgan failure, and one patient from acute pulmonary embolism. Ninety day mortality was 11.5 %. A significant improvement was postoperatively observed regarding the performance status, dyspnea scale, as well as quality of life. This study suggests a beneficial effect of LVRS on PAP, which may ultimately help to protect and stabilize right ventricular function. Further studies, implementing pre- and postoperative right heart catheterizations including invasive PAP evaluation, are necessary to support the findings in this study in greater detail."

Post-operative cardiac performance was analyzed using the echocardiogram and treadmill exercise stress test (EST).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in the present study. The mean age was 11.7 years and the mean age at operation was 7.4 years. The predominant systemic chamber was morphologic left ventricle. Straightforward Fontan operation was performed in 60% of cases. Mean of Fontan index, mean of McGoon ratio, and mean of Nakata index were 2.63, 2.32, and 414.15 sqmm/sqm, respectively. Mean of the PVR and PAP were 1.98 U/m2 and 11.05 mmHg. Eighteen percent of patients died in the early post-operative period. Most of the patients died from septicemia. The mean EFwas 58.43%. Systolic dysfunction in 17.9% of the cases was abnormal, whereas diastolic dysfunction was present in half of the cases. Thirty-nine percent had MPI abnormality. During EST three cases developed arrhythmias and 3 cases had hypotension. Patients were categorized into 3 groups (Group 1: normal systolic and diastolic functions, Group 2: diastolic dysfunction, Group 3: impairment of both systole and diastole). Pre-operative cardiac catheterization parameters, surgical data and cardiac performance showed no statistical significance. However, there was a significant correlation between those with abnormal cardiac performance and arrhythmias or hypotension during EST (p = 0.003).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The selection of suitable cases and good pre-operative evaluation could decrease the morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.

Construct validity was assessed by testing the primary a priori hypotheses that postoperative DASI scores (1) are higher in patients without vs with postoperative complications and (2) correlate with six-minute walk test distance (6MWD). Exploratory analyses assessed the association between DASI scores and (1) preoperative physical status [higher (ASA ≤ 2) vs lower (ASA > 2)], (2) stoma creation (no stoma vs stoma), (3) age [younger (≤ 75 years) vs older (> 75 years)], (4) time to readiness for discharge [shorter (≤ 4 days) vs longer (> 4 days)], and (5) surgical approach (laparoscopic vs open). Responsiveness was assessed by testing a priori hypotheses that DASI scores are higher (1) preoperatively vs at POW2 and (2) at POW4 vs POW2. Mean differences in DASI scores were obtained using linear regression.

Exercise prescription involved aerobic and resistance training with telephone-based supervision. The primary endpoint was overall feasibility (recruitment rate, retention rate, intervention adherence and acceptability). Secondary endpoints included safety and effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and physical performance, evaluated at baseline, after the exercise intervention and 4-5 weeks after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Over three months, 15 patients were eligible, and all agreed to participate (recruitment rate: 100%).

Patients performed an aerobic and resistance training volume higher than prescribed (median adherence rates of 104% and 111%, respectively). A total of nine adverse events occurred during the intervention (Grade 1, n = 8; Grade 2, n = 1), the most common being shoulder pain. After the exercise intervention, significant improvements were observed in the HRQOL summary score (mean difference, 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], from 0.9 to 4.8; p = 0.049) and the five-times sit-to-stand test score (median difference, -1.5; 95% CI, from -2.1 to -0.9; p = 0.001).

Four patients developed major post-operative cardiac complications of whom one patient died. EECG was not a significant predictor of outcome, as 48.6% of all EECGs were inadequate due to non-completion of the exercise protocol. Significant pre-operative predictors of outcome were a history of angina (p less than 0.01), myocardial infarction (p less than 0.001), congestive cardiac failure (p less than 0.0001), or a Goldman score of greater than 14 (p less than 0.05).

Although evidence for prehabilitation is promising, the data for liver transplant (LT) candidates are limited. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel prehabilitation strategy on changes in frailty metrics and survival in LT candidates. The secondary aim was to determine liver-related and extrahepatic conditions associated with frailty.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this ambispective cohort study, all patients underwent frailty assessment using the liver frailty index (LFI), 6-minute walk test, and gait speed test performed by a dedicated physical therapist. Home-based exercise prescription was individualized to each patient's baseline physical fitness.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We included 517 patients (59% men, median age 61 years, and a model for end-stage liver disease score of 12) evaluated during 936 PT visits. Frailty metrics were affected by age, sex, and liver-related parameters, but not by model for end-stage liver disease. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related cirrhosis had worse frailty metrics by all tools. We demonstrated the feasibility of prehabilitation in improving both LFI and 6-minute walk test, particularly in adherent patients. A median LFI improvement of 0.3 in frail patients was associated with improved survival in univariate analysis. Compliance with physical therapist visits (hazards ratio = 0.35 [0.18-0.67] for 2 visits and hazards ratio = 0.54 [0.31-0.94] for ≥3 visits) was independently associated with increased survival.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Prehabilitation improves frailty metrics in LT candidates and is associated with a survival advantage. Our findings provide a framework for the standardized prehabilitation program in LT candidates while prioritizing compliance, adherence, and on-training LFI goal accomplishment."

Remaining active is an important consideration for elderly patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion. Golf, swimming, and biking are common forms of recreational exercise for an older population in whom lumbar fusion is often performed. There is a lack of data in the current literature regarding rates of return to recreational sporting activities following elective lumbar fusion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Following Institutional Review Board approval, all patients undergoing lumbar fusion at a single institution from 2012 to 2016 were screened and included in this study. A minimum of 1-year postoperative follow-up was required. A total of 117 patients were identified undergoing single-level or multilevel lumbar fusion during this time period. The average age was 63 years. Questionnaires were obtained to screen and identify patients who participated in 1 of 3 recreational sports before surgery (golf, swimming, and biking). Preoperative and postoperative collected outcome measures were then compared using the Student t test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 117 identified lumbar fusion patients, 32 patients (27%) participated in 1 of the 3 most common recreational sporting activities of golf, swimming, or biking. Within the golf cohort (n=13), 100% of patients returned to recreational golfing postoperatively. There was a statistically significant reduction in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores postoperatively (6.3±3.7-1.8±2.4, P=0.01). Driving distance was reduced postoperatively (223.3±42.7-212.1±44.4 yards, P=0.042) and handicaps increased (12.8±8.4-17.0±11.4, P=0.02). Within the swimming cohort (n=9), 100% of patients returned to recreational swimming following lumbar fusion. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS pain scores postoperatively (9.1±1.7-2.2±2.3, P=0.01). There was a trend towards increased amounts of swimming (times per week) postoperatively, however, this was not statistically significant (2.1±1.7-3.7±1.5, P=0.10). Within the biking cohort (n=10), 100% of patients returned to recreational biking following lumbar fusion. There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS pain scores postoperatively (6.7±4.0-1.3±1.7, P=0.03). There was a trend towards increased amounts of biking (times per week) postoperatively, however, this was not statistically significant (2.5±1.8-3.7±1.6 postoperatively, P=0.20).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In the cohort of patients from this study who partook in golfing, swimming or bicycling, 100% were able to return to their respective sport by 3-9 months postoperatively and all had a significant reduction in pain. With regards to golfers, lumbar fusion likely has an adverse effect on their golfing ability with an increase in handicap and an expected reduction in driving distance."

A literature review provided nine studies that investigated either one or both of these two variables across a wide range of surgical procedures. Six of the seven studies that reported sufficiently detailed results on peak oxygen consumption and four of the six studies that reported sufficiently detailed results on anaerobic threshold found them to be significant predictors. We conclude that peak oxygen consumption and possibly anaerobic threshold are valid predictors of peri-operative morbidity and mortality in non-cardiopulmonary thoraco-abdominal surgery.

Various parameters were measured following an exercise load before and after surgery. There were significant decreases in post-operative resting levels of stroke volume (SV) (p < 0.001), end-diastolic volume (EDV) (p < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) (p < 0.05) and ejection rate (ER) (p < 0.001) and significant increase in heart rate (HR) (p < 0.001) when compared to pre-operative resting levels. Neither filling rate (FR) nor cardiac output (CO) showed significant difference. At maximum exercise load, there were significant decreases in post-operative EDV (p < 0.005), SV (p < 0.005), ER (p < 0.001) and FR (p < 0.005), but no significant differences were detected in HR and EF; consequently, there was a significant decrease in CO (p < 0.005). Ratio of the levels at maximum load to those at resting of each parameter did not show significant difference between before and after operation with regard to any parameters except CO and FR which showed significant decrease (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). Effects of the surgery on left ventricular function were studied according to amount of lung resection. In 13 cases where more than two lobes were resected, similar significant differences to those mentioned above were found in all parameters except EF. In cases where a single lobe was resected, only ER and FR showed similar tendency to that described above. Effects of the surgery on left ventricular function were also studied according to age of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Key domains of physical functioning including exercise tolerance (six-minute walk test (6MWT)) and muscle strength (hand-grip strength), and habitual physical activity participation, including sedentary behaviour (accelerometry) were measured pre-surgery (T0) and repeated at 1-month (T1) and 6-months (T2) post-surgery.

Current evidence reveals that early intervention is recommended for endurance in patients with hip fractures. To our knowledge, preoperative exercise intervention in patients with hip fractures remains poorly researched, and no study has yet applied aerobic exercise preoperatively. This study aims to investigate the short-term benefits of a supervised preoperative aerobic moderate-intensity interval training (MIIT) program and the added effect of an 8-week postoperative MIIT aerobic exercise program with a portable upper extremity cycle ergometer. The work-to-recovery ratio will be 1-to-1, consisting of 120 s for each bout and four and eight rounds for the pre- and postoperative programs, respectively. The preoperative program will be delivered twice a day. A parallel group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was planned to be conducted with 58 patients each in the intervention and control groups. This study has two primary purposes. First, to study the effect of a preoperative aerobic exercise program with a portable upper extremity cycle ergometer on immediate postoperative mobility. Second, to investigate the additional effect of an 8-week postoperative aerobic exercise program with a portable upper extremity cycle ergometer on the walking distance at eight weeks after surgery. This study also has several secondary objectives, such as ameliorating surgical and keeping hemostatic balance throughout exercise. This study may expand our knowledge of preoperative exercise effectiveness in hip fracture patients and enhance the current literature about early intervention benefits."

            "title": "Factors affecting exercise capacity in renal transplantation candidates on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy.",
            "abstract": "It is well known that reduced peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) is a predictor for mortality in several chronic diseases and during the preoperative period. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that influence peak VO2 in renal transplant candidates receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy. We included 22 chronic renal failure patients (12 men, 10 women; ages 29.64 +/- 8.29 years; CAPD duration, 37.35 +/- 7.15 months) in this study. Pulmonary function tests and symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise tests were administered to all patients. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests were performed on a cycle ergometry at the same time of day for all patients. We analyzed the exercise duration, maximum work rate, and peak VO2 level during cycle ergometry. Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, prealbumin, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, ferritin, sodium, potassium, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels were analyzed from samples. Mean values of exercise duration (6.86 +/- 1.56 minutes), peak VO2 (17.20 +/- 4.91 mL/min/kg), and maximum work rate (77.09 +/- 26.09 watts) were lower when we compared them with predicted values for a healthy population. Peak VO2 was well correlated with serum phosphorus levels (4.51 +/- 1.28 mg/dL, r = .592, P = .004). Test duration was correlated with peak VO2 (r = .489, P = .025) and serum phosphorus levels (r = .530, P = .024). There were no significant correlations with other factors. As a component of ATP, phosphorus is at the hub of the energy-related mechanisms operative in muscles of the respiratory and musculoskeletal systems. Therefore, we suggest that low exercise capacity might be related to low serum phosphorus levels, and that optimal control of serum phosphorus therapy would increase exercise capacity, exercise duration, and oxygen consumption resulting in a decrease of postoperative mortality in renal transplantation candidates."

It measures the exercise tolerance of the patient. In this pilot study, we evaluated its predictive value for the postoperative course in cardiac surgery patients. Design. This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement. STST was applied in the patients, along with pulmonary function testing, a day prior to surgery, on postoperative day 7, and 3 months after surgery. A Short Form-36 health related quality of life survey (SF-36) was also included. The patients were divided into two groups according to the preoperative STST outcome: group A (≤20 repetitions, n = 12), and group B (>20 repetitions, n = 18). Results. We enrolled 30 patients in the study between May 2017 and May 2019. No complication were observed during the STST. The standard perioperative measures were identical for both groups. However, group A exhibited a significantly longer artificial ventilation time, as well as worse pulmonary function (VC, FVC, TLCO), on postoperative day 7. Concerning the SF-36, group A displayed a worse pre- and postoperative evaluation in both physical functioning and vitality. Conclusions. STST is a short and practical physical performance test that could enable a better prediction of the postoperative course after cardiac surgery. Patients with lower preoperative STST performance may require longer postoperative artificial ventilation, as they may present worse in some parameters of pulmonary functions and quality of life. However, these findings must be corroborated in larger studies."

However, postoperative complications occur in up to 50% of patients and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, lower health related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased expenditure in health care. The number and severity of complications are closely related to preoperative functional capacity, nutritional state, psychological state, and smoking behavior.

            "abstract": "Patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AVA <1.3 cm2) who were judged, by a referring cardiologist, as asymptomatic or equivocal symptomatic from the aortic stenosis were included in the study. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% were not included. Twenty-nine percent of the referred patients were judged asymptomatic and 71% equivocal symptomatic from their valve disease. The mean age was 72 years and 90% of the patients had an AVA-index <0.6 cm2/m2. By clinical evaluation in the outpatient clinic, 48% were judged as having functional limitation corresponding to NYHA≥II. The study participants had cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) at inclusion, and, if relevant, pre- and nine months post-aortic valve replacement (AVR). CPX was feasible in 130 of 131 study participants recruited across 19 months. The coefficient of variability by test-retest was 5.4% and 4.6% for peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) and peak oxygen pulse (pO2pulse= pVO2/peak heart rate), respectively. The stroke volume generally increased with exercise, also in those with peak flow velocity across the aortic valve (Vmax) >5 m/s, >4 m/s, and <4 m/s but with high valvuloarterial impedance (Zva >5.5 mm Hg/(mL·m2 )). This was found both when assessed by inert gas rebreathing and by the pO2pulse/hemoglobin index. Both resting and exercise stroke volume were lower for the latter group, with Vmax <4 m/s but high valvuloarterial impedance. A pVO2 <83% of the predicted, which corresponds to the lower 95% percentile found in the healthy sedentary population, was predicted independently by lower stroke volume during exercise, lower heart rate during exercise, lower FEV1, and by higher ventilation/carbon dioxide exhaustion rate (VE/VCO2), but not by the severity of the aortic stenosis as determined by echocardiography. According to the CPX results, the patients were prospectively grouped into 3 groups, as follows: 1) normal pVO2 (>83% of predicted) and pO2pulse (>95% of predicted); 2) subnormal pVO2 or pO2pulse that according to CPX could be explained by causes other than hemodynamic compromise; 3) subnormal pVO2 and pO2pulse. Groups 1 and 2 followed an initial conservative strategy, whereas Group 3 was referred for angiogram and Heart Team evaluation for AVR. The patients were followed for an average of 24 months and, in Groups 1 and 2, one patient (0.9%) suffered cardiac death and seven were hospitalized with heart failure (6.7%). The patient who died and another patient with heart failure had both previously, during the study, declined AVR. For Groups 1 and 2, the rate of the combined endpoint progression to cardiac death, hospitalization with heart failure, or AVR was 37.5%, which seems lower than what was reported in the literature by conventional assessment and strategy for younger asymptomatic patients with comparable echocardiographic severity of aortic stenosis. The endpoint progression to cardiac death, hospitalization with heart failure, or AVR with improvement in pVO2 or in the Physical Component Score of the SF-36 health-related quality of life score was reached in 25.6% in Groups 1+2 and in 62.5% in Group 3 (p=0.003). A decreased pO2pulse, which expresses stroke volume at peak exercise, predicted this endpoint. In 73 operated patients without left ventricular dysfunction and no coronary stenosis, including 37 patients from the above-mentioned study, a CPX 9 months post-AVR showed that the pVO2, on average, was less than that predicted (mean 89% of the predicted ) and 35% of the patients had a subnormal pVO2 (<83% of that predicted). A preoperative mean gradient <40 mm Hg across the aortic valve, the presence of atrial fibrillation, and a permanent pacemaker post-AVR all predicted a post-AVR pVO2 <83% of that predicted. For the 37 patients with a pre-AVR CPX, a postoperative decrease >10% in the absolute pVO2 was noted in 30% and an increase >10% in 24% of patients. A decrease >10% in pVO2 was predicted by preoperative mean gradient <40 mm Hg and an increase in pVO2 was predicted by preoperative AVAI <0.4 cm2/m2 and preoperative pO2pulse <the median in the study population (<98% of that predicted).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this group of patients, where clinical assessment is difficult and conventional exercise testing is regarded as less useful, CPX showed high feasibility and reproducibility. CPX therefore has potential as a useful tool for serial monitoring. In general, the stroke volume increased during exercise, including in patients with severe aortic stenosis or decreased resting stroke volume. CPX gives information on hemodynamics and the physiologic components that determine decreased pVO2. CPX seems useful to identify 1) patients with a low risk of cardiac death and low risk of progression to symptoms from the aortic stenosis, and 2) patients with hemodynamic compromise who improve in functional capacity after AVR. Patients with a preoperative mean gradient <40 mm Hg across the aortic valve, with the presence of atrial fibrillation or who have a permanent pacemaker, postoperatively seem to benefit less from AVR, whereas the benefit seems larger in those with more severe aortic stenosis and a decreased pO2pulse. These findings may be of importance for decisions and information of patients before AVR."

The median Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were: 1540 days for the whole cohort; 2200 days after cystectomy scheduled (n = 108); and 843 days without surgery. The mortality hazard remained double that expected for a matched general population, but survival was better in patients scheduled for surgery than those who were not: the mortality hazard ratio (95%CI) after cystectomy was 0.43 (0.26-0.73) the mortality hazard without surgery, p = 0.001. The mortality hazard ratios for the three-variable Bayesian Model Averaging survival model for all 141 patients were: referral for surgery (0.5); haemoglobin concentration (0.98); and efficiency of carbon dioxide output (1.05). Efficiency of carbon dioxide output was the single variable in the postoperative model (n = 108), mortality hazard 1.08 (per unit increase). The ratio of observed to expected peak oxygen consumption associated best with mortality in 33 patients not referred for surgery, hazard ratio 0.001. Our results can inform consultations with patients with invasive bladder cancer and suggest that interventions to increase fitness and haemoglobin may improve survival in patients who do and who do not undergo radical cystectomy."

            "abstract": "In the last years a number of significant improvements have been achieved in risk stratification for lung cancer patients who undergo lung resection. Nevertheless, future improvements should be based in prospective cooperative studies including a large number of comparable cases. First limitations of available published evidence come from the fact that FEV1 and ppo-FEV1 are pivotal in patient classification. Besides, ppoFEV1 is not a reliable predictor of complications in patients with COPD, since their functional behavior is different compared with non-COPD patients after lung resection and, although current calculation methods may be accurate in estimating the residual definitive FEVI at 3 to 6 months after surgery, they tend to overestimate the actual FEV1 in the first postoperative days, when most of the complications occur. The assumption that FEV1 and DLCO are highly correlated is the reason why ppoDLCO estimation is not recommended in all patients, limiting the predictive ability of this test. Finally, the predictive ability of exercise testing has not been proven since it is not systematically recommended in all patients before lung resection."

A video terminal gave access to a remote computer. The postoperative subjective response was evaluated by questionnaires sent to patients at 6- to 12-month intervals, and was augmented by treadmill testing and postoperative coronary arteriography. Operative risk and subjective response are related only to the degree of ventricular function lost prior to surgery. Long-term results were best in patients in whom complete revascularization was possible. Current operative risk is less than 1%; a five-year survival rate of 90% to 95% is predicted. More than 90% of patients were asymptomatic or \"greatly improved.\" Postoperative treadmill tests were negative in 88% of patients in these groups. In patients who were only \"slightly improved\" or \"not improved,\" repeat catherization showed a graft patency rate of 84%, suggesting that recurrent symptoms were related to the extent of preoperative disease or to the progression of disease in nongrafted vessels, rather than to graft occlusion."

The association between pretransplant pVO2 and post-transplantation outcomes in HF patients has not been previously studied. We identified adult OHT recipients with available pVO2 in the United Network for Organ Sharing registry (2000 to 2015). Patients were divided into 3 categories using Weber classification: class B (pVO2 16 to 20 ml/kg/min), class C (pVO2 10 to 16 ml/kg/min), and class D (pVO2 <10 ml/kg/min). Postoperative outcomes (mortality, renal failure, rejection) were compared between the groups. A total of 9,623 patients were included in this analysis; the mean age was 54 ± 11 years, 74% were male, 75% were white and 59% had nonischemic etiology of HF. The mean pVO2 was 11.7 ± 3.6 ml/kg/min: 1,202 (12.5%) in class B, 6,055 (62.9%) in class C, and 2,366 (24.6%) were in class D. At a median follow-up of 6.1 years, 2,730 (28.4%) died.

A preoperative step test result of greater than or equal to 14.5 and male gender were significant predictive parameters for an effective judgment with JOACMEQ-L.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative step test results significantly reflected the effective results of JOACMEQ-L and were predictive of improved lower limb function after laminoplasty in patients with CCM.

However, there are few data concerning the effects of LVRS on the cardiopulmonary circulation, especially during exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pulmonary function tests and pulmonary hemodynamic study at rest and during exercise were performed before and 6 months after LVRS (seven patients) or pulmonary lobectomy (eight patients). In the workload test, an electrically braked bicycle ergometer (25 w) was used in the supine position for at least 2 minutes or until exhaustion or breathlessness developed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After lung lobectomy, the values of vital capacity, percentage of predicted vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, residual volume/total lung capacity, and maximal voluntary ventilation deteriorated significantly. Six months after LVRS, however, vital capacity, percentage vital capacity showed no significant change, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and maximal voluntary ventilation showed marked improvement. Cardiac index was changed neither at rest nor during exercise in either group by the operation. Although postoperative pulmonary arterial pressure in the lobectomy group was significantly increased by the exercise, LVRS did not affect postoperative pulmonary arterial pressure at rest or during exercise. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the lobectomy group showed no significant change after the operation, whereas LVRS ameliorated the marked elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure observed during exercise. After lobectomy, significant increases in the pulmonary vascular resistance index were observed at rest and during exercise. LVRS markedly increased the pulmonary vascular resistance index at rest but not during exercise. In the lobectomy group, the postoperative flow-pressure curve moved upward, and its gradient became steeper than the preoperative one. In the LVRS group, the curve moved upward in a parallel fashion. These results show that much more right-sided heart work is needed to achieve the same cardiac output against higher pulmonary arterial pressure, not only after lobectomy but also LVRS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The current study demonstrated that the effects of LVRS on the cardiopulmonary circulation were not negligible, especially during exercise, and successful LVRS may depend on improved respiratory function and also preserved cardiac function that can tolerate the damage to the pulmonary vascular bed induced by this operation."

Only patients who had undergone a lobar pulmonary resection were subsequently considered; these patients had a new complete cardio-respiratory evaluation 3 months after surgery. The pre- and postoperative values compared were those of FEV1, TLC, DLCO, VO2max, and VE/VCO2. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD).

Study endpoints were limited to postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death before hospital discharge. There were nine postoperative cardiac events (seven deaths and two nonfatal infarctions). There was no statistical correlation between cardiac events and preoperative clinical descriptors, including individual clinical parameters, the Dripps-American Surgical Association score, the Goldman Cardiac Risk Index score, the Detsky Modified Cardiac Risk Index score, Eagle's clinical markers of low surgical risk, and the probability of postoperative events as determined by Cooperman's equation. There were no cardiac events in 30 patients with normal dipyridamole-thallium scans or in nine patients with fixed myocardial perfusion defects. Of 21 patients with reversible perfusion defects who underwent surgery, nine had a postoperative cardiac event (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 43%). In the six other patients with reversible defects, preoperative angiography showed severe coronary disease or cardiomyopathy. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically before major general and vascular surgery, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who sustained a postoperative cardiac event."

            "abstract": "A generalized decision tree or clinical algorithm for treatment of high-risk elective surgical patients was developed from a physiologic model based on empirical data. First, a large data bank was used to do the following: (1) describe temporal hemodynamic and oxygen transport patterns that interrelate cardiac, pulmonary, and tissue perfusion functions in survivors and nonsurvivors; (2) define optimal therapeutic goals based on the supranormal oxygen transport values of high-risk postoperative survivors; (3) compare the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies in a wide variety of clinical and physiologic conditions; and (4) to develop criteria for titration of therapy to the endpoints of the supranormal optimal goals using cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) as proxy outcome measures. Second, a general purpose algorithm was generated from these data and tested in preoperatively randomized clinical trials of high-risk surgical patients. Improved outcome was demonstrated with this generalized algorithm. The concept that the supranormal values represent compensations that have survival value has been corroborated by several other groups. We now propose a unique approach to refine the generalized algorithm to develop customized algorithms and individualized decision analysis for each patient's unique problems. The present article describes a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of artificial intelligence techniques to accomplish individualized algorithms that may further improve patient care and outcome."

This study included patients who underwent routine preoperative CPET prior to elective CRS and HIPEC at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney between July 2017 and July 2020. CPET was performed using a cycle ergometer and measured peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) and anaerobic threshold (AT).

The associations between preoperative CPET variables and postoperative morbidity were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 129 patients were included. Mean age was 56 years (standard deviation (SD) 12.5 years), and colorectal cancer was the most common indication for CRS and HIPEC. The overall complication rate was 69%, and two (1.6%) patients died in hospital. Patients who did not develop any postoperative complication had slightly higher preoperative AT and VO2 peak and shorter length of hospital stay.

Additional measurements of blood flow reduction and functional impairment clarify the indication for treatment and facilitate outcome evaluation. Purpose To analyze the additional outcome information on peripheral arterial pressures and walking capacity obtained from a local registry of EVT. Material and Methods Patients with IC treated with endovascular technique (angioplasty or stent) were prospectively entered into a local registry in addition to the national registry (NORKAR), with information on arterial pressures (ankle brachial index [ABI]) and treadmill performance (maximum walking distance [MWD]). Results A total of 242 consecutive patients (41% women; median age, 70 years) receiving the first treatment between July 2010 and December 2012 were included, 61% with aorto-iliac lesions. After 3 months, mean ABI increased from 0.62 (0.59-0.64) to 0.85 (0.83-0.87). The median MWD increased from 160 m to 410 m. Sixty-two percent reached the test maximum of 10 min.

Impaired cardiopulmonary function is associated with mortality following esophagectomy. We sought to assess the impact of NAT on cardiopulmonary function using CPEX and assessing the clinical relevance of any change in particular if changes were associated with post-operative morbidity. This was a prospective, cohort study of 40 patients in whom CPEX was performed before and after NAT. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgery and follow-up with perioperative outcomes measured. The primary variables derived from CPEX were the anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2peak). There were significant reductions in the AT (pre-NAT: 12.4 ± 3.0 vs. post-NAT 10.6 ± 2.0 mL kg-1.min-1; p = 0.001). This reduction was also evident for V˙O2peak (pre-NAT: 16.6 ± 3.6 vs. post-NAT 14.9 ± 3.7 mL kg-1.min-1; p = 0.004). The relative reduction in V˙O2peak was greater in chemotherapy patients who developed any peri-operative morbidity (p = 0.04). For patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy, there was a significantly greater relative reduction in AT (p = 0.03) for those who encountered a respiratory complication. Cardiopulmonary function significantly declined as a result of NAT prior to oesophagectomy. The reduction in AT and V˙O2peak was similar in both the chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy groups."

However, ongoing pain and disability is an issue for some patients, and recurrence contributing to reoperation is reported. It is important to identify prognostic factors predicting outcome to inform decision-making for surgery and rehabilitation following surgery. The objective was to determine whether pre-operative physical factors are associated with post-operative outcomes in adult patients [≥16 years old] undergoing lumbar discectomy or microdiscectomy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review was conducted according to a registered protocol [PROSPERO CRD42015024168].

Prospective cohort studies with ≥1-year follow-up, evaluating candidate physical prognostic factors [e.g. leg pain intensity and straight leg raise test], in adult patients undergoing lumbar discectomy/microdiscectomy were included. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, evaluated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias [QUIPS].

There is low level evidence that higher severity of pre-operative leg pain predicts better Core Outcome Measures Index at 12 months and better post-operative leg pain at 2 and 7 years. There is very low level evidence that a lower pre-operative EQ-5D predicts better EQ-5D at 2 years. Low level evidence supports duration of leg pain pre-operatively not being associated with outcome, and very low-quality evidence supports other factors [pre-operative ODI, duration back pain, severity back pain, ipsilateral SLR and forward bend] not being associated with outcome [range of outcome measures used].\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An adequately powered low risk of bias prospective observational study is required to further investigate candidate physical prognostic factors owing to existing low/very-low level of evidence."

Activity was measured via self-report and accelerometers, including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and sedentary activity (SA). Physical function measures at baseline and restaging follow-up included 6-minute walk test (6MWT), 5 times sit-to-stand (5×STS), handgrip strength (HGS), 3-m walk for gait speed (GS), and the PROMIS Physical Function Short Form. HRQOL was measured via the FACT-Hep questionnaire. Results: Fifty participants with mean age 66 years (standard deviation = 8 years) were enrolled. The 6MWT, 5×STS, and GS significantly improved from baseline to restaging follow-up (P=.001, P=.049, and P=.009, respectively). Increases in self-reported aerobic exercise, weekly MVPA, and LPA were associated with improvement in 6MWT (β=.19, P=.048; β=.18, P=.03; and β=.08, P=.03, respectively) and self-reported physical functioning (β=.02, P=.03; β=.03, P=.005; and β=.01, P=.02, respectively). Increased weekly LPA was associated with increased HRQOL (β=.03, P=.02). Increased SA was associated with decreased HRQOL (β=-.02,P=.01). Conclusions: Patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer exhibit meaningful improvement in physical function with prehabilitation; physical activity was associated with improved physical function and HRQOL. These data highlight the importance of physical activity during treatment for pancreatic cancer."

            "abstract": "Patients with impaired pulmonary function are at increased risk for the development of postoperative complications. Recently exercise testing and predicted postoperative (ppo) function have gained increasing importance in the evaluation of lung resection candidates. We prospectively evaluated an algorithm for the preoperative functional evaluation that was developed at our institution. This algorithm incorporated the cardiac history including an electrocardiogram (ECG), and the three parameters FEV1, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), as well as their respective ppo values (FEV1-ppo, DLCO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo) calculated based on radionuclide perfusion scans. A consecutive group of 137 patients (mean age 62 yr; range 23 to 81; 102 males, 35 females) with clinically resectable lesions underwent assessment according to our algorithm. Five patients were deemed functionally inoperable, 132 passed the algorithm and underwent pulmonary resections with standard thoracotomy: 9 segmental or wedge resections, 85 lobectomies (inclusive 3 bilobectomies), and 38 pneumonectomies. All patients were extubated within 24 h. The mean stay in the ICU was 1.4 (+/- 1.8) d, and the mean hospital stay was 14.6 (+/- 5) d. Postoperative complications (within 30 d) occurred in 15 patients (11%), of whom two died (overall mortality rate 1.5%). In comparison to our previous series this meant a 50% reduction in complications whereas the percentage of inoperable patients remained unchanged (4% now, 5% before). We conclude that adherence to our algorithm resulted in a very low complication rate (morbidity and mortality), and excluded more rigorous patient selection as a bias for the improved results."

            "abstract": "The risk of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery may be estimated by clinical risk factor analysis and by myocardial stress testing. While stress testing modalities accurately delineate reversible myocardial ischaemia, their positive predictive value is low, and it is not clear whether their implementation improves outcome when compared to risk stratification alone. Similarly, it remains to be shown that preoperative coronary revascularization is an effective strategy in reducing perioperative risk. Recent reports indicate that surgery undertaken in the first weeks after percutaneous coronary interventions may be associated with a significantly increased rate of major complications. Administration of beta-blockers and alpha2-adrenergic agonists to high-risk patients reduces surgical morbidity and mortality, and the benefits observed with beta-blockers may extend long after the operative period. In high-risk patients undergoing major surgery, pulmonary artery catheter-guided haemodynamic optimization has not been associated with better outcomes, whereas use of regional anesthetic techniques decreases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary, but not cardiac, complications."

The flap artery was implanted into the aorta, the venous flow was directed into the right atrium. All patients were about 3 weeks after the intervention free from angina. The postoperative bicycle ergometry showed no signs of ischemic ST-segment changes, meanwhile the preoperative ergometry evinced signs of ischemic ST-segment changes in almost all patients.

Sixty-six patients had a good clinical response to intensification of the antianginal therapy and were therefore treated further medically. In 60 patients with refractory angina, sole transmyocardial laser revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass or additional grafts was performed. The transmyocardial laser revascularization group was 32% female; 78.3% patients had had bypass operations; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53.6 +/- 15%.

Transmyocardial laser revascularization led to a rapid early relief of symptoms, but with a trend towards worsening over time and showed a high peri-operative risk (> 10%) dependent on the pre-operative ejection fraction. Our data were in contrast to other published reports on the more beneficial effects of transmyocardial laser revascularization and should lead to further investigation of this experimental method.

The V'(O2 peak) was instead the best predictor for the occurrence of severe cardiopulmonary postoperative complications (OR: 0.05, z=-2.39, p<0.02).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In COPD patients, a high V'(E)/V'(CO2) slope before lung resection is an independent mortality predictor even in the presence of an acceptable cardiopulmonary performance. COPD patients with high V'(E)/V'(CO2) slope before surgery must be carefully screened to exclude pulmonary hypertension, especially before surgical procedures with large parenchymal exeresis."

Of 2458 participants, 455 were given an activity monitor, which records the steps per minute, and an exercise diary before and 1 year after surgery. The mean number of steps/d, active min/d, and high-cadence min/wk were calculated for 310 participants who wore the monitor ≥10 hr/d for ≥3 days at both evaluations. Pre- and postoperative PA were compared for differences using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

However, depending on the PA measure, 24-29% of participants were ≥5% less active postoperatively than preoperatively. Controlling for surgical procedure, gender, age, and body mass index, more PA preoperatively independently predicted for more PA postoperatively (P < .0001, for all PA measures). Less pain, not having asthma, and the self-report of increasing PA as a weight loss strategy preoperatively also independently predicted for more high-cadence min/wk postoperatively (P < .05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The majority of adults increase their PA level after bariatric surgery.

The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate the benefits of direct versus indirect revascularisation of internal iliac arteries (IIAs) for prevention of buttock claudication in this population. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of proximal ischaemia patients who underwent revascularisation and both preoperative and postoperative stress TcPO(2) testing. Revascularisation procedures were classified as either direct revascularisation, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and internal iliac artery bypass, resulting in a direct inflow in a patent IIA (group 1) or indirect revascularisation, including aortobifemoral bypass and recanalisation of the femoral junction on the ischaemic side, resulting in indirect inflow from collateral arteries in the hypogastric territory (group 2). Patency was checked 3 months after revascularisation in all cases. Treadmill exercise stress tests were performed before and after revascularisation using the same protocol designed to assess pain, determine maximum walking distance (MWD) and measure TcPO(2) during exercise. In addition, ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) were calculated. Between May 2001 and March 2008, a total of 93 patients with objectively documented proximal ischaemia underwent 145 proximal revascularisation procedures using conventional open techniques in 109 cases and endovascular techniques in 36. Direct revascularisation was performed on 50 limbs (35%) (group 1) and indirect revascularisation on 95 limbs (65%) (group 2). The mean interval between revascularisation and stress testing was 60+/-74 days preoperatively and 149+/-142 days postoperatively. No postoperative thrombosis was observed. Buttock claudication following revascularisation was more common in group 2 (p<0.001). No difference was observed between the two groups with regard to improvement in MWD (365 / 294 m) and ABI (0.20/0.22). Disappearance of proximal ischaemia was more common after direct revascularisation (p<0.01). The extent of lesions graded according to the TASC II classification appeared not to be predictive of improvement in assessment criteria following revascularisation. Conversely, patency of the superficial femoral artery was correlated with improvement (p<0.01). This study indicates that direct revascularisation, if feasible, provides the best functional outcome for prevention of buttock claudication."

            "abstract": "A prospective study of preoperative exercise testing was carried out in 200 patients older than 40 years scheduled for elective major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia. The exercise test response was electrocardiographically positive in 32 patients (16%) (2 patients had a markedly positive test), equivocal in 11 patients (5.5%) and negative in 157 patients (78.5%). The patients were followed with serial pre- and postoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) and determinations of serum creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB. Six patients (3%) had primary endpoints: 3 (1.5%) died postoperatively and 3 (1.5%) had definite postoperative myocardial infarction. Secondary endpoints of suspected postoperative myocardial ischemia/injury diagnosed by ECG or elevation in CK-MB levels occurred in 27 patients (14%). Endpoint events were more common in patients aged 70 years or older. Endpoint events were also more common in patients with an abnormal (positive or equivocal) preoperative exercise test response than in those with a negative response (27% vs 14%); however, preoperative exercise results were not statistically significant independent predictors of cardiac risk. Using multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant independent predictor of risk was the preoperative ECG. Endpoint events were more common in patients with an abnormal than in those with a normal ECG (23% vs 7%, p less than 0.002). Because the results of exercise testing do not appear to add substantially to the risk separation provided by the ECG at rest, exercise testing is not recommended as a routine preoperative method for assessing perioperative risk in older patients who are being evaluated before major elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia."

Tests designed to identify myocardial ischemia alone will fail to detect cardiac failure and are thus inadequate as a screening test for identification of cardiac risk in noncardiac surgical patients. We find that the degree of cardiac failure is the most important predictor of morbidity and mortality. We use cardiopulmonary exercise testing to establish the anaerobic threshold as the sole measure of cardiopulmonary function as well as to detect myocardial ischemia. Patients with an anaerobic threshold < 11 ml/min/kg are at risk for major surgery, and perioperative management must be planned accordingly. Myocardial ischemia combined with moderate to severe cardiac failure (anaerobic threshold < 11 ml/min/kg) is predictive of the highest morbidity and mortality."

Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the online databases PubMed, PEDro and Cochrane Library using the following search keywords: \"prehabilitation\", \"preoperative care\", and \"total hip replacement\". Results: A total of 400 potentially relevant studies were identified. After title, abstract and full-text screening, 14 studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Patients who completed exercise-based prehabilitation before their operation showed significant postoperative improvements compared with no intervention in the following tests: six-minute walk test, Timed Up and Go test, chair-rise test, and stair climbing. For various other assessments, such as the widely used Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and Barthel Index, no significant differences in outcomes regarding exercise therapy were reported in the included studies. Education alone had no effect on postoperative outcomes. Conclusions: Prehabilitation in the form of a prehabilitation exercise therapy is an effective prehabilitation measure with regard to postoperative physical functioning, while prehabilitation in the form of education has no significant effects.

Patients completed the six-minute walk test prior to surgery. Disability was measured before and six months after surgery using the World Health Organization disability assessment schedule. Primary outcome measures included quality of recovery at one month and significantly increased disability at six months after surgery. A total of 293 patients participated. The median body mass index was 41 kg/m2. Patients generally recovered well. Following surgery, 9% of patients experienced a poor quality of recovery and 7% developed a significant increase in disability. The proportion of patients free from clinically significant disability increased from 66% prior to surgery to 90% at six months after surgery. The distance walked in six minutes was weakly predictive of poor recovery at one month and significantly increased disability at six months; weight and body mass index were not. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (95% confidence intervals 0.51 to 0.78) for poor recovery and 0.64 (95% confidence intervals 0.51 to 0.77) for increased disability.

We reported recently the results of a randomized trial comparing 2 prehabilitation programs before colorectal surgery (stationary cycling plus weight training versus a recommendation to increase walking coupled with breathing exercises); however, adherence to the programs was low.

Women were less likely to improve; low baseline walking capacity, anxiety, and the belief that fitness aids recovery were associated with improvements during prehabilitation. In the postoperative phase, the patients who had improved during prehabilitation were also more likely to have recovered to their baseline walking capacity than those with no change or deterioration (77% vs 59% and 32%; P = .0007).

During support, average pump flow indices ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 L.min-1.m-2, and all patients underwent physical rehabilitation. Between the time of LVAD implantation and explantation, the mean serum creatinine value decreased from 1.63 +/- 0.6 to 1.25 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (p = not significant), and the mean serum total bilirubin value decreased from 2.8 +/- 2.0 to 0.63 +/- 0.11 mg/dL (p < 0.05). All but 1 patient improved from New York Heart Association class IV to class I. Device-related complications were minimal. Twelve control patients (\"de facto randomized\") who did not receive the LVAD also were evaluated: actuarial survival at 1 year was 0% (p < 0.05); 3 (25%) underwent transplantation and died within 2 months; 9 (75%) died before transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To assess construct validity, results were compared with other measures used to estimate recovery, including pain (VAS), health-related quality of life (SF-36), and complications. CHAMPS was also compared with a measure of exercise capacity, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).

            "abstract": "A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether preoperative physiotherapy/pulmonary rehabilitation is beneficial for patients undergoing lung resection. Ten papers were identified using the reported search, of which five represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. In 2007 a report showed in 13 subjects receiving a preoperative rehabilitation programme (PRP) an improvement of maximum oxygen uptake consumption (VO(2) max) of an average 2.4 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval 1-3.8; P=0.002). A report in 2008 showed in 12 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and VO(2) max <15 ml/kg/min that PRP could effect a mean improvement in VO(2) max of 2.8 ml/kg/min (P<0.001). An earlier report in 2005 demonstrated a reduced length of hospital stay (21±7 days vs. 29±9 days; P=0.0003) in 22 subjects who underwent PRP for two weeks compared with a historical control of 60 patients with COPD. It was shown in 2006 that by using a cross-sectional design with historical controls that one day of chest physiotherapy comprising inspiratory and peripheral muscle training compared with routine nursing care was associated with a lower atelectasis rate (2% vs. 7.7%) and a median length of stay that was 5.73 days vs. 8.33 days (P<0.0001). A prospective randomised controlled study in 1997, showed that two weeks of PRP followed by two months of postoperative rehabilitation produced a better predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in one second in the study group than in the control group at three months (lobectomy + 570 ml vs. -70 ml; pneumonectomy + 680 ml vs. -110 ml). We conclude that preoperative physiotherapy improves exercise capacity and preserves pulmonary function following surgery. Whether these benefits translate into a reduction in postoperative pulmonary complication is uncertain."

A systematic search of controlled trials published up to October 2019 that assigned participants to either a preoperative or postoperative exercise training group or a nonexercise group was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. Twenty-two training programs were assessed (18 performed after bariatric surgery). The effect of preoperative exercise training on postsurgery outcomes was reported in only one study. Compared with the control condition without exercise, postoperative exercise training led to higher weight loss (N = 14, mean difference [95% CI] = -1.8 [-3.2; -0.4] kg, P = 0.01), fat loss (N = 9, P = 0.01), increase in VO2 max (N = 8, P < 0.0001), and increase in muscle strength (N = 9, P < 0.0001). No significant effect was found on lean body mass (N = 11). Preliminary evidence suggests a beneficial effect of postoperative exercise training on bone mineral density (N = 3, P < 0.001) and weight maintenance after the end of the intervention (N = 2, P < 0.001) but no significant effect on quality of life (N = 2), habitual physical activity (N = 2), or cardiometabolic outcomes (N < 4). In conclusion, exercise training performed after bariatric surgery improves physical fitness and leads to a small additional weight and fat loss and may prevent bone loss and weight regain after bariatric surgery."

To stratify patients at different risk of coronary events we investigated the usefulness of a noninvasive preoperative cardiological workup.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied 172 consecutive patients admitted to the Neurosurgical Department for symptomatic high-grade (70% to 99%) carotid stenosis (age, 42 to 74 years; mean, 57.8 years). Patients without history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and able to exercise were submitted to exercise electrocardiographic testing (EET) and, if abnormal, to exercise thallium myocardial imaging (TMI). Patients were classified into four groups: group 1, patients without CAD: no history of CAD, normal EET, or normal TMI in the presence of indeterminant EET (n = 93, 54%); group 2, patients with silent CAD: no history of CAD and concordant abnormal EET and TMI (n = 28, 16%); group 3, patients unable to exercise: no history of CAD and inability to perform adequate EET because of previous stroke or claudication (n = 29, 17%); and group 4, patients with known CAD: history of angina or myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 22; 13%).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The four groups were comparable in regard to age, sex, and computed tomographic scan of the brain. The prevalence of stroke was higher in patients unable to exercise; hypercholesterolemia was more frequent in patients with known CAD. During the perioperative period (< or = 30 days after carotid endarterectomy), coronary events occurred in 3 patients (2%): fatal MI in 2 patients in group 4 and 1 patient in group 3. One hundred percent of patients were followed up for 6.2 years. Coronary events occurred in 23 of the 168 patients discharged from the hospital (13.7%); these were fatal in 11 (6.5%): 3 patients of group 1 (3%; sudden death in 2, fatal MI in 1), 8 patients of group 2 (29%; fatal MI in 5, unstable angina in 3), 8 patients of group 3 (28%; fatal MI in 4, nonfatal MI in 4), and 4 patients of group 4 (18%; fatal MI in 2, sudden death in 1, unstable angina in 1). Kaplan-Meier estimated curves of survival free from fatal and nonfatal coronary events were 97%, 51%, 49%, and 59%, respectively (P < .001, group 1 versus groups 2 and 3; P < .01, group 1 versus group 4).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Among patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, coronary events occurred twice as often as cerebral recurrences. A preoperative noninvasive cardiac investigation, including EET, can adequately identify groups of patients with diverse short- and long-term prognoses.

The rehabilitation programme, starting 6 weeks after surgery, consisted of follow-up at a coronary clinic, repeated health education, and physical training in out-patient groups. During the first year after CABG, fewer study group patients were readmitted to hospital (14% vs 32%, p less than 0.01) and on fewer occasions (1.1 vs 2.9, p less than 0.05). Fewer patients used anxiolytic drugs (0% vs 15%, p less than 0.01). At the one year post-CABG exercise test we found in the study group a tendency to a greater increase in work capacity, as compared with the values obtained at the preoperative exercise test (33 vs 25 W ns). There were no differences in the rates of returning to work (59% vs 64%). In a long-term follow-up study (av. 38 months post-CABG) the patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire evaluating perceived physical work capacity and training habits. The study group patients rated their physical work capacity higher, and more patients had continued with regular physical training (66% vs 46%, p = 0.05). There were fewer patients using anxiolytic drugs (9% vs 30%, p less than 0.01). Although the programme did not influence the return to work we conclude that it improved the quality of life of our patients as it entailed fewer readmissions and reduced the use of anxiolytic medication; in addition it promoted physical fitness and training habits."

The leads were connected to external stimulators and used both at home and in the hospital for up to six weeks total.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In six of seven subjects (86%), the average of daily pain scores across the first two weeks was <4 on the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale for pain. A majority of subjects (four out of seven; 57%) had ceased opioid use within the first week (median time to opioid cessation for all subjects was six days). Gross sensory/motor function was maintained during stimulation, enabling stimulation during physical therapy and activities of daily living. At 12 weeks following surgery, six of seven subjects had improved by >10% on the Six-Minute Walk Test compared to preoperative levels, and WOMAC scores improved by an average of 85% compared to before surgery. No falls, motor block, or lead infections were reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This feasibility study suggests that for TKA, ultrasound-guided percutaneous PNS is feasible in the immediate perioperative period and may provide analgesia without the undesirable systemic effects of opioids or quadriceps weakness induced by local anesthetics-based peripheral nerve blocks."

Before surgery, at 6 weeks, 4, and 12 months postoperatively, the following evaluations were performed: low back pain and leg pain estimated on a visual analog scale, disability according to the Roland-Morris questionnaire (RMQ) and disability rating index (DRI). Clinical examination, including the SLR test, was performed using a single blind method. Consumption of analgesics was registered. Twenty-five patients started neuromuscular customized training 2 weeks after surgery (early training group = ETG). Thirty-one patients formed a control group (CG) and started traditional training after 6 weeks. There was no significant difference in pain and disability between the two training groups before surgery. Median preoperative leg pain was 63 mm in ETG and 70 mm in the CG. Preoperative median disability according to RMQ was 14 in the ETG and 14.5 in the CG. Disability according to DRI (33/56 patients) was 5.3 in the ETG vs. 4.6 in the CG. At 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months, pain was significantly reduced in both groups, to the same extent. Disability scores were lower in the ETG at all follow-ups, and after 12 months, the difference was significant (RMQ P=.034, DRI P=.015). The results of the present study show early neuromuscular customized training to have a superior effect on disability, with a significant difference compared to traditional training at a follow-up 12 months after surgery. No adverse effects of the early training were seen. A prospective, randomized study with a larger patient sample is warranted to ultimately demonstrate that early training as described is beneficial for patients undergoing LDH surgery."

An isokinetic muscle examination and leg circumference measurements were repeated at 1, 3, and 7 weeks postoperatively. Additionally, the amount of pain and medication required was analyzed. The results of the study indicated that the use of a TNS unit is an effective adjunct in decreasing postoperative pain in 93% of patients. The amount of pain and total pain medication required was greatest in the control group, less in the placebo, and markedly reduced in the TNS group.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is a common therapy for chronic pulmonary regurgitation. However, the use of this strategy is mostly based on the studies performed on patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and not in patients with pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS). The aim of this study is to evaluate our experience with PVR in patients with PA/IVS and compare them with a matched cohort of TOF patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between 1995 and 2009, 13 patients with PA/IVS underwent a late PVR. Matched TOF control subjects were identified for 12 of these patients. Before and after PVR echocardiographic, magnetic resonance imaging, exercise test, Holter, and electrocardiographic data were compared between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was no mortality in either group. The PVR improved pulmonary regurgitant fraction and right ventricular volumes in all patients. Patients with PA/IVS had more significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR [at least moderate]) by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging before PVR (n = 11 [85%] versus n = 1 [8%]; p = 0.003) and had more tricuspid valve repairs than TOF patients (n = 9 [69%] versus n = 1 [8%]; p = 0.004). Repair was undertaken by a combination of techniques. Although TR was improved early postoperatively, only 2 of 9 patients (22%) were free from significant TR at most recent follow-up (median 2.5 years; range, 0.1 to 10.9). No patient underwent reoperation at latest follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients with PA/IVS can undergo a late PVR with excellent results. Significant TR and repair are more commonly observed among patients with PA/IVS compared with TOF patients. Although tricuspid valve repair improves regurgitation early, TR tends to recur, suggesting the need for further refinement of current surgical techniques."

We searched in OVID Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Characteristics of studies and program results and outcome data were extracted. Changes between the intervention and control groups, from baseline to follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each intervention was pooled using weighted random-effects models).

            "abstract": "The surgical patient population is increasingly elderly and comorbid and poses challenges to perioperative physicians. Accurate preoperative risk stratification is important to direct perioperative care. Reduced aerobic fitness is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is an integrated and dynamic test that gives an objective measure of aerobic fitness or functional capacity and identifies the cause of exercise intolerance. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides an individualized estimate of patient risk that can be used to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality. This technology can therefore be used to inform collaborative decision-making and patient consent, to triage the patient to an appropriate perioperative care environment, to diagnose unexpected comorbidity, to optimize medical comorbidities preoperatively, and to direct individualized preoperative exercise programs. Functional capacity, evaluated as the anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]o2peak) predicts postoperative morbidity and mortality in the majority of surgical cohort studies. The ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide (an index of gas exchange efficiency), is predictive of surgical outcome in some cohorts. Prospective cohort studies are needed to improve the precision of risk estimates for different patient groups and to clarify the best combination of variables to predict outcome. Early data suggest that preoperative exercise training improves fitness, reduces the debilitating effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and may improve clinical outcomes. Further research is required to identify the most effective type of training and the minimum duration required for a positive effect."

Twenty patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries, performed a closed-chain leg-press while relaxed and against a 150 N load. The tibiofemoral contact patterns between 0 degrees to 90 degrees of knee flexion were recorded by magnetic resonance scans. All measurements were performed pre-operatively and repeated at 12 weeks and two years. Following reconstruction there was a mean passive anterior laxity of 2.1 mm (sd 2.3), as measured using a KT 1000 arthrometer, and the mean Cincinnati score was 90 (sd 11) of 100. Pre-operatively, the medial and lateral contact patterns of the injured knees were located posteriorly on the tibial plateau compared with the healthy contralateral knees (p=0.014), but were no longer different at 12 weeks (p=0.117) or two years postoperatively (p=0.909). However, both reconstructed and healthy contralateral knees showed altered kinematics over time. At two years, the contact pattern showed less posterior translation of the lateral femoral condyle during flexion (p<0.01)."

Preoperative data included spirometry, plethysmography, diffusion of carbon monoxide (Dco), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure, resting arterial blood gases (ABG), cardiopulmonary exercise testing with ABG and lactate sampling, and radionuclide ventriculography. Prepulmonary and postpulmonary rehabilitation 6-min walk tets (6MWT), and preoperative chest CT scans were also obtained. Twenty-two subjects were male and 17 of the subjects were on the lung transplant list. Patient characteristics included age of 60.5 +/- 7.5 years, FEV1 of 0.67 +/- 0.20 L, total lung capacity of 7.56 +/- 1.7 L, Dco of 7.40 +/- 4.1 mL/min/mm Hg, and PaCO2 of 41.6 +/- 6.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). The FEV1, vital capacity, MIP, resting room air PaCO2, prepulmonary and postpulmonary rehabilitation 6MWT, and PaCO2 at maximum oxygen consumption correlated with length of hospitalization (p < 0.05). Based on analysis of 41 of 47 patients for whom there were complete data, the inability to walk more than 200 m on the 6MWT before or after preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation, and resting PaCO2 > or = 45 mm Hg were the best predictors of an unacceptable outcome. If either of these characteristics was present, six of 16 vs zero of 25 died (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.0025, one-tailed) and 11 of 16 vs four of 25 had hospital courses > 21 days (p < 0.002).

A lower oxygen uptake at peak exercise amongst several other variables on the cardiopulmonary exercise test and a lower performance on field tests, such as the incremental shuttle walk test, stair-climb test, and 6-minute walk test, were associated with a higher risk for postoperative complications and/or postoperative mortality. Cut-off values were reported in a limited number of studies and were inconsistent. Due to the variety in outcomes, further research is needed to evaluate which outcomes and cut-off values of physical exercise tests are most clinically relevant."

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of perioperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation. We enrolled candidates for lung volume reduction surgery from 1999 to 2006 and retrospectively evaluated the feasibility and safety of perioperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation for these patients. The program included the progressive exercise training on a treadmill for approximately 3 weeks. Two primary endpoints, feasibility and safety, were determined by the adherence rates of the program session and the adverse events. Pulmonary function and exercise capacity were evaluated at baseline and the termination of pre- and postoperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. All patients completed our program without any serious adverse events. The mean values of adherence rates of the preoperative, postoperative, and overall period were, 89.1%, 95.1%, and 92.1%, respectively. All values of pulmonary function tests, except for forced vital capacity, significantly improved at the termination of postoperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation in comparison to those at the termination of preoperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation. The values of the 6-minute walk distance, total exercise time, and maximal workload on incremental exercise test were significantly improved by preoperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation, and their values were maintained until the termination of postoperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation. The results indicated that it is both feasible and safe to perform perioperative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation."

Recently, a new concept appeared in digestive surgery: prehabilitation. This interventional process consists of patient preparation, between surgical consultation and surgery, and is based on 3 components: (1) physical management, (2) nutritional care and (3) psychological care.

            "abstract": "In order to estimate the preoperative evaluation of the respiratory risk, a well adapted clinical examination associated with a routine pulmonary function test (VC, FEV1) can be sufficient. Although some patients with cardiopulmonary disorders or candidates to lung resection need more complex assessments: the flow-volume loop to detect small airways obstruction (MEF 50%, MEF 25%), measure of bronchial hyperreactivity to predict bronchospasm during anaesthesia, residual volume for the diagnosis of emphysema, diffusing capacity (DCO) to discover lung fibrosis: these parameters disruption always make the pronostic worse. It is also useful to couple together preoperative function test and pulmonary scintigraphy to predict post-operative values after lung resection. But, these criteria for operability are not always a good indicator of post-operative complications. So it is possible to use in addition the results of exercise testing to determine cardio-respiratory performances and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2MAX) which seem better correlated with mortality and post-operative lung surgical complications. Preliminary results of our study concerning thirty patients hospitalized in Besancon-St-Jacques Hospital, agree with the hypothesis that exercise testing is an important criterion in the pre-operative evaluation and to predict post-operative mortality and morbidity of patients candidates to thoracic surgery."

There is still controversy about cardiopulmonary limitations of this disease and benefits of surgical repair. This study evaluates the impact of pectus excavatum on the cardiopulmonary function of adult patients before and after a modified minimally invasive repair. Methods and Results In this retrospective cohort study, an electronic database was used to identify consecutive adult (aged ≥18 years) patients who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing before and after primary pectus excavatum repair at Mayo Clinic Arizona from 2011 to 2020. In total, 392 patients underwent preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing; abnormal oxygen consumption results were present in 68% of patients. Among them, 130 patients (68% men, mean age, 32.4±10.0 years) had post-repair evaluations. Post-repair tests were performed immediately before bar removal with a mean time between repair and post-repair testing of 3.4±0.7 years (range, 2.5-7.0). A significant improvement in cardiopulmonary outcomes (P<0.001 for all the comparisons) was seen in the post-repair evaluations, including an increase in maximum, and predicted rate of oxygen consumption, oxygen pulse, oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold, and maximal ventilation. In a subanalysis of 39 patients who also underwent intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography at repair and at bar removal, a significant increase in right ventricle stroke volume was found (P<0.001). Conclusions Consistent improvements in cardiopulmonary function were seen for pectus excavatum adult patients undergoing surgery. These results strongly support the existence of adverse cardiopulmonary consequences from this disease as well as the benefits of surgical repair."

Physically, the majority of them had physical class (ASA grade) Grade 2 (67.7%), ECOG performance status of 1 (61.3%) and SGA grade B (51.6%). The functional capacity and nutritional status showed a significant improvement after one week of prehabilitation interventions: peak expiratory flow meter (p<0.001), handgrip (p<0.001), ECOG performance (p<0.001), walking distance (p<0.001), incentive spirometry (p<0.001), total body calorie (p<0.001) and total body protein (p=0.004). However, those patients who required two weeks of prehabilitation for optimization showed only significant improvement in peak expiratory flow meter (p<0.001), handgrip (p<0.001), and incentive spirometry (p<0.001). Prehabilitation is significantly associated postoperatively with the length of hospital stay (p=0.028), complications (p=0.011) and Clavien-Dindo Classification (p=0.029).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Prehabilitation interventions significantly increase the functional capacity and nutritional status of cancer patients preoperatively; concurrently reducing hospital stays and complications postoperatively.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Liver resection is associated with significant morbidity, and assessment of risk is an important part of preoperative consultations. Objective methods exist to assess operative risk, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Subjective assessment is also made in clinic, and patients perceived to be high-risk are referred for CPX at our institution. This article addresses clinicians' ability to identify patients with a higher risk of surgical complications after hepatectomy, using selection for CPX as a surrogate marker for increased operative risk.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Prospectively collected data on patients undergoing hepatectomy between February 2008 and November 2013 were retrieved and the cohort divided according to CPX referral. Complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo system.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      CPX testing was carried out before 101 of 405 liver resections during the study period. The median age was 72 and 64 in CPX and non-CPX groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The resection size was similar between the groups. No difference was noted for grade III complications between CPX and non-CPX tested-groups; however, 19 (18.8%) and 28 (9.2%) patients suffered grade IV-V complications, respectively (P = 0.009). There was no difference in long-term survival between groups (P = 0.63).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study attempts to assess clinicians' ability to identify patients at greater risk of complications after hepatectomy. The confirmation that patients identified in this way are at greater risk of grade IV-V complications demonstrates the value of preoperative counseling. High-risk patients do not have worse long-term outcomes suggesting survival is determined by other factors, particularly disease recurrence."

            "abstract": "Laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair is an established alternative to open hernia repair, which offers equivalent outcomes with less postoperative pain and faster recovery. Unfortunately, it remains technically challenging, requiring advanced laparoscopic skills which have limited its popularity among surgeons. The robotic platform has the potential to overcome these challenges. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term quality of life and outcomes following robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair, since these data have not been reported up to now. From October 2012 to October 2015, 159 inguinal hernias in 82 consecutive patients were repaired with 3D mesh (BARD) using da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The patients' demographics and intraoperative data were documented. Patients were seen 2 and 6 weeks after the surgery and the complications were recorded. Patients were assessed 6 weeks after the surgery by a survey using a universal pain assessment tool to document their post-operative pain, narcotic use and time of return to work and exercise. A modified short form 12 (SF 12) was also sent out to the patients 12-36 months after the surgery to measure their health-related quality of life prior to surgery and at the 12- to 36-month follow-up, and to document any evidence of recurrence. Postoperative health-related quality of life scores were compared to the pre-operative baseline quality of life scores using the unpaired t test. Over the course of 3 years, 159 robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair were performed in 82 patients, 73 men and 9 women by one surgeon as an outpatient basis. The mean age was 53 and mean body mass index was 26. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions. The average operative time was 99 min. Four patients developed urinary retention post-operatively and one patient developed postoperative bowel obstruction requiring laparoscopic lysis of adhesion with no long-term complications. All patients completed the pain assessment survey and the median pain score, 3 days after the surgery was 3. Narcotics were used for an average of 3.1 days. The modified SF 12 survey assessing for quality of life before and 12-36 months after surgery was completed and returned by 29 patients (response rate of 35.4% and median follow-up of 32 months). Only one recurrence was reported which was repaired with open technique. The analysis of the SF 12 survey that evaluated patient's quality of life, pain score and the ability to perform activities of daily living before and after surgery revealed a significant improvement in those measures 12-36 months after the surgery compare to their baseline. Hernia recurrence, chronic pain and physical impairment are the major long-term concerns after any type of inguinal hernia repair. Our results demonstrate that robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be a technically feasible, reproducible and safe minimally invasive alternative with low recurrence, low chronic pain and high health-related quality of life in the long term."

            "abstract": "Prognostic risk stratification to identify perioperative and long-term cardiac risk in selected patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is part of good clinical practice. Exercise variables associated with significant increased risk include poor functional capacity (eg, <4 metabolic equivalents), marked exercise-induced ST segment shift or angina at low workloads, and inability to increase or actually decrease systolic blood pressure with progressive exercise. Approximately 40% of patients tested before peripheral vascular surgery will have an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram (ECG). The predictive value for a perioperative event, ie, death or myocardial infarction, ranges from 5% to 25% for a positive test and 90% to 95% for a negative test. Whereas exercise cardiac imaging is the modality of choice in patients with a noninterpretable exercise ECG, pharmacological stress imaging should be used in the 30% to 50% of patients who require perioperative noninvasive risk stratification and are unable to perform an adequate level of exercise to test cardiac reserve. Myocardial perfusion variables predictive of increased cardiac events include severity of the perfusion defect, number of reversible defects, extent of fixed and reversible defects, increased lung uptake of thallium-201, and marked ST segment changes associated with angina during the test. The reported sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine-induced echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities in patients with peripheral vascular disease is similar to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, but the confidence limits are wider due to the smaller sample size in these more recent studies. In conclusion, noninvasive cardiac testing should be used selectively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery; the results provide useful estimates of short- and long-term risk of cardiac events, and the magnitude of abnormal response on noninvasive testing should be used to formulate decisions regarding the need for coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization."

            "abstract": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, we investigated the postoperative analgesic effect of a single intra-articular injection of 40 mg methylprednisolone acetate (MP) administered 1 week before total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Forty-eight patients with high pain osteoarthritis (≥5 on a numeric rating scale during walk) and sensitization (pressure pain threshold <250 kPa), aged 50 to 80 years and scheduled for primary unilateral TKA under spinal anaesthesia were included. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with moderate/severe pain during a 5-m walk test 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain at 48 hours, during the first 14 days, sensitization (quantitative sensory testing with pressure pain threshold and wind-up from temporal summation), and inflammatory changes (systemic C-reactive protein, intra-articular interleukin [IL]-6). No difference in the proportion of patients with moderate/severe pain was found between MP/placebo groups at 24 hours (67% and 74%, χ2 = .2, P = .63, odds ratio = .7, 95% confidence interval = .2-2.8) or at 48 hours (57% and 68%, χ2 = .5, P = .46, odds ratio = .6, 95% confidence interval = .2-2.3), and no difference between groups in postoperative sensitization was found (P > .4) despite reduced preoperative intra-articular inflammation (IL-6) in the MP group versus placebo (median change in IL-6 = -70 pg/mL, interquartile range = -466 to 0 vs. 32 pg/mL, interquartile range = -26 to 75, P = .029). Alternative central or peripheral analgesic interventions in this high-risk group are required.\n    \n\n\n          Perspective:\n        \n      \n      Peripherally driven inflammatory pain and nociceptive changes before TKA has been suggested to be a cause for increased acute postoperative pain. However, preoperative intra-articular MP in patients with high pain osteoarthritis and sensitization did not reduce acute post-TKA pain or sensitization despite a preoperative reduction of intra-articular inflammatory markers."

Between January and June 1994, a prospective open study was carried out in 156 patients scheduled for elective vascular procedures (63 carotid endarterectomies, 34 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 29 aortoiliac and 30 infrainguinal reconstructions) to compare the ability of clinical data, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi tomoscintigraphy to predict postoperative cardiac events. Pharmacological stress testing consisted of incremental dobutamine infusion (+/-1 mg atropine to achieve 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate, with continuous echocardiographic monitoring, and injection of Tc-99m sestamibi after dobutamine infusion). Dobutamine echocardiography was abnormal in 36 patients (worsening resting wall motion abnormality in 11; new induced wall motion abnormality in 25). Dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi tomoscintigraphy revealed a reversible perfusion defect in 34 patients, indicating the presence of myocardial ischaemia. As a result, eight patients underwent myocardial revascularization (n = 5) or the proposed operation was cancelled (n = 3). In the remaining 142 vascular procedures, there were eight (5.6%) adverse cardiac events: three myocardial infarctions (two fatal), three prolonged myocardial ischaemia, one acute congestive heart failure and one sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the post operative period. Univariate analysis selected unstable angina (relative risk (RR) 11.6), previous congestive heart failure (RR 6.4), Detsky's score of > or = 15 (RR 3.0), positive dobutamine stress echocardiography (RR 3.7), and positive dobutamine tomoscintigraphy (RR 7.4) as significant predictors of postoperative cardiac events. In patients without clinical markers of coronary artery disease (n = 66), non-invasive cardiac testing did not predict cardiac complications (n = 2; one prolonged myocardial ischaemia; one infarction). In the subset of 76 patients with definite clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of ischaemic heart disease, dobutamine stress testing provided additional information, and optimized risk stratification: five of six patients who suffered a cardiac complication had a pathologic dobutamine stress test. Furthermore, a negative dobutamine stress test was characterized by a high negative predictive value (0.96 for echocardiography; 0.97 for tomoscintigraphy). The study further demonstrated that the cardiac response (ischaemic versus non-ischaemic) to dobutamine stress was concordantly classified by echocardiographic and tomoscintigraphic techniques in 96% of cases. It is concluded that complementary non-invasive cardiac stress testing by dobutamine is indicated only in patients with clinically apparent coronary artery disease."

Although the CT group (n = 16) showed better patient activity across the investigated period, there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, white blood cell count on postoperative days (POD) 2 and 10, neutrophil count (POD 2, 7, and 10), and C-reactive protein level (POD 13) in the CT group were significantly lower than in the placebo group. Furthermore, 6MWT on POD 7 and QoR-40 on POD 13 were significantly higher in the CT group than those in the placebo group.

We used the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) to evaluate functional decline; a 0.1 or greater increase was used to indicate a clinically significant decline. The preoperative Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) and a physical function score (PFS), assessing gait speed, grip strength, balance, and standing speed, were evaluated as predictors of decline. We enrolled 215 patients (71.2 ± 5.2 years; 56.7% female); 204 completed follow-up HAQ assessments (71.1 ± 5.3 years; 57.8% female). A significant number of patients had functional decline out to 1 year. Postoperative HAQ-DI increases of 0.1 or greater occurred in 45.3 per cent at 1 month, 30.1 per cent at 3 months, and 28.3 per cent at 1 year. Preoperative DASI and PFS scores were not predictors of functional decline. Male sex at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 6.85); American Society of Anesthesiologists class (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.31 to 8.86), smoking (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.27 to 7.85), and length of stay (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16) at 3 months; and cancer diagnosis at 1 year (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.14 to 5.96) were associated with functional decline."

            "abstract": "Prior to 1970, most patients with tricuspid atresia (TA) and reduced pulmonary blood flow were palliated by means of a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt (SPAS). In Birmingham between 1967 and 1988, 19 patients with TA (aged 16 days to 23 years, mean 3.8 years) have undergone side-to-side cavopulmonary anastomosis (CPA) with preservation of pulmonary artery continuity. One had undergone a previous right Blalock-Taussig shunt and in 1 patient with left and right SVCs, bilateral CPAs were performed. Nine patients were less than 1 year old at the time of operation. There were no operative deaths. One late death occurred due to pneumonia. Immediate clinical improvement occurred in all cases. Six symptomatic patients subsequently required further surgery (mean interval between operations 8.9 years, range 4.6-14.2 years). The remaining 12 patients have recently been reviewed. Mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range 5 weeks to 21 years). Exercise tolerance remains good (9 in NY-HA Class 1 or 2) and resting transcutaneous oxygen saturations are higher (mean 85%, range 70%-89%) compared with preoperative values (P less than 0.01). In small children, CPA avoids the complications of SPAS and, in some patients, may itself achieve adequate long-term definitive palliation."

The means of FEV1 and VO2max did not differ from the predicted values, whereas the predicted DCO was lower than the observed value (mL/min/mm Hg: 15.1 vs 17.9; percent predicted: 59.6 vs 70.9) (p < 0.05). At 6 months, correlations remained very good for FEV1 (r = 0.81 and 0.84) and for DCO (r = 0.76 and 0.74), but had decreased for VO2max to 0.56 and 0.65, respectively. All means were higher than predicted (p < 0.05) owing to recovery in the lobectomy group. Patients with postoperative complications (group B) had a lower preoperative VO2max in percent predicted (62.8 +/- 7.5% vs 84.6 +/- 19.7%) (p < 0.01) and also a lower VO2max-ppo (10.6 +/- 3.6 vs 14.8 +/- 3.5 mL/kg/min and 44.3 +/- 13.5 vs 68.0 +/- 20.7% predicted) (p < 0.05) than patients without complications (group A).

Telerehabilitation interventions can optimize the delivery of perioperative care. This pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility and the potential impact on pain and disability of a telerehabilitation prehabilitation program, compared to in-person prehabilitation or usual care.Material and methods: Thirty-four patients awaiting a total hip or knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to (1) an in-person 12-week prehabilitation program, (2) a tele-prehabilitation program or (3) usual care. Outcomes were feasibility, patients' acceptance and compliance to the program, the LEFS, the WOMAC, SF-36, the Self-Pace Walk, the Stair Test, the Timed Up and Go, and a Global Rating of Change scale. Outcomes were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks.Results: Participants reported excellent satisfaction toward tele-prehabilitation. Compliance with the programs was high. No significant differences between groups were found for self-reported outcomes after the prehabilitation program (p ≥ 0.05).Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that tele-prehabilitation can be feasible using commercially available mobile technologies with patients awaiting total hip or knee arthroplasty, and can generate good satisfaction with this population.

Thirty-two patients would be considered lower risk, having achieved both VO(2)peak and AT cut-offs. Setting an ISWT threshold of 360 m identified 13 of the lower risk patients [positive predictive value (PPV) 1.0, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.49].

Postoperative critical care unit (CCU) admission was based upon the CPET results.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ninety-four patients were identified, of whom 48 underwent CPET testing. The CPET group were significantly older than the non-CPET group (85 vs 83 years, P = 0.04) and were more likely to have a planned admission to CCU postoperatively (P < 0.0001). Despite the increased use of CCU resources, the overall CCU length of stay (LOS) in the CPET group did not differ from the non-CPET group, but the non-CPET group had a higher proportion of Level-3 care. There were no differences in the incidence of unplanned CCU admission between the CPET and the non-CPET group (P = 0.23). There were no differences in overall LOS between the two groups (P = 0.42). There was no difference in mortality (P = 0.11), overall complications (P = 0.53) or severe complications (P = 0.3).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative CPET testing in patients aged over 80 undergoing elective colorectal cancer resection allows identification of higher-risk patients and mitigation of risk by preemptive admission to a CCU. This stratification allows equivalent results to be achieved in high- and low-risk elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery."

            "abstract": "In order to preserve left ventricular (LV) function, aortic valve replacement may be contemplated in asymptomatic patients with aortic regurgitation when LV dilatation and dysfunction are not too advanced. Our study involved 10 asymptomatic patients with severe, isolated and pure aortic regurgitation. Before, and 6 months after the operation, the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured at rest and during exercise on an ergometric bicycle by radionuclide angiography (multigated technique). Mean preoperative values were: age 52 +/- 14 years; cardiothoracic ratio 0.55 +/- 0.04; end-diastolic LV diameter 69 +/- 9 mm; end systolic LV diameter 47 +/- 7 mm; LV fibre shortening fraction 0.31 +/- 0.03; LVEF 0.55 +/- 0.10 at rest and 0.41 +/- 0.13 at exercise. After surgery, the cardiothoracic ratio value (0.51 +/- 0.03) and the LVEF value at rest (0.60 +/- 0.07) were not significantly different from the corresponding preoperative values, but the LVEF value during exercise was significantly increased (0.58 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001). Among the 9 patients who before surgery showed a fall in LVEF at exercise, after surgery 5 had a rise (group B) and 4 had a fall (group A) in LVEF at exercise. Before surgery, group A patients had greater LV diameters than group B patients: end-diastolic diameter 76 +/- 6 mm vs 63 +/- 9 mm; end-systolic diameter 53 +/- 4 mm vs 43 +/- 7 mm (p = 0.07). These diameters were the only variables that predicted the postoperative changes in LVEF at exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, data on the long-term effects of intensive or supervised physiotherapy is lacking. The aim of this exploratory study is the assessment of QoL in the intervention group, using various QoL questionnaires in their validated German translations and gather data on its feasibility in the context of chemotherapy with a follow-up of 12 months (and develop concepts to improve QoL after pancreatic cancer resection).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-six patients (mean age: 66.4 ± 9.9 years) were randomized in this study to intervention (cohort A, n = 28) or control group (cohort B, n = 28).

This paper aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the safety of exercise training and its effects on exercise capacity in AAA patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched for randomized controlled trials published up to December 2017 that compared exercise training vs usual care without exercise training in AAA patients. The primary outcome was safety, specifically the occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events during the study.

There were a total of two cardiovascular adverse events during the exercise test and training, and the cardiovascular event rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were 0.8% and 0.2% to 3.1%. Exercise training did not tend to increase AAA diameter, and it also tended to decrease high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in patients with AAA. All studies that evaluated the changes in AAA diameter or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level involved patients with AAA diameter <55 mm at baseline; there was no study involving participants with AAA diameter ≥55 mm at baseline.

The mean injury-to-surgery time was 20.4 weeks (range, 4-96 weeks). The Matles test and an improved Thompson test was used to examine Achilles tendon rupture. These patients were not able to stand on the tiptoes of the injured lower extremity. X-ray tests ruled out the chance of fracture and were used to examine the Kager triangle. MRI was used to confirm the final diagnosis. The function of the ankle and the foot was assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS). V-Y tendon plasty for Achilles tendon reconstruction was performed. A below-knee cast was used to keep the ankle in plantar flexion (up to 20°) for 4 weeks. Non-weight-bearing exercise was allowed with crutches. After 4 weeks, partial weight-bearing was allowed. Physical exercises were performed under rehabilitation guidelines.

Cardiac output (t) also increased from 4.0 +/- 1.2 to 5.1 +/- 1.9 L/min (p < 0.05), yielding to a higher mixed venous PO(2). Both PaO(2) and t during OLV were significantly lower in patients who had undergone right thoracotomies compared with those who had undergone left thoracotomies. The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio during OLV correlated with the PaO(2) during exercise (r = 0.39; p = 0.01) and with the perfusion of the non-neoplastic lung (r = 0.44; p = 0.005).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In COPD patients, OLV leads to a significant derangement of gas exchange, which is more pronounced in right thoracotomies. Preoperative measurement of PaO(2) during exercise and the distribution of perfusion by lung scan might be useful to identify those patients who are at the greatest risk of abnormal gas exchange during lung resections."

We therefore analyzed the value of preoperative lung scanning and exercise testing for the prediction of postoperative complications and of the short- as well as long-term performance in lung resection candidates at increased risk for complications. Twenty-five (mean age 63 y; 17 m) out of 84 consecutive lung resection candidates were considered at increased risk for postoperative complications due to impaired pulmonary function (FEV1 < 2L or diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) < 50% predicted, or FEV1 and DLCO < or = 80% predicted combined with New York Heart Association dyspnea index > or = 2). Candidates underwent radionuclide perfusion scans and exercise testing to predict postoperative ( = ppo) values for FEV1, DLCO and maximal O2-uptake (VO2max). They all underwent thoracotomy for neoplastic lesions; 7 had pneumonectomies, 18 lobectomies. Six had postoperative complications (within 30 days), of whom three died. Three and 6 months postoperatively, pulmonary function tests and VO2max were repeated. In the 22 survivors, the observed values were then compared with the predicted values. At 3 months, there were excellent correlations (absolute/predicted values): for FEV1r = 0.78 and 0.81; for DLCOr = 0.77 and 0.74; and for VO2max r = 0.71 and 0.83. The means of FEV1 and VO2max did not differ from the predicted values, whereas the predicted DLCO was lower than the observed value (ml/min/mmHg: 15.1 vs 17.9; percent predicted: 59.6 vs 70.9) (p < 0.05). At 6 months, correlations remained very good for FEV1 (r = 0.81 and 0.84) and for DLCO (r = 0.76 and 0.74), but had decreased for VO2max to 0.56 and 0.65, respectively. All means were higher than predicted (p < 0.05) owing to recovery in the lobectomy group. Patients with postoperative complications (group B) had a lower preoperative VO2max in percent predicted (62.8 +/- 7.5% vs 84.6 +/- 19.7%) (p < 0.01) and also a lower VO2max-ppo (10.6 +/- 3.6 vs 14.8 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min and 44.3 +/- 13.5 vs 68.0 +/- 20.7 percent predicted) (p < 0.05) than patients without complication (group A). AVO2max-ppo < 10/ml/kg/min was associated with a 100% mortality. Although FEV1-ppo and DLco-ppo were lower in group B the difference did not reach significance. We conclude that radionuclide-based calculations of postoperative VO2max are predictive of perioperative morbidity and mortality: a VO2max-ppo of < 10 ml/kg/min may indicate inoperability. Further, short-term postoperative performance is accurately predicted by FEV1-ppo and VO2max-ppo, but long-term function is underestimated after lobectomy."

All were stable on intensive medical treatment. The CSD, a textile polyester device, was fitted snugly around the heart during surgery. All patients survived surgery and recovered smoothly. Three months after surgery, 56% of patients were in NYHA class I, 33% were in class II, and 11% were in class II/III.

Thallium redistribution was found to have the best statistical correlation with postoperative myocardial infarction (MI). No MIs occurred after aortic operations among 60 patients with normal scans compared with 8 of 31 patients with abnormal ones. The odds of a patient with abnormalities found by DTS having a postoperative MI were 12 times greater than for those with a normal scan. No symptom or combination of symptoms of CAD was as good as an abnormal DTS in identifying patients at risk. The incidence of MI was 7.0% for patients with symptomatic CAD and 8.5% for those who were asymptomatic. Cardiac complications gradually declined as surgeons gained confidence in the use of DTS, to the point where no postoperative MIs occurred during the final year of the study. DTS approaches the ideal preoperative test for CAD in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The test does not require exercise, is minimally invasive, safe, and of sufficient sensitivity to detect myocardial ischemia in the absence of symptoms. Furthermore, it is cost-effective; only those patients with an abnormal scan and an imperative need for aortic surgical treatment need further cardiac evaluation."

            "abstract": "Preoperative stress testing in asymptomatic patients is considered rarely appropriate in patients with: (1) moderate to good functional capacity (≥4 metabolic equivalent (METs)), (2) no clinical risk factors, or who are (3) asymptomatic after revascularization, normal stress test, or normal coronary angiography within 1 year. Preoperative stress testing is also not recommended in patients at low risk (<1%) for adverse cardiac events. We investigated the frequency of rarely appropriate and low-risk preoperative stress testing across medical specialties at our institution in asymptomatic patients when applying appropriate use criteria and two different perioperative risk models. We reviewed preoperative stress tests for noncardiac surgeries performed at Hershey Medical Center from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Perioperative cardiac risk was estimated using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Arrest risk calculator and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. We analyzed 501 preoperative stress tests meeting the study criteria. When applying appropriate use criteria, we found that 336 of 501 studies (67%) were rarely appropriate. When applying the risk score models, 369 of 501 studies (74%) were determined to be low risk by the RCRI (RCRI score ≤1), and 248 of 361 stress tests (69%) were determined to be low risk by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Arrest risk calculator. Low risk and rarely appropriate preoperative stress testing was common across all ordering specialties reviewed. In conclusion, these findings suggest that preoperative stress testing is broadly overused in asymptomatic patients and that interventions to reduce rarely appropriate and low-risk preoperative stress testing require a multispecialty approach."

            "abstract": "The major determinants of postoperative morbidity and mortality after lung resection are the physiologic and functional statuses of the pulmonary and cardiac systems. In our previous study, serial measurements of right ventricular performance after pulmonary resection demonstrated significant right ventricular dysfunction in the postoperative period. This study evaluates the preoperative measurement of right ventricular ejection fraction as a predictor of postoperative complications. In addition to conventional cardiopulmonary functional tests, right ventricular function was assessed with a thermodilution technique at rest and during exercise in 18 patients before and 3 weeks after lobectomy or pneumonectomy. The patients were grouped according to severity of right ventricular functional defect: right ventricular ejection fraction of at least 45% (group Ia, n = 8), right ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% (group Ib, n = 10), exercise-induced increases in right ventricular ejection fraction (group IIa, n = 8), and exercise-induced decreases in right ventricular ejection fraction (group IIb, n = 10). Postoperative cardiopulmonary morbidity was recorded for two patients (25%) in group Ia, three patients (30%) in group Ib, no patients (0%) in group IIa, and five patients (50%) in group IIb. Postoperative hospital stay was 28.9 +/- 8.5 days in group Ia, 29.9 +/- 20.2 days in group Ib, 19.4 +/- 8.0 days in group IIa, and 37.5 +/- 15.9 days in group IIb (p < 0.05, group IIa vs group IIb). Although resection-induced changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second did not differ significantly between group Ia and group Ib, these values appeared to be increased in groups IIa (not statistically significant) and IIb (significantly, p < 0.05). The measured postoperative values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and vital capacity were significantly higher than the predicted postoperative values (p < 0.05) in group IIa, but not in groups Ia, Ib, and IIb. We conclude that evaluation of right ventricular performance is useful in determining which patients are at increased risk for medical complications after lung resection. Exercise-induced change in right ventricular ejection fraction may be a better indicator of high risk among candidates for pulmonary resection than the absolute value of this parameter."

Recommendations were framed using the approach described by the Health and Science Policy Committee.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The preoperative physiologic assessment should begin with a cardiovascular evaluation and spirometry to measure the FEV(1). If diffuse parenchymal lung disease is evident on radiographic studies or if there is dyspnea on exertion that is clinically out of proportion to the FEV(1), the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) should also be measured. In patients with either an FEV(1) or Dlco < 80% predicted, the likely postoperative pulmonary reserve should be estimated by either the perfusion scan method for pneumonectomy or the anatomic method, based on counting the number of segments to be removed, for lobectomy. An estimated postoperative FEV(1) or Dlco < 40% predicted indicates an increased risk for perioperative complications, including death, from a standard lung cancer resection (lobectomy or greater removal of lung tissue). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to measure maximal oxygen consumption (Vo(2)max) should be performed to further define the perioperative risk of surgery; a Vo(2)max of < 15 mL/kg/min indicates an increased risk of perioperative complications. Alternative types of exercise testing, such as stair climbing, the shuttle walk, and the 6-min walk, should be considered if CPET is not available. Although often not performed in a standardized manner, patients who cannot climb one flight of stairs are expected to have a Vo(2)max of < 10 mL/kg/min. Data on the shuttle walk and 6-min walk are limited, but patients who cannot complete 25 shuttles on two occasions will likely have a Vo(2)max of < 10 mL/kg/min. Desaturation during an exercise test has not clearly been associated with an increased risk for perioperative complications. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) improves survival in selected patients with severe emphysema. Accumulating experience suggests that patients with extremely poor lung function who are deemed inoperable by conventional criteria might tolerate combined LVRS and curative-intent resection of lung cancer with an acceptable mortality rate and good postoperative outcomes. Combining LVRS and lung cancer resection should be considered in patients with a cancer in an area of upper lobe emphysema, an FEV(1) of > 20% predicted, and a Dlco of > 20% predicted.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A careful preoperative physiologic assessment will be useful to identify those patients who are at increased risk with standard lung cancer resection and to enable an informed decision by the patient about the appropriate therapeutic approach to treating their lung cancer.

The data on study characteristics, methodology and outcomes were extracted independently by two observers and checked by two other observers. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We performed random effects meta-analysis to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in two-group comparison and pooled the rates for stress test alone. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and methodological quality of studies using Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The predefined protocol was registered in PROSPERO #CRD42016049212.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From 1807 abstracts, 79 studies were eligible (297,534 patients): 40 had information on 30-day mortality, of which 6 studies compared stress test versus no stress test. The risk of 30-day mortality was not significant in the comparison of stress testing versus none (RR: 0.79, 95% CI = 0.35-1.80) along with weak evidence for heterogeneity. For the studies that evaluated stress testing without a comparison group, the pooled rates are 1.98% (95% CI = 1.25-2.85) with a high heterogeneity. There was evidence of potential publication bias and small study effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite substantial interest and research over the past 40 years to predict 30-day mortality risk among patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, the current body of evidence is insufficient to derive a definitive conclusion as to whether stress testing leads to reduced peri-operative mortality."

Despite the fact that exercise thallium scintigraphy is also dependent on the patient's ability to exercise, using this test in conjunction with ECG-monitored exercise testing may enhance sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive evaluation. Thirty-two patients were subjected to ECG-monitored exercise testing, exercise thallium scintigraphy and coronary angiography. The sensitivity of ECG-monitored exercise testing for detecting coronary artery disease was calculated at 81.8% and the specificity at 87.5%, while the figures for exercise thallium scintigraphy were 73.1% and 33.3% respectively. Using these two methods in combination yielded a predictive accuracy of 90.6%. The only advantage of exercise thallium scintigraphy over exercise ECG appears to be in patients in whom the latter test could not be interpreted or was non-diagnostic."

Modifications were required to prevent the preserved tissue from interfering with prosthetic valve function, to implant an adequate size of valve and to prevent left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Conventional MVR was performed to 51 patients (group 1) and bileaflet preserving MVR was performed to 43 patients (group 2). Mitral anterior leaflet incised from the middle of the leaflet to mitral annulus without chordal injury in group 2 patients. Sutures were placed through the mitral annulus first and then passed from the bottom to the tip of anterior leaflet. Posterior leaflet was also preserved. Prosthetic valve was put down into the mitral annulus and sutures were ligated. Excessive anterior leaflet tissue was attached to left atrial wall.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Cross-clamping time was 45 +/- 5.33 minutes versus 61.32 +/- 4.43 minutes (p = 0.0001) and total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 60.80 +/- 4.44 minutes versus 80.55 +/- 3.65 minutes (p = 0.0001) in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of V'E/V'CO2 slope as preoperative mortality predictor depending on the type of surgery performed. Retrospective analysis was performed on 263 consecutive patients evaluated before surgery for lung cancer. Death within 30 days and serious respiratory complications were considered. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of death. Lobectomy or bilobectomy were performed in 186 patients with 29/186 (15.6%) serious pulmonary complications and 6/186 (3.2%) deaths. Pneumonectomy was performed in 77 patients with 14/77 (18.2%) serious complications and 5/77 (6.5%) deaths. Considering the whole group, the peak oxygen consumption (V'02peak, L/ min; z=-2.66, p<0.008, OR 0.007) and V'E/V'C02 slope (z=2.80, p<0.005, OR 1.14) were independent predictors of mortality whereas in pneumonectomies V'E/V'C02 slope (z=2.34, p<0.02, OR 1.22) was the only independent predictor of mortality. High V'E/V'CO2 slope, age and low V'02peak are predictors of death and severe complications after lung surgery. Before larger resections as pneumonectomies an increased V'E/V'CO2 slope represents the best mortality predictor."

Reduced pulmonary functions and exercise capacity are known as risk factors for complications after esophagectomy. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple field test that can be used to evaluate the functional exercise capacity of patients who undergo thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the preoperative 6MWD with postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer. Records of a total of 111 patients who underwent thoracic surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation from January 2013 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Data of patients who experienced Clavien-Dindo grade II or severer (grade ≥ II) complications were compared with those who experienced grade ≤I complications. The 6MWD was significantly correlated with age, serum albumin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, and hand grip strength. A total of 42 patients experienced grade ≥II. The 6MWD of patients with grade ≥ II complications was significantly shorter than that of those with grade ≤I complications. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, 6MWD ≤ 454 m was a threshold for predicting grade ≥II complications with 71.0% sensitivity and 54.8% specificity. The incidence of grade ≥II complications led to delayed ambulation and longer stays in hospital. In the multiple regression analysis, the preoperative risk factors for incidence of grade ≥II complications included lower levels of preoperative 6MWD and % of the predicted value of forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Our results indicate that the 6MWT is useful to assess preoperative physical status in patients with esophageal cancer."

However, their actual daily activity level was not significantly improved. Six months is a rather short follow-up period and the discrepancy in recovery among different aspects of functioning might be explained by this limited duration of follow-up. The objective of the present study was to examine the recovery of different aspects of physical functioning at a follow-up nearly 4 years after THA/TKA. Special attention was given to the actual daily activity level, and whether it had increased 4 years after THA/TKA compared to 6 months postoperatively. Seventy-seven (35 hip, 42 knee) patients who were measured preoperatively and postoperatively (6 months after surgery) in a previous study were invited to participate; 44 patients (23 hip, 21 knee) agreed to participate. The 4-year follow-up data were compared with the preoperative and 6-month postoperative data. The daily activity level after 4 years was found to be actually lower than at 6 months post-surgery (128 min vs. 138 min activity per 24h; p-value 0.48). However, the patients continued to improve in other aspects of physical functioning. In conclusion, 4-year post-surgery patients continued to improve on perceived physical functioning, capacity, and performance of activities in daily life.

Methods The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date review of gender-related differences in the epidemiology, specific risk factors, outcome, and screening and prevention programmes in aortic aneurysms. Results Female patients affected by aortic disease still have worse outcomes and higher early and late mortality than men. It is difficult to plan new specific strategies to improve outcomes in women undergoing major aortic surgery, given that the true explanations for their poorer outcomes are as yet not clearly identified. Some authors recommend further investigation of hormonal or molecular explanations for the sex differences in aortic disease. Others stress the need for quality improvement projects to quantify the preoperative risk in high-risk populations using non-invasive tests such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Conclusions The treatment of patients classified as high risk could thus be optimised before surgery becomes necessary by means of numerous strategies, such as the administration of high-dose statin therapy, antiplatelet treatment, optimal control of hypertension, lifestyle improvement with smoking cessation, weight loss and careful control of diabetes. Future efforts are needed to understand better the gender differences in the diagnosis, management and outcome of aortic aneurysm disease, and for appropriate and modern management of female patients."

Postoperatively, prehabilitation may improve functional capacity, determined with the 6-minute walk test at four and eight weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.81 to 65.85; 2 studies; n = 131; and MD 26.58, 95% CI -8.88 to 62.04; 2 studies; n = 140); however, the certainty of evidence is low and very low, respectively, due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. After prehabilitation, the functional capacity before surgery improved, with a clinically relevant mean difference of 24.91 metres (95% CI 11.24 to 38.57; 3 studies; n = 225). The certainty of evidence was moderate due to downgrading for serious risk of bias. Prehabilitation may also result in fewer complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29; 3 studies; n = 250) and fewer emergency department visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was low due to downgrading for serious risk of bias and imprecision. On the other hand, prehabilitation may also result in a higher re-admission rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.65; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was again low due to downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. The effect on VO2peak, handgrip strength, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, health-related quality of life, return to normal activities, safety of the programme, and compliance rate could not be analysed quantitatively due to missing or insufficient data. The included studies did not report a difference between groups for health-related quality of life and length of hospital stay. Data on remaining outcomes were not reported or were reported inadequately in the included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity, determined with the 6-minute walk test both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complication rates and the number of emergency department visits postoperatively may also diminish due to a prehabilitation programme, while the number of re-admissions may be higher in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low, due to downgrading for serious risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. In addition, only three heterogeneous studies were included in this review. Therefore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Numerous relevant RCTs are ongoing and will be included in a future update of this review."

            "abstract": "Markedly increased pulmonary blood flow because of a relevant atrial septal defect (ASD) leads to impaired cardiopulmonary function during maximum exercise in adults. No comparative preoperative and postoperative data are available on the short-term effects of shunt closure on cardiorespiratory function at peak exercise in children. Pulmonary function testing at rest and cardiopulmonary exercise testing together with haemodynamic assessment was done prospectively in children with an ASD preoperatively and again after full recovery at 3-4 mo postoperatively and compared with a matched normal population. Sixteen children, aged 6.8-16.1 y, with a defect of 8-23 mm (median 15 mm) and a pulmonary/systemic flow ratio of 1.5-3.5 (median 2.2) were tested and compared with 15 healthy children. Preoperatively, baseline pulmonary function parameters and exercise capacity were no different from normals. At peak exercise, patients with a shunt had increased pulmonary resistance, especially of the distal airways (p = 0.04), with a significantly larger proportion of children having a paradoxical increase in total airway resistance during exercise (p < 0.05). Maximum serum lactate at peak exercise was elevated (p < 0.05) in patients. In patients, maximum oxygen uptake was impaired (p = 0.03) and remained so at repeat evaluation postoperatively. The same observation was made for chronotropic response to exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Cardiopulmonary exercise parameters in patients with ASD differed only slightly from those in normal children. The most important deviations were a lower maximum oxygen uptake and an increase in airway resistance at maximum exercise."

When disabling pain and radiculopathy persists after adequate course of rehabilitation and imaging confirms compressive pathology, surgical decompression is indicated. Prehabilitation aiming to augment functional capacity pre-surgery may improve physical function and activity levels pre and post-surgery. This study aims to evaluate the effect and dose-response of pre-surgery physiotherapy on quadriceps femoris strength and walking ability in patients with degenerative lumbar spine disorders compared to waiting-list controls and their association with postoperative physical activity level.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      In this single blinded, 2-arm randomised controlled trial, 197 patients were consecutively recruited.

It allows ankle dorsiflexion by active peroneal nerve stimulation during the swing phase of gait. In this paper the authors report the outcome of the first prospective study on a large number of patients with stroke-related drop foot. METHODS Twenty-seven patients who experienced a stroke and with persisting spastic leg paresis received an implantable ActiGait drop foot stimulator for restoration of ankle movement after successful surface test stimulation. After 3 to 5 weeks, the stimulator was activated, and gait speed, gait endurance, and activation time of the system were evaluated and compared with preoperative gait tests. In addition, patient satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. RESULTS Postoperative gait speed significantly improved from 33.9 seconds per 20 meters to 17.9 seconds per 20 meters (p < 0.0001), gait endurance from 196 meters in 6 minutes to 401 meters in 6 minutes (p < 0.0001), and activation time from 20.5 seconds to 10.6 seconds on average (p < 0.0001). In 2 patients with nerve injury, surgical repositioning of the electrode cuff became necessary. One patient showed a delayed wound healing, and in another patient the system had to be removed because of a wound infection. Marked improvement in mobility, social participation, and quality of life was confirmed by 89% to 96% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The ActiGait implantable drop foot stimulator improves gait speed, endurance, and quality of life in patients with stroke-related drop foot. Regarding gait speed, the ActiGait system appears to be advantageous compared with foot orthosis or surface stimulation devices. Randomized trials with more patients and longer observation periods are needed to prove the long-term benefit of this device."

Preoperative data were collected for patients operated on between January 1985 and June 1994 and examined with respect to effect on long-term survival.

Ninety-day mortality was associated with low right ventricular ejection fraction, a blunted hemodynamic response to exercise testing, and requirement for an intraaortic balloon pump at the time of the operation. Using a stepwise Cox regression method of multivariable survival analysis (n = 101), we determined that atrial fibrillation, New York Heart Association class IV, high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and balloon pump use were independent variables simultaneously associated with poor overall survival. When metabolic testing variables were added to this model, peak oxygen consumption eliminated both pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and functional class from the model, albeit with fewer (n = 74) patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is an evolving therapy for symptomatic congestive heart failure, the results of which may be enhanced by intelligent, risk-sensitive patient selection."

It has been observed that despite near-normal lung function, exercise intolerance and reductions in quality of life (QOL) often persist up to years after transplantation. Several modifiable pre- and posttransplant factors are known to contribute to these persisting impairments. Physiological changes associated with severe and chronic lung disease, limb muscle dysfunction, inactivity/deconditioning, and nutritional depletion can affect exercise capacity and physical functioning in candidates for lung transplantation. After transplantation, extended hospital and intensive care unit stay, prolonged sedentary time, persisting inactivity, immunosuppressant medications and episodes of organ rejection may all impact lung recipients' recovery. Available evidence will be reviewed and content will be proposed (both evidence and experience based) for rehabilitation interventions prior to transplantation, during hospitalization after transplantation, and in both the immediate (≤12 months after hospital discharge) and long-term (>12 months after hospital discharge) posttransplant phase. Outpatient rehabilitation programs including supervised exercise training have been shown to be effective in improving limb muscle dysfunction, exercise capacity, and QOL both before and after transplantation if offered appropriately. Unmet research needs included the absence of sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials measuring the effects of rehabilitation interventions on crucial long-term outcomes such as sustained improvements in QOL, participation in daily activity, survival, incidence of morbidities and cost-effectiveness. Remotely monitored (telehealth) home-based exercise or pedometer-based walking interventions might be interesting alternatives to supervised outpatient rehabilitation interventions in the long-term posttransplant phase and warrant further investigation."

Eighteen percent of patients were considered frail and more than 50% completed the 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test at a higher time than the reference values adjusted to age and sex. Advanced age, ASA III/IV, sedentarism, frailty and a high level of anxiety and depression were related to a lower functional capacity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The surgical population of our area has a low functional reserve and a high index of sedentary lifestyle and frailty, predictors of postoperative morbidity. It is mandatory to implement preoperative measures to identify population at risk and prehabilitation programmes, considered highly promising preventive interventions towards improving surgical outcome."

            "abstract": "The effects of coronary artery bypass (CAB) by comparison with medical treatment were evaluated on exercise tolerance in 68 patients with stable angina on effort, who underwent coronary and left ventricular cineangiography. Stress tests were performed by bicycle ergometer before medical and surgical treatment, and 6 and 12 months thereafter. Thirty-five patients (31 males and 4 females; 7 with one 70% stenosed vessel, 12 with two, 16 with three) underwent CAB; 33 (30 males and 3 females; 9 with one 70% stenosed vessel, 11 with two, 13 with three), having refused CAB, only underwent medical treatment. Both groups were given long-acting oral nitrates, none received digitalis and/or propranolol; antiarrhythmic drugs were only administered in 5% of medical and 4% of surgical patients. Both groups at 6 and 12 months follow-up showed a significant improvement in exercise tolerance. Surgical patients showed a significant increase in exercise tolerance with lower angina incidence (from the preoperative 100% to 26% and 22%, respectively), higher work load (P < .001), and a significant reduction of S-T segment depression (P < .001). Medical treatment induced an increase of exercise tolerance; angina on effort decreased (from 100% to 74% and 72%, respectively) with higher work load, and a significant reduction of S T depression (in both cases P < .001). Comparing the data of the two groups, we observed that surgical patients showed higher exercise tolerance (P < .01), lower S-T depression (P < .001) and angina incidence. Our results suggest that surgical treatment is able to improve exercise tolerance more remarkably than medical treatment."

All patients underwent preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) using FDG and Rb-82 before and after dipyridamole stress; the extent of viable myocardium by PET was defined by the number of segments with metabolism-perfusion mismatch or ischemia. Dobutamine echocardiography (DbE) was performed in 47 patients; viability was defined by augmentation at low dose or the development of new or worsening wall motion abnormalities. Functional class, exercise testing and a QOL score (Nottingham Health Profile) were obtained at baseline and follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients had wall motion abnormalities in 83+/-18% of LV segments. A mismatch pattern was identified in 12+/-15% of LV segments, and PET evidence of viability was detected in 30+/-21% of the LV. Viability was reported in 43+/-18% of the LV by DbE. The difference between pre- and postoperative exercise capacity ranged from a reduction of 2.8 to an augmentation of 5.2 METS. The degree of improvement of exercise capacity correlated with the extent of viability by PET (r = 0.54, p = 0.0001) but not the extent of viable myocardium by DbE (r = 0.02, p = 0.92). The area under the ROC curve for PET (0.76) exceeded that for DbE (0.66). In a multiple linear regression, the extent of viability by PET and nitrate use were the only independent predictors of improvement of exercise capacity (model r = 0.63, p = 0.0001). Change in Functional Class correlated weakly with the change in exercise capacity (r = 0.25), extent of viable myocardium by PET (r = 0.23) and extent of viability by DbE (r = 0.31). Four components of the quality of life score (energy, pain, emotion and mobility status) significantly improved over follow-up, but no correlations could be identified between quality of life scores and the results of preoperative testing or changes in exercise capacity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In patients with LV dysfunction, improvement of exercise capacity correlates with the extent of viable myocardium.

            "abstract": "Patients undergoing major surgery are predisposed to a decrease in functional capacity as a response to surgical stress that can delay post-operative recovery. A prehabilitation program consists of patient preparation strategies before surgery, and include pre-operative measures to improve functional capacity and enhance post-operative recovery. Multimodal prehabilitation may include exercise, nutritional counseling, psychological support, and optimization of underlying medical conditions, as well as cessation of unfavorable health behaviors such as smoking and drinking. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for prehabilitation, and the existent studies are heterogeneous; however, multimodal approaches are likely to have a greater impact on functional outcomes than single management programs. We have reviewed the literature on prehabilitation in general, and in gynecologic surgery in particular, to identify tools to establish an optimal prehabilitation program within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol for gynecologic oncology patients. We suggest a safe, reproducible, functional, and easy-to-apply multimodal prehabilitation program for gynecologic oncology practice based on patient-tailored pre-operative medical optimization, physical training, nutritional counseling, and psychological support. The analysis of the prehabilitation program implementation in an ERAS protocol should undergo further research in order to test the efficacy on surgical outcome and recovery after surgery."

Nevertheless, stair climbing is not performed in many centres because of structural issues or patient safety concerns. We hypothesized that comparable exercise can be obtained on an ergometric bicycle in a safer environment where any adverse event can be treated. We tried to correlate the amount of exercise performed by stair climbing and by using an ergometric bicycle in a series of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evaluated prospectively.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-four consecutive patients with NSCLC who were scheduled for lung resection were prospectively enrolled to complete two low-technology exercise tests: The first one was stair climbing, and the second was a ramp test on an ergometric bicycle.

The amount of exercise on the stair-climbing test (in watts: Watt 1) was calculated per patient weight, height reached on stairs and time spent. The bicycle test was performed on a Lode Corival ergometer with automatic calculation of the total work load (Watt 2). No estimation of VO 2 max was attempted. The bicycle test was conducted in an ad-hoc room fully equipped with oxygen, cardiac and blood pressure and PO 2 monitoring and resuscitation equipment.

Myocardial injury was sustained by 162/1325 (12.2%) patients. Raised preoperative NT pro-BNP was more common when chronotropic incompetence was <0.6 (OR: 1.57 [1.11-2.23]; P=0.011). Chronotropic incompetence was not significantly associated with myocardial injury (OR: 1.05 [0.74-1.50]; P=0.78), independent of rate-limiting therapy. HR recovery <12 beats min-1 decrease after exercise was associated with myocardial injury in the presence (OR: 1.62 [1.05-2.51]; P=0.03) or absence (OR: 1.60 [1.06-2.39]; P=0.02) of chronotropic incompetence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Chronotropic incompetence is common in surgical patients. In contrast to parasympathetic dysfunction which was associated with myocardial injury, preoperative chronotropic incompetence (suggestive of sympathetic dysfunction) was not associated with postoperative myocardial injury."

Outcome measures included mobility (Life Space Assessment; LSA), self-efficacy for walking tasks (modified Gait Efficacy Scale; mGES), and physical (quadriceps strength and the Timed Up and Go; TUG test) and knee function (the Knee Society Score questionnaire). As a result, a total of 59 patients (mean age: 71.7 years; range: 58-79 years) had completed all postoperative assessments. Compared with preoperative values, patients showed decreased LSA and mGES scores at 1 month postoperatively. We found improvements in those scores from the 1-month to the 3- and 6-month assessment; however, there was no difference in the LSA and mGES scores between the preoperative and 6-month assessment. We also found improvements in quadriceps strength, the TUG score, the Knee Society Score, and pain scores from the preoperative to the 6-month assessment. Additionally, at 6 months postoperatively, the mGES and TUG scores significantly affected mobility. Our results suggest that mobility at 6 months after TKA is similar to preoperative level and self-efficacy for walking tasks and functional ability are important factors in improving mobility after TKA."

The four patients with severe deterioration in the graft function were re-transplanted with a good clinical result in three of them, the fourth dying in the immediate post-operative period. We conclude that single lung transplant represents an effective treatment both in the short and medium term in patients with chronic airflow obstruction."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is considered the leading outcome measure for patients with osteoarthritis of the lower extremity, recent work has challenged its factorial validity and the physical function subscale's ability to detect valid change when pain and function display different profiles of change. This study examined the etiology of the WOMAC's physical function subscale's limited ability to detect change in the presence of discordant changes for pain and function. We hypothesized that the duplication of some items on the WOMAC's pain and function subscales contributed to this shortcoming.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two eight-item physical function scales were abstracted from the WOMAC's 17-item physical function subscale: one contained activities and themes that were duplicated on the pain subscale (SIMILAR-8); the other version avoided overlapping activities (DISSIMILAR-8). Factorial validity of the shortened measures was assessed on 310 patients awaiting hip or knee arthroplasty. The shortened measures' abilities to detect change were examined on a sample of 104 patients following primary hip or knee arthroplasty. The WOMAC and three performance measures that included activity specific pain assessments--40 m walk test, stair test, and timed-up-and-go test--were administered preoperatively, within 16 days of hip or knee arthroplasty, and at an interval of greater than 20 days following the first post-surgical assessment. Standardized response means were used to quantify change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The SIMILAR-8 did not demonstrate factorial validity; however, the factorial structure of the DISSIMILAR-8 was supported. The time to complete the performance measures more than doubled between the preoperative and first postoperative assessments supporting the theory that lower extremity functional status diminished over this interval. The DISSIMILAR-8 detected this deterioration in functional status; however, no significant change was noted for the SIMILAR-8. The WOMAC pain scale demonstrated a slight reduction in pain and the performance specific pain measures did not reflect a change in pain. All measures showed substantial improvement over the second assessment interval.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings support the hypothesis that activity overlap on the pain and function subscales plays a causal role in limiting the WOMAC physical function subscale's ability to detect change."

            "abstract": "Twenty-four patients who had undegone mitral valve surgery for pure non-rheumatic mitral regurgitation were studied non-invasively six months to six years postoperatively. The long-term results of operation were assessed on the basis of clinical history, echocardiography, and treadmill stress testing using a points scoring system. The score so obtained was used to divide the patients into those with a good response to surgery (group 1) and those responding poorly (group 2). The effects on the long-term surgical outcome of several intraoperative and preoperative factors were then analysed both together and separately. A short symptomatic history (less than 1 year), a normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (less than or equal to 100 ml per m2), and a large post-ectopic potentiation of KV max (greater than 50 s-1) were found to be favourable prognostic factors when analysed independently. An angiographic ejection fraction less than 0.5 was uniformly associated with a poor outcome, and 71 per cent of patients in atrial fibrillation at the time of operation also responded badly. In those patients with good long-term function, cold potassium cardioplegia was more commonly used than intermittent aortic cross clamping as the means of intraoperative myocardial preservation, though this difference did not reach conventional significance. A standard analysis of variance allowed assessment of length of history, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, and type of valve prosthesis simultaneously. This indicated that both length of history and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index were highly significant prognostic factors. The use of a Björk-Shiley as opposed to a Starr-Edwards prosthesis also emerged as significantly favouring a good long-term result. The state of the left ventricular myocardium before operation and the type of valve prosthesis used were thus shown to be the prime determinants of surgical outcome in these patients. The optimum time for operation was shown to be within one year of the onset of symptoms, and before the left left ventricular end-diastolic volume index exceeds 100 ml per m2, or the ejection fraction falls to less than 0.5. At such a time, irreversible changes in myocardial function sufficient to negate the beneficial effects of mitral valve surgery have not yet occurred."

BNP was measured pre- and post-operatively (immediately, day 1) in 18 children undergoing corrective repair with concurrent echocardiography (pre-, post-op day 1) to assess right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction, restrictive physiology, wall motion and pulmonary regurgitation (PR). In the first 24 h postoperatively, BNP rose acutely in all patients (mean 34.9 vs 144.4 vs 716.9 pg/ml at pre-op, days 0 and 1; P < 0.001). Immediate postoperative BNP correlated with preoperative haematocrit (rho = 0.52, P = 0.03) and inversely with preoperative oxygen saturation (rho = -0.63, P = 0.007). All patients showed reduced RV systolic function and abnormal wall motion with at least moderate PR in six patients (33.3%) and restrictive physiology in four (24%). Subsequent BNP expression (post-op day 1) correlated with a low RV fractional area change (rho = -0.51, P = 0.04), high oxygen extraction ratio (rho = 0.56, P = 0.02) and high central venous pressure (rho = 0.79, P < 0.001). The LV function and wall motion remained preserved in all patients. The mechanism of BNP expression is likely to be multi-factorial in the presence of a complex postoperative RV physiology in tetralogy of Fallot. An acute BNP response in the early postoperative period reflects an important physiological role and may be used as an adjunct biomarker to assess the RV function."

Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative knee extensor strength (standardized β = 0.35, P < .01) and first postoperative walking day (standardized β = -0.22, P = .04) were independently associated with the postoperative %6MWD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These results suggest that maintaining preoperative muscle strength and allowing for early postoperative mobilization might help to enhance the recovery of physical function and facilitate the patient's social reintegration after LDLT."

            "abstract": "Orthopedic surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis entails anxiety and severe postoperative pain. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate an intervention for adolescent post-spinal fusion pain management in patients from a tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada. Participants were adolescents and young adults ages 11 to 20 years undergoing spinal fusion. Participants were randomized to standard care or standard care with adjunct intervention. The intervention consisted of a DVD with information and guided imagery/relaxation exercises to practice at least three times a week at home. A nurse screened the DVD with the patient preoperatively and at discharge (T1) and telephoned 2 weeks post-discharge (T2) to reinforce the technique. Both groups completed questionnaires at T1, T2, and T3 (1-month postoperative follow-up). Outcome measures included pain intensity, anxiety, coping mechanisms, and daily activities. From March 2010 to June 2011, we enrolled 40 of 45 eligible participants (n = 20 per group), average age 15 ± 2.1 years, 7 participants were male. Compared with the control group, the experimental group experienced significantly less overall pain at all time points, with moderate to large effect sizes at T2, T3 (p ≤ .007). Worst pain in 24 hours was moderately decreased at T2 (p = .01). State-trait anxiety remained high. On a 10-point scale, a median 2.5-point benefit was seen in eating and sleeping (Mann-Whitney test, p = .002), and 2 points in walking (Mann-Whitney test, p = .003). Coping strategies showed no significant differences. Addition of a guided imagery and relaxation exercise DVD for home use was more effective than standard care alone for postoperative pain. Our nonpharmacologic adjunct looks promising. Larger sample size and longer (6-9 months) follow-up will permit refinement."

            "abstract": "There is a consistent relationship between physical activity, physical fitness, and health across almost all clinical contexts, including the perioperative setting. Physiological measurements obtained during physical exercise may be used to infer the risk of adverse outcome after major surgery. In particular, data obtained from perioperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing have an expanding role in perioperative care. Such information may be used to inform a variety of changes in clinical practice, including interventions that may reduce the risk of perioperative adverse events. Specifically, for patients undergoing major cancer surgery there is a complex interplay between different cancer treatments, including neoadjuvant therapies (chemo- and chemo- plus radiotherapy), surgery, and physical fitness, and the modulation of these relationships by perioperative exercise interventions. Preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides an objective evaluation of physical fitness and has been used to provide an individualized risk profile in order to guide collaborative decision-making, inform the consent process, characterize and optimize co-morbidities, and to triage patients to perioperative care. Furthermore, studies evaluating exercise interventions aimed at increasing preoperative exercise capacity have established that training improves physical fitness. However, to date, this literature is largely composed of feasibility and pilot studies with small sample sizes, which are in general underpowered to assess clinical outcomes. Adequately powered prospective multicentre studies are needed to characterize the most effective means of improving patient fitness before surgery and to evaluate the impact of such improvements on surgical and disease-specific (e.g. cancer) outcomes."

Exercise training consisted of 5 endurance cycle ergometry sessions per week at intensities varying from 60% to 100% of baseline peak oxygen consumption (VO(2 peak)). Participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-minute walk (6 MW), and pulmonary function testing at baseline, immediately before, and 30 days after surgical resection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five patients were deemed ineligible before surgical resection and were removed from the analysis.

Bacterial sepsis represented the commonest postoperative complications (30%), which was attributed to peritonitis, pneumonia, and catheter-related infections. Preoperative FeNO and peak VO2 values were lower in patients with postoperative sepsis. Patients with sepsis required higher needs for mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Inverse correlation was found between logarithmically FeNO-transformed data and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (r = -0.348; P = 0.018). Multivariate analyses using bootstrap sampling method indicated that odds of sepsis were associated with lower values of peak exercise VO2 [OR = 0.790 (0.592; 0.925)] and reduced log(FeNo) [OR = 0.027 (0.001; 0.451)], but not with higher MELD scores [OR = 1.141 (0.970; 1.486)].

However, PVO2 < 20 ml/min/kg was found in 70 per cent of patients who had complications compared with 50 per cent of those who had not. Also 4 patients considered medically unfit for surgery all had PVO2 < 20 ml/min/kg. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of PVO2 may be helpful in identifying patients more at risk of post-operative complications but should not be used in isolation without through clinical assessment."

            "abstract": "To establish the indications for aortocoronary bypass surgery on coronary artery lesions caused by Kawasaki disease, we analyzed surgical outcome in 26 patients. Ages at operation ranged from 1 to 17 years. All patients were followed up with selective coronary arteriography, thallium myocardial imaging, electrocardiography at rest, and the Master \"two-step\" and treadmill exercise tests for coronary insufficiency. Surgical outcome was analyzed by comparing results of patient examinations made preoperatively with those both at 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. One month after the operation, 25 (93%) of 27 internal mammary artery grafts and 6 (86%) of 7 saphenous vein grafts were patent; 1 year after the operation, 19 (86%) of 22 internal mammary artery grafts and 6 (67%) of 9 saphenous vein grafts were patent. By comparing the preoperative findings of myocardial imaging with those obtained 1 month after surgery, we found that 17 (68%) of 25 showed improvement and 3 (12%) of 25 were worse. At 1 year, 6 (29%) of 21 showed further improvement than at 1 month, suggesting increased development of the coronary bed after internal mammary artery graft anastomosis. Thus an internal mammary artery graft has proved to be satisfactory in the management of children with coronary artery obstruction caused by Kawasaki disease; it appears that both the quality of life and the life expectancy of those patients can be improved by the surgery."

Thereafter the patients had to undergo treadmill tests (painfree and maximal walking distance). Compared to healthy volunteers preoperative blood-flow was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in the common femoral artery and in the superficial femoral artery. Postoperatively the blood-flow increased significantly (p < 0.001) in patients with an open bypass. This increase could still be demonstrated up to one year after bypass surgery. Surprisingly, a significant (p < 0.01) postoperative rise in blood-flow was also observed in the non-operated leg. Doppler pressure, tcPO2-values (calf) in the operated leg and walking distance increased significantly (p < 0.001). The MAVISR as a noninvasive procedure allows to check the further development of the bypass-function independently of subjective influences, because quantitative changes in blood-flow are documented."

Valve repair was possible in all but three patients who had to undergo valvular replacement. Myotomy was associated in 18 cases (28 p. 100). The mean systolic pressure gradient was 79,9 mmHg (+/- 17,8); there was associated aortic regurgitation in 21 patients but this was minimal except in one case. Twenty children (31 p. 100) had symptoms on effort and the basal ECG showed ST-T wave changes in the left precordial leads in 30 cases (47 p. 100). Several preoperative exercise ECGs were performed in 29 patients without ST-T changes on the resting ECG. The exercise ECG was positive in 15 patients, providing one of the arguments for surgery; a poor blood pressure response to exercise was observed in 12 patients with a negative test. Out of the 28 patients with a positive preoperative exercise ECG, 7 (25 p. 100) went on having a positive result after surgery (p less than 0,05). The maximal heart rate was not significantly higher after surgery but the total work was significantly greater (p less than 0,01) and the increase in systolic blood pressure was even more significant (p less than 0,001). Out of 14 patients undergoing repeat catheterisation for a continuing positive exercise ECG or for ST-T wave changes on the resting ECG, there were 6 residual severe stenoses, 3 severe aortic regurgitations, 3 hypertrophic cardiomyopathies which were obstructive in 2 cases. The exercise ECG is a means of appreciating the consequences of the stenosis which are the cause of the complications (myocardial ischemia and poor blood pressure adaptation). This justifies its use in assessing the surgical indications and for the follow-up of the surgical result. A persistantly positive exercise ECG and continuing ST-T wave changes on the resting ECG are signs of a poor surgical result and hemodynamic revaluation should be considered; besides severe postoperative aortic regurgitation, residual or recurrent stenosis and, above all, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, obstructive or not, are the main causes of poor postoperative results."

Twenty-nine patients (38.6%) had electrocardiographic evidence (ECG) of old myocardial infarction (MI) and only six (8%) had a normal resting ECG. Preoperative exercise testing was done in 22 of the 75 patients. The stress test was positive in all patients, 17 (77%) of whom had greater than 2 mm ST depression; 90.6% (68/75) had significant right coronary artery disease. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted preoperatively in only four patients (5%) and was required in two additional patients postoperatively. The IABP was inserted preoperatively in four patients because of medically refractory angina and not on the basis of coronary anatomy alone. An average of three grafts per patient were inserted. There were three (4%) postoperative myocardial infarctions and two (2.6%) deaths. During the follow-up period, which comprised 105 patient-years, there was one myocardial infarction and one death. These data indicate that successful surgical treatment of left main coronary artery disease can be achieved with low mortality and that routine preoperative insertion of IABP is unnecessary."

Quantitative data were collected to determine feasibility targets; rates of recruitment, adherence and adverse events, including 6minute walking distance (6MWD) test and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). Qualitative interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of patients to capture their experiences of the study and the intervention. The authors recruited 23 patients who attended a mean percentage of 75% scheduled exercise sessions. However, retention rates were limited, with only 14/23 (62%) completing the programme. In these patients, the 6MWD increased from a mean of 346 to 451m (i.e. by 105m, 95% CI 62 to 148m) with no serious adverse events. Whist participants found the exercise programme acceptable and reported improvement in their physical fitness and overall mental health and wellbeing prior to ASCT, the study identified challenges in hospital attendance for the prehabilitation schedule whilst receiving induction or re-induction chemotherapy.

            "title": "Pre-Conditioning and Post-Operative Photobiomodulation Therapy by a Novel Light Patch System for Knee Arthroplasty: A Protocol for a Phase 1 Study.",
            "abstract": "Objective: To determine the potential efficacy and feasibility of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) before and after knee arthroplasty (KA) surgery. Background: Total knee replacements (total knee arthroplasty, TKA) are one of the most common and successful surgical interventions for osteoarthritis. Up to 20,000 knee replacement arthroplasties are performed in Australia annually. Although TKA aims to restore knee alignment and relieve pain in the long term, the initial post-operative period is difficult and rehabilitation is often hindered by persistent pain and swelling. A promising therapeutic approach, PBMT using a novel self-adhesive light patch system, may be feasible for reducing post-operative pain and swelling and aiding recovery. Materials and methods: This is an interventional clinical feasibility study protocol. Patients from a surgical waitlist will be invited to take part. PBMT will be applied for 30 min daily for 7 days pre-operatively using a novel light patch system (CareWear®) with both 450 nm (6.75 mW/cm2) and 640 nm (2.25 mW/cm2) microdiodes. Post-operative treatment will utilize the same device second daily for 1 week after removal of compression bandages. Results: Outcomes will be evaluated at seven time points: baseline at week 1 pre-operatively, 1 day before surgery, day 4 after surgery, weekly for a further 2 weeks, and fortnightly until 6 weeks post-hospital discharge. Outcome measures include the following: Numeric Pain Rating Scale, stair climb test, 30-sec chair stand test, timed up and go test, 40-m fast-paced walk test, modified Iowa Level of Assistance Scale, muscle strength, knee range of motion, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Lower Limb Functional Index. Conclusions: This study will provide an assessment of feasibility of using PBMT applied using a novel light patch system for management of pain symptoms and swelling, and aiding recovery of patients undergoing TKA. The results of this feasibility study will contribute to planning of the design and methods of a large clinical trial."

            "abstract": "Myocardial thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy or radionuclide angiography performed in conjunction with exercise stress testing can provide clinically useful information regarding the functional significance of underlying coronary artery stenoses in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Knowledge of type, location, and extent of myocardial 201Tl perfusion abnormalities or the severity of exercise-induced global and regional dysfunction has prognostic value. Risk stratification can be undertaken with either radionuclide technique by consideration of the magnitude of the ischemic response and may assist in the selection of patients for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In patients with coronary artery disease, delayed 201Tl redistribution observed on exercise or dipyridamole 201Tl scintigraphy, particularly when present in multiple vascular regions and associated with increased lung 201Tl uptake, has been shown to be predictive of an adverse outcome, whereas patients with chest pain and a normal exercise 201Tl scintigram have a good prognosis with medical treatment. Similarly, a marked fall in the radionuclide ejection fraction from rest to exercise has been found to correlate with high-risk anatomic disease. In one published nonrandomized study, patients with coronary artery disease who demonstrated an abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise preoperatively had a better survival with CABG than with medical therapy. Another important application of radionuclide imaging in patients being considered for CABG (particularly those with a depressed resting left ventricular ejection fraction) is the determination of myocardial viability and potential for improved blood flow and enhanced regional function after revascularization. There are certain limitations of exercise 201Tl scintigraphy and radionuclide angiography that can be reduced by improved methods of quantitation of perfusion and function and further development of tomographic imaging approaches."

Ten patients with pacemakers (four VVIR due to slow atrial fibrillation and six DDDR, of which four were due to high-degree atrioventricular block and two to sinus node disease) were upgraded to a biventricular pacing (BVP) system. The median duration of pacing before the upgrade was 5.7 years. Assessments of 6-min walk test, symptom score, brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), and echocardiography were made pre-operatively. After a run-in period of 1 month in BVP following the upgrade, the patients were randomized to a 2-month period in either BVP or right ventricular pacing (RVP), followed by 2 months in the other mode, in a double-blind crossover fashion. After each period, the pre-operative measurements were repeated. After study completion, patients were asked to select their preferred period. The median 6-min walking distance was significantly longer in BVP (400 m) vs. RVP (315 m), P = 0.02. The symptom score was also significantly better in BVP (P = 0.005). Median pro-BNP was significantly lower in BVP than in RVP, 3,030 vs. 5,064 ng/L (P = 0.005). Six patients demanded an early crossover in RVP but none in BVP (P = 0.015), and all patients except one expressed a preference for BVP.

Forty-seven patients who had repairs performed by aortic reimplantation are the subject of this study. The median age at repair was 7.7 months. Before repair, 10 infants (21%) presented in extremis requiring ventilatory and inotropic support, and 38 infants (80%) presented in heart failure.

Guideline algorithms include a cardiological evaluation, a cardiopulmonary assessment to calculate the predicted residual lung function, and identify patients needing exercise testing to complete the evaluation. According to most expert opinion, exercise tests have a very high predictive value of complications. However, since the publication of these guidelines, minimally-invasive surgery, sublobar resections, prehabilitation and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have been developed. Implementation of these techniques and programs is associated with a decrease in postoperative mortality and complications. In addition, the current guidelines and the cut-off values they identified are based on early series of patients, and are designed to select patients before major lung resection (lobectomy-pneumonectomy) performed by thoracotomy. Therefore, after a review of the current guidelines and a brief update on prehabilitation (smoking cessation, exercise training and nutritional aspects), we will discuss the need to redefine functional criteria to select patients who will benefit from lung surgery."

No other significant differences between groups were found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Comparison between groups showed that pulmonary rehabilitation, administered pre and postoperatively, significantly improved exercise capacity at 6 months in patients undergoing lung resection; it also significantly reduced the decrease in exercise tolerance observed 1 month after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical rehabilitation impact:\n        \n      \n      The PUREAIR trial highlights the importance of combined preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation in reducing physical deconditioning in lung cancer patients undergoing surgery. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity at 1 and 6 months after surgery. The PUREAIR trial results increase knowledge on comprehensive rehabilitation's outcomes in the first six months after surgery."

The clinical stage was 0-I in 12 patients, II in 4 patients, III in 16 patients, and IV in 2 patients. Thirty-one patients (91.2 %) underwent open surgery. At the baseline, components of the SF-36 scores significantly correlated with CAT and HADS scores, and the physical status was significantly poorer in patients with COPD than those without. Comparisons between the preoperative and postoperative values revealed significant decreases in 6MWD, hand grip strength, isometric knee extensor muscle strength, and a significant increase in CAT scores but not in HADS scores after surgery.

A systematic review was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, the guidelines of the Physical Therapy Journal and the PRISMA guidelines. No literature pertaining to exercise training during preoperative neoadjuvant treatment was found. Seven studies, investigating the effects of regular exercise during adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer or a mixed population, were identified. A small effect (effect size (ES) 0.4) of endurance/interval training and strength training (ES 0.4) was found in two studies conducted in patients with colorectal and gastrointestinal cancer. In five studies that included a mixed population of cancer patients, interval training resulted in a large improvement (ES 1.5; P≤.05). Endurance training alone was found to increase both lower extremity strength and endurance capacity. The effects of strength training in the lower extremity are moderate, whereas, in the upper extremity, the increase is small.

            "abstract": "A prospective study of patients with neurogenic claudication and lumbar spinal stenosis was undertaken to determine whether measurement of exercise tolerance on the treadmill would be useful in defining baseline functional status and response to surgical treatment. Twenty patients with an average age of 73 years, all of whom had intractable neurogenic claudication and radiographically confirmed severe lumbar spinal stenosis, were studied. Lumbar decompressive laminectomy was performed in all patients. Preoperatively and 2 months postoperatively, quantitative assessment of ambulation was conducted on a treadmill at 0 degree ramp incline at two different speeds: 1.2 mph and the patient's preferred walking speed. The following information was recorded: time to first symptoms, time to severe symptoms, and nature of symptoms (leg pain, back pain, or generalized fatigue). The examination was stopped after 15 minutes or at the onset of severe symptoms. In the preoperative 1.2-mph trial, the mean time to first symptoms was 2.68 minutes (median 1.31) and the mean time to severe symptoms was 5.47 minutes (median 3.42). In the postoperative trial at the same speed, 13 patients (65%) were able to walk symptom free for 15 minutes. The mean time to first symptoms was 11.12 minutes (median 15) and the mean time to severe symptoms was 11.81 minutes (median 15). Similar findings were recorded in the preferred walking-speed trials. There were no complications from the treadmill testing procedure. These findings indicate that exercise stress testing on a treadmill is a safe, easily administered, and quantifiable means of assessing baseline functional status and outcome following laminectomy in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis."

Late-onset RVF was defined as persistent right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) <4.0g/m(2) at any rotation speed and after saline infusion test at 5 weeks after implantation of CF LVAD. Patients with late-onset RVF had significantly impaired exercise tolerance indicated by shorter 6-min walking distance and lower peak VO2, and worsened tricuspid regurgitation, together with enlargement of the RV under CF LVAD treatment (all P<0.05). Univariable analyses demonstrated that preoperative smaller LV diastolic diameter (LVDd) was the risk factor for late-onset RVF with a cutoff value of 64mm calculated by ROC analysis (area under curve, 0.925). In contrast, there was no correlation between preoperative LVDd and postoperative RVSWI in the PF LVAD group, though their preoperative background was worse than that of the CF group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n       In the setting of preoperative small LVDd, CF LVAD may cause late-onset RVF by leftward shift of the interventricular septum.

Potentially curative surgical resection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For operable locally advanced disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) improves survival over surgery alone. However, NAC carries the risk of toxicity and is associated with a decrease in physical fitness, which may in turn influence subsequent clinical outcome. Lower levels of physical fitness are associated with worse outcome following major surgery in general and Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery (UGI) surgery in particular. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides an objective assessment of physical fitness.

There was no statistical difference between both groups regarding hearing thresholds, interpeak wave latencies preoperatively and on first and the sixth months postoperatively. Histopathological evaluation revealed no specific changes. There was a mild local inflammation both in the PLA implanted and control ears. PLA film barrier most likely has no toxic effects on Guinea pig middle ear and does not show any ototoxic side effects."

Based on the large Hb decrease that is seen after total joint surgery, one could expect a decrease in performance as well. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether autologous blood enhanced performance on a bicycle ergometer in patients after total hip arthroplasty.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      Nine patients scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty in an accelerated stay program participated in a preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) program. Weeks before the scheduled surgery, patients donated 4 units of blood and received standard erythropoietin treatment. Physical fitness was assessed during exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. Each patient was matched with three previously tested patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients in both groups were 69.0 years old (range, 66-74 years vs. 61-77 years). None of the patients had relevant cardiovascular abnormalities. On average patients received 3.3 units of blood because 3 units were not transfused. The PABD group showed a Hb decrease of 0.5 g per dL (4%) on the fourth postoperative day versus 4.4 g per dL (31%) in the control group. The decline in power output on Day 4 was significantly less in the PABD group compared with the control group (t test, p = 0.026).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      From this pilot study it can be concluded that correction of the postoperative Hb decrease was associated with a lower decrease in maximum power output, compared to the control group.

            "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate whether the trajectory of the body's Centre of Mass (CoM) is a sensitive and responsive measure of functional compensations in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) performing the Five Times Sit-to-Stand test (5STS). This prospective study included 21 individuals with OA and 21 age- and gender-matched controls. Motion analysis data was collected while participants performed the 5STS, one month prior and one year after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to evaluate (1) differences in the area under the curve (AUC) of CoM trajectories, and (2) the effect of number of sit-to-stand cycles on the AUC. Preoperatively, individuals with OA displayed a larger contralateral shift (p = 0.009) and forward displacement of the CoM (p < 0.004) than controls. Postoperatively, CoM trajectories of OA individuals were not statistically different from controls. However, upon comparison of specific cycles, OA individuals displayed a larger forward displacement during the final cycle. Pain was significantly reduced postoperatively (p = 0.001). The CoM trajectory appears to be a sensitive and responsive measure of functional compensations. The increased contralateral shift of the CoM represents a strategy to reduce pain by unloading the affected knee. Postoperatively, when pain was substantially reduced, OA individuals were comparable to controls. The increased forward CoM displacement characterises a strategy to reduce muscular effort by reducing the required knee extension moment. Postoperatively, OA individuals were comparable to controls in all cycles but the last, possibly suggesting residual muscle weakness."

There have been no studies of exercise or functional capacity in patients who have had tricuspid valve surgery for Ebstein anomaly in adulthood. We aimed to compare exercise capacity before and after tricuspid valve repair or replacement for Ebstein anomaly in adults at Mayo Clinic. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with Ebstein anomaly who underwent tricuspid valve surgery at Mayo Clinic between June 2007 and January 2015. We compared pre- and postoperative echocardiograms, exercise tests, and clinic visits. Tricuspid valve surgery was done for 322 patients, and 32 patients met criteria of native tricuspid valve repair or replacement at age 18 or older and had maximal pre- and postoperative exercise tests. Nineteen patients had valve repair, and 13 had valve replacement. Surgery for Ebstein anomaly resulted in significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular size. There was a significant improvement in NYHA functional class after surgery; however, there was no significant improvement in functional aerobic capacity (FAC), metabolic equivalents (METs), exercise time, or [Formula: see text] after surgery. Patients who had an atrial shunt closed during surgery had improved minimum blood oxygen saturations during exercise, though no improvement in exercise capacity. In our cohort, patients who had tricuspid valve repair or replacement for Ebstein anomaly reported an improvement in functional capacity; however, this did not reflect improvement in measured exercise capacity, despite excellent surgical results by echocardiography."

The aim of this prospective study was therefore to compare different ways to measure preoperative physical activity and to correlate those tests with postoperative physical activity (footsteps). The daily number of footsteps was recorded from preoperative day 5 to postoperative day (POD) 3 in a prospective cohort of colorectal patients using connected wrist bracelets. Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUGT) and 6-Minutes Walking Test (6MWT) were assessed preoperatively. Pearson correlation and multivariable regression were used to study the predictive potential of these tests for postoperative footsteps. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean number of preoperative and postoperative footsteps were 6163 (SD 4274) and 1183 (SD 1828), respectively. There was no correlation between preoperative footsteps and preoperative tests (TUGT and 6MWT) as well as between preoperative tests (TUGT and 6MWT) and postoperative footsteps. Postoperative physical activity was significantly correlated with mean number of preoperative footsteps (Rho = 0.527, IC 95 [0.28;0.709]; p < 0.001). Thereby, preoperative footsteps measurement was the only tool permitting to predict postoperative footsteps.

            "abstract": "Exercise duration during exercise treadmill testing (ETT) predicts long-term outcome among asymptomatic patients with mitral regurgitation. However, the prognostic value of preoperative exercise duration in patients who undergo mitral valve surgery is unknown. We examined findings among 45 prospectively followed (average 9.2 ± 4.3 years) patients (aged 54.8 ± 12.0 years, 45% men) with chronic isolated severe MR who underwent ETT before mitral valve surgery to test the hypotheses that exercise duration predicts long-term postoperative survival and persistent symptoms within 2 years after operation. During follow-up, 11 patients died; of these, 8 had persistent symptoms. Among patients who exercised >7 minutes, average annual postoperative all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks were 0.75% (both endpoints) versus 5.4% and 4.8%, respectively, versus those who exercised ≤7 minutes (p = 0.003 all-cause, p = 0.007 cardiovascular). Exercise duration predicted postoperative deaths (p <.02 all cause, p <.04 cardiovascular) even when analysis was adjusted for preoperative variations in age, gender, medications, history of atrial fibrillation, and peak exercise heart rates. Other ETT, echocardiographic, and clinical variables were not independently associated with these outcomes when exercise duration was considered in the analysis. Preoperative exercise duration also predicted postoperative (New York Heart Association functional class ≥II) symptom persistence (p = 0.012), whereas other ETT, echocardiographic and clinical variables did not (NS, all). In conclusion, among patients who undergo surgery for chronic nonischemic mitral regurgitation, preoperative exercise duration, unlike many commonly used descriptors, is useful for predicting postoperative mortality and symptom persistence. Future research should determine whether interventions to improve exercise tolerance before mitral valve surgery can modify these postoperative outcomes."

METHODS: CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and PubMed/MEDLINE were searched until April 2021 using predefined search strategy and accompanied by manual forward and backwards citation review. Screening of titles, abstracts, full-texts, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and methodologic quality was performed independently by two reviewers. Mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was compared and heterogeneity assessed using Chi Squared Test and I2 statistic. Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review. Interventions prescribed bouts of high-intensity exercise [80-115% peak work rate (WRp)] interspaced with low-intensity (rest-50% WRp) exercise. The meta-analysis included five RCTs reporting peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Preoperative HIIT did not result in significantly higher VO2peak in comparison to usual care or moderate intensity exercise (MD 0.83, 95%CI-0.51-2.17) kg/ml/min, p = 0.12). Studies were insufficiently powered with respect to postoperative complications, but there is no evidence of significant impact. No adverse events occurred and high adherence rates were reported. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate there is insufficient evidence to support HIIT as a method of improving preoperative fitness prior to oncologic resection.

This study investigated the relationship of patient-reported outcomes and progressive cartilage degenerative changes at 3 years after ACLR.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      Higher activity levels, as measured by Marx scores, are significantly correlated with early cartilage degeneration after ACLR.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 35 patients (16 women; mean age, 31.0 ± 7.6 years) with isolated ACLR and without pre-existing arthritis were prospectively enrolled. Patients reported Marx activity scores and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) scores and underwent T1ρ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after ACLR with soft tissue graft (22 autograft). The change in cartilage relaxation times between preoperative and 3-year imaging was used to identify cartilage degeneration, defined as an increase in T1ρ values by 14.3%. Correlation between Marx activity levels, KOOS scores, and T1ρ degeneration was performed with the Spearman rank test. The Fisher exact test was used to test for association between Marx activity score cutoffs and degeneration. The Student t test was used to compare Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) and T1ρ relaxation times. Significance was defined as P < .05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen patients (45.7%) showed evidence of cartilage degeneration at 3 years, most frequently in the medial compartment (n = 12; 34%). Higher Marx activity scores at 3 years correlated with cartilage degeneration in the medial femur (rho = 0.34; P = .045), and medial tibia (rho = 0.43; P = .01). A Marx score of 11 or greater at 3 years was significantly associated with medial compartment degeneration (P = .03), with a positive predictive value of 52.6%. No Marx score cutoff at years 1 or 2 predicted future cartilage degeneration. The KOOS Quality of Life score was inversely correlated with cartilage degeneration (rho = 0.38; P = .02). WORMS did not correlate with degeneration of the medial compartment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Increased activity at 3 years after ACLR was significantly associated with increased risk of medial compartment PTOA. While further research is needed to fully define these relationships, patients may be counseled that return to Marx activity levels of greater than 11 may be associated with a higher risk of medial compartment cartilage degeneration."

This decline can reduce vital and inspiratory capacity and can culminate in restrictive lung diseases that cause atelectasis, reduced diaphragm movement, and respiratory insufficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative ambulatory respiratory muscle training in patients undergoing esophagectomy. The sample consisted of 20 adult patients (14 men [70%] and 6 women [30%]) with a diagnosis of advanced chagasic megaesophagus. A significant increase in maximum inspiratory pressure was observed after inspiratory muscle training when compared with baseline values (from -55.059 ± 18.359 to -76.286 ± 16.786). Preoperative ambulatory inspiratory muscle training was effective in increasing respiratory muscle strength in patients undergoing esophagectomy and contributed to the prevention of postoperative complications."

            "abstract": "The current guidelines from various medical societies provide a good summary of data regarding various preoperative exercise tests in patients prior to non-cardiac surgical interventions. However, there is no consensus among experts on the appropriateness of these methods for identifying risk groups for potential perioperative complications. A large volume of published studies describes the role of preoperative exercise stress testing impact in improving the prediction of potential cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients after non-cardiac surgery. Numerous stress tests are available in clinical practice, and the methods used and the best choice depends on the purpose of the study and the availability of equipment in the hospital. Traditionally, the value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG), or ECG stress test, has been based on the belief that it is beneficial for perioperative cardiac risk prediction. However, in the past two decades, the key role of this method has lost its importance due to the growing trend toward the use of imaging techniques. Moreover, in light of current trends, the six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a helpful tool in preoperative assessment and plays an important role in postoperative rehabilitation. Interestingly, the recent finding showed how 6MWT affects the risk of postoperative complications. Cardiopulmonary testing, as a dynamic clinical tool, determines the cardiorespiratory status of a patient. Various clinical indications for cardiopulmonary exercise testing include evaluation of therapy, stratification of risk factors, diagnosis of disease, and control of physical activity. Stress testing is one of the most practical ways of predicting perioperative risk and managing patients. This test is based on ischemia provoked by pharmacological agents or exercise. There is no established evidence of a significant advantage of pharmacological stress over exercise stress imaging in subjects who are capable enough to be physically active. All of these studies examined a stress test for induced myocardial ischemia. Currently, there are no data on the use of ischaemic stress tests, especially diastolic stress tests, in the assessment of perioperative risk before non-cardiac surgical interventions. We consider it promising and essential to continue research in this direction in patients with coronary heart disease and other categories of cardiac patients, in particular, comorbid and low-symptomatic individuals, before elective high-risk surgical interventions."

Low-technology exercise tests include six minute walking, shuttle walking and stair climbing. Conflicting evidence has been reported regarding 6 minute walking test. This test should not be used to select patients for lung resection. An incremental shuttle walk test is easier to replicate than 6 minute walking test. Most patients achieving 25 shuttles or 400 m have a maximum oxygen consumption measured at cardiopulmonary exercise test greater than 15 l/Kg/min. Although this test tends to underestimate performance at the lower range compared to peak oxygen consumption it can be used a screening test before lung resection. Excluding patients from operation based on this test alone is however not recommended and a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test should be always used in those walking less than 400 m. Stair climbing has been extensively studied in thoracic surgery. Several studies have found that poor performance in this test is indicative of cardiopulmonary complications and mortality after lung resection. In particular, climbing less than 12 m represents very high risk, whereas climbing more than 22 m is associated with a favourable outcome. Recent guidelines recommend referring all patients climbing lower than 22 m to cardiopulmonary exercise test. Stair climbing can be used as a screening test in cases cardiopulmonary exercise test is not readily available. In general, patients climbing more than 22 m can proceed to surgery without further evaluation."

The optimal way to implement prehabilitation programs, such as the optimal forms of prehabilitation, duration, intensity, and methods to improve compliance, remained to be studied. This Prehabilitation for Thoracic Surgery Study will compare the effectiveness of multimodal and aerobic training-only programs in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This randomized pragmatic trial will be conducted in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and include 100 patients who are eligible to undergo VATS lobectomy. Patients will be randomized to a multimodal or aerobic training group. Prehabilitation training guidance will be provided by a multidisciplinary care team. The patients in the multimodal group will perform aerobic exercises, resistance exercises, breathing exercises, psychological improvement strategies, and nutritional supplementation. Meanwhile, the patients in the aerobic group will conduct only aerobic exercises. The interventions will be home-based and supervised by medical providers. The patients will be followed up until 30 days after surgery to investigate whether the multimodal prehabilitation program differs from the aerobic training program in terms of the magnitude of improvement in functional capability pre- to postoperatively. The primary outcome will be the perioperative 6-min walk distance (6MWD). The secondary outcomes will include the postoperative pulmonary functional recovery status, health-related quality of life score, incidence of postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Prehabilitation remains a relatively new approach that is not widely performed by thoracic surgery patients. The existing studies mainly focus on unimodal interventions. While multimodal prehabilitation strategies have been shown to be preferable to unimodal strategies in a few studies, the evidence remains scarce for thoracic surgery patients. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of methods for thoracoscopic lobectomy patients.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04049942 .

Predefined end points for assessing outcome were the occurrence within 24 months of death or aortic valve replacement necessitated by symptoms or by a positive exercise test. Variables independently associated with outcome were used to build a score that was validated in an independent cohort of 107 patients from Belgium. Independent predictors of outcome were female sex, peak aortic-jet velocity, and B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline. Accordingly, the score could be calculated as follows: Score=[peak velocity (m/s) x 2]+(natural logarithm of B-type natriuretic peptide x 1.5)+1.5 (if female sex). Event-free survival after 20 months was 80% for patients within the first score quartile compared with only 7% for the fourth quartile.

This article reviews the current literature on the value and practical applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a tool to evaluate risk and thereby improve the management of the elderly patient undergoing major surgery. There is a consistent association between CPET-derived variables and outcome following major surgery. Furthermore, CPET-derived variables have utility in perioperative risk prediction and identification of patients at high risk of adverse outcome following major surgery. This optimal predictor appears to differ between various surgery types and the incremental benefit of combining CPET with alternative methods of perioperative risk prediction remains poorly defined."

Spirometry can provide cut-off values of acceptable risk in patients that are candidated for abdominal and thoracic surgery. At-risk patients having resective lung surgery should undergo a split lung function study with quantitative lung scanning or computed tomography in order to estimate the function of residual parenchyma after surgery.

Pneumonectomy was performed in 18 patients, lobectomy in 29, and thoracotomy without resection in six. No surgery was attempted in two patients who were considered functionally inoperable. Cardiopulmonary complications developed in 16 patients within 30 days of surgery, including three deaths. The predictions of postoperative function correlated well with the measured values at 3 months. For FEV1, r = 0.51 in pneumonectomy (p less than 0.05) and 0.89 in lobectomy (p less than 0.001). Predicted postoperative FEV1 (FEV1-ppo), diffusing capacity (DLCO), predicted postoperative DLCO (DLCO-ppo) and exercise-induced arterial O2 desaturation (delta SaO2) were predictive of postoperative complications including death and respiratory failure. In patients who underwent pneumonectomy, the best predictor of death was FEV1-ppo. The predictions were enhanced by expressing the value as a percentage of the predicted normal value (% pred) rather than in absolute units. For the entire surgical group a FEV1-ppo greater than or equal to 40% pred was associated with no postoperative mortality (n = 47), whereas a value less than 40% pred was associated with a 50% mortality (n = 6), suggesting that resection is feasible when FEV1-ppo is greater than or equal to 40% pred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Two studies satisfied the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, one qualitative and one quantitative study. The quantitative study reported a beneficial effect of pre-rehabilitation, resulting in post-operative mobility (at least indoor ambulation) in 63% of the included LLA patients. There is a need for prospective clinical studies examining the effect of pre-rehabilitation on post-operative outcomes to be able to confirm or reject our hypothesis. Although the hypothesis seems plausible, evidence is lacking to support our hypothesis that pre-operative rehabilitation will improve post-operative outcomes in patients with LLA. The qualitative study indicated that integrating pre-rehabilitation in the care for LLA patients seems to be limited to a selected group of dysvascular patients, but at this stage cannot be advised based on current evidence even in this subgroup. Further research is needed to clarify whether such an intervention prior to amputation would be a useful and effective tool for optimizing post-operative outcomes in LLA patients."

The severity of the COPD and the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity can determine the perioperative anesthetic risk; therefore they have to be assessed by a thorough preoperative evaluation in order to give the rationale on which to decide for optimum anesthetic management.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Aim of the study was to assess the predictive applicability of exhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) in smoking surgical population with COPD, on the basis of morbidity and mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, observational study was undertaken in 70 smoking patients diagnosed with COPD scheduled for laparotomy surgery under general anesthesia COPD was evaluated with the GOLD Classification of Air Flow Limitation, the Modified MRC Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC), the BODE Index score and the 6 Minutes Walk Distance (6MWD) using spirometry parameters. All patients were observed for presenting perioperative and postoperative respiratory complications. A cut off value of 19 ppb was determined for fractional exhaled nitric oxide measured at expiratory flow of 50 mL/s (FENO50) to differentiate patients poor prognosis from those with favorable outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients with severe COPD had high BODE index score as well as FENO50. Elevated FENO50 is significantly related to multiple complications (p = 0.004) and postoperative cough (p < 0.001). Patients from the high FENO50 group that were not treated with steroids had a statistically significant higher incidence of extra hospital care need (p < 0.001). Increased FENO50 and ABCD classification are both related with the presentation of multiple complications (Odds ratio = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.7, p = 0.028 for ABCD and Odds ratio = 6.39, 95% CI 1.33 to 30.5, p = 0.020 for FENO50). Increased FENO50 and ABCD are related with extra hospital care (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively) and combined with corticosteroid administration could predict the necessity for extra hospital care (Odds ratio 4.09, 95% CI 1.1 to 15.3, p = 0.036 for corticosteroid treatment, odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.1, p = 0.029 for ABCD and odds ratio 7.93, 95% CI 1.7 to 35.3, p = 0.007 for FENO50).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The FENO50 may identify high risk smoking surgical patients with COPD receiving general anesthesia.

            "abstract": "In a series of 253 high-risk surgical patients, we measured the oxygen consumption (VO2) at frequent intervals before, during, and immediately after surgical operations and calculated the rate of VO2 deficit from the measured VO2 minus the VO2 need estimated from the patient's own resting preoperative control values corrected for both temperature and anesthesia. The calculated oxygen deficit was related to multiple organ failure, complications, and outcome. The 64 patients who died all had organ failure; their cumulative VO2 deficit averaged 33.2 +/- 4.0 L/m2 (+/- SEM) at its maximum, which occurred 17.8 +/- 2.2 h after surgery. In the 31 survivors with organ failure, the cumulative VO2 deficit averaged 21.6 +/- 3.7 L/m2 at its maximum, which occurred 10.1 +/- 2.7 h after surgery (p less than 0.05). In the 158 survivors without organ failure or major complications, the maximum cumulative VO2 deficit averaged 9.2 +/- 1.3 L/m2 at 4.1 +/- 0.6 h after surgery (p less than 0.05). In a prospective randomized clinical trial, a protocol group maintained at supranormal hemodynamic and oxygen transport values had significantly reduced oxygen debt (7.6 +/- 3.4 L/m2 vs 17.3 +/- 6.8 L/m2; p less than 0.05), fewer organ failures, and lower mortality (4 percent vs 33 percent; p less than 0.05) compared with a control group maintained at normal hemodynamic values. The data demonstrate a strong relationship between the magnitude and duration of the VO2 deficit in the intraoperative and early postoperative period and the subsequent appearance of organ failure and death. The latter may be reduced when oxygen debts were prevented or minimized by augmenting naturally occurring compensations that increased oxygen delivery."

            "abstract": "Background: Surgical resection remains the primary curative treatment for intra-cavity cancer. Low physical fitness and psychological factors such as depression are predictive of post-operative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Prolonged post-operative morbidity is associated with persistently elevated risk of premature death. We aim to investigate whether a structured, responsive exercise training programme, a psychological support programme or combined exercise and psychological support, delivered between treatment decision and major intra-cavity surgery for cancer, can reduce length of hospital stay, compared with standard care. Methods: WesFit is a pragmatic , 2x2 factorial-design, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial, with planned recruitment of N=1560. Participants will be randomised to one of four groups. Group 1 (control) will receive usual pre-operative care, Group 2 (exercise) patients will undergo 2/3 aerobic, high-intensity interval training sessions per week supervised by personal trainers. Group 3 (psychological support) patients are offered 1 session per week at a local cancer support centre. Group 4 will receive both exercise and psychological support. All patients undergo baseline and pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete self-report questionnaires and will be followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks and 12 months post-operatively. Primary outcome is post-operative length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes include disability-adjusted survival at 1-year postoperatively, post-operative morbidity, and health-related quality of life. Exploratory investigations include objectively measured changes in physical fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, disease-free and overall mortality at 1-year postoperatively, longer-term physical activity behaviour change, pre-operative radiological tumour regression, pathological tumour regression, pre and post-operative body composition analysis, health economics analysis and nutritional characterisation and its relationship to post-operative outcome. Conclusions: The WesFit trial will be a randomised controlled study investigating whether a high-intensity exercise training programme +/- psychological intervention results in improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing major inter-cavity resection of cancer.

NAC+ subjects presented lower values of diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (P = .035) and hemoglobin concentrations (P < .001). DLCO was strongly correlated with peak V̇O2 (r(2) = 0.56). Adjustment for DLCO reduced the effect of NAC on peak V̇O2 without suppressing it.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NAC was associated with lower preoperative peak V̇O2 in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer.

The impact of a \"prehabilitation\" program on elderly patients is discussed. This mono-center observational cohort study included consecutively 139 patients planned for major abdominal and thoracic surgery, with 44 in the control group (age < 65) and 95 in the elderly group (age > 65). All patients followed a \"prehabilitation\" program including exercise training, nutritional optimization, psychological support, and behavioral change. Seventeen patients in the control group and 45 in the elderly group completed the study at six months. The 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) increased in both groups from the initial evaluation to the last (median value of 80 m (interquartile range 51) for those under 65 years; 59 m (34) for the elderly group; p = 0.114). The 6 MWT was also similar after one month of prehabilitation for both populations. The rate of postoperative complications was similar in the two groups. Prehabilitation showed equivalence in patients over 65 years of age compared to younger patients in terms of increase in functional capabilities and of postoperative evolution. This multimodal program represents a bundle of care that can benefit a frailer population."

Twenty-one of 22 patients with two pulmonary arteries were considered to be in a hemodynamically operable state at the time of study. The condition of three of five patients with a single pulmonary artery was subsequently found inoperable because of severe pulmonary vascular disease in the lung supplied by the single pulmonary artery. In patients with two pulmonary arteries, demonstration of low pressure in at least one normal-sized pulmonary artery established operability. Postoperative pressure measurements correlated well with preoperative prediction of operability, with 19 of 20 patients having a pulmonary arterial pressure less than 70 percent of systemic levels after repair. Bilateral pulmonary arterial binding may be more effective than central arterial banding (which frequently produces severe obstruction to the right pulmonary artery) in preventing pulmonary vascular obstructive disease in patients with truncus arteriosus who have two pulmonary arteries. Patients with truncus arteriosus and a single pulmonary artery with pulmonary arterial banding remain at high risk for the development of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease."

Patients were evaluated with a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and patient satisfaction. The 6-minute walk test, active knee range of motion, and peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength were assessed. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for strength measures.

At final follow-up, while the mean LSIs for peak isokinetic knee flexor and extensor strength were 96.9% and 95.7%, respectively, 74.7% of patients were satisfied with their ability to participate in sports, and 88.5% were satisfied overall. A nonsignificant decline was observed for tissue infill (P = .211) and the MRI composite score (P = .099) from 2 years to final review. At final MRI review, 9 grafts (9.1%) had failed. While no significant association (P > .05) was observed between clinical or MRI-based outcomes and patient demographics (age, body weight, body mass index), defect size, or the duration of preoperative symptoms, the number of previous surgical procedures was significantly and negatively associated with KOOS Symptoms (P = .015), KOOS Sport (P = .011), and the degree of tissue infill (P = .045).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      MACI provided high levels of satisfaction and adequate graft survivorship as visualized on MRI at 10.5 to 16 years after surgery."

            "abstract": "The role of exercise radionuclide angiography in the therapeutic strategy of chronic aortic insufficiency remains controversial. In order to assess the value of this technique, 47 patients with pure chronic aortic insufficiency were evaluated before and one year after valve replacement. The preoperative EF decreases or does not increase on exercise (51.9% vs 48 +/- 10%; p < 0.001) in the majority of patients (78%), whereas, after surgery, the EF tends to increase on exercise (55 +/- 11% vs 57 +/- 11%; NS). Despite optimal surgical correction, 16 of the surviving 46 patients still had left ventricular dysfunction at one year after surgery. The preoperative parameters correlating with this dysfunction were, in order, resting radionuclide EF (r = 0.65; p = 0.0001) and the echocardiographic parameters: left ventricular endosystolic dimension, fractional shortening, and the radius/thickness ratio. The preoperative exercise radionuclide parameters did not correlate with postoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In patients without postoperative left ventricular dysfunction, the EF increased on exercise, contrary to the other group. The exercise EF remains valuable for retrospective evaluation of surgical benefit. The exercise radionuclide EF does not reflect myocardial contractile reserve alone but also the conditions of left ventricular load. This study confirms the superiority of the resting radionuclide EF and echocardiographic parameters over exercise radionuclide EF for the prediction of postoperative left ventricular dysfunction."

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to predict postoperative improvement in functional capacity. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) significantly improved from 14.2 +/- 3.7 ml/min/kg before to 21.4 +/- 5.6 ml/min/kg at a mean of 11.2 +/- 3.0 months after the transplant procedure (p < 0.001).

The improvement seen at 6 months did not significantly change over 9 years of follow-up. Significant preoperative univariate predictors of.1-year postoperative improvement in peak VO2 were preoperative peak VO2 (p = 0.004), age (p < 0.001), ischemic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.007), and preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001). Peak VO2 at 1 year in patients able to perform the test was not significantly influenced by acute rejection episodes, donor body surface area, or donor/recipient size ratio. In conclusion, exercise capacity is significantly improved within 6 months after cardiac transplantation, and maintained as long as 9 years after procedure.

However, there are few studies that determine the impact of SG on health's determinants such as physical fitness (PF) and physical activity (PA). Objectives: to describe the changes in PF and PA of patients after SG. Methods: twenty-three women with obesity (mean 36.1 ± 11.1 years old and body mass index [BMI] of 35.1 ± 3.4 kg/m2) were evaluated preoperatively to SG and at one and three months after surgery. An assessment of PF was conducted, including handgrip (HGS) and quadriceps muscle strength (QMS) with dynamometers and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with an ergospirometer. PA was assessed with a three-axis accelerometer. Results: the absolute VO2 peak decreased after the first and third month (p < 0.001) post SG. The VO2 peak relative to body weight showed an increase from baseline after the SG (p = 0.002). After SG, there was a reduction in absolute values for HGS and QMS (p < 0.001) and an increase in relative HGS after three months post-surgery compared to preoperative (p = 0.011), without changes in relative QMS (p = 0.596). No changes in PA were observed. Conclusions: after SG, there is a short term decline on PF when it is expressed on absolute values. However, when it is expressed in relative terms to body weight, some components of PF improve, while others showed no change. There was no modification in PA levels of the participants."

            "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the impact of septoplasty on cardiopulmonary functions in patients with nasal septal deviation (NSD). A total of 30 consecutive adult patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 33.7 [10.9] years, 56.7% were males) who underwent septoplasty due NSD were included. Visual analog scale scores, nose obstruction symptom evaluation scale scores, serum N-terminal Pro BNP levels, and cardiologic examination findings on electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and exercise treadmill testing were evaluated both 7 days before and 3-months after septoplasty operation. A significant decrease was noted in mean (standard deviation) visual analog scale scores (8.27 [0.83] versus 1.87 [0.73], P < 0.001), and nose obstruction symptom evaluation scores (83.7 [4.9] versus 12.7 [(5.4], P < 0.001) from preoperative to postoperative period, while maximum effort capacity was improved significantly (11.8 [1.9] versus 13.1 [2.1], P = 0.010) after septoplasty. Echocardiography findings at 3rd postoperative month revealed significant decrease in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (22.2 [3.2] versus 19.0 [3.6], P = 0.001), whereas significant increase in trans-mitral early diastolic rapid filling (E wave, 0.82 [0.14] versus 0.87 [0.13], P = 0.011), peak systolic velocity (S, 0.11 [0.02] versus 0.12 [0.02], P = 0.002), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (22.6 [3.2] versus 24.9 [2.9], P = 0.002), and right ventricle stroke volume (0.14 [(0.02] versus 0.15 [0.02], P = 0.013). In conclusion, our findings indicate favorable outcome of septoplasty in NSD patients not only in terms of improved nasal airflow but also cardiopulmonary functions, particularly the exercise capacity, pulmonary artery pressure, and right ventricular systolic functions. In this regard, our findings emphasize the important role of treating NSD patients without delay, given the likelihood of septoplasty to reverse the changes in the pulmonary artery system and to prevent onset of permanent cardiopulmonary dysfunction via amelioration of chronic obstruction of the upper respiratory tract."

The direct anterior approach does not incise muscle, and so recovery after surgery may be faster, but it has been associated with complications (including fractures and nerve injuries), and it involves a learning curve for surgeons who are unfamiliar with it. Few randomized trials have compared these approaches with respect to objective endpoints as well as validated outcome scores.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to compare the direct anterior approach with the direct lateral approach to THA with respect to (1) patient-reported and validated outcomes scores; (2) frequency and persistence of abductor weakness, as demonstrated by the Trendelenburg test; and (3) major complications such as infection, dislocation, reoperation, or neurovascular injury.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a randomized controlled trial recruiting patients from January 2012 to June 2013. One hundred sixty-four patients with end-stage osteoarthritis were included and randomized to either the direct anterior or direct lateral approach. Before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, a physiotherapist recorded the Harris hip score (HHS), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and performed the Trendelenburg test directly after the 6MWD. The patients completed the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the EQ-5D. The groups were not different at baseline with respect to demographic data and preoperative scores. Both groups received the same pre- and postoperative regimes. Assessors were blinded to the approach used. One hundred fifty-four patients (94%) completed the 2-year followup; five patients from each group were lost to followup.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were few statistical differences and no clinically important differences in terms of validated or patient-reported outcomes scores (including the HHS, 6MWD, OHS, or EQ-5D) between the direct anterior and the lateral approach at any time point. A higher proportion of patients had a persistently positive Trendelenburg test 24 months after surgery in the lateral approach than the direct anterior approach (16% [12 of 75] versus 1% [one of 79]; odds ratio, 15; p = 0.001). Irrespective of approach, those with a positive Trendelenburg test had statistically and clinically important worse HHS, OHS, and EQ-5D scores than those with a negative Trendelenburg test. There were four major nerve injuries in the direct anterior group (three transient femoral nerve injuries, resolved by 3 months after surgery, and one tibial nerve injury with symptoms that persist 24 months after surgery) and none in the lateral approach.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on our findings, no case for superiority of one approach over the other can be made, except for the reduction in postoperative Trendelenburg test-positive patients using the direct anterior approach compared with when using the direct lateral approach.

            "abstract": "It is accepted that cardiopulmonary exercise testing is one of the most valuable parameters, especially peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)), for the evaluation of risk assessment in lung cancer surgery. It therefore represents an attractive way of identifying a patient at high risk for postoperative complications. However, many patients do not achieve the maximal or predictive level during an incremental exercise testing. The purpose of the current investigation was to study the value of the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), which shows exercise capacity during submaximal testing, in predicting postoperative mortality in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma scheduled for lung resection. Forty-nine patients with bronchogenic carcinoma participated in studies with exercise tests as a preoperative evaluation. The peak VO(2) was calculated for each subject by averaging values obtained during the final 10s of exercise. The following equation was used to determine OUES: VO(2)/log(10)VE. Peak VO(2) without postoperative complication was 22.8+/-3.3 ml/(kg min), however, peak VO(2) in patients with present complications was 19.1+/-4.2 ml/(kg min) (p=0.001). In addition, although the mean OUES in patients with present complications was 11.1+/-1.2, the mean OUES in the absent group was 13.3+/-2.1 (p<0.001). Although peak VO(2) is useful in evaluating selected patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, OUES is also a beneficial parameter and should be calculated and recorded with peak VO(2), a better predictor of poor surgical outcome than absolute values, and should be integrated into preoperative decision making."

Its impact on the indices of systemic and splanchnic blood circulation, as well as results of an acute pancreatitis treatment was studied. Inclusion of Quercetin into a scheme of the patients preoperative preparation have promoted the improvement of indices of systemic hemodynamics and the cardiac pump function and enhancement of the left ventricle mechanical work by 18.4% (p < 0.01) at average. A trustworthy reduction of the peak systolic velocity of blood flow in the splanchnic space vessels was established.

Patients are often elderly, with multiple comorbidities that predispose them to perioperative morbidity. Use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has increased due to reduced early perioperative risk. This study assessed whether preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could be used to predict morbidity and hospital length of stay (LOS) after aortic aneurysm repair.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 185 patients underwent surgical repair (84 open repairs, 101 EVAR) and had adequate determination of a submaximal CPET parameter (anaerobic threshold).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patient comorbidities and cardiorespiratory fitness, derived from CPET, were similar between surgical procedures.

The hospital LOS was significantly increased in patients with one or more complications in both groups compared with those with no complications. In the open repair group, the level of fitness, as defined by anaerobic threshold, was an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and hospital LOS. When the optimal anaerobic threshold (10 mL/min/kg) derived from receiver operator curve analysis was used as a cutoff value, unfit patients stayed significantly longer than fit patients in critical care (mean, 6.4 [SD, 6.9] days vs 2.4 [SD, 2.9] days; P=.002) and in the hospital (mean, 23.1 [SD, 14.8] days vs 11.0 [SD, 6.1] days; P<.0001).

Reduced cardiovascular reserve and exercise intolerance are common in patients with CKD and are associated with adverse outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      The gold standard for identifying exercise limitation is cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). CPET provides an integrative evaluation of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and metabolic function during maximal or submaximal exercise. It is useful in clinical setting for differentiation of the causes of exercise intolerance, risk stratification, and assessment of response to relevant treatments. A number of recent studies have used CPET in patients with pre-dialysis CKD, aiming to assess the cardiovascular reserve of these individuals, as well as the effect of interventions such as exercise training programs on their functional capacity. This review provides an in-depth description of CPET methodology and an overview of studies that utilized CPET technology to assess cardiovascular reserve in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. Key Messages: CPET can delineate multisystem changes and offer comprehensive phenotyping of factors determining overall cardiovascular risk. Potential clinical applications of CPET in CKD patients range from objective diagnosis of exercise intolerance to preoperative and long-term risk stratification and providing intermediate endpoints for clinical trials. Future studies should delineate the association of CPET indexes, with cardiovascular and respiratory alterations and hard outcomes in CKD patients, to enhance its diagnostic and prognostic utility in this population."

Recommendations were framed using the approach described by the Guidelines Oversight Committee.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The preoperative physiologic assessment should begin with a cardiovascular evaluation and spirometry to measure the FEV1 and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco). Predicted postoperative (PPO) lung functions should be calculated. If the % PPO FEV1 and % PPO Dlco values are both > 60%, the patient is considered at low risk of anatomic lung resection, and no further tests are indicated. If either the % PPO FEV1 or % PPO Dlco are within 60% and 30% predicted, a low technology exercise test should be performed as a screening test. If performance on the low technology exercise test is satisfactory (stair climbing altitude > 22 m or shuttle walk distance > 400 m), patients are regarded as at low risk of anatomic resection. A cardiopulmonary exercise test is indicated when the PPO FEV1 or PPO Dlco (or both) are < 30% or when the performance of the stair-climbing test or the shuttle walk test is not satisfactory. A peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2 peak) < 10 mL/kg/min or 35% predicted indicates a high risk of mortality and long-term disability for major anatomic resection. Conversely, a V˙O2 peak > 20 mL/kg/min or 75% predicted indicates a low risk.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A careful preoperative physiologic assessment is useful for identifying those patients at increased risk with standard lung cancer resection and for enabling an informed decision by the patient about the appropriate therapeutic approach to treating his or her lung cancer. This preoperative risk assessment must be placed in the context that surgery for early-stage lung cancer is the most effective currently available treatment of this disease."

Whether stress testing leads to a reduction in cardiac events after AAA repair has remained unclear.

We measured the usage rates of stress testing across centers and compared the Vascular Study Group of New England cardiac risk index (VSG-CRI) among patients who had and had not undergone preoperative stress testing. We determined the rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of perioperative myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure exacerbation, and death across the centers. We compared the MACE and 1-year mortality between the centers in the highest quintile of stress test usage and the lowest quintile.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We studied 43,396 EVAR patients and 8935 OAR patients across 324 centers.

The rate of MACE was 1.8% after EVAR and 11.6% after OAR. The 1-year mortality was 4.6% for EVAR and 6.6% for OAR. The centers in the highest quintile of stress testing had a higher adjusted likelihood of MACE after both EVAR (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-2.30) and OAR (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.59) but similar 1-year mortality (EVAR: OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37; OAR: OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.17) compared with the centers in the lowest quintile.

The hypotheses concerned the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and correlations (Spearman's rho) between the change scores of the physical capacity tasks, the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), and back pain intensity measured with visual analog scale (VAS). At least 80% of the hypotheses would have to be confirmed for adequate responsiveness. Absolute and relative MICs for improvement were determined by the optimal cut-off point of the ROC curve based on the classification of improved and unchanged patients according to construct-specific global perceived effect (GPE) scales.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One-minute stair climbing, 50-ft walk and timed up-and-go displayed adequate responsiveness (≥ 80% of hypotheses confirmed), while 5-min walk did not (40% of hypotheses confirmed). The absolute MICs for improvement were 45.5 m for 5-min walk, 20.0 steps for 1-min stair climbing, - 0.6 s for 50-ft walk, and - 1.3 s for timed up-and-go.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of responsiveness for 1-min stair climbing, 50-ft walk, and timed up-and-go implies that these have the ability to detect changes in physical capacity over time in patients with chronic LBP who have undergone lumbar fusion surgery."

Age ranged from 18 to 62 years (mean 27 years). The pectus index (Haller index) was 4.5 ± 1.1. Lung function tests at rest were within the normal range, whereas maximal oxygen uptake (peak VO₂) was only 77 ± 2% of the predicted value. At 1-year follow-up, the pectus excavatum repair was associated with minor changes in lung function tests and significant increase (p=0.0005) in VO₂ (87 ± 2% of the predicted value).

Although left ventricular dysfunction is reversible after aortic valve replacement to a greater extent in patients with good preoperative exercise capacity compared with patients with impaired exercise capacity, not all patients with preserved exercise capacity demonstrate improved left ventricular function after aortic valve replacement. To determine the influence of duration of preoperative left ventricular dysfunction on postoperative reversal of left ventricular dysfunction, we studied 37 patients with aortic regurgitation who preoperatively had left ventricular dysfunction, defined as subnormal echocardiographic fractional shortening (less than 29%), and good preoperative exercise capacity, defined as completion of stage I of the NIH treadmill protocol without limiting symptoms. Eight patients were asymptomatic. In 11 patients left ventricular dysfunction was documented 18 to 57 months preoperatively (prolonged); in 10 patients left ventricular dysfunction developed in an interval of 14 months or less preoperatively (brief); in 16 patients duration of left ventricular dysfunction was unknown. Patients with brief vs those with prolonged left ventricular dysfunction did not differ with respect to severity of preoperative symptoms or exercise tolerance, echocardiographically determined left ventricular dimensions or fractional shortening (25 +/- 3% [SD] vs 25 +/- 3%), or radionuclide angiographic ejection fraction (42 +/- 5% vs 42 +/- 5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Liver transplantation has a significant early postoperative mortality rate. An accurate preoperative assessment is essential for minimizing mortality and optimizing limited donor organ resources. This study assessed the feasibility of preoperative submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) for determining the cardiopulmonary reserve in patients being assessed for liver transplantation and its potential for predicting 90-day posttransplant survival. One hundred eighty-two patients underwent CPET as part of their preoperative assessment for elective liver transplantation. The 90-day mortality rate, critical care length of stay, and hospital length of stay were determined during the prospective posttransplant follow-up. One hundred sixty-five of the 182 patients (91%) successfully completed CPET; this was defined as the ability to determine a submaximal exercise parameter: the anaerobic threshold (AT). Sixty of the 182 patients (33%) underwent liver transplantation, and the mortality rate was 10.0% (6/60). The mean AT value was significantly higher for survivors versus nonsurvivors (12.0 ± 2.4 versus 8.4 ± 1.3 mL/minute/kg, P < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that AT, donor age, blood transfusions, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were significant univariate predictors of outcomes. In a multivariate analysis, only AT was retained as a significant predictor of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 90.7% and 83.3%, respectively, with good model accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.92, 95% confidence interval = 0.82-0.97, P = 0.001). The optimal AT level for survival was defined to be >9.0 mL/minute/kg. The predictive value was improved when the ideal weight was substituted for the actual body weight of a patient with refractory ascites, even after a correction for the donor's age. In conclusion, the preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve (as defined by CPET) is a sensitive and specific predictor of early survival after liver transplantation. The predictive value of CPET requires further evaluation."

The charts of 23 consecutive patients (age range 13-36 years, mean 23.6+/-7) who underwent repair of aortic coarctation at the Atatürk University, Aziziye Hospital, between 1986 and 2000 were reviewed. There were 16 (70%) men and seven (30%) women. All patients had preoperative hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (BP) ranged between 150 and 200 mmHg, with a mean of 176+/-15 mmHg. Peak systolic gradient across the coarctation was 52+/-20 mmHg (range from 30 to 112 mmHg). There were no early or late deaths. Mean systolic BP values at the first postoperative evaluation were 176+/-15 mmHg (p<0.001 from preoperative values). Exercise testing revealed hypertensive response to exercise in three of 10 patients who had borderline hypertension at rest and without medication. Repair of coarctation of aorta even in adults is safe and improves systemic hypertension. To identify patients with potential hypertension, exercise testing should be performed. Impaired arterial dilatation may be an important contributor to exercise-related hypertension and late morbidity or mortality."

Sarcopenia (i.e. low skeletal muscle mass), myosteatosis [i.e. low skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SM-RA)], and impaired objectively measured aerobic fitness (reduced oxygen uptake) have been associated with poor post-operative outcomes and survival in various cancer types. However, the association between CT body composition and physical fitness has not been explored.

Multivariate linear regression was used to test the association between CPET variables and body composition.

Our center has adopted a policy of performing cardiac catheterization (CATH) in patients with predefined risk factors, and this is followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when it is indicated, even in the presence of negative stress test findings. The aim of this single-center, retrospective study of all patients who underwent OLT between 2000 and 2010 was to assess the effect of our policy on cardiovascular (CV) complications and survival rates after OLT. Data, including 1-year all-cause and CV mortality, postoperative myocardial infarctions (MIs), and frequencies of CATH and PCI, were abstracted. The study was divided into 3 subperiods to reflect the changes in policy over this period: (A) 2000-2004, (B) 2005-2008, and (C) 2009-2010. One thousand two hundred twenty-one patients underwent OLT between 2000 and 2010. The rate of catheterization increased during the 3 time periods (P < 0.001), as did the rate of PCI (P < 0.05). All-cause mortality decreased over the periods (P < 0.001), as did the MI rate (P < 0.001). Thirty-five of the 57 patients requiring PCI had normal stress tests. The mortality rate associated with postoperative MIs was significantly higher than the overall all-cause mortality rate. In conclusion, a significant improvement in the overall survival rate over the 3 analyzed time periods was noted. Increases in the frequencies of CATH and PCI corresponded to significant reductions in postoperative MIs and 1-year all-cause mortality rates. The increased use of CATH and PCI was associated with reduced overall all-cause mortality through reductions in the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal MIs. Further analyses of the role of stress testing and CATH in evaluating and treating patients before OLT are required to optimize this process."

Anesthesiologists as \"perioperative physicians\", can identify those scoring systems that assess functional capacity, whether from the basic physical history and walk test to the most complex such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and formulate intraoperative and postoperative interventions (rehabilitation) to minimize the impact of surgery on the recovery process. Nevertheless, the preoperative period can be used as an opportune time to increase functional reserve in anticipation of surgery, thus enabling the patient to better withstand the metabolic cost of surgical stress (prehabilitation). There is a compelling evidence that prehabilitation programs, including physical exercise, nutritional optimization and relaxation strategies, can enhance preoperative physiological reserve, however further studies are needed to identify the most appropriate protocols for those patients at risk, and assess the impact of such programs on clinically meaningful surgical outcomes."

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between total hospital length of stay and percent predicted peak oxygen consumption.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three-hundred and seventy patients undergoing pulmonary valve replacement/conduit change between 2003 and 2017 at Boston Children's Hospital were identified. Ninety had preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise tests within 6 months of surgery. Exclusion for inadequate exercise data (n = 3) and imaging data (n = 1) left 86 patients for review. Patients with percent predicted peak oxygen consumption ≥ 70% (n = 46, 53%) had shorter total hospital length of stay (4.4 days) than the 40 with percent predicted peak oxygen consumption <70% (5.4 days, p = 0.007). Median percent predicted peak oxygen consumption increased over sequential surgical eras (p < 0.001), but total hospital length of stay did not correlate with surgical era, preoperative left ventricular function, or preoperative right ventricular dilation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Children undergoing surgical pulmonary valve replacement with better preoperative exercise capacity had shorter total hospital length of stay. Exercise capacity is a potentially modifiable factor prior to and after pulmonary valve replacement. Until more patients systematically undergo cardiopulmonary exercise tests, the full impact of optimisation of exercise capacity will not be known."

Thallium stress testing was the initial examination of cardiovascular status in 141 patients. An adequate examination was one in which at least 70% of maximum heart rate was achieved. A thallium stress test was normal if there were no ST segment depressions on the electrocardiogram and no perfusion abnormalities on the thallium scan. Forty-four patients underwent cardiac catheterization as the initial evaluation (Group C) and four patients underwent transplantation without a formal cardiovascular evaluation (Group D).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-four of the 141 patients undergoing thallium stress testing had an adequate and normal examination (Group A). The incidence of perioperative cardiac events in this group was 2%. Seventy-seven patients (Group B) had an abnormal (n = 41) or an inadequate (n = 36) thallium stress test and most (n = 61) then underwent coronary angiography. The use of beta-blockers was the only predictor of an abnormal or inadequate thallium stress test (10 of 64 versus 27 of 77, chi 2 = 6.66, p less than or equal to 0.025). Forty-three percent (26 of 61 in Group B) of patients with inadequate or abnormal thallium stress tests had significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. The perioperative risk of cardiac events was not different in Group A versus Groups B, C, and D combined. Survival of Group A and B patients was not different but was significantly longer than that of Group C patients (p less than 0.001). Thallium stress testing was less expensive than cardiac catheterization ($1,000 versus $4,000 to $5,000).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Thallium stress testing allowed 45% of patients to avoid cardiac catheterization before renal transplantation. Discontinuing beta-blockers before thallium stress tests may improve exercise performance. The risk of perioperative cardiac events after transplantation was low and not different among patient groups. The relatively low predictive value of thallium stress testing for significant coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac events in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease suggests the need for the development of a more cost-effective, noninvasive screening test for this patient population."

A \"stunned\" myocardium can be expected when preoperative asynergic wall motion is normalized after successful coronary bypass surgery under similar loading conditions. Forty-five patients (mean age 51 years) underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization before and 9.5 months after successful bypass surgery. Patients with perioperative myocardial infarction and/or occluded vein grafts were excluded from the study. Preoperatively 17 of the 45 patients had a reduced systolic ejection fraction. These patients were further divided into the following two groups: group 1 consisted of 6 patients without or with only a small increase in regional ejection fraction (6 regions of the left ventricle in the right anterior oblique projection) after surgery (control group), and group 2 of 11 patients with a postoperative increase in preoperatively reduced regional ejection fraction (preoperatively \"stunned\" myocardium). In regard to duration of symptoms, functional classification (NYHA), number of myocardial infarctions, unstable angina pectoris and physical working capacity on the bicycle ergometer, there were no significant differences between the two groups. A mean 2.8 and 3.6 vein grafts (ns) were implanted in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Postoperatively, NYHA class decreased significantly and physical working capacity increased in both groups.

The rehabilitation after LTx aims at regaining physical abilities and health related quality of life using the increased breathing capacities.

The 6MWT is the simplest and most likely to be cost effective, as it provides useful information regarding prognosis, ADLs, and health care use at a very low cost. In addition, the 6MWT can be used to evaluate response to several interventions, including physical rehabilitation, medications, lung volume reduction interventions, and transplantation. The 6MWT has also been useful in and has become an integral part of the evaluation and response to treatment in other medical conditions, including congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis. The stair-climbing test seems to be most useful for preoperative evaluations when a CPET is not available. We have also used it on patients unable to perform a good CPET because of lack of familiarity with bicycle pedaling. The shuttle walk test may be used to better determine a maximal exercise capacity when a CPET is not available and to measure the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients unfamiliar with a CPET. The role of exercise as a therapeutic tool is central to the concept of pulmonary rehabilitation. Exercise training improves not only functional dyspnea and health-related quality of life, but also has been shown to decrease health care resource use.

Using a single-group prospective design, patients were enrolled in supervised aerobic exercise training for the duration of surgical wait time (mean 59.7 days). Participants completed assessments of cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and QOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung scales, including the trial outcome index (TOI) and the lung cancer subscale (LCS) at baseline, immediately presurgery, and postsurgery (mean, 57 days). 9 participants provided complete data. Repeated-measures analysis indicated a significant effect for time on TOI (P = .006) and LCS (P = .009). Paired analysis revealed that QOL was unchanged after exercise training (ie, baseline to presurgery), but there were significant and clinically meaningful declines from presurgery to postsurgery in the LCS (-3.6, P = .021) and TOI (-8.3, P = .018). Change in peak oxygen consumption from presurgery to postsurgery was significantly associated with change in the LCS (r = 0.70, P = .036) and TOI (r = 0.70, P = .035). Exercise training did not improve QOL from baseline to presurgery. Significant declines in QOL after surgery seem to be related to declines in cardiorespiratory fitness. A randomized controlled trial is needed to further investigate these relationships."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with VVIR pacemakers and without overt symptoms of a pacemaker syndrome benefit from a pacemaker upgrade, and if a preoperative noninvasive measurement of the change in stroke volume (SV) could predict the effect of a pacemaker upgrade. The study group consisted of 20 (12 women, 8 men) VVIR patients with a mean age of 60 years. The indication for the first implantation was AV block in 13 patients and SSS in 7. The mean time of a ventricular pacing was 77 months. The objective (echocardiography, an exercise capacity) and the subjective (the quality-of-life) parameters investigated in patients during ventricular pacing were compared to results obtained 2 months and 1 year after a pacemaker upgrade. To assess preoperatively a change in a SV expected after upgrading, attempts were made to restore AV synchronization by the use of a transesophageal pacemaker. An increase in SV (from 5% to > 35%) during temporary AV resynchronization was observed in each patient. Values of SV increase correlated with those obtained 2 months (r = 0.65; P < 0.01) and 1 year (r = 0.66; P < 0.01) after an upgrade. Superior hemodynamics was associated with a significant improvement of an exercise capacity in both subgroups of patients. The most significant improvement in the quality-of-life was observed in patients with SSS. We did not find correlations between SV and the quality-of-life assessed 2 months (r = 0.043; NS) or 1 year (r = 0.02; NS) after an upgrade. In conclusion, a pacemaker upgrade performed after a long-term ventricular pacing resulted almost consistently in the improvement of hemodynamics and was associated with an increase of exercise capacity. In patients with SSS it was followed by the significant improvement of their quality-of-life. Such a relation was not observed in patients with AV block as some of them (especially those with VVIR pacemakers) felt quite well during ventricular pacing. The proposed preoperative echocardiographic evaluation may precisely predict the degree of hemodynamic improvement expected after a pacemaker upgrade."

            "abstract": "Resection of large bullae to decompress adjacent lung tissue with the goal of improving pulmonary function has been an accepted surgical approach for many years. However, the indication for lung volume reduction is not bullous disease but diffuse emphysema and the surgical approach is based on an entirely different concept. The resection of the most affected parts of the emphysematous parenchyma aims at a reduction of the over expansion of the chest with the goal of improving respiratory mechanics. This concept was introduced by Brantigan in 1959, but has failed to gain widespread acceptance until recently. Based on the extensive experience in lung transplantation for patients with end stage emphysema J. D. Cooper reevaluated the idea successfully. He reported remarkable improvements in FEV1 and a reduction in hyperinflation after performing bilateral lung volume reduction through a median sternotomy. During the last 2 years we performed bilateral lung volume reduction in more than 30 patients with diffuse emphysema using video assisted thoracoscopy (VAT) and studied the results prospectively. In the first 20 patients preoperative mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 765 ml/sec and improved by a mean of 42% (0-100%) three months postoperatively. This gain in FEV1 was already observed at the end of hospitalisation approximately two weeks after surgery. The 12 minute walking distance improved over 40%. In our highly selected study population we had no perioperative mortality. Lung volume reduction is a palliative treatment of severe pulmonary emphysema. Currently no data is available on the duration of the improvement. In this selected group of patients dyspnea is reduced and pulmonary mechanics are improved, with a resulting increase in quality of life."

Despite LVAD therapy, some patients continue to exhibit exercise intolerance. The predictors and outcomes of these patients are unknown. A retrospective review of 65 LVAD recipients who performed 6-minute walk tests was conducted. Patients walking <300 m were considered to have poor exercise tolerance. Twenty patients exhibited poor exercise tolerance (221 ± 45 m), compared to 45 patients with better exercise tolerance (406 ± 76 m). Postoperatively, poor performers were not easily identified by functional symptoms alone, because 42% of these patients reported New York Heart Association functional class I or II symptoms. Preoperative New York Heart Association class, inotrope therapy, and intra-aortic balloon pump use were similar between the 2 groups. Multivariate analysis using all adequately powered (n >50) univariate predictors identified diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 10.493, p = 0.003) and elevated 1-month right atrial pressure (odds ratio 2.985 for every 5 mm Hg, p = 0.003) as significant predictors of poor performance (<300 m; area under the curve 0.85). The poorly performing group had increased mortality (p = 0.011), with 21% increased risk for overall mortality for every 10 m short of 300 m (fitted Cox model: hazard ratio 1.211, p = 0.0001). The distance walked in meters in a postoperative 6-minute walk test was the strongest predictor of late post-LVAD mortality (p = 0.0002). In conclusion, despite similar severity of heart failure preoperatively, some LVAD recipients may have persistent exercise intolerance postoperatively as assessed by the 6-minute walk test that is independently associated with subsequent reduced survival."

Both the self-ratings of appearance (2.5 ± 0.8 vs 4.4 ± 0.5) and ability to exercise (3.3 ± 0.7 vs 4.3 ± 0.6, scale 1-5) increased significantly. (All data: mean ± St Dev, *p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Closed repair of PE results in improvements in pulmonary and aerobic exercise function and perceived appearance and exercise tolerance. Our data suggest that the impact on appearance and self-perceived well being is greater than the physical effect."

Three patients received only arterial grafts, and 17 simultaneously received a saphenous vein graft. Forty five right gastroepiploic artery grafts were harvested during this study, but two were not used because of foci of severe calcification. The right gastroepiploic artery was grafted to the distal right coronary artery in 17 patients and to the distal obtuse marginal branches in three patients, accompanied by an internal thoracic artery graft to the left anterior descending artery in seventeen, to the diagonal branch in three, and to the proximal right coronary artery in one patient. A postoperative exercise test with a bicycle ergonometer was administered 6 to 12 weeks after the operation, and the results are reported after conversion into metabolic units. The preoperative exercise test resulted in 3.6 +/- 1.9 metabolic units for 18 patients tested, and the postoperative metabolic units were 7.8 +/- 1.3 for 20 patients. Left ventricular wall motion was analyzed by regional ejection fraction before and after coronary artery bypass grafting in 14 patients who received an right gastroepiploic artery graft for the right coronary system. The mean regional ejection fraction of the posterobasal or diaphragmatic wall was 28.0% or 28.2% before operation and improved to 43.1% or 43.2% after coronary artery bypass graft, respectively. The flow of right gastroepiploic artery seemed to distribute adequately to the revascularized area. Long-term results have not yet been proved; the use of simultaneous right gastroepiploic artery and internal thoracic artery grafts, however, thus produced excellent results, as seen from improvements in both left ventricular wall motion and early postoperative exercise performance."

All participants received an individualized exercise prescription including upper quadrant-specific resistance and mobility training and aerobic exercise for the duration of their surgical wait time. Feasibility was assessed by recruitment, adherence, attrition, and intervention-related adverse event rates. An exploratory investigation of intervention efficacy was conducted via a 6-min walk test, upper-quadrant strength and range of motion, volumetric chances associated with lymphedema, and participant-reported quality of life, fatigue, pain, and disability. Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, prior to surgery, and at six and 12 weeks after surgery. Semi-structured interviews with a subset of participants (n = 5) and health-care providers (H; n = 2) were conducted to provide further insights about intervention feasibility. Qualitative data were analyzed using a hybrid inductive and deductive thematic analysis approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Recruitment and attrition rates were 62 and 36%, respectively.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a recently developed technique which is accurate for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in general populations. The purpose of this study was to assess its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic implications in patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD (n = 97) underwent DSE as part of a preoperative evaluation before being listed for renal transplantation. Patients were followed for 12 +/- 6 months (range 1 to 24) after the study. Rest and dobutamine stress echocardiograms were analyzed for regional and global function. Coronary angiography was performed in 30 patients, and 25 underwent renal transplantation in the follow-up period. DSE had a sensitivity of 95% (92% for 1-vessel, 100% for > or = 2-vessel disease), specificity of 86%, and accuracy of 90% for the detection of CAD. During the follow-up period, 6 patients died; DSE revealed inducible ischemia in 4, and catheterization before death revealed multivessel CAD in 2. Conversely, a normal DSE identified a very low risk population, with a 97% probability of being free of cardiac complications or death during the follow-up period.

            "abstract": "This prospective study evaluated the ability of serial biplane rest and exercise radionuclide angiography to predict the status of individual coronary bypass grafts in 20 patients 2 to 6 months after surgery. The preoperative coronary angiogram was used to assign vessels to 10 regions of distribution on the radionuclide angiogram. Predictions of graft adequacy for individual vessels were based on a detailed assessment of rest and exercise wall motion in their regions of supply. Of 59 grafts, 38 were judged adequate (patent with less than 75% stenosis) and 21 inadequate by postoperative catheterization. Radionuclide prediction of graft status was possible for 32 of the 59 grafts, including 19 of 24 left anterior descending, 7 of 19 circumflex and 6 of 16 right coronary artery grafts. The status of the remaining 27 grafts could not be assessed because of normal wall motion in their region of supply both pre- and postoperatively (22 vessels) or because a region of supply was not represented on the biplane radionuclide angiogram (5 vessels). Of the 32 predictions made, 25 (78%) were correct, including 13 (93%) of 14 predictions of graft adequacy and 12 (67%) of 18 predictions of graft inadequacy. The single incorrect prediction of graft adequacy resulted from improved exercise wall motion in a region supplied by a graft judged as having a 75% anastomotic stenosis. Most incorrect predictions of graft inadequacy were due to new septal or other rest wall motion abnormalities postoperatively. The comparison of pre- and postoperative studies was essential to maintain the predictive ability of the test. Thus, a detailed analysis of regional wall motion by rest and exercise radionuclide angiography can be used to predict the status of individual coronary artery bypass grafts. Reliable predictions can be made for most successful anterior descending grafts, and may permit cardiac catheterization to be deferred in certain cases. However, the method is limited by the need to perform preoperative exercise studies, by the low number of right and circumflex coronary artery grafts that can be evaluated and by the poor specificity of predictions of graft failure."

Peak myocardial perfusion was evaluated in 42 patients 12 years post-SWITCH, using technetium-99 m (Tetrofosmin). SWITCH exercise data was compared to 42 gender-matched controls (CON). One symptomatic and one asymptomatic SWITCH patient had abnormal exercise myocardial perfusion; both patients had variant coronary anatomy preoperatively. SWITCH patients had lower VO(2peak) (p < 0.01), peak heart rates (p = 0.01), percentages of age-predicted peak heart rates (p < 0.01), and peak oxygen pulses indexed to body surface area (p < 0.01) than CON patients.

However, it may be responsible of postoperative complication and mortality, especially in patients with impaired pulmonary function. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs have been focused mainly in minimal invasive surgery approach during lung resection and respiratory rehabilitation after surgery. Preoperative exercise-based intervention (prehabilitation) has demonstrated reduction of morbi-mortality in other surgeries but in thoracic surgery continues to be under discussion. Cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) is the gold standard technique to predict postoperative morbi-mortality. The implementation of a preoperative respiratory rehabilitation could optimize patient's physical capacity before surgery and improve outcomes and enhance recovery. The aim of this systematic review of the literature is to identify the effectiveness and safety of prehabilitation programs in thoracic surgery, the type of exercise and its duration, and the group of patients with best benefit. Prehabilitation is a safe intervention without side effects in patients. High-intensity interval training (HIT) with duration of 2 to 6 weeks seems to be the best exercise programme in a prehabilitation intervention but it exists heterogeneity in terms of intensity and duration. Prehabilitation increase exercise capacity and significantly enhances pulmonary function. But the reduction of postoperative complication and mortality has not been clearly demonstrated. Different criteria selection, type of intervention and small sample size, in addition to no randomization, could justify disparate results. It seems that not all patients can benefit from prehabilitation and it could be indicated only in patients with impaired lung function. Further randomized clinical trials with enough patients, correct duration of HIT (2 to 6 weeks) and focused in COPD patients are needed to clarify the suitability of prehabilitation. Meanwhile, safety of prehabilitation and good results of some studies support this intervention in high-risk patients."

            "abstract": "Purpose: We evaluate the effect of an exercised prehabilitation programme on tumour response in rectal cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). Patients and Methods: Rectal cancer patients with (MRI-defined) threatened resection margins who completed standardized NACRT were prospectively studied in a post hoc, explorative analysis of two previously reported clinical trials. MRI was performed at Weeks 9 and 14 post-NACRT, with surgery at Week 15. Patients undertook a 6-week preoperative exercise-training programme. Oxygen uptake (VO2) at anaerobic threshold (AT) wasmeasured at baseline (pre-NACRT), after completion of NACRT and at week 6 (post-NACRT). Tumour related outcome variables: MRI tumour regression grading (ymrTRG) at Week 9 and 14; histopathological T-stage (ypT); and tumour regression grading (ypTRG)) were compared. Results: 35 patients (26 males) were recruited. 26 patients undertook tailored exercise-training with 9 unmatched controls. NACRT resulted in a fall in VO2 at AT -2.0 ml/kg-1/min-1(-1.3,-2.6), p < 0.001. Exercise was shown to reverse this effect. VO2 at AT increased between groups, (post-NACRT vs. week 6) by +1.9 ml/kg-1/min-1(0.6, 3.2), p = 0.007. A significantly greater ypTRG in the exercise group at the time of surgery was found (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Following completion of NACRT, exercise resulted in significant improvements in fitness and augmented pathological tumour regression."

They can influence patient-reported and physical performance outcome measures in a variety of disorders, but the associations between a comprehensive profile of pain-coping responses and preoperative pain/function and physical performance measures in patients scheduled for knee arthroplasty have not been examined. Patients with moderate to high pain catastrophizing (a pain appraisal approach associated with an exaggerated focus on the threat value of pain) may represent an excellent study population in which to address this knowledge gap.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      We asked the following questions among patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing who were scheduled for TKA: (1) Do maladaptive pain responses correlate with worse self-reported pain intensity and function and physical performance? (2) Do adaptive pain-coping responses show the opposite pattern? As an exploratory hypothesis, we also asked: (3) Do maladaptive responses show more consistent associations with measures of pain, function, and performance as compared with adaptive responses?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 384 persons identified with moderate to high levels of pain catastrophizing and who consented to have knee arthroplasty were recruited. The sample was 67% (257 of 384) women and the mean age was 63 years. Subjects were consented between 1 and 8 weeks before scheduled surgery. All subjects completed the WOMAC pain and function scales in addition to a comprehensive profile of pain coping and appraisal measures and psychologic health measures. Subjects also completed the Short Physical Performance Battery and the 6-minute walk test. For the current study, all measures were obtained at a single point in time at the preoperative visit with no followup. Multilevel multivariate multiple regression was used to test the hypotheses and potential confounders were adjusted for in the models.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Maladaptive pain responses were associated with worse preoperative pain and function measures. For example, the maladaptive pain-coping strategy of guarding and the pain catastrophizing appraisal measures were associated with WOMAC pain scores such that higher guarding scores (β = 0.12, p = 0.007) and higher pain catastrophizing (β = 0.31, p < 0.001) were associated with worse WOMAC pain; no adaptive responses were associated with better WOMAC pain or physical performance scores. Maladaptive responses were also more consistently associated with worse self-reported and performance-based measure scores (six of 16 associations were significant in the hypothesized direction), whereas adaptive responses did not associate with better scores (zero of 16 scores were significant in the hypothesized direction).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The maladaptive responses of guarding, resting, and pain catastrophizing were associated with worse scores on preoperative pain and performance measures. These are pain-related responses surgeons should consider when assessing patients before knee arthroplasty. TKA candidates found to have these pain responses may be targets for treatments that may improve postoperative outcome given that these responses are modifiable. Future intervention-based research should target this trio of maladaptive pain responses to determine if intervention leads to improvements in postsurgical health outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level I, prognostic study."

In the total population, a 10% extensor and flexor deficit and a 5% rotator deficit was noted. A significant difference between patellar tendon and hamstrings in terms of muscular recovery was found. It pointed out that a more specific rehabilitation should be done on the hamstring group. The muscular recovery was correlated to the highest subjective score. This study allowed the surgeon to be more specific in the ACL tear definition, to adapt the graft choice to the type of sport activity but also to the type of work the patient does and finally to modify the rehabilitation protocol for the hamstring technique."
