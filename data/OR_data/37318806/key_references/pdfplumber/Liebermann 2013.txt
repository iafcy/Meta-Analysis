DISCUSSION
This study provides baseline data to quantify post-
operative ambulation in hospitalized patients recov-
ering from gynecologic surgery. Despite widespread
acceptance of ambulation as a discharge criterion, we
found that ambulation appears insufficient with at
leastonein10patientstakingnopedometer-recorded
steps before discharge.

Although we did not detect improvements in

that this may be the result of an insufficient interven-
tion, lack of attention to patient-identified barriers, or
other factors. We found some easily modifiable
barriers to ambulation as identified by patients in
a questionnaire. Simple interventions such as early
discontinuation of indwelling catheters, discontinua-
tionofintravenousfluids,andimprovingpaincontrol
have the potential to increase postoperative ambula-
tion and thus overall postoperative outcome.
Body mass index and age (factors that are not
modifiable at the time of surgery) were not correlated
with ambulation. It seems that patients can be catego-
rized into walkers who have an active lifestyle and
nonwalkers, patients who have a more sedentary
