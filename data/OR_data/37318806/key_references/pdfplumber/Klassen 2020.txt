BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of higher therapeutic exercise doses on walking during inpatient
rehabilitation, typically commencing 1 to 4 weeks poststroke.
METHODS: This phase II, blinded-assessor, randomized controlled trial recruited from 6 Canadian inpatient rehabilitation units,
between 2014 and 2018. Subjects (n=75; 25/group) were randomized into: control (usual care) physical therapy: typically,
1 hour, 5 days/week; Determining Optimal Post-Stroke Exercise (DOSE1): 1 hour, 5 days/week, more than double the
intensity of Control (based on aerobic minutes and walking steps); and DOSE2: 2 hours, 5 days/week, more than quadruple
the intensity of Control, each for 4 weeks duration. The primary outcome, walking endurance at completion of the 4-week
intervention (post-evaluation), was compared across these groups using linear regression. Secondary outcomes at post-
evaluation, and longitudinal outcomes at 6 and 12-month evaluations, were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Both DOSE1 (mean change 61 m [95% CI, 9–113], P=0.02) and DOSE2 (mean change 58 m, 6–110, P=0.03)
demonstrated greater walking endurance compared with Control at the post-evaluation. Significant improvements were also
observed with DOSE2 in gait speed (5-m walk), and both DOSE groups in quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L) compared with Control.
Longitudinal analyses revealed that improvements in walking endurance from the DOSE intervention were retained during
the 1-year follow-up period over usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first preliminary evidence that patients with stroke can improve their walking recovery
and quality of life with higher doses of aerobic and stepping activity within a critical time period for neurological recovery.
Furthermore, walking endurance benefits achieved from a 4-week intervention are retained over the first-year poststroke.

from Usual Care, and then as well with DOSE2, at least
quadrupling the intensity from Usual Care. The high
number of walking steps used in this study to improve
walking recovery (DOSE1:2169; DOSE2:4747 steps) is
consistent with the thousands of functional, challenging,
repetitions observed in the animal model studies to pro-
mote neurological changes.24 However, the effects were
not necessarily additive, and some physical outcomes did
not demonstrate any benefits. There were no differences
between groups with respect to recovery of balance, as
measured by the Berg Balance Scale. This may be sec-
ondary to subjects within all groups receiving a similar
challenge in their physical therapy sessions with respect
to balance exercises or due to a ceiling effect of the bal-
ance measurement scale (Berg Balance Scale). There
was also no effect on paretic quadricep muscle strength,
which is likely because of the focus of the protocol on
stepping, rather than high force generation.
Both DOSE1 and DOSE2 exceeded 50 m on the
6MWT over the control group immediately following the
4-week intervention, which is considered a meaning-
ful clinical change in this measure early after stroke.16
DOSE2 intensity was double that of DOSE1 and resulted
in greater gait speed measured by the 5-meter walk, but
a similar response was not seen with walking endurance,
as measured by the 6MWT. Perhaps the extra walking
practice completed by subjects in the DOSE2 interven-
tion contributed to improved performance over shorter
walking distances (ie, 5-meter walk), but further training
duration beyond the 4-week intervention protocol may
be necessary to see the increased gait speed translate
to improvements in gait endurance (6MWT).
Despite no additional physical therapy or physical
activity counseling occurring beyond usual care after
completing the 4-week intervention, both DOSE subjects
and Usual Care continued to improve in the 6MWT at the
same rate (ie, slope) until 12 months. Since the DOSE
subjects start at a higher 6MWT value at 4 weeks, they
end at a higher value at 12 months compared with Usual
Care. This suggests that walking endurance improve-
ments obtained during a time of critical neurological
recovery may be retained long term.
Prior research has been inconclusive on the efficacy
of aerobic activity in improving quality of life poststroke.25
Thus, our results demonstrate that aerobic walking activ-
ity can improve quality of life, with both DOSE groups
having benefits over Usual Care. Although these ben-
efits were not retained to the 1-year follow-up evalua-
