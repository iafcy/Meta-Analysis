arthroplasty. This study aimed to determine whether the use of an activity diary for goal setting during occupational
therapywouldreducepain,andimprovepsychologicalandphysicalperformanceinpatientsaftertotalkneearthroplasty.
Methods:Atotalof41totalkneearthroplastyparticipantsfromtwocohortswererecruitedinthestudyandallocated
by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n¼20) or the control group (n¼21).
Occupational therapy intervention (1–2 weeks postoperatively) to promote goal achievement was performed in both
groups, and self-monitoring was performed in the diary group by using the activity diary. The outcome indices were
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, pain (resting pain, walking pain), pain catastrophizing (rumination, help-
lessness, and magnification), anxiety, depression, pain self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Data were evaluated by
using analysis of variance analyses with post hoc tests.
Results: A time-by-group interaction emerged for Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, pain
catastrophizing,anxiety,depression,andphysicalactivitylevel(p<0.05),bothfavouringthediarygroup.Thediarygroup
also showed greater improvement in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, anxiety, and physical
activity levels at four weeks postoperatively, compared to the control group (p<0.05).
Conclusion: The use of the activity diary in this study increased occupational therapy effectiveness, reduced patients’
pain, and prevented a decline in physical performance. We believe that the use of an activity diary is an effective and
feasible addition for total knee arthroplasty patients.
