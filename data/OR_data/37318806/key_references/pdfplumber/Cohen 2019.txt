Abstract
Background: In-hospital immobility of older adults is associated with hospital-
associated functional decline (HAFD). This study examined the WALK-FOR
program’s effects on HAFD prevention.
Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-post two-group (intervention group [IG] n = 188,
t
p
control group [CG] n = 189) design was applied in two hospital internal-medical
i
r
units. On admission, patients reported pre-hospitalization functional status, which was
c
assessed again at discharge and 1-month follow-up. Primary soutcome was decline in
u
basic activities of daily living (BADL), using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI).
n
Secondary outcomes were decline in instrumental ADL (Lawton’s IADL scale) and
a
community mobility (Yale Physical Activity Survey). All participants (75.1 ± 7 years
M
old) were cognitively intact and ambulatory at admission. The WALK-FOR included
a unit-tailored mobility program utilizing patient-and-staff education with a specific
d
mobility goal (900 steps/daeys), measured by accelerometer.
t
Results: Decline in BADL occurred among 33% of the CG versus 23% of the IG
p
(p = 0.02) at discharge, and among 43% of the CG versus 30% in the IG (p = 0.01) at
e
1-month fcollow-up. Similarly, 26% of the CG versus 15% of the IG declined in
c
community mobility at 1-month follow-up (p = 0.01). Adjusted for major covariates,
A
the intervention reduced the odds of decline in BADL by 41% (p = 0.05) at discharge
and by 49% at 1-month follow-up (p = 0.01), and in community mobility by 63%
(p = 0.02). There was no significant effect of the intervention on IADL decline
(p = 0.19).
Conclusions: The WALK-FOR intervention is effective in reducing HAFD.
Key words: in-hospital mobility, hospitalization, intervention, functional decline,
activities of daily living.

Introduction
Hospitalization of older adults for non-disabling conditions, such as pneumonia or
chronic illness exacerbations, results in 30–50% functional decline (1-4) and long-
term community-mobility limitations (5). About one-third of older adults fail to
recover their pre-hospitalization functional status and continue to decline by 1-year
t
p
follow-up and have a higher subsequent mortality risk (4,6). Limited in-hospital
i
r
mobility is strongly linked to hospital-associated functional decline (HAFD) among
c
older adults, even after controlling for important confounderss such as prior
u
functioning, comorbidity, illness acuity, depression, and malnutrition (2,3).
n
Nevertheless, regardless of their walking abilities, older adults spend more than two-
a
thirds of their hospital stay lying in bed, as measured by accelerometer (7-9).
M
Various interventional studies have found a positive effect of increased in-
hospital mobility on basic activities of daily living (BADL) (10-13), length of stay
d
(LOS) (10,14), in-hospital meobility (10,14), community mobility (15), and
t
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (16). Although preventing functional
p
decline is the ultimate goal of every geriatric treatment (3,17-19), and the potential to
e
improve mcobility in hospital settings has been widely demonstrated (10,11,13-15),
c
previous studies revealed two gaps to address when developing new mobility
A
interventions: (1) considering characteristics of the local context that may improve
implementation and sustainability, and (2) setting a measurable mobility goal.
The WALK-FOR (walking for better outcomes and recovery) intervention is a
theory-driven intervention aimed to address these gaps. First, it adopts a well-
grounded and flexible model, the SEIPS 2.0 (System Engineering Initiative for
Patients Safety) (20), which guided the adaptation to the local context (21). The
strength of the model is its ability to identify and manipulate local factors limiting in-

hospital mobility while adapting elements from existing interventions (20). Second, it
addresses 900 steps per day as a measurable goal. Walking fewer than 900 steps per
day was linked to a 4.7-fold risk of developing HAFD (22) and therefore can serve as
a walking-dose benchmark. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the effect
of WALK-FOR on the prevention of HAFD at discharge and at 1-month follow-up
t
p
from acute hospitalization in internal medical units.

Methods
s
Research Design and Participants u
n
We used a quasi-experimental pre-post two-group comparative design to assess the
a
impact of the WALK-FOR intervention program on functional decline at discharge
M
and at 1-month follow-up. The control group (CG) for usual-care practice was
collected first and lasted from October 2015 through February 2016. Following this
d
phase was a 3-month development phase that included field mapping, after which the
e
WALK-FOR protocolt was fully implemented and an intervention group (IG) was
p
collected, which lasted from June 2016 through September 2016.
e
Hebrew-, Russian-, or Arabic-speaking older adults (≥65 years), admitted for
c
c
non-disabling diagnosis to one of two internal-medicine units in a medical center in
A
northern Israel, and who were able to walk at time of admission, were screened for
participation in the study. The study setting included 46 beds in each unit, with a 75-
meter corridor, five nurses, and two nurses’ aides during the daytime, a 20% position
of physical therapists, and no assistive mobility devices at baseline. Exclusion criteria
were immobility due to medical restrictions, end-of-life care, or impaired cognition (a
score of ≤5 points on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) (23).
Participants were recruited within the first 24 hours of admission and were followed

for 3 hospitalization days, at discharge, and at 1-month follow-up. The study was
approved by the University of Haifa’s ethics board (Approval no. 139/16) and by
HaEmek Medical Center’s Helsinki committee (Approval no. 0100-15-EMC). All
participants signed informed consent forms. The study was registered in the
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration record
t
p
ACTRN12616001274460).

Intervention
c
Development phase. The first stage of the interventiosn development was field
u
mapping by addressing the main obstacles to patient mobility while illuminating local
n
strengths, relying on the SIEPS 2.0 theoretical model (20). The principal investigators
a
(AZ, MA) conducted a series of meetings with the hospital leadership (including YH)
M
and the interdisciplinary team to identify local constraints and resources and to design
the intervention. During this process, in-depth interviews were conducted with all
d
disciplines, including nursees’ aides, who were designated to assist mobility. After
t
articulating the project road map, we borrowed a materials kit from Liu and
p
colleagues (14), adjusted for local settings and needs. During the first 2 months,
e
hospital mcanagement dedicated half an hour per day to supervising the intervention.
c
Intervention description. The intervention included a unit-tailored mobility
A
program structured for unit staff, patients, and their caregivers and distributed through
video clips, in-personal communication, brochures, and posters. More specifically, a
dose of at least 900 steps per day (22) was defined as a behavioral goal. Staff
underwent theoretical and practical training to assess mobility and to safely mobilize
patients. Several changes were added to the processes at the hospital setting: (1)
nurses assessed mobility and provided mobility recommendations at admission, (2)
electronic medical records were modified to include patients’ mobility ability as well

as reports on daily walking distance, and (3) environmental modification included
removing physical obstacles from corridors, marking walking trails, and purchasing
extra walkers. No additional staff members were recruited. The intervention stages
and the effort involved in its development are described in detail elsewhere (21).
Intervention fidelity. To assess the effect of the intervention on actual
t
p
mobility, daily step count was collected for up to 3 days by an ankle-worn
i
r
accelerometer (Actical), and total daily mean steps was calculated for both groups. To
c
evaluate the behavioral change of staff toward mobility and tso address the effect of
u
the intervention on patients’ beliefs regarding in-hospital mobility, patients were
n
asked two yes/no questions: ‘Were you encouraged by staff members to walk more?’
a
and ‘Do you believe in-hospital mobility will improve your recovery?’ Additionally,
M
falls were documented as a balancing measure by a cross-reference from patient
reports and medical records every 24 hours.

Functional Assessmentts
p
Primary outcome. HAFD was operationalized by three domains: BADL, IADL, and
e
community mobility. The primary outcome, BADL, was measured using the 10-item
c
c
Modified Barthel Index (MBI, score 0–100). The MBI consists of individuals’
A
subjective assessment of their independence level in performing BADL (24). BADL
was assessed on admission retrospectively for pre-morbid status (2 weeks pre-
admission), at discharge, and by telephone 1 month post-discharge. A functional
decline in BADL was defined as a decrease of 5 points or more on the MBI from pre-
morbid stage to discharge or to 1-month follow-up, which expresses a loss of
independence in one of the BADL criteria, such as walking (25).

Secondary outcomes. IADL was assessed using Lawton’s IADL eight-item
scale for pre-morbid status (2 weeks pre-admission) and by telephone 1 month post-
discharge (26). A decline in IADL was defined as a decrease of 1 point or more,
representing a loss of independence in one IADL function (27).
Community mobility was assessed using an activity summary index, a
t
p
subscale of the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS) (28), at admission for pre-
i
r
morbid status (during the previous month) and at 1-month follow-up. The summary
c
index was correlated with daily steps measured by acceleromseter (r = 0.45, p < 0.001)
u
(28). The YPAS activity subscale score ranges from 0–142, with higher scores
n
representing greater mobility. Scores are calculated based on frequency and duration
a
of various activities performed by the patient throughout a typical week in the
M
previous month, including vigorous activities, leisurely walking, walking up and
down stairs, mobility, standing, and sitting (29). A typically clinically significant cut-
d
off of 10% decline (30) in ceommunity mobility was defined as a 14-point or more
t
reduction in YPAS score, representing a decrease from walking 3 to 4 times a week
p
for 10 to 30 minutes to not walking outdoors.

c
c
Covariates
A
The following potential confounders (2,3,31) were assessed at admission: comorbidity
using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (32), severity of illness using the
National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (33), severity of symptoms using 11 self-rated
common symptoms during hospitalization (34), LOS, age, and sex. In addition,
depressive symptoms were assessed using the HADS, coded as normal, borderline,
and positive symptoms of depression groups (35); and low and high malnutrition risk
was estimated using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) (36).

Statistical Analysis
We used t tests and chi-squared tests to test for significant differences between the CG
and IG for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate logistic
regressions were modeled separately for BADL, IADL, and community-mobility
decline to examine the effect of participation in IG compared with CG on preventing
t
p
HAFD. All models were adjusted for well-known confounders affecting functional
i
r
abilities during and post hospitalization: pre-morbid BADL, IADL, and community
c
mobility; age, gender, LOS, comorbidity, severity of symptomss, severity of illness,
u
depressive symptoms, and malnutrition risk (2,3,31). All analyses were performed
n
using IBM SPSS 23.0 package (SPSS INC, Chicago, IL).

admission, implying that the CG patients were less independent 2 weeks before
admission and had slightly worse comorbidity scores (see Table 1). However, no

Of the 377 participants, 368 (97%) had valid accelerometer data for a

completing 24 hours of assessment. During hospitalization, IG patienrts walked

Discussion u
n
The current study examined the effect of the WALK-FOR program on preventing
a
HAFD. The findings confirm that through its combination of attaining a goal of 900
M
steps, education, and consistent consideration of the local context and its resources,
the WALK-FOR is an effective way to reduce BADL functional decline at discharge
d
by 41% and at 1-month follow-up by about half. Additionally, the WALK-FOR
e
reduced decline in comtmunity mobility at 1-month follow-up by 33%. These findings
p
were significant even after adjusting for major covariates such as pre-hospitalization
e
functional status, age, sex, LOS, comorbidities, depressive symptoms, and severity of
c
c
illness. Overall, the number of patients experiencing a decline in BADL or
A
community mobility during hospitalization and at 1-month follow-up was reduced by
one-third in the IG compared with the CG. Moreover, the WALK-FOR did not
increase the number of falls, as only three patients (1%) fell in each group, consistent
with similar studies (15). However, no significant difference between groups in IADL
decline was found.
The WALK-FOR intervention reduced the decline in the primary outcome: BADL at
discharge and at 1 month post discharge. Findings regarding BADL of other

interventions are mixed (10-12,15,16,37). On one hand, nurse-driven mobility
protocols (10) and multidisciplinary interventions targeting physical and cognitive
functions (11,12) demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in BADL
functioning at time of discharge. On the other hand, three interventional studies which
included both exercise and walking as tolerated, using an allied health-assistant, did
t
p
not demonstrate an effect on ADL decline at discharge (15,16,37) or at 1-month post-
i
r
hospitalization (15). The differences in the findings across interventions may be
c
explained by (1) the potentially high standard of care that masy include physical
u
therapy and as such reduce the added value of the intervention in some settings (37);
n
(2) the use of different instruments (the Barthel Index and the Functional
a
Independence Measure), scoring systems, and baseline time points (e.g., admission or
M
2 weeks before hospitalization) to capture ADL decline; and (3) different definitions
of mobility goals across studies.
d
Our encouraging finedings for the secondary outcome—community mobility
t
(measured by YPAS)—are in line with the results of Brown and colleagues, which
p
demonstrated prevention of community-mobility loss 1 month post hospitalization,
e
measured cby Life Space Assessment (LSA) (15). The findings from both studies have
c
similar clinical implications, which reflects a person’s ability to participate socially.
A
This finding may stem from improved awareness of the importance of one’s mobility,
which in turn influenced the levels of mobility even 1 month post hospitalization. In
contrast to these findings, Siebens and colleagues (16) did not demonstrate prevention
of community-mobility decline. However, comparison between studies is difficult
because of the significant differences in measurement tools. Siebens and colleagues
(16) used only one question (frequency of leaving the neighborhood), which only

partially captured community mobility compared with the LSA and YPAS measures
(15,28,29).
The WALK-FOR did not significantly prevent decline in IADL 1 month post
discharge. This finding is in line with the study of Landefeld and colleagues (12) but
in contrast to the findings of Siebens and colleagues (16). The differences can be
t
p
explained by the intervention focus: the WALK-FOR and Landefeld and colleagues’
i
r
(12) interventions concentrated on altering mobility behavior during hospitalization,
c
whereas Siebens and colleagues (16) also added instructions sfor mobility behavior
u
during 1 month post hospitalization. Siebens and colleagues explicitly instructed
n
participants to conduct home exercises that should be documented and followed
a
weekly. Adding mobility instructions for the post-discharge period may reduce the
M
decline in IADL (16).
Interventions aimed at increasing in-hospital mobility among older adults
d
hospitalized for non-disablieng conditions have the potential to reduce HAFD
t
(10,11,13-16). However, consensus regarding mobility definitions and interventions’
p
functional measures remains to be achieved, limiting the ability to compare studies
e
and genercalize their findings. Different interventional studies used different functional
c
instruments, time points of measure (which, in addition, lacked post-hospitalization
A
follow-up), and statistical approaches. The definition of in-hospital mobility is also
inconsistent in terms of its operationalization and the required dose. Existing
interventions operationally defined in-hospital mobility as anything from merely
getting out of bed (14) to walking two or three times a day (10,14,15). Moreover,
within these definitions, the recommended dose for mobility to prevent HAFD ranges
from 15 to 20 min (15) to walking as much as tolerated (10,14). To our knowledge,

this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of adapting an objectively measurable
daily walking goal (>900 steps) on the reduction of HAFD.
Arriving at a measurable goal is a crucial step in the development of effective
interventions (20,21). However, achieving the desired goal requires in-depth
exploration of the local context that includes understanding an organization’s needs,
t
p
culture, and resources (20). Unlike most interventions, in which efforts invested in the
i
r
implementation phase use external assistants (11-13,15,16), the current study invested
c
most efforts during the context-evaluation and adjustment phsases (21). Similar efforts
u
were invested in the study by Liu and colleagues (14). Reliance on existing resources
n
may increase the likelihood of implementation sustainability.
a
The current study had several limitations that future research should address.
M
The sample is fairly homogenous and composed of relatively high-functioning older
adults, although the mean age (15), sex, comorbidity (11), and pre-morbid functional
d
status (10) are similar to thoese in other studies. Moreover, the intervention group
t
demonstrated higher functional abilities and lower burden of chronic illnesses, 2
p
weeks prior to the intervention. To reduce this potential bias, these variables (ADL,
e
IADL, andc comorbidity) were controlled for in the analysis. Additionally, this study
c
was conducted in one hospital setting to explore the effect of local sustainable
A
practice alterations. To prevent treatment contamination (38), it was designed as a
quasi-experimental study that controlled for a large set of confounders. Future studies
should incorporate a more heterogenic sample that would enable subgroup analysis
and implementation of a stronger design, such as a multi-center randomized clinical
trial, to strengthen the results.
To conclude, the current investigation joins the growing body of studies
demonstrating the positive effect of increased in-hospital mobility to prevent HAFD.

A combination of three elements contributes to the success of the WALK-FOR
intervention: (1) definition of a measurable walking goal, (2) in-depth understanding
of the context, and (3) ongoing education of patients and staff about the importance of
mobility. The program was found to be safe and applicable for its reliance on local
resources. Findings from this study should be replicated in broader populations within
t
p
different settings while considering a measurable mobility dose as a behavioral goal

and function as an ultimate outcome.
