Abstract
Background Earlymobilizationisoneessentialitemwithintheenhancedrecoveryaftersurgery(ERAS)concept,butlackssolid
evidenceandastandardizedassessment.Theaimwastomonitorandincreasethepostoperativemobilizationofpatientsafter
majorvisceralsurgerybyprovidingacontinuousstepcountfeedbackusingactivitytrackingwristbands.
Methods The study was designed as a randomized controlled single-center trial (NCT02834338) with two arms (open and
laparoscopic surgery). Participants were randomized to either receive feedback of their step counts using an activity tracker
wristbandornot.Theprimarystudyendpointwasthemeanstepcountduringthefirst5postoperativedays(PODs).
Results Atotalof132patientswererandomized.Afterlaparoscopicoperations,theaveragestepcountduringPODs1–5was
significantly increased bythe feedbackcomparedwiththe control group (P<0.001); thecumulativestepcount (9867 versus
