Abstract
7
8 BACKGROUND:
9 Commercial wrist worn activity monitors have the potential to accurately assess activity levels, and
10 are being increasingly adopted in the general population. The aim of this study was to determine if
T
11 feedback from a commercial activity monitor improves activity levels over the first 6 weeks after
P
12 total hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA).
I
13 METHODS: R
C
14 163 consecutive subjects undergoing primary TKA or THA were randomized into 2 groups. Subjects
15 received an activity tracker with the step display obscured 2 weeks prior to surgery and completed
S
16 patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). On day 1 after surgery participants were randomized
U
17 to either the “Feedback Group” (FB) or the “Non Feedback Group” (NFB). The FB group were able to
N
18 view their daily step count, and were given a daily step goal. Participants in the NFB group wore the
A
19 device with the display obscured for 2 weeks after surgery, after which time they were also able to
20 see their daily step count, but did not receive a formaMl step goal. The mean daily steps at 1, 2, 6
21 weeks, and 6 months were monitored. At 6 months after surgery subjects repeated PROMS and daily
22 step count collection. D
23 RESULTS: E
T
24 Of the 163 subjects, 95 underwent THA and 68 underwent TKA. FB subjects had a significantly higher
25 (p<0.03) mean daily step count bPy 43% in week 1, 33% in week 2, 21% in week 6, and 17% at 6
26 months, compared to NFB. FBE subjects were 1.7 more likely to achieve a mean 7,000 steps per day
27 than NFB subjects at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02). There was no significant difference between the
C
28 groups in PROMS at 6 months. 91% of FB and 83% of NFB reported they were satisfied with the
C
29 results of the surgery (p=0.08). At 6 months after surgery 70% of subjects had a greater mean daily
A
30 step count compared to their preoperative level.
31 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
32 Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had
33 significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6 weeks and 6 months,
34 compared to subjects who did not receive feedback in a randomized controlled trial. Commercial
35 activity trackers may be a useful and effective adjunct after arthroplasty.

Introduction

39 Mobility and physical activity are imperative to healthy aging. Evidence supports the positive
40 benefits of regular physical activity with higher activity being associated with reduction in the risk of
41 chronic disease and premature mortality[1, 2]. More recently associations like The Committee on
42 Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorse regular phyTsical
43 activity and even classify it as a modifiable risk factor for prevention in cardiovascular disease and
P
44 other chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint
I
45 diseases, and depression[3]. R
C
46
47 After joint replacement surgery the aim should therefore not only be to improve pain and function,
S
48 but also lead to improved activity. This activity should preferably meet the recommended daily
U
49 activity levels as recommended by the WHO, US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart
50 Foundation of Australia [4] [5]. N
51
A
52 Historically, post-operative activity has been monitored by using participant completed subjective
M
53 questionaries. [6, 7]. However, reports in literature have questioned the accuracy and validity of this
54 form of assessment. It has been identified that in s elf-assessment of physical activity people tend to
D
55 overestimate their level of activity by as much as 50%.[5] Verlaan et al. reported that up to 62% of the
56 general population meet the activity intensEity guidelines according to their self-assessment questionnaire
57 whereas only 9.6% meet these same guidelines when defined from objective physical activity
T
58 monitoring[8].
P
59
E
60 With the recent development of commercial-based accelerometers (activity trackers) the
61 “subjective” error has beCen decreased and it has become easier to accurately measure daily activity
62 level. It has also been identified that these activity trackers have a great potential to accurately
C
63 assess activity level before and after joint arthroplasty[9]. These devices are largely used in the
A
64 fitness industry as a motivational tool for those wanting to monitor and improve fitness. More
65 importantly these devices have been shown to be a valid and reliable assessment tool for activity
66 levels in normal participants[10], and participants after cardiac surgery[11].
67
68 In this study, we used commercial activity trackers to monitor and encourage higher activity levels in
69 a series of participants before and after Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Total hip arthroplasty (THA).
70 Our hypothesis was that subjects who received feedback of step count in the first 2 weeks after
71 surgery would have higher mean daily step count over the first 6 weeks after TKA or THA. We also

72 examined whether this impacted participant satisfaction, participant reported outcome measures or

74 Materials and Methods:
75 This was a single center parallel group randomized controlled study with an equal allocation ratio.
76 Eligible patients were all adults undergoing primary elective hip or knee arthroplasty under the care
77 of one of the investigating surgeons between May 2016 and December 2016. Patients were required
78 to provide written informed consent and were randomised to either control (NFB) or device
T
79 feedback (FB) groups. Subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory disease, and
P
80 those undergoing hip arthroplasty after an acute femoral fracture were excluded. Subjects who were
I
81 not contactable within 2 weeks of their surgery were excluded. R
82 Two weeks prior to surgery, subjects were contacted via telephone and inviCted to participate. All
83 potential participants were informed the purpose of the study. Participants were emailed or posted
S
84 the written Participant Information and Consent Form as approved by the Hospitals Human
U
85 Research Ethics Committee. If the participant consented they received a Garmin Vivofit2 device for 2
N
86 weeks prior to their surgery. The Garmin Vivofit®2 uses a 3-axis MEMS accelerometer to estimate
87 step count. This device has a long battery life of roughly 12A months and the retail cost is AUD$109.
88 The device has been shown to be valid and reliable for assessment of step count [12-14].
M
89 The display on the Vívofit®2 device which indicates the number of steps per day was obscured in all
D
90 participants in the preoperative period. On day 1 after arthroplasty, randomisation was performed.
91 The randomisation was blocked in multitudes of 40 with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The random
E
92 permutation list was generated from www.randomization.com. From this list a series of 40
T
93 numbered and sealed envelopes were created with the words “Feedback Group” or “No Feedback
P
94 Group” generated in the order determined by the permutation list. When a participant was to be
E
95 randomised the researcher obtained the next sequentially numbered envelope from a contact who
96 was independent of the rCecruitment process for allocation consignment.
C
97 A researcher visited the subject on the first day after surgery and advised as to which group they had
98 been allocated. AIf the subject was in the ‘Feedback Group’ the cover over the vivofit display was
99 removed to make the step count visible and he or she was given a daily step goal as indicated in
100 Table 1. Subjects were advised this goal should be considered a rough guide based on average
101 activity level after arthroplasty, and may need to be adjusted in some circumstances for medical or
102 lifestyle reasons. The weekly step goal was selected based on mean daily steps observed in a
103 previous study of subjects with activity monitors after arthroplasty[15]. The goal of 7000 steps by
104 week 6 was selected as this is the recommended daily step count for healthy older adults(>65)[16]

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
105 Participants in the “Non- Feedback Group” continued to wear the device with the display obscured
106 for 2 weeks after surgery and were not given a daily step goal.
107 The mean daily steps from each group for the first 2 weeks was recorded and compared. After 2
108 weeks all participants were permitted to remove the cover over the display and see the step count.
109 The non randomised group were not given the login or password required to sync the device and
T
110 therefore could not access their data until after they were unblinded. All participants from both
P
111 groups continued to wear their device until 6 weeks after surgery. Where possible the Garmin
I
112 Vivofit2 device was synced to the subject’s mobile device (phone or tablet) using the Garmin
R
113 Connect mobile application. If the subject did not have a suitable mobile device, arrangements were
C
114 made for the device to be synced at least every 3 weeks with the research unit’s computers, either
115 in person or via post. At 6 weeks after surgery participants returned the Garmin Vívofit®2 in person
S
116 or via post. At 6 months after surgery subjects wore the Garmin Vívofit®2 again for a period of 3
U
117 weeks.
N
118 All subjects completed patient reported outcome questionnaires (PROMS) preoperatively and at 6
A
119 months after surgery. The questionnaire included the disease specific measure of the Knee injury
M
120 and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score
121 (HOOS), and the general measure of the EuroQo l-5D (EQ-5D): an instrument for measuring quality of
D
122 life. At 6 months patients also completed the satisfaction component of the Knee Society Score, and
123 graded their satisfaction with their outcomEe of surgery on a 5-point scale from very satisfied to very
124 disappointed. They were also asked ifT they would have the same surgery again under the same
125 circumstances (Yes/No/Unsure).
P
126 The study was performed at Ethe Mater Hospital, a private hospital located in Sydney, Australia at
127 which over 2000 arthroplasty procedures are performed annually. The routine care of subjects
C
128 undergoing arthroplasty was admission on day of surgery, 5-day postoperative stay in acute care
C
129 orthopaedic ward, commencement of mobilization on Day 1 after surgery and twice daily
A
130 physiotherapy sessions for 5 days. The vast majority of subjects then attend inpatient rehabilitation
131 for a further 7-10 days, and outpatient sessions twice a week until 6 weeks from surgery.
132 The study was initially designed to recruit 300 participants. Prior to commencement of the study a
133 series of 30 participants undergoing TKA wore a Garmin Activity monitor for 6 weeks after surgery.
134 In this population the mean number of recorded steps per day was 6700 (standard deviation 3200)
135 before surgery and 5700 at 6 weeks (standard deviation 2600). This data was used to determine the
136 study sample size for the RCT design. Power calculations from (http://www.statisticalsolutions.net/)

137 determined that in order to detect a 25% variation in mean step count, with a power of 0.8 and a
138 significance level of 0.05, 113 participants were required for each group. By over sampling an
139 additional 37 participants in each group, we account for potential withdrawals and losses to follow-
140 up. A single planned interim analysis of the primary outcome measures was performed 7 months
141 after commencement of the study, after recruitment of over 200 subjects. A statistically significant
142 difference between the Feedback and Non- Feedback Groups was evident on all primary oTutcome

Results:
159 Between May 2016 and December 2016, 395 subjects underwent primary hip or knee arthroplasty
160 under the care of the investigating surgeons. Participant flow is shown according to the CONSORT
161 guidelines in Figure 1. 202 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 9 were
162 excluded as their surgery was cancelled or postponed and 30 patients were excluded as there was
T
163 insufficient data for baseline step count. The final groups included 81 subjects in the Feedback
P
164 Group and 82 subjects in the No Feedback Group.
I
165 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in TaRble 2. There were
166 no significant differences between the feedback and no feedback group for any of the baseline
C
167 variables or characteristics. Daily step count was recorded for each subject a mean of 36 of a
S
168 possible 42 days in the first 6 weeks after surgery. Days missing step counts was either due to non-
U
169 compliance with wearing the device, or difficulties with successfully syncing the device to retrieve
170 step counts. N
A
171 Mean daily step count for the 2 groups at 1- week, 2-week, 6- week and 6- months is shown in Table
172 3 and Figure 2. The feedback group had a significantlyM higher mean step count at all review points
173 than the no feedback group. Cohen’s d was 0.4-0.5, indicating a moderate effect size[17]. The mean
174 difference between groups ranged from 6-20%D between 1 week and 6 months after surgery. For the
175 Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7069 preoperatively to 8326 at 6 months
E
176 after surgery (p=0.001). For the No Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7748
T
177 preoperatively to 8467 at 6 months after surgery (p=0.001).
P
178 7000 steps per day is recommended as a suitable activity level for subjects over 65 years[16]. The
E
179 proportion of subjects achieving a mean of 7000 or more steps each day is shown in Figure 3.
C
180 Subjects is the Feedback Group were 1.7 (95CI% 1.2-2.6) more likely to be achieve a mean 7000
181 steps per day than sCubjects in the No Feedback group at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02).

182 The patient reported outcome scores reported at 6 months for the 2 groups is shown in Table 4.
183 There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for patient reported outcome scores at 6
184 months after surgery.
185 Patient satisfaction with the outcome was assessed at 6 months and the results are shown in Table
186 5. There was a trend (p=0.089) towards higher proportion of satisfied or very satisfied subjects in the

196 Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had
197 significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroAplasty at all measured time points over 6
198 months, compared to subjects who did not receive feedback. Feedback from activity trackers was
M
199 found to be an effective tool to increase early mobilization with subjects motivated to “achieve their
200 daily goal”.
D
E
201 This study is the first to report the positive effect of the use of activity monitors after knee and hip
T
202 arthroplasty. Our results indicated that in the feedback group the patients receiving a daily goal and
203 daily feedback in the first two wePeks after surgery led to increased activity in the acute phase,
204 increased activity at 6 monthEs, and a trend to improved higher patient satisfaction at 6 months
205 (p=0.09). The Feedback Group had significantly higher activity than the Non- Feedback Group by 45%
C
206 at one week, 34% at two-weeks, 26% at six weeks and then finally the 17% at six-month mark. With
C
207 the evident benefits of physical activity to healthy aging, especially after surgery, this increased
A
208 activity can be considered a positive effect for a successful surgery.
209
210 The success following joint replacement surgery can be measured by a variety of parameters. It is
211 important to aim to improve pain and function, but also physical activity. Physical activity includes
212 an improvement in mobility which can be measured by daily step count. However, until now a
213 reliable objective measure of improved step count following arthroplasty has not been reported. The
214 World Health Organisation (WHO), US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart Foundation
215 of Australia have released a list of recommendations of daily activity or step count to improve an
10
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
216 individuals’ health and reduce the risk of disease. According to their recommendations the average
217 individual needs to take 10,000 steps a day to improve their health and reduce the risk of
218 disease.[18-20] It is further specified that the recommended daily step count for healthy older
219 adults(>65) is 7,000-10,000 [21]. The proportion of subjects taking 7000 steps or more increased
220 from 50% prior to surgery to 70% at 6 months after surgery. The mean daily step count at 6 months
221 was increased compared to preoperative status in 66% of subjects. Even though a value ofT 10,000
222 steps/day currently is promoted as a target for obtaining health benefits the increase seen in these
P
223 patients after arthroplasty can be seen as a step in the right direction towards improving their health
I
224 outcomes. R
225
C
226 It should be noted that the group were differentiated by the presence or absence of feedback from
S
227 the activity monitor only for the first 2 weeks after surgery. After this time both groups were able to
U
228 see their daily step count on the device, but only the Feedback Group were encouraged to use the
229 weekly step goals (see Table 1). It is interesting that the positivNe effect of the early feedback from
230 the device and the use a goal had a positive effect over the full 6 months of the study. We
A
231 hypothesise that the early feedback was a powerful and persisting motivator for subjects to be
M
232 aware of their activity level over the long term.
233
D
234 With the recent rise in technological based assessment tools it is important for the orthopaedic
235 fraternity to stay up to date [22] AccordinE g to the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity
236 should be assessed by its four compoTnents: frequency, intensity, time, as well as type of activity
237 (abbreviated as FITT). Modern commercially available activity trackers have the ability to monitor all
P
238 of the FITT components. Physical performance is used as an assessment tool of patient recovery,
E
239 rehabilitation, and clinical progress postoperatively. It is therefore important to be able to measure
C
240 this accurately. The devices used in this study did not include a heart rate monitor to assess
241 intensity, rather we Cdeliberately focused on the daily step count, as it is our opinion that in the older
242 population grouAp, simpler goals may just be more appropriate. There are different forms of activity
243 monitors with increasing levels of complexity and accuracy but ultimately just a basic, accurate
244 activity monitor proved to be valuable in the rehabilitation of the post joint replacement patients.
245 Patient satisfaction is the ultimate indicator of successful surgery. At 6 months after surgery, 91% of
246 subjects in the Feedback Group reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of
247 the surgery, compared to 83% of the subjects in the No Feedback Group (p=0.089). While this trend
248 is encouraging, it was not reflected in the other patient reported outcomes at 6 months, with no
11
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
249 significant difference observed between the groups for the disease specific KOOS/HOOS sub scores
250 (p>0.65), or the EQ5D general health measure (p>0.17).
251 In 2001 a group of surgeons from Europe coined the term “ERAS”. Enhanced recovery after surgery.
252 Their research has highlighted the focus on quality of post-operative recovery and rested on several
253 factors: a multimodal team approach, preoperative counselling, standardized analgesic and
T
254 anaesthetic protocols, optimization of nutrition and early mobilization. Paying attention to these
P
255 elements they stated: “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery practices improve the opportunity for
I
256 rapid, uncomplicated recovery after surgery with both short- and long-term benefits for patients
R
257 while improving quality and saving money” [23] With the focus on early mobilization in joint
C
258 replacement surgery it has historically been difficult to monitor post-operative mobility with an
259 objective scoring system or scale that accurately identified the patients level of activity. We believe
S
260 the use of activity monitors can potentially lead to improved monitoring and ultimately improved
U
261 activity outcomes. Activity monitors have been enthusiastically adopted by the younger populations.
N
262 A recent commercial consumer reports of 1000 respondents suggest that over 50% of 18-64 year
A
263 olds own at least one wearable device, and report health as the primary motivation for
264 purchase[24]. It is likely that this technology will be usMed with increasing frequency in the
265 arthroplasty population of the future.
266 D
267 Subjects in this study stayed in acute care hospital for a mean of 5 days after arthroplasty surgery.
E
268 The most common practice was that they then attended inpatient rehabilitation for a further week.
T
269 This practice is considerably slower than the usual care after arthroplasty seen in majority of other
270 centres. This limits the generalisPabilty of our findings. However it is plausible that the benefit of
271 receiving feedback from an aEctivity monitor is relevant to populations of both slow stream and fast
272 stream rehabilitated protocols.
C
273
C
274 We identified some limitations to our study. We question the accuracy of these activity trackers at
A
275 low speeds. The devices make an estimate of daily step count using a combination of motion
276 sensors, including an accelerometer, which then use an algorithm to estimate step count. It is the
277 algorithm that allows the device to differentiate between simple movements of the arm and
278 walking. It can be expected that the algorithms are based on ‘normal’ walking speeds and so lack the
279 sensitivity to accurately measure very slow speed walking, or movement patterns that are
280 complicated by use of walking aids, such as crutches or walking frames. This is especially a concern in
281 the first days after surgery when activity levels are expected to be at a slower rate. [25-27]. This
282 potential error would affect both groups in this study equally so should not have unevenly biased
12
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
283 our early results. Regardless we advocate that these devices are probably better used after the first
284 week from surgery when walking patterns are starting to normalise. Additionally, we lost a number
285 of patients in our follow up either due to failure of device or information loss. We contributed this to
286 possible hardware or user failure. Overall the activity monitors were well tolerated by subjects but
287 for some elderly there were challenges with successfully managing the technology. Certainly, setting
288 up the devices correctly required some form of assistance in a significant proportion of theTse
289 subjects. This is likely to become less of an issue over time as the younger populations are vastly
P
290 more familiar and comfortable with using modern technologies. Lastly during our exclusion process,
I
291 30 patients had to be excluded due to late arrival or delivery of their devices (moRre than 1-week post
292 op). Despite these difficulties we achieved a more than 90% of successful data retrieval of the study
C
293 cohort, and remained suitably powered for detecting differences in step counts between the groups.
