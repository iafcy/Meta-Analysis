Abstract
Objective: To test if pedometers, as a motivational tool, could affect mobility outcomes in inpatient
rehabilitation.
Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
Setting: Subacute hospital rehabilitation unit in Australia.
Participants: A total of 78 participants with reduced mobility and clinician-determined capacity to improve.
Interventions: Both groups received usual care. For the intervention group, a pedometer was worn on the
hip with the step count visible to participant and recorded daily on an exercise log. For the control group, a
pedometer fixed shut was worn on the hip and they recorded estimated distances walked on an exercise log.
Main measures: Primary outcome was functional mobility – De Morton Mobility Index. Secondary outcome
measures were walking velocity, functional independence measure, time spent upright and daily step count.
Results: Significant improvements over time (P < 0.001) in functional mobility, comfortable walking velocity
and functional independence measure were not influenced by the intervention. The daily average upright
time (hours) in the first week of intervention was different (P = 0.004) between the intervention group
(median, interquartile range (IQR): 1.67, 1.77) compared to the control group (median, IQR: 1.12, 0.82).
Conclusion: Pedometers as a motivational tool without targets do not improve functional mobility in
this population. Pedometers may improve daily upright time in this setting.
