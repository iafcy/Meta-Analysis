Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a multicomponent
intervention to decrease sedentary time during and shortly after hospitalization.
Design: This is a quasi-experimental pilot study comparing outcomes in patients admitted before and
after the implementation of the intervention.
Setting: The study was conducted in a university hospital.
Subjects: Participants were adult patients undergoing elective organ transplantation or vascular surgery.
Interventions: In the control phase, patients received usual care, whereas in the intervention phase,
patients also received a multicomponent intervention to decrease sedentary time. The intervention
comprised eight elements: paper and digital information, an exercise movie, an activity planner, a
pedometer and Fitbit Flex™, a personal activity coach and an individualized digital training program.
Measures: Measures of feasiblity were the self-reported use of the intervention components (yes/
no) and satisfaction (low–high = 0–10). Main outcome measure was the median % of sedentary time
measured by an accelerometer worn during hospitalization and 7–14 days thereafter.
Results: A total of 42 controls (mean age = 59 years, 62% male) and 52 intervention patients (58 years,
52%) were included. The exercise movie, paper information and Fitbit Flex were the three most frequently
used components, with highest satisfaction scores for the fitbit, paper information, exercise movie and
digital training. Median sedentary time decreased from 99.6% to 95.7% and 99.3% to 91.0% between
Days 1 and 6 in patients admitted in the control and intervention phases, respectively. The difference at

Day 6 reached statistical significance (difference = 41 min/day, P = 0.01). No differences were seen after
discharge.
Conclusion: Implementing a multicomponent intervention to reduce sedentary time appeared feasible
and may be effective during but not directly after hospitalization.
