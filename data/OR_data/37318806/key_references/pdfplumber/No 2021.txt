Abstract
Purpose: To investigate whether the use of an activity tracker with feedback increases physical activity and
issafeinpatientswhounderwentamidlinelaparotomyforgynecologicdisorders.
Methods: Patients who were planned to undergo a midline laparotomy for gynecologic diseases wore an
activitytrackeratbaselineandfrompostoperativedays1–6.Patientsintheexperimentalarmcouldmonitor
their step counts and were encouraged to achieve the individualized step-count goal daily. In contrast,
patients in the control arm did not monitor their step-counts and received the usual encouragement for
ambulation. The primary endpoint was the percentage of the average step-count at postoperative days 4–5
dividedbythebaselineactivitycount.
Results: Seventy-three patients were randomized; 63 patients underwent a surgery and wore an activity
tracker; 53 patients were evaluable for primary endpoint. The activity recovery rate was significantly higher
in the experimental arm compared to the control arm (71% vs 41%, p <0.01). However, the study arm was
not significantly associated with the activity recovery rate in multivariate analysis. The brief pain inventory
score, brief fatigue inventory score, day of first flatus, day of soft blend diet initiation, ileus incidence, and
length of postoperative hospital stay were similar between arms. The incidence of wound dehiscence and

Conclusion: The use of an activity tracker with feedback is safe and may increase physical activity in

The present study has several limitations. A major References
limitation is the imbalance of the ASA score between
