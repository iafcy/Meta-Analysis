Abstract 
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a multicomponent 
intervention to decrease sedentary time during and shortly after hospitalization. 
Design: This is a quasi-experimental pilot study comparing outcomes in patients admitted before and 
after the implementation of the intervention. 
Setting: The study was conducted in a university hospital. 
Subjects: Participants were adult patients undergoing elective organ transplantation or vascular surgery. 
Interventions: In the control phase, patients received usual care, whereas in the intervention phase, 
patients also received a multicomponent intervention to decrease sedentary time. The intervention 
comprised eight elements: paper and digital information, an exercise movie, an activity planner, a 
pedometer and Fitbit Flex™, a personal activity coach and an individualized digital training program. 
Measures: Measures of feasiblity were the self-reported use of the intervention components (yes/ 
no) and satisfaction (low–high = 0–10). Main outcome measure was the median % of sedentary time 
measured by an accelerometer worn during hospitalization and 7–14 days thereafter. 
Results: A total of 42 controls (mean age = 59 years, 62% male) and 52 intervention patients (58 years, 
52%) were included. The exercise movie, paper information and Fitbit Flex were the three most frequently 
used components, with highest satisfaction scores for the fitbit, paper information, exercise movie and 
digital training. Median sedentary time decreased from 99.6% to 95.7% and 99.3% to 91.0% between 
Days 1 and 6 in patients admitted in the control and intervention phases, respectively. The difference at

Day 6 reached statistical significance (difference = 41 min/day, P = 0.01). No differences were seen after 
discharge. 
Conclusion: Implementing a multicomponent intervention to reduce sedentary time appeared feasible 
and may be effective during but not directly after hospitalization.

In many patients, hospitalization is associated with 
physical inactivity and more time spent sedentary, 
in some leading to a longer length of stay and func- 
tional decline during and after hospitalization.1–7 In 
the last 10 years, several randomized controlled tri- 
als (RCTs) studied the effect of physical activity 
interventions during and after hospitalization. A 
recent systematic review, concluding that the effect 
of physical activity interventions on physical per- 
formance in older patients during hospitalization 
was uncertain, included 15 trials.8 The interventions 
used in those trials varied considerably and com- 
prised (supervised) physical exercise program(s) 
with mobility, flexibility, strength, balance, walking 
and functional exercises,9–19 proprioceptive neuro- 
muscular facilitation,20 electrical stimulation,21 
vibration training22 and horse riding stimulation.23 
Four RCTs published afterwards24–27 investi- 
gated one or more (supervised) physical exercise 
program(s) including mobility, flexibility, strength, 
balance, walking and functional exercises. These 
RCTs showed contradictive evidence for the effect 
of physical interventions during and after hospitali- 
zation, with two studies showing a positive effect, 
one on physical activity27 and the other on physical 
performance,24 and two studies demonstrating no 
effect on physical performance measures.25,26 
The interventions in some of the aforementioned 
studies were delivered by means of eHealth.18,19,23 
eHealth is defined as the use of information and 
communication technologies to support or improve 
health and health care.28 eHealth has a broad area of 
application to facilitate physical activity in patients 
such as mobile (exercise) applications to facilitate 
physical activity in particular, by means of, for 
example, the provision of digitial information, 
mobile (exercise) application activity trackers 
(measuring physical activity).18,19,23,29–31 
In the literature, including the aforementioned 
studies on physical activity interventions in hospi- 
tals that were using eHealth, eHealth applications 
are mainly studied as single interventions. It is, 
however, advocated to combine them with face-to- 
face contacts, including individual or group educa- 
tion.32,33 This advice is based on observations that 
adherence rates of eHealth interventions are in 
general disappointing,33 whereas personal contacts 
with health professionals can increase their uptake.34 
Such a combination of eHealth and therapeutic 
guidance is called “blended care” or “technology 
supported care.”35 A multicomponent intervention 
may also help to tailor the intervention to patients’ 
personal needs, as a recent study among 336 hospi- 
talized patients showed that individual preferences 
regarding the promotion of physical activity may 
vary considerably.5 However, to our knowledge, 
there are no studies investigating the effectiveness 
of a blended physical therapy intervention during 
hospitalization. A missed opportunity since hospi- 
talized patients are often more sedentary than 
strictly necessary.1 
Thus, to our knowledge, there are no studies 
investigating the effectiveness of a blended physi- 
cal therapy intervention during hospitalization. The 
aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the 
feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a multi- 
component physical therapy intervention compris- 
ing both eHealth and non-eHealth elements to 
decrease sedentary time of patients hospitalized for 
vascular or transplantation surgery. 


This study was conducted at the vascular and trans- 
plantation surgery wards of the Leiden University 
Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands between 
July 2015 and March 2016. The study protocol com- 
plied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee 
of the LUMC (protocol no. P15.026) and registered 
in the Netherlands Trial Register (no. NL7820). 
As shown in Figure 1, a quasi-experimental 
design was used, with three phases—(1) a control 
phase (four months): patients included in this phase 
received care as usual; (2) a one-month implemen- 
tation phase: in this phase, physical therapists (PTs) 
were trained and nurses/physicians were informed 
about a multicomponent intervention to decrease 
sedentary time, and the recruitment of patients 
paused during this phase; and (3) an intervention 
phase (four months): patients included in this phase 
(recruitment restarted) received the multicompo- 
nent intervention, alongside usual care. 
During both the control and the intervention 
phases, all consecutive adult patients who were 
scheduled for elective (scheduled in advance) sur- 
gery at the transplantation surgery ward (e.g. kidney 
transplant, pancreas transplant) or the vascular sur- 
gery ward (e.g. aneurysm surgery, femoral-tibial 
bypass) and with a planned hospital stay of at least 
three days were invited to participate in the study. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: living inde- 
pendently before admission, ability to understand 
Dutch and having sufficient mental and physical 
abilities to undergo the intervention and to complete 
a pen-and-paper questionnaire. In close consultation 
with the treating physician, patients with a poor prog- 
nosis for recovery were excluded from the study. 
The screening for eligibility for the study was 
done prior to surgery by the PT and the treating phy- 
sician based on the study criteria. All eligible patients 
were informed about the study and were invited to 
participate by means of an information letter sent by 
postal mail, followed by a phone call from one of the 
researchers (D.C. or L.F. (PT)). If a patient met the 
criteria and agreed to participate, written informed 
consent was obtained and the baseline questionnaire 
was completed before surgery. Participating patients 

who were readmitted to the hospital during the study 
period were not invited to participate in the study for 
a second time. During the control phase (CG), all 
patients received regular PT based on their individ- 
ual needs if necessary, and by referral by the treating 
physician. Regular PT was conducted by hospital 
PTs who were working exclusively at the transplan- 
tation and vascular surgery wards. 
Patients included during the intervention phase 
received a multicomponent intervention during hos- 
pitalization and the first month after discharge in 
addition to regular physical therapy (physical ther- 
apy by indication). This multicomponent interven- 
tion comprised eight eHealth and non-eHealth 
elements (see Supplemental Appendix 1): (1) paper 
information about the importance of physical activ- 
ity before, during and after discharge; (2) digital 
web-based information about the importance of 
physical activity before, during and after discharge; 
(3) an exercise movie comprising strength or mobil- 
ity exercises (available on hospital television, 
mobile phone, laptop or tablet); (4) an activity plan- 
ner (only used during hospitalization) consisting of a 
board with icons attached to the headend of the 
patient’s bed, informing the patient, clinicians and 
family about the functional mobility of the patient; 
(5) a pedometer for patients to monitor their own 
physical activity; (6) a wearable activity tracker 
(Fitbit Flex™) to monitor their own physical activ- 
ity; (7) personal activity coaching, consisting of the 
opportunity for patients to contact a physiotherapist 
by email or phone for support or to ask questions, 
available both from admission until one month after 
discharge; and (8) access to Physitrack™, which is 
an app-based digital exercise program, tailored by a 
PT for every individual patient. 
The multicomponent intervention started on the 
first day after surgery, or in case of a post-surgery 
intensive care (IC) period, on the day of transfer 
from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the clinical 
ward; it was delivered on all weekdays by two PTs 
(D.C. and L.F.), except for the digital exercise pro- 
gram Physitrack which was delivered by the PT of 
the transplantation surgery ward or of the vascular 
surgery ward if necessary. Assessments (Figure 1) 
were done at admission (baseline), during hospi- 
talization, at discharge from hospitalization, one 



and four weeks thereafter (by D.C. and L.F). 
Assessments consisted of questionnaires (base- 
line, discharge from hospitalization, four weeks 
after discharge), a three-axis accelerometer to 
assess physical activity behavior (during hospitali- 
zation and one week after discharge) and a diary 
for physical activities (during hospitalization and 
one week after discharge). 


The following patient and hospitalization char- 
acteristics were extracted from the patients’ medi- 
cal files: date of birth, sex, date and reason for 
hospital admission, date of surgery and date of 
discharge. The following personal and socio- 
demographic data were collected by means of a 
questionnaire: weight (kg) and length (cm) to com- 
pute the body mass index (BMI: kg/m2); living sta- 
tus (living alone, with partner or family, living in a 
nursing home, other status); educational level (low: 
up to and including lower technical and vocational 
training, medium: up to and including secondary 
technical and vocational training, high: up to and 
including higher technical and vocational training 
and university); profession (studying, working, 
volunteer, unfit for work, housewife or houseman, 
unemployed or retired); sick leave (yes/no); unfit 
for work (yes/no); smoking (yes/no, I quit/no, I 
never smoked); receiving physical therapy before 
admission (yes/no); in possession of a smartphone, 
computer, tablet and television (yes/no); using the 
smartphone, computer, tablet or television for 
health purposes (yes/no). 
The feasibility (use and satisfaction) of the various 
elements of the multicomponent intervention was 
evaluated only among patients included in the inter- 
vention phase at discharge from hospitalization and 
one month after discharge by means of a self-devel- 
oped questionnaire. For each of the eight elements 
(i.e. eHealth and non-eHealth elements), patients 
were asked to rate the frequency of use in the past 
period using a four-point Likert-type scale (often, 
regularly, occasionally or never) and give a grade for 
their overall satisfaction (low–high = 0–10). 
The main aim of the intervention was to reduce 
sedentary time by offering patients various options 
to perform activities and be more physically active. 
Sedentary time was considered the primary out- 
come in this study, since patients tend to spend 
relatively much time lying or sitting following sur- 
gery. For this purpose, the daily percentage of sed- 
entary time was measured with an accelerometer 
(Activ8™ Professional Activity Monitor)36 and a 
physical activity diary. For each patient, acceler- 
ometery data were collected twice: during hospi- 
talization (excluding IC period) and one week after 
discharge for one week. The Activ8 is a tri-axial 
accelerometer worn on the leg that is sensitive to 
high accelerations in the human activity spectrum. 
The accelerometer contains a battery, a clock and 
data storage and is able to convert raw signals into 
postures and motions. Automated analysis of the 
angular position of the Activ8 converts raw sam- 
ples into physical activity classes. The Activ8 is 
able to distinguish whether a patient is lying, sit- 
ting, standing, walking, cycling or running. 
During hospitalization, when the patient arrived 
at the ward, patients were instructed to attach the 
Activ8 with water-resistant adhesive fixation mate- 
rial on the frontside of the upper leg, 10 cm above 
the basis of the patella. Patients were informed that 
the Activ8 should be worn all days and nights dur- 
ing the hospitalization period, and there were no 
restrictions in daily activities, including taking a 
shower or bath. 
At discharge, patients were instructed to wear 
the accelerometer for seven days, starting one week 
after discharge from the hospital, according to the 
same rules and instructions as the previous period. 
After wearing the accelerometer for one week, day 
and night, at home, patients returned the Activ8 by 
postal mail in a pre-stamped envelope. If a patient 
was not able to attach the accelerometer to the leg, 
nurses assisted (during hospitalization) or family 
members were instructed to do so (after discharge). 
The information from the accelerometer was 
downloaded by the researchers (D.C. and L.F.). 
Sedentary time was defined as any data from the 
accelerometer designated by the instrument as either 
lying or sitting and between 7:30 a.m. and 22:00 
p.m. This time frame was chosen since most patients 
would have been awake. Accelerometer data from 
the day of discharge were not taken into account, 
since the sedentary time during that day is not typi- 
cal for a day spent fully in hospital. If patients had 
worn the accelerometer at home for more than 
seven days, only the first seven days were taken into 
account. The proportion of sedentary time was cal- 
culated as the total time spent on sitting or lying 
divided by 12.5 hours (7:30 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.). If 
any non-wear time was registered during the 12.5- 
hour period, the time spent on lying or sitting was 
divided by the actual time the accelerometer was 
worn within the time frame between 7:30 a.m. and 


22:00 p.m. If any irregularities, unclarities or non- 
wear time in the accelerometer data occurred, the 
movement diary was used to check the interpreta- 
tion of the accelerometer data and discussed among 
the researchers. On average, the analysis of the data 
from a single patient of either the hospital period or 
period after discharge took one hour. 
Secondary outcomes concerned measures of 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physi- 
cal activity administered at 
inclusion and 
four weeks after discharge. HRQoL was measured 
using the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health 
Survey (SF-36). The EQ-5D is a generic measure- 
ment of the valuation of HRQoL (utility) in five 
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain and mood.37,38 The five three-point Likert- 
type scale results in a total score (no health to full 
health = −0.329 to 1.0). 
The SF-36 contains 36 questions divided into 
eight subscales: physical functioning, physical 
functioning and mental role, social functioning, 
mental functioning, vitality, pain and perceived 
health.39,40 From these subscales, physical and men- 
tal component summary scores for HRQoL can be 
calculated ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best 
HRQoL). Physical activity over the past month, 
summer and winter was measured, using a vali- 
dated questionnaire to determine whether or not the 
Dutch recommendations of health-enhancing phys- 
ical activity (30 minutes of at least moderate inten- 
sity physical activity on at least five days of the 
week or heavy intensive active for at least 20 min- 
utes three times a week) were met (yes/ no).41 
Statistical analyses comprised the following. 
The distribution of the data was checked for nor- 
mality by means of the Shapiro–Wilk test (P > 0.05 
normal distribution). Baseline characteristics of the 
patients in the control and intervention groups were 
presented as means with standard deviation (SD), 
median with interquartile range (IQR) or number 
(%) and were compared by means of the unpaired 
student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney’s U-test or chi- 
square test, where appropriate. 
Descriptive statistics were used to describe usage 
(n (%)) and satisfaction (median (IQR)) regarding 
the elements of the intervention at both baseline and 
four weeks after discharge. Furthermore, satisfac- 
tion was compared (Wilcoxon signed rank test) 
between baseline and four weeks after discharge to 
analyze whether there was a difference in feasibility 
for the elements inside or outside the hospital. 
Mann–Whitney’s U-test was used for the compari- 
son of the proportion of time spent on sedentary 
time for each consecutive post-surgery day between 
the control group and the intervention groups both 
during hospitalization and the measurement period 
after discharge. 
In addition, a linear mixed-models (LMM) anal- 
ysis was used to compare the individual patterns of 
daily sedentary time during hospitalization between 
the control group and the intervention group. Main 
effects and interaction term for group and days 
were used, with age, gender, BMI and type of sur- 
gery (transplantation/vascular) being entered as 
covariates in the analysis. We first fitted the model 
with time × group interaction and evaluated the 
corresponding significance test. Subsequently, the 
model was refitted after exclusion of the interac- 
tion effect, with only main effects for all variables. 
Models were fit with random effect for both inter- 
cept and time effect, based on optimality of 
Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion (BIC). 
The same analysis was done to compare the pat- 
terns of daily sedentary time during the first week 
after discharge between the control group and the 
intervention group with age, gender, BMI, type of 
surgery (transplantation/vascular) and length of 
stay being entered as covariates in the analysis. 
HRQoL (median (IQR)) and physical activity (n 
(%)) of the intervention and control groups four 
weeks after discharge and changes over time (four 
weeks after discharge-baseline) were compared by 
means of Mann–Whitney’s U-test or chi-square 
test. Since this was a pilot study, no sample size 
calculations were made. All analyses were per- 
formed with IBM SPSS, Statistics Data Editor 24. 
P-values less than 0.05 are considered statistically 
significant. 

A total of 187 patients were considered eligible to 
participate in this study (85 in the control phase 



and 102 in the intervention phase; see Figure 2). 
Due to logistic issues (e.g. weekend admission or a 
too short time frame before surgery), 72 and 92 
patients were actually invited to participate, of 
whom 42 (58%) and 52 (57%) agreed to participate 
and were included in the control and intervention 
groups, respectively. Patients who dropped out 
during the study or remained in the study but did 
not complete all assessements are shown in the 
flowchart (Figure 2). 
Table 1 shows that there were no significant 
differences in characteristics between the control 
and the intervention groups, except for a lower 
use of pre-admission physical therapy and more 
use of computer/laptop for health purposes in the 
control group. 
Moreover, the average duration of hospitaliza- 
tion and length of stay on the ICU were signifi- 
cantly shorter in the intervention phase than in the 
control phase (ICU not shown in table: mean = 
0.60 days (SD = 0.87) vs 2.3 (SD =7.7); P = 0.02). 
Table 2 shows the usage and satisfaction of the 
patients in the intervention group regarding the 
various elements in the intervention. During hospi- 
talization, the exercise movie, paper information 
and the wearable activity tracker were used by the

information and the exercise movie. Satisfaction 
with the elements was in general lower at home as 
compared to in hospital, in particular for the paper 
information. 
Table 3 shows the course of the average propor- 
tion of sedentary time per day (median % of time 
spent) on the first six days of hospitalization. 
Sedentary time decreased between Days 1 and 6 
from 99.6% (IQR = 95.7–100.0) to 95.7% (IQR = 
92.7–98.0) and from 99.3% (IQR = 93.6–100.0) to 
91.0% (IQR = 87.3–93.2) in the control and inter- 
vention groups, respectively. On Day 6, sedentary 
time was statistically significantly lower in the 
intervention group compared to the control group. 
This difference in proportion of sedentary time 
equals 41 minutes of sedentary time in favor of the 
intervention group. 
To take into account all days of hospitalization, 
an LMM analysis during hospitalization, including 
interaction between the between-subject and within- 
subject factors (control/intervention group × time 
(days) interaction), provided no evidence in favor of 
this interaction effect on sedentary time (P = 0.11, 
95% CI = (–1.57, 0.17)). After removing the inter- 
action term and re-fitting the model, we found no 
evidence of the main effect for the between-subject 
factor (the main effect for control vs intervention 
group; P = 0.60, 95% CI = (–1.79, 3.08)) during 
hospitalization over time for sedentary time. 
One week after discharge, the median % of time 
spent on sedentary activities did not differ groups on 
any measurement day. Taking into account all meas- 
urement days, the LMM including interaction (con- 
trol/intervention group × time (days) interaction) 
provided no evidence in favor of this interaction 
effect (P = 0.76, 95% CI = (–1.36, 1.00)) in seden- 
tary time. After removing the interaction term and 
re-fitting the model, we again found no evidence of 


the main effect between phases (control vs interven- 
tion group; P = 0.64, 95% CI = (–6.23, 3.86)) one 
week after discharge in sedentary time. 
Table 4 shows the comparisons of the SF-36, 
EQ-5D and proportions of patients meeting the 
Dutch 
recommendations of health-enhancing 
physical activity. There were no significant differ- 
ences, neither after discharge, nor regarding the 
change scores. 

This quasi-experimental pilot study evaluated the 
feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a multi- 
component intervention to decrease sedentary time 
during and directly following hospitalization of 
patients undergoing organ transplantation or vas- 
cular surgery. It was found that patients admitted in 
the intervention phase used on average three or 
more of the eight components of the intervention, 
with the paper information, the exercise movie, the 
wearable activity tracker and the individual digital 
training program being the most frequently used 
and best appreciated elements. In comparison with 
the control phase, patients admitted in the interven- 
tion phase tended to spend less time sedentary dur- 
ing hospitalization, but not after discharge. Results 
have to be interpreted with caution, due to meth- 
odological issues, such as the relatively high drop- 
out rate in both the intervention phase and the 
control phase. 
Our results regarding the feasibility of the 
multi component intervention are promising, but 
the usage of the individual components varied. 
Approximately 60% of the patients who reported 
the usage of the elements used three or more com- 
ponents of the intervention during hospitalization 
and at home. This may not be seen as disappoint- 
ing, as a broader range of elements was offered so 
that patients could select those that best fitted their 
interests and capabilities. This variety of modali- 
ties was based on the observation that preferences 
regarding the promotion of physical activity of 
patients who are hospitalized may vary considera- 
bly.5 Nevertheless, there was a relatively high 
dropout rate from the study, and although this 
occurred in both phases and is thus not likely to be 
related to the intervention, it cannot be ruled out 
that the usage and satisfaction outcomes are biased. 
The results from our study are difficult to 
compare with other studies on physical activity 
interventions during hospitalization,8,24–27 because 
these did not investigate multicomponent inter- 
ventions including various eHealth elements/ 
non-eHealth elements at the same time. However, 
studies that specifically evaluated the feasibility of 
single eHealth interventions, such as the study by 
Laver et al.19 on an interactive gaming program, 
showed that their use in a hospital setting was 
feasible. Our study also found a decreased usage 
between hospitalization and the first month at 
home. A similar observation was done in a study 
by Oesch et al.,18 where the adherence, rating, 
enjoyment and motivation regarding exergames 
during inpatient rehabilitation faded over time, in 
comparison with conventional exercise therapy. 
That finding could probably be explained by the 
“Law of Attrition” describing the exponential 
decrease within eHealth elements in adherence.18 
Although many solutions to reduce this effect and 
to maximize patient engagements are possible 
within eHealth interventions,18 the challenge of 
long-term adherence remains. It should be consid- 
ered, however, that with time, the need for the 
intervention may decrease because the patients’ 
health status improves. 
Our results regarding the preliminary effects of 
the multicomponent intervention are similar to other 
studies evaluating physical eHealth interventions’ 
effects on physical performance by Layer et al.19 
and Kim et al.23 These studies described significant 
improvements on capacity tests (e.g. the Functional 
Reach Test, Timed Up and Go Test and Timed 
10-meter walk test) of the elderly patients in a (geri- 
atric) hospital who received a physical eHealth 
intervention compared to patients who received 
conventional care or ball therapy. Although these 
outcome measures differ from accelerometry, both 
describe the functional status of a patient. In the 
absence of other studies investigating the effect of 
blended care on physical activity, our study shows 
similar results as the study of Wanigatunga et al.27 
Wanigatunga’s study found that accelerometry- 
based physical activity increased in older patients 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


receiving center-based exercise sessions combined 
with home exercise sessions after hospitalization for 
one year. In addition, Wanigatunga et al. also found 
similar findings on the long-term effects between 
groups and no interaction between group and the 
time, using a LMM analysis. However, our study 
especially contributes to modern care by evaluating 
physical activity of patients receiving this multi- 
component intervention, including evaluating the 
feasibility of the multicomponent intervention. 
Our study had several limitations. First, we 
included at the patient level, so in the intervention 
phase there was a mix of patients who were partici- 
pating in the study and patients who were not 
included in the study. If all patients at one specific 
ward had been included in the study, instead of a 
sub-selection based on pre-defined inclusion crite- 
ria, there might have been more mutual solidarity to 
be physically active, so the effect of the multicom- 
ponent intervention could have been larger. Second, 
the dropout rate was considerable and may have led 
to attrition bias. Nevertheless, we tried to reduce the 
impact of attrition bias using the intention to treat 
analysis. As the dropout rate was similar in both 
phases (36% control, 39% intervention), it is not 
likely to be associated with the intervention. Third, 
at baseline we found that the intervention group had 
received more physical therapy before admission. 
As a consequence, patients in the intervention group 
could have been more susceptible to reduce seden- 
tary time after the surgery. Fourth, the study was 
conducted in two wards of one university hospital 
in the Netherlands, which limits the generalizability 
of the results to other hospitals and countries where 
the contents of the conventional (physical) therapy 
or occupational therapy may differ. Fifth, some of 
the assessments applied were subjective by nature. 
We used patients’ self-reported data to collect data 
about height and weight, whereas more objective 
data from the anaesthesiologist’s record could have 
been used. Moreover, the use of the various compo- 
nents of the intervention was recorded subjectively, 
by means of patient report. For some elements, 
such as the usage of data of the digital training pro- 
gram, data are actually collected in the application 
itself, yet retrieving that data in a valid manner is 
very time consuming and not feasible within the 
available resources. In addition, despite the obvious 
advantages of accelerometery to monitor physical 
activity time, it cannot be ruled out that the acceler- 
ometer was worn by another person than the actual 
patient. And finally, this study could not be blinded, 
as patients, PTs, physicians and nurses were aware 
of the study phase (control or intervention). 
Thus, the findings of this pilot study with a 
quasi-experimental design suggest that the imple- 
mentation of a multicomponent intervention to 
decrease sedentary time during and directly fol- 
lowing hospitalization may be effective during 
hospitalization, but not after discharge. The results 
must be interpreted with caution, however, due to 
the aforementioned limitations. First of all, confir- 
mation of the results in a larger study with a rand- 
omized design would be necessary. Since the 
current study did not show a sustained positive 
effect after discharge, the need for more support for 
patients in the home setting should be investigated, 
including patients’ preferences for the most appro- 
priate modalities. In addition, further research is 
needed regarding the characteristics of patients 
who remain largely sedentary after discharge, so 
that the interventions can be further personalized. 
In general, more studies into which components 
are appropriate for which patients are needed, in 
order to provide tailored care. 

The authors would like to thank all patients who partici- 
pated in this study. They are grateful to all PTs at the 
Department of Orthopaedics, Rehabilitation and Physical 
Therapy for contributing to the study, with special thanks 
to L.M.M. Fremouw (PT) and E.M. Vermeulen (MD) for 
the huge contribution they have made to this study. The 
authors also thank the staff and all team members of the 
vascular surgery and transplantation surgery wards for 
their corporation and contribution to the project. 

In patients admitted to hospital for organ 
transplantation or vascular surgery sedentary 
time during hospitalization could probably be 
decreased by means of a multicomponent 
intervention including eHealth aiming to 
decrease sedentary time.
