OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether specific ambulation 
goals affect 
the adequacy or perceived barriers to 
ambulation in hospitalized surgical patients after major 
gynecologic surgery. 
METHODS: One hundred forty-six surgical 
inpatients 
were randomized to specific ambulation goals or routine 
care. We assessed the number of pedometer-recorded 
steps in the 24 hours preceding discharge as well as 
patient-identified barriers to ambulation. Groups were 
compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. 
RESULTS: Of the 129 participants with outcome data, 12% 
were discharged without any pedometer-recorded steps. 
We did not detect an effect of specific ambulation goals by 
group (routine care: 87 compared with ambulation goals: 
80, P5.7). The three main barriers to ambulation from 
a patient perspective were indwelling catheters (38.5%), 
intravenous poles (28%), and pain (12.5%) The median num- 
ber of postoperative steps was higher after minimally inva- 
sive surgery (143) compared with laparotomy (27) (P5.035). 
CONCLUSION: Approximately 12% of gynecologic sur- 
gical patients do not walk while hospitalized despite 
formal encouragement to ambulate. Ambulation is easily 
quantified and may improve with attention to modifiable 
barriers, potentially improving postoperative recovery.

desired for most operations.1–3 The surgical litera- 
ture documents the favorable effect of postoperative 
ambulation on reduction of surgical complications 
such as atelectasis, pneumonia4 and venous thrombo- 
embolism.5,6 In addition, early ambulation has also 
been shown to shorten recovery time7 and to decrease 
the length of hospital stay.8 
Ambulation is usually a discharge requirement; 
however, there is no standard definition of ambulation 
nor guidelines to determine the adequacy of post- 
surgical ambulation. Little data are available that 
quantify how much the average patient ambulates after 
abdominal surgery. In a study of patients undergoing 
total knee arthroplasty, Ilfeld et al9 described sufficient 
ambulation as at least 30 meters without a time limit as 
a discharge criteria. In a separate study about enhanced 
recovery programs, Maessen10 included ambulation in 
his discharge criteria measured by independence in 
activities of daily living but did not define or quantify 
ambulation. Browning et al11 recorded upright mobi- 
lization in minutes after upper abdominal surgery 
and concluded that 
the average postoperative 
upright mobilization time is low. Another small 
study found that women especially benefit from the 
use of an accelerometer and standardized encourage- 
ment after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.12 A recent 
Cochrane Review about enhanced recovery pro- 
grams in postoperative care was not informative as 
a result of the lack of randomized controlled trials.13 
The lack of a quantifiable, standardized definition for 
adequate 
an opportunity 
for health care teams to improve the metrics used 
for sufficient ambulation. This study was designed 
to estimate whether enhanced encouragement of 
ambulation affects 
the number of pedometer- 
recorded steps taken in the 24 hours before discharge 
when compared with the usual postoperative care. 



MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This randomized controlled trial was approved by the 
institutional review board at Loyola University and 
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01254851). 
Patients who were to undergo gynecologic surgery 
were enrolled from January 2011 to June 2011 at Loy- 
ola University Medical Center. We approached adult 
(aged 18 years or older) English-speaking women 
before undergoing major gynecologic surgery who 
were expected to have at least a 24-hour hospital stay 
postoperatively. We excluded non-English speakers 
and women who were not able to walk independently 
before surgery. All participants provided written and 
oral consent for research participation. 
A Student’s t test was used to compare propor- 
tions of age and body mass index (BMI, calculated as 
weight (kg)/[height (m)]2); a x2 test was used to com- 
pare proportions of type of surgery, gynecologic ser- 
vice, and race and ethnicity; and a Mann-Whitney U 
test was used to compare discharge days (Table 1). 
A resident physician enrolled participants before 
surgery. Randomization occurred after completion of 
their surgery when the surgeon had determined that 
no intraoperative events had changed the preoperative 
plan for the patient to ambulate freely immediately 
postoperatively. Patients were randomized to usual 
care or specific ambulation goals using sequentially

the number of 
pedometer-recorded steps documented in the 24 hours 
immediately before discharge. The 24 hours before 
discharge was chosen for ease of comparison between 
patients regardless of the length of their hospital stay. 
Furthermore, 
if ambulation is used as a discharge 
criterion, a patient’s ambulation should be highest in 
the timeframe immediately before discharge. Steps 
were recorded with a commercially available pedome- 
ter, which was placed around the patient’s neck with 
a lanyard in the postoperative recovery room. The 
manufacturer reported a precision of step-counting 
65% for this device tested by a vibration-testing 
machine. Patients were instructed to wear the pedom- 
eter at all times except during showers. Placement and 
retrieval events were documented in the patient’s chart 
and pedometer data were downloaded using the Om- 
ron Health Management software. 
The study group was given specific ambulation 
goals as our standardized intervention. We used 
bedside signs and signs on the patient’s hospital room 
door to reinforce the specific ambulation goal of at 
least 500 steps before discharge. The health care team 
(doctors and nurses) was instructed to remind the 
patients in the intervention group to ambulate with 
every patient encounter. The control group received 
standard postoperative care with no extra encourage- 
ment for ambulation. In our hospital there is no spe- 
cific protocol for standard care in terms of ambulation 
in place. It is the expectation that health care workers 
are consistently encouraging and aiding patient ambu- 
lation; however, this is not quantified in any way. 
Patients also completed a visual analog scale (0–10) 
to rate their difficulty with ambulation both preopera- 
tively and postoperatively immediately before discharge. 
A Student’s t test for related samples was used to test for 
differences in these ratings. We also assessed patient per- 
ception of obstacles to ambulation using a 10-question 
nonvalidated patient survey, which included options 
such as urinary catheters, lack of privacy, embarrassment 
from hospital gowns, lack of help from staff, and pain. 
This questionnaire was developed by the study authors 
and was completed by study participants on the day of 
their discharge. Finally, we performed a subgroup anal- 
ysis that compared open and minimally invasive (vagi- 
laparoscopic, and robotic) operative approaches 
nal, 
using the Mann-Whitney U test for group comparison. 




Given the lack of data in the literature, we 
performed a pilot study to inform our study design. 
This pilot study involved 25 patients who had major 
gynecologic surgery to assess the timing, frequency, 
and amount of postoperative ambulation. This pilot 
study was able to demonstrate the feasibility of using 
a pedometer to quantify ambulation in the postoper- 
ative setting. The data from this study revealed a wide 
range of steps (0–3,458) with a surprisingly low 
median number of steps in the 24 hours before dis- 
charge (40). The distribution of steps was highly 
skewed with just over one-fourth of the participants 
having no pedometer-recorded steps before hospital 
discharge. Given these data, we anticipated that a non- 
parametric test of significance would be needed to 
examine the effect of ambulation encouragement in 
our randomized trial. 
We also considered that a clinically significant 
effect of encouragement would be evidenced if 65% of 
patients in the control group were at or below the 
median number of steps in the treatment group (as 
opposed to 50%, which would indicate no treatment 
effect). From this, calculations indicated that 59 
patients per group would be necessary to provide 
80% power using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test 
with a .05 a level. 
RESULTS 
Of the 172 patients assessed for eligibility, 146 met 
eligibility criteria and were consented and random- 
ized (77 allocated to usual care and 69 allocated to 
goal enhanced postoperative care). Figure 1 displays

the flow of patients through the study. Ultimately data 
from 129 surgical patients were analyzed; 68 in the 
usual care group and 61 in the goal enhanced ambu- 
lation group. The loss of data resulted from loss of the 
pedometers before downloading the data. 
We did not detect significant group differences in 
mean age (53 compared with 56 years), mean BMI 
(30.6 compared with 30.5 kg/m2), race, type of sur- 
gery, gynecologic service, or discharge day (Table 1). 
Roughly 50% of the study participants were included 
in the study from the gynecologic oncology service 
with the primary procedures being robotic or staging 
laparotomies 
for endometrial or ovarian cancer. 
Another 30% of our study patients were undergoing 
urogynecologic procedures including robotic, laparo- 
scopic, and vaginal hysterectomies with prolapse 
repair. The final 20% of all study participants under- 
went hysterectomy for benign indications, including 
leiomyoma and abnormal uterine bleeding or adnexal 
procedures for benign reasons. 
The majority of all study patients (n581 [62.8%]) 
were discharged on postoperative day 1, which means 
that the number of steps in the 24 hours before dis- 
charge corresponds to the total number of steps taken 
during their entire hospitalization. Twenty-five percent 
(n533) of patients were discharged on postoperative 
day 2, and the remaining patients were discharged on 
postoperative days 3–9. There was no significant group 
difference in discharge day between the routine and 
goal-enhanced care groups (1.71 compared with 1.54, 
P5.388, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no statisti- 
cally significant group difference between numbers of 
steps (ambulation goal group: median 80 steps [range 0– 
2,353] compared with usual care group: median 87 steps 
[range 0–3,576], Mann-Whitney U test, P5.70) (Fig. 2). 
in each group took no 
pedometer-recorded steps before discharge. There 
was no significant difference between the group of 
participants that did not walk (n516) and the group 
that walked (n5113) in age, BMI, race, discharge day, 
type of surgery or preoperative, and postoperative 
difficulty score (Table 2). Groups were compared with 
a Student’s t test for age, BMI, and discharge day; a x2 
test for race and type of surgery; and a Mann-Whitney 
U test for preoperative and postoperative difficulty 
walking scale. 

Participants reported a mean preoperative ambu- 
lation difficulty score of 1.47 out of 10 compared with 
a mean postoperative difficulty score of 4.79 out of 10 
on a visual analog scale. There was a statistically 
significant difference in these ratings (P,.001). Most 
(80%) participants returned the ambulation barrier 
survey. Urinary catheters (38.5%), intravenous poles

DISCUSSION 
This study provides baseline data to quantify post- 
operative ambulation in hospitalized patients recov- 
ering from gynecologic surgery. Despite widespread 
acceptance of ambulation as a discharge criterion, we 
found that ambulation appears insufficient with at 
least one in 10 patients taking no pedometer-recorded 
steps before discharge. 
The lack of ambulation and an operational, quan- 
tifiable definition of “ambulation” highlight opportuni- 
ties to improve patient care. We have demonstrated the 
feasibility of quantifying ambulation in hospitalized 
postoperative patients. Given the importance of ambu- 
lation, we suggest that further research be considered to 
facilitate an operational definition that is universally 
accepted. Perhaps ambulation could be treated as a vital 
sign quantified and reported regularly among health 
care team members. This study shows one easy way 
in which physicians can quantify patients’ ambulation 
to decide if they are ready for discharge. 
Although ambulation was a discharge criterion, at 
least one in 10 patients were discharged without 
pedometer-recorded steps. Although pedometer failure 
was a possibility, we do not believe that pedometer 
function is the cause of 
this finding, because we 
confirmed pedometer function in each of these situations 
consistent with our protocol. We did not assess whether 
the health care team’s discharge decision would have 
been altered with knowledge of insufficient ambulation, 
but this seems to be an important area for future study. 
improvements in 
ambulation with specific ambulation goals, we believe 
that this may be the result of an insufficient interven- 
tion, lack of attention to patient-identified barriers, or 
other factors. We found some easily modifiable 
barriers to ambulation as identified by patients in 
a questionnaire. Simple interventions such as early 
discontinuation of indwelling catheters, discontinua- 
tion of intravenous fluids, and improving pain control 
have the potential to increase postoperative ambula- 
tion and thus overall postoperative outcome. 

Body mass index and age (factors that are not 
modifiable at the time of surgery) were not correlated 
with ambulation. It seems that patients can be catego- 
rized into walkers who have an active lifestyle and 
nonwalkers, patients who have a more sedentary

(28%), and pain (12.5%) were the most common 
ambulation barriers overall. There was no significant 
difference in barrier perception between the interven- 
tion group and the control group (indwelling urinary 
catheters [test: 48%, control: 30%, P5.067%], intrave- 
nous poles [test: 31%, control: 25%, P5.479], pain 
[test: 14.6%, control: 10.7%, P5.552]; x2). Based on 
the group similarity, we tested differences based on

lifestyle. This seems to be a matter of personality and is 
not directly correlated to their BMI or age. Older age is 
often associated with medical comorbidities such as 
arthritis, visual disturbances, unsteady gait, shortness of 
breath, and so on. Patients with these types of comor- 
bidities might be more hesitant to freely ambulate in 
a nonfamiliar environment. There is a possibility that 
just the intervention of wearing a pedometer could 
increase the amount of ambulation in hospitalized 
patients, but this effect was not quantified in this study. 
As clinically anticipated, patients who underwent 
minimally invasive surgery had a statistically significant 
higher number of steps postoperatively compared with 
those who underwent an open abdominal procedure. 
for the benefits of 
This provides further support 
a minimally invasive approach to surgery whenever 
clinically reasonable. 
Because our patient population included a wide 
range of age, BMI, and race, we consider our results as 
generally valid and reproducible to a larger sample. 
Weaknesses of this study include the difficulty ensuring 
that encouragement was given in a uniform manner, 
because we did not quantify the frequency of encour- 
agement by the health care team. Although the data are 
generalizable to the entire gynecologic population, the 
number of patients in each subspecialty is too low to 
comment on significance in these areas. The study has 
several strengths. It provides quantifiable baseline data 
about average postoperative ambulation after modern 
gynecologic surgery. The feasibility of quantifying 
ambulation allows many further studies that are likely 
to enhance patient safety and the quality of postoper- 
ative care. Ambulation quantification may also improve 
the precision of health care team communication 
regarding an individual patient’s postoperative status. 
We believe our findings provide a baseline for 
further research into methods to optimize postopera- 
tive ambulation.
