Purpose: To investigate whether the use of an activity tracker with feedback increases physical activity and 
is safe in patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for gynecologic disorders. 
Methods: Patients who were planned to undergo a midline laparotomy for gynecologic diseases wore an 
activity tracker at baseline and from postoperative days 1–6. Patients in the experimental arm could monitor 
their step counts and were encouraged to achieve the individualized step-count goal daily. In contrast, 
patients in the control arm did not monitor their step-counts and received the usual encouragement for 
ambulation. The primary endpoint was the percentage of the average step-count at postoperative days 4–5 
divided by the baseline activity count. 
Results: Seventy-three patients were randomized; 63 patients underwent a surgery and wore an activity 
tracker; 53 patients were evaluable for primary endpoint. The activity recovery rate was signiﬁcantly higher 
in the experimental arm compared to the control arm (71% vs 41%, p < 0.01). However, the study arm was 
not signiﬁcantly associated with the activity recovery rate in multivariate analysis. The brief pain inventory 
score, brief fatigue inventory score, day of ﬁrst ﬂatus, day of soft blend diet initiation, ileus incidence, and 
length of postoperative hospital stay were similar between arms. The incidence of wound dehiscence and 
other adverse events were similar between arms. There were no grade 3 of 4 adverse events. 
Conclusion: The use of an activity tracker with feedback is safe and may increase physical activity in 
patients who have undergone major gynecologic surgery.

Physical activity reﬂects functional status and is asso- 
ciated with health outcomes in many conditions. For 
example, lower levels of physical activity have been 
associated with a longer hospital stay in elderly 
inpatients.1 Health outcomes can be improved by 
increasing physical activity. For example, physical 
exercise has been shown to reduce the readmission 
rate in patients with coronary heart disease,2 and 
physical exercise improves obesity and quality of life 
in breast cancer survivors.3

Low physical activity levels in the perioperative 
period are associated with increased complication rates 
and prolonged hospital stay. For example, a low physi- 
cal activity level 
in the postoperative period was 
reported to be associated with pulmonary embolism and 
deep vein thrombosis in patients who underwent heart 
surgery.4,5 The time to ambulation after hip fracture sur- 
gery was related to delirium, pneumonia, and prolonged 
hospital stay,6 and a low postoperative physical activity 
level was associated with prolonged hospital stay in 
patients who underwent coronary artery surgery.7 
To improve surgical outcomes, several studies have 
examined the effect of exercise therapy in diverse set- 
tings. For example, inpatient exercise therapy reduced 
hospital stay in colon cancer patients.8 Pre- and early 
post-rehabilitation, 
including intensive mobilization, 
reduced the length of hospital stay in patients who 
underwent spinal surgery.9 However, exercise ther- 
apy requires resources. For example, in one trial, the 
exercise therapy comprised a 15-min exercise session 
under therapist supervision twice a day,8 while in 
another trial, an intensiﬁed exercise program, protein 
supplements, and balanced pain therapy were used.9 
Therefore, the adoption of exercise therapies in rou- 
tine practice is challenging. 
Simpler methods such as the use of an activity 
tracker were reported to increase physical activity and 
decrease body mass index and blood pressure mainly 
in outpatient settings.10 The use of an activity tracker 
with feedback also accelerated recovery in women who 
underwent day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy,11 
and self-monitoring of physical activity using an activ- 
ity tracker increased physical activity in hospitalized 
cardiac patients.12 However, 
there are few studies 
examining the effect of activity tracker use in inpatients 
who have undergone major surgery, and therefore, it is 
unclear whether they are safe and effective in these 
patients. For example, unsupervised ambulation in sur- 
gical inpatients could result in falls. 
We investigated whether activity tracker use, with 
feedback, increased physical activity and was safe in 
patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for 
gynecologic diseases. 

This was a single-center, randomized, open-label trial 
comparing the effect of using an activity tracker with 
feedback with usual care, on physical activity in 
patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for 
gynecologic diseases. After the institutional review 
board approved the protocol (Seoul National Univer- 
sity Bundang Hospital IRB, No. E-1311/225-002) and 
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02344095), 
patients were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Repub- 
lic of Korea from January 2014 to August 2015. All 
subjects gave informed consent. The inclusion crite- 
rion was a planned midline laparotomy for gyneco- 
logic disease. The major exclusion criteria were 
conditions in which physical activity should be 
restricted, the patient being unable to ambulate inde- 
pendently, anticipated intensive care unit admission, 
and anticipated discharge before postoperative day 5. 
Before the patients were admitted for surgery, they 
were requested to wear an activity tracker (Lifegram, 
LA11M-BS, LG) on the wrist for 2 days to determine 
the baseline activity that was calculated by averaging 
the step-counts for two complete days. When only 
one complete day count was measured, we used this 
as the baseline activity. After the baseline activity was 
measured, patients were randomized into the experi- 
mental and control arms in a 1:1 ratio using block ran- 
domization. Stratiﬁcation factors were age (<=60 
vs >60) and indication for surgery (conﬁrmed or sus- 
picious cancer vs not cancer). Randomization and 
notiﬁcation of result were performed by the statistics 
center of our institute. 
Patients in both trial arms wore an activity tracker 
from the morning of postoperative day 1 to the morn- 
ing of postoperative day 6. Patients in the experimen- 
tal arm self-monitored their step-counts via the 
activity tracker and were encouraged to achieve 
the individualized step-count goal daily. The goal on 
postoperative day 1 was 5% of baseline activity. For 
example, a patient with a baseline activity of 10 000 
was encouraged to walk 500 steps or more on postop- 
erative day 1. If the patient achieved this, the goal 
became the next level. The goals were set at 5%, 15%, 
30%, 50%, 80%, 120%, 170%, and 230% of baseline 
activity and patients were encouraged to achieve 
these daily. Patients were allowed to surpass several 
levels in a day. In contrast, patients in the control arm 
wore an activity tracker but could not monitor their 
step counts because the screen of the activity tracker 
was blinded. They received the usual encouragement 
for ambulation but no goals were set. 
The primary endpoint was the activity recovery 
rate at postoperative days 4–5, which is the percent- 
age of the average step count on postoperative days 
4 and 5 divided by the baseline activity. For example, 
when baseline activity is 10 000 and step counts at 


postoperative days 4 and 5 are 3000 and 5000, the 
activity recovery rate is 40%. In some cases, only one 
complete day of step counts was measured on postop- 
erative days 4–5 because the patient was discharged 
at postoperative day 5. In these cases, we used the 
one complete day step count as the average step 
count of postoperative days 4 and 5. The secondary 
endpoints were pain, measured with the brief pain 
inventory (BPI) at postoperative days 2 and 5; fatigue, 
measured with the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) on 
postoperative day 5; day of passing ﬁrst ﬂatus; day of 
initiation of a soft blend diet; 
ileus incidence, and 
postoperative hospital stay. Safety endpoints were the 
incidence and grade of wound dehiscence and other 
adverse events. The grade was determined according 
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. 
Based on previous studies,10,13 the activity recovery 
rates in the experimental and control arms were esti- 
mated as 36% and 30%, respectively. The standard 
deviation of activity recovery rate was assumed as 
8%. With alpha error 0.05, power 80%, drop-out rate 
10%, and two-sided test, the sample size was deter- 
mined as 64. 
For analysis, two cohorts were deﬁned. The safety 
cohort was deﬁned as patients who underwent mid- 
line laparotomy and wore an activity tracker for any 
duration. Baseline characteristics, surgery characteris- 
tics, and safety endpoints were measured in the safety 
cohort. The efﬁcacy cohort was deﬁned as patients 
who wore an activity tracker until postoperative day 
5 and whose activity recovery rates were calculated. 
Efﬁcacy endpoints were evaluated in the efﬁcacy 
cohort. 
To compare variables between arms, the student’s 
t-test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact 
test were used according to the type of variables and 
normality. All analyses were performed using R (ver- 
sion 3.6.1 [5 July, 2019]). This study is being reported 
in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Tri- 
als (CONSORT) Guidelines. 



but 
Seventy-three 
63 patients received surgery and wore an activity 
tracker (safety cohort). Ten patients were dropped 
due to early discharge, 
the remaining 
53 patients made up the efﬁcacy cohort (Figure 1). All 
baseline and surgery characteristics were balanced 


between the experimental and control arms except the 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score 
which was lower in the experimental arm (Table 1). 
The baseline activity levels were similar between 
the experimental and control arms. However, activity 
levels at postoperative days 4–5 tended to be higher 
in the experimental arm. Therefore, the activity recov- 
ery rate was signiﬁcantly higher in the experimental 
than in the control arm (71% vs 41%, p-value <0.01) 
(Table 2). However, 
in the unplanned multivariate 
logistic regression analysis including the ASA score 
and study arm, the activity recovery rate was associ- 
ated with the ASA score (1 [ref] vs 2 or 3, 
coefﬁcient = (cid:1)40, p = 0.04) but not with the study 
arm (control 
arm, 
coefﬁcient = (cid:1)2, p = 0.90). 


The BPI score on postoperative days 2 and 5, the 
BFI score at postoperative day 5, the day of ﬁrst ﬂa- 
tus, day of soft blend diet initiation, ileus incidence, 
and postoperative hospital stay were similar between 
the study arms (Table 2). 
The incidence of wound dehiscence and other 
adverse events were similar between the arms. There 
were no adverse events of grade 3 or higher (Table 3). 
In addition, venous thromboembolism did not occur. 

The use of an activity tracker with feedback is safe 
and may increase physical activity in patients who 
have undergone major surgery for gynecological con- 
ditions. The difference in activity recovery rate 
between the experimental and control arms was sub- 
stantial, but the ASA score was not balanced between 
both arms. 
the multivariate analysis 
including study arm and ASA score showed that the 
activity recovery rate was associated with the ASA 
score but not with the study arm. Therefore, our ﬁnd- 
ings should be interpreted with caution. In future 
studies investigating the physical activity in surgery 
the ASA score should be 
patients, 
controlled. 


Activity tracker use with feedback increased physi- 
cal activity in outpatient settings.10 However, 
the 
effect varied according to speciﬁc situations. For 
in patients who underwent bariatric sur- 
example, 
gery, 
the use of an activity tracker with exercise 
counseling increased physical activity. However, 
using an activity tracker without exercise counseling 
did not increase physical activity.14 In another study,

activity tracker use with a smartphone application 
did not increase physical activity in breast cancer sur- 
vivors.15 Studies of the effect of using an activity 
tracker with feedback on physical activity in an inpa- 
tient setting are rare and studies on surgical inpatients 
are extremely rare. In one randomized trial, the use of 
an activity tracker with ambulation goal-setting did 
not increase the physical activity in gynecologic surgi- 
cal patients. However, the hospital stay was less than 
2 days, and 12% of the patients were discharged with- 
out any physical activity.16 In patients who under- 
went major abdominal visceral surgery, the use of an 
activity tracker increased the physical activity in the 
laparoscopic surgery group but not in open surgery 
group.17 To our knowledge, the present study is the 
ﬁrst to suggest that an activity tracker with feedback 
is safe to use and may increase physical activity in 
inpatients who underwent gynecologic open surgery. 



The present study has several limitations. A major 
limitation is the imbalance of the ASA score between 
arms, which made the results difﬁcult to interpret. 
Second, the absence of baseline measurements of BPI 
and BFI scores also makes comparisons difﬁcult. 
Third, the short duration of observation and the small 
sample make this study underpowered for detecting 
the changes in rare and long-term adverse events such 
as incisional hernia. 
In conclusion, the use of an activity tracker with 
feedback is safe and may increase physical activity in 
patients who have undergone major surgery for gyne- 
cological diseases. However, our ﬁndings should be 
interpreted with caution because of an imbalance of 
ASA scores between arms.
