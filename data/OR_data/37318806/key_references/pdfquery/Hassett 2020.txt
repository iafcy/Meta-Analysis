Digitally enabled rehabilitation may lead to better outcomes but has not been tested in large 
pragmatic trials. We aimed to evaluate a tailored prescription of affordable digital devices in 
addition to usual care for people with mobility limitations admitted to aged care and neuro- 
logical rehabilitation.

We conducted a pragmatic, outcome-assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial in 3 
Australian hospitals in Sydney and Adelaide recruiting adults 18 to 101 years old with mobil- 
ity limitations undertaking aged care and neurological inpatient rehabilitation. Both the inter- 
vention and control groups received usual multidisciplinary inpatient and post-hospital 
rehabilitation care as determined by the treating rehabilitation clinicians. In addition to usual 
care, the intervention group used devices to target mobility and physical activity problems, 
individually prescribed by a physiotherapist according to an intervention protocol, including 
virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices for 6 months 
in hospital and at home. Co-primary outcomes were mobility (performance-based Short 
Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]; continuous version; range 0 to 3; higher score indi- 
cates better mobility) and upright time as a proxy measure of physical activity (proportion of 
the day upright measured with activPAL) at 6 months. The dataset was analysed using 
intention-to-treat principles. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000936628). Between 22 September 2014 
and 10 November 2016, 300 patients (mean age 74 years, SD 14; 50% female; 54% neuro- 
logical condition causing activity limitation) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 149) 
or control (n = 151) using a secure online database (REDCap) to achieve allocation conceal- 
ment. Six-month assessments were completed by 258 participants (129 intervention, 129 
control). Intervention participants received on average 12 (SD 11) supervised inpatient ses- 
sions using 4 (SD 1) different devices and 15 (SD 5) physiotherapy contacts supporting 
device use after hospital discharge. Changes in mobility scores were higher in the interven- 
tion group compared to the control group from baseline (SPPB [continuous, 0–3] mean 
[SD]: intervention group, 1.5 [0.7]; control group, 1.5 [0.8]) to 6 months (SPPB [continuous, 
0–3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 2.3 [0.6]; control group, 2.1 [0.8]; mean between-group 
difference 0.2 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3; p = 0.006). However, there was no evidence of a dif- 
ference between groups for upright time at 6 months (mean [SD] proportion of the day spent 
upright at 6 months: intervention group, 18.2 [9.8]; control group, 18.4 [10.2]; mean 
between-group difference −0.2, 95% CI −2.7 to 2.3; p = 0.87). Scores were higher in the 
intervention group compared to the control group across most secondary mobility out- 
comes, but there was no evidence of a difference between groups for most other secondary 
outcomes including self-reported balance confidence and quality of life. No adverse events 
were reported in the intervention group. Thirteen participants died while in the trial (interven- 
tion group: 9; control group: 4) due to unrelated causes, and there was no evidence of a dif- 
ference between groups in fall rates (unadjusted incidence rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 
1.83; p = 0.43). Study limitations include 15%–19% loss to follow-up at 6 months on the co- 
primary outcomes, as anticipated; the number of secondary outcome measures in our trial, 
which may increase the risk of a type I error; and potential low statistical power to demon- 
strate significant between-group differences on important secondary patient-reported 
outcomes. 

In this study, we observed improved mobility in people with a wide range of health conditions 
making use of digitally enabled rehabilitation, whereas time spent upright was not impacted.

ter; ACTRN12614000936628 






• Use of digital devices such as virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and hand- 
held computer devices can be enjoyable, provide feedback on performance, and may 
enable a greater dose of task-specific therapy to improve outcomes. 
• Current evidence is yet to confidently confirm the effects of rehabilitation using digital 
devices in addition to usual rehabilitation care on mobility tasks such as walking and 
other important outcomes such as quality of life. 

• In a pragmatic, outcome-assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, 300 people with 
walking difficulties (age 72 ± 16 years, 50% female) received usual multidisciplinary 
inpatient and post-hospital aged care and neurological rehabilitation alone, or in addi- 
tion used a range of affordable devices such as virtual reality video games, activity moni- 
tors, and handheld devices to target mobility and physical activity, as individually 
prescribed by a physiotherapist for 6 months. 

ting and 2 ± 1 devices in the post-hospital setting. This approach was feasible and 
enjoyed, and demonstrated it could be provided across care settings including the post- 
hospital setting with mostly remote support. 





• Digitally enabled rehabilitation using a range of devices prescribed by a physiotherapist 
to target a range of mobility limitations across care settings for adults with mixed health 
conditions can improve mobility but not time spent upright. 




Over 20% of the world population will be >60 years of age by 2050 [1]. Many will need accessi- 
ble and affordable rehabilitation to reduce costly limitations in function from neurological and 
musculoskeletal health conditions [2] as well as decline from aging and inactivity [3]. Physical 
rehabilitation should contain intensive, repetitive task-specific exercises to improve outcomes 
[4–7]. Virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices are 
accessible, affordable, and enjoyable [8], and together can provide a digitally enabled rehabili- 
tation environment by providing more opportunity and greater motivation to increase task- 
specific practice in hospital [9] and in the home setting [10]. However, evidence of their impact 
on outcomes is limited and focused on stroke rehabilitation [11,12]. A systematic review of vir- 
tual reality interventions in people after stroke (72 studies) demonstrated a moderate effect on 
balance, but no effect on walking speed or global motor function when delivered as an adjunct 
to usual rehabilitation [11]. However, the quality of evidence was rated as low for nearly all 
outcomes, and all but 1 study tested a single virtual reality system. A feasibility trial conducted 
by our team in people undertaking inpatient aged care and neurological rehabilitation (n = 58) 
provided an additional dose of rehabilitation for 2 weeks using a range of low-cost video 
games and activity monitors [13]. The intervention was feasible, safe, and enjoyable, and 
enabled a higher dose of exercise and improved balance but not overall mobility. This promis- 
ing intervention, after refinement, required rigorous evaluation.

care alone. 
Methods

AMOUNT was a pragmatic, assessor-blinded, multicentre superiority randomised controlled 
trial with 2 parallel groups and included a nested economic analysis (presented separately) and 
a qualitative study [14]. 

There were 3 trial sites across Australia. Two were in metropolitan hospitals in Sydney in New 
South Wales (Site 1: 20-bed stroke and 20-bed aged care rehabilitation wards; Site 2: 16-bed 
brain injury rehabilitation unit), and 1 was in Adelaide in South Australia (Site 3: 30-bed geri- 
atric evaluation and management ward and 40- and 20-bed general rehabilitation wards). 
Research physiotherapists recruited participants, conducted baseline assessments, randomised 
participants, and delivered the intervention; all were experienced physiotherapists and 
received training in trial processes, as well as in the digital intervention to be delivered.

ity and quantity of practice. 


participate: �18 years old; reduced mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] 
score < 12) [15] with clinician-assessed capacity for improvement (based on the usual care 
physiotherapists’ clinical experience and their assessment and treatment experience with the 
patient); life expectancy > 12 months; anticipated length of stay � 10 days from randomisa- 
tion; and able to maintain a standing position (with assistance of 1 person if necessary). 
Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: cognitive impairment likely to interfere 
with device use; insufficient English language skills with no available interpreter; inadequate 
vision to use devices; medical condition(s) precluding exercise; no interest in using devices; 
anticipated discharge to high care residential facility (nursing home); or discharge location too 
distant for follow-up. 

A staff member external to the trial prepared the randomisation schedule using randomly per- 
muted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6 and incorporating stratification for study site and health condi- 
tion (whether or not the person had a neurological health condition affecting mobility). 
Following written informed consent and baseline assessment, research staff completed web- 
based randomisation (allocation concealment) to determine group allocation. 

Both the intervention and control groups received usual rehabilitation care, which was deter- 
mined by the treating clinicians and included assessment and prescription of a series of repeti- 
tive exercises by the physiotherapist, tailored management by the multidisciplinary team, and 
a fall prevention brochure [16] (see Table 1). In addition, the intervention group was pre- 
scribed 30 to 60 minutes of digitally enabled rehabilitation 5 days per week in hospital and 
post-discharge, defined as rehabilitation using digital devices (e.g., virtual reality, wearables, 
and tablet and smartphone applications), with remote monitoring and communication post- 
discharge. The intervention group was prescribed exercises using virtual reality video games, 
activity monitors, and handheld computer devices to enhance mobility and physical activity. 
The exercises and devices were individually prescribed by a trial physiotherapist according to 
an intervention protocol that matched different task-specific exercises on different devices to 
common mobility limitations. The physiotherapist also considered participant impairments 
(e.g., upper limb weakness, hemianopia) and contextual factors such as participant goals, 
device preferences, and the home environment. Included devices were purchased by the 
research team or constructed for less than US$3,700 each. Participants could use any number 
of devices as guided by the physiotherapist. Devices were loaned to participants to use at home 
and were progressed or changed as required. For further details of usual care and the addi- 
tional intervention using digital devices, see Table 1 and S1 Text, and the published protocol 
[17]. 

Face-to-face outcome assessments were conducted at 3 weeks and 6 months after randomisa- 
tion and by mail or telephone at 12 weeks after randomisation. Outcome assessors were regis- 
tered health professionals trained in conducting the outcome assessments, external to the 
clinical sites, and blinded to group allocation. The face-to-face assessments were conducted in 
the hospital if the participant was still an inpatient, or at the post-hospital-discharge destina- 
tion (e.g., home, transitional living unit). Prior to the outcome assessor completing the

Clinical therapists were provided with information on the trial protocol 
and asked not to use devices to improve mobility or physical activity as 
part of their usual care intervention. 
Participants were (1) provided with a fall prevention brochure on 
discharge from hospital [16]; (2) provided with inpatient usual care at the 
3 study sites involving assessment and prescription of a series of repetitive 
exercises (e.g., practice of standing up or stepping); (3) referred to usual 
outpatient therapy as clinically required. Usual care also included 
assessment and tailored management by medical specialists, nurses, 
occupational therapists, speech pathologists, social workers, nutritionists, 
orthoptists, and other health professionals as required.

As planned, the intervention protocol was modified during the trial; 
version 2 (published 14 October 2015) and version 3 (published 23 
February 2016). Modifications included adding new games (e.g., Game 
Trainer for Nintendo Wii), a new iPhone application (Walk Forward), 
and upgrades of devices (e.g., software updates and rollout of a home- 
based version for Fysiogaming). Health coaching was initially prescribed 
weekly but changed within the first 6 months of the trial to ‘as required’ 
with a recommendation of weekly initially, reducing the frequency over 
time if the participant was managing well. This was modified due to 
experience in the trial and matched the tailored nature of the 
intervention (see S2 Text). 
Fidelity checking by site research managers (LH and MvdB) entailed 
observation of intervention sessions (inpatient and community), review 
of intervention data sheets with feedback/discussion, site weekly/ 
fortnightly team meetings, combined-site quarterly meetings with case 
studies, practical sessions with devices, review of intervention protocol, 
and regular phone meetings between site research managers. 






Clinical practice sheets were collected from staff at the 2 sites in New 
South Wales (where it was usual practice for therapists to provide practice 
sheets) to assess usual physiotherapy care. Participants were questioned 
regarding their device use at the time of hospital discharge, and at the end 
of the trial intervention. 
6-month assessment, the intervention devices were removed from participant homes and par- 
ticipants were reminded not to discuss their trial involvement with the assessor. 
Primary outcomes. The co-primary outcomes were mobility and physical activity 
(upright time) 6 months after randomisation. Mobility is a broad term that is defined as the 
ability to move around and change positions, such as to stand up from sitting and to walk. 
Mobility was assessed with the performance-based SPPB (continuous version), also known as 
the lower extremity continuous summary performance score, which uses actual time taken to 
complete mobility tasks [18]. Scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 3 (best performance) 
and are based on timed gait speed over 4 metres; standing balance with feet positioned parallel, 
semi-tandem, and tandem; and standing up from a chair 5 times. The SPPB has high levels of 
validity, reliability, and responsiveness in measuring mobility in older people living in the 
community, is increasingly used in trials involving older adults [19], and can predict falls risk, 
disability, and death [20]. The 12-point version of the SPPB is most commonly used, and 0.5- 
to 1-point changes have been suggested to be clinically meaningful. We used the continuous 
version as it has been suggested as more likely to be able to detect change [18]. 

period using the activPAL activity monitor (PAL Technologies, UK) [21]. The measure of 
physical activity was ‘upright time’, defined as the average proportion of the day spent standing 
and stepping, measured in 10-second minimum periods. Upright time was chosen as our pri- 
mary physical activity measure, rather than steps per day, as not all trial participants were 
expected to be able to walk independently, and we sought to use a measure that could be used 
at all study time points. 

3 weeks and 6 months after randomisation and participant-reported measures assessed at 3 
and 12 weeks and 6 months after randomisation. Performance-based measures of mobility 
included SPPB (continuous) at 3 weeks; SPPB total score (0 to 12 based on categorisation of 
performance times; higher score indicates better mobility; clinically important difference 0.5 
points) [15,20] and subscale scores (0 to 4) [19]; de Morton Mobility Index (0 to 100; higher 
score indicates better mobility; clinically important difference 7 to 8 points) [22–24]; single leg 
stance (0 to 10 seconds; greater time indicates better mobility); maximal balance range test 



(millimetres; greater distance indicates better mobility) [25]; and step test (number of steps; 
greater number of steps indicates better mobility) [26]. Performance-based measures of physi- 
cal activity included proportion of the day spent upright at 3 weeks, average time spent stand- 
ing and stepping, number of steps per day, and number of sit to stand transitions per day 
measured using the activPAL [21]. Performance-based measures of cognition included Trail 
Making Test A, B, and B − A (seconds; quicker time indicates improved cognition) [27,28]. 
Participant-reported measures included Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire 
(IPEQ) total score and home exercise and walking activity subscale scores (hours/week) [29]; 
Modified Computer Self Efficacy Scale (10 to 100; higher score indicates improved device self- 
efficacy) [30]; Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (0 to 100; higher score indicates 
improved confidence) [31]; WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (12 to 60; lower score 
indicates improved activity performance and participation) [32,33]; Short Form 6 dimensions 
questionnaire subscale scores and health utility score (0 to 1; higher score indicates better qual- 
ity of life; mean minimal important difference 0.041) [34,35]; and European Quality of Life–5 
dimensions subscale scores, visual analogue scale score (0 to 100), and health utility score 
(−0.68 to 1; higher score indicates better quality of life; minimal important difference 0.074) 
[35,36]. In addition, falls and health and community service usage were assessed over the 
6-month period. Adverse events in the intervention group and deaths in both groups were 
monitored and documented throughout the trial. Adverse events were defined as an unwanted 
and usually harmful outcome (e.g., fall, seizure, cardiac event) that may or may not be related 
to the intervention, but occurred while the participant was undertaking mobility or physical 
activities using intervention digital devices. Self-reported measures of device usability (System 
Usability Scale; 0 to 100; score above 70 indicates above average usability) [37,38] and enjoy- 
ment (Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale; 18 to 126; higher score indicates more enjoyment) 
[39] were obtained from the intervention group at 3 and 12 weeks and 6 months after 
randomisation. 

We estimated that a sample size of 300 participants (150 per group) would provide 90% power 
to detect a 15% between-group difference in the co-primary outcome measures, allowing for a 
20% dropout rate and an alpha of 5%. This sample size was also estimated to be sufficient to 
detect between-group differences of 10%–15% in most secondary outcomes and was consid- 
ered by the authors to be of meaningful size on the basis of our collective clinical experience 
with the measures. 
A statistical analysis plan was approved by the study statistician (SH) and chief investigator 
(CS) before data analysis, and no changes were made after this time (see S3 Text). Analysis was 
conducted by 2 investigators (CS, LH) blinded to group allocation for the co-primary outcomes 
using dummy codes for group allocation, created by a person external to the trial. The dataset 
analysed consisted of all randomised participants irrespective of intervention adherence (inten- 
tion-to-treat). Missing values were not imputed for the primary analyses. Between-group com- 
parisons for continuously scored outcomes were made using linear models with baseline scores 
entered as covariates. The distribution of continuous variables was evaluated to inform whether 
change scores were used for analysis. Fall rates between groups were compared using negative 
binomial regression. Two pre-specified sensitivity analyses were conducted for the co-primary 
outcomes; (i) not adjusting for baseline scores and (ii) adjusting for stratification variables. p- 
Values were not adjusted for multiplicity as we pre-specified that a significant effect must be 
observed on both primary outcomes to declare the intervention effective.

determine whether the effect of treatment differed significantly across categories for that vari- 
able. Analyses were performed using Stata software, version 14 (StataCorp).

Two human research ethics committees (HRECs) approved the trial (Southern Adelaide Clini- 
cal HREC and South Western Sydney Local Health District HREC). Six minor protocol 
amendments were approved by the ethics committees, 4 prior to the trial commencing (see S2 
Text). We prospectively registered the trial with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials 
Registry (ACTRN12614000936628). 

Between September 2014 and November 2016, 5,039 patients were screened, 715 patients were 
assessed as eligible, and 300 patients provided written informed consent and were randomised: 
149 to the intervention group and 151 to the control group (Fig 1). Six-month assessments were 
completed by 258 participants (control group: 129/151, 85%; intervention group: 129/149, 
87%). For the co-primary outcomes, there was an 85% (254/300) follow-up rate for mobility 
(data unavailable for 4 additional participants who refused to complete 1 or more test compo- 
nents) and an 80% (239/300) follow-up rate for upright time (data missing or excluded for 19 
additional participants due to <4 days wear time for activPAL device, n = 3; refusal/unable to 
wear device, n = 5; device initialisation/fault, n = 3; device lost, n = 4; missing data, n = 4). 
Baseline characteristics are presented in Tables 2 and S1. On average, participants spent 13 
days in the ward before randomisation (SD 16; median 8). Participants had a mean age of 74 
(SD 14) years, 50% were female, and 54% had neurological health conditions causing activity 
limitation. At baseline, participants had significant mobility limitation (mean [SD] SPPB total 
score 4.2 [2.6]) and spent little time standing or stepping (mean [SD] upright time 112 [90] 
minutes) (Table 3). Prior to hospital admission, 87% of participants could walk independently 
in the community and all but 1 could walk indoors. Thirty-nine percent of participants 
reported never using a computer, tablet, smartphone, gaming device, or activity monitor in 
the month prior to hospitalisation. 

Over the 6-month trial period, participants spent on average 19 days (SD 20; median 12) in an 
inpatient setting and 161 days (SD 18) in a post-hospital setting, typically at home. The total 
cost of the intervention (staff training, equipment, intervention preparation, and delivery) per 
participant was AU$1,892 (S2 Table). Intervention data are presented in Table 4. Intervention 
participants rated the usability of prescribed devices above average, and enjoyment as high at 
all time points (Table 3).

(inpatient setting: computer, n = 1; tablet, n = 2; activity monitor, n = 3; post-hospital setting:

Co-primary outcomes. Change in mobility scores were higher in the intervention group 
compared to the control group from baseline (SPPB [continuous, 0–3] mean [SD]: interven-

points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3; p = 0.006); however, there was no evidence of a difference between 
groups for upright time at 6 months (mean [SD] proportion of the day spent upright at 6 
months: intervention group, 18.2 [9.8]; control group, 18.4 [10.2]; mean between-group differ-

spent walking from 3 weeks to 6 months (IPEQ walking activity subscale, hours/week: 1.8, 
95% CI 0.6 to 3.0, n = 254; p = 0.004), and for change on 1 measure of cognition from baseline 
to 3 weeks (Trail Making Test A: −5.1 seconds, 95% CI −9.3 to −0.8, n = 283; p = 0.02). There 
was no evidence of a difference between groups in the number of steps taken per day from 
baseline to 6 months (mean between-group difference 646 steps per day, 95% CI −109 to 
1,402, n = 239; p = 0.09) or on any other secondary outcomes (Tables 5 and 6 and S4). Thirteen 
participants died while in the trial (intervention group: 9; control group: 4) due to causes unre- 
lated to the trial. The same number of participants reported falling 1 or more times in both 
groups (n = 53), and there was no difference between groups in fall rate (S5 Table). No adverse 
events, defined as incidents that occurred while participating in the intervention, were 
reported. 
Interaction analysis for primary outcomes indicated a greater effect of the intervention on 
mobility among those with poorer mobility at baseline (Tables 5 and S6). Exploratory analyses 
for secondary outcomes revealed consistently greater intervention impact in younger partici- 
pants (Tables 5 and 6 and S7).

We conducted a pragmatic, assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial in people with 
mobility limitations undertaking aged care and neurological rehabilitation recruited from 3 
Australian hospitals to investigate whether tailored prescription of affordable digital devices 
(including virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices) in 
addition to usual care could improve mobility and physical activity when compared with peo- 
ple undertaking usual care alone. There was no evidence of effectiveness of the intervention in 
accordance with our pre-specified definition that both primary outcomes needed to show sta- 
tistically significant between-group differences. However, significant and clinically relevant 
improvements in mobility were observed in participants receiving the AMOUNT interven- 
tion. The greatest improvements in mobility were seen at 3 weeks during hospital-supervised 
therapy. Between-group differences were still evident at 6 months despite the lower intensity 
physiotherapy support in the post-hospital period. All available devices were used, supporting 
our premise of a multi-device intervention over using a single device as in previous studies. Six 
of the devices were used across both inpatient and post-hospital care settings, and usability 
and enjoyment were rated highly. Taken altogether, these findings suggest that digitally 
enabled rehabilitation, supported by physiotherapists, is feasible and acceptable and can 
improve mobility outcomes. 
The mean between-group difference on our primary mobility measure at 6 months (0.2 
points) may be considered of clinical importance. A change of 0.54 on the 12-point version of 
the SPPB, i.e., 4.5% of the maximum value, has been suggested to be a small meaningful change

[20]. The between-group difference at 6 months in the present study represents 6.7% of the 
maximum value for the 3-point version; therefore, it may represent meaningful change. 
In the inpatient setting, participants received on average 41 minutes daily of additional 
rehabilitation using devices (Table 4). Approximately 60% of participants used the rehabilita- 
tion video games (Fysiogaming and the Humac Balance System), which enable the greatest 
customisation of task-specific mobility training. Our findings of improved mobility are consis- 
tent with previous systematic reviews demonstrating improved activity when a greater amount 
of task-specific practice is provided [4,5]. In contrast, our findings of improved mobility are 
different than those of the Cochrane systematic review of virtual reality interventions in people 
after stroke for the effect of additional virtual reality intervention on global motor function 
[11]. This is likely due to our multi-device intervention and detailed intervention protocol, 
enabling additional task-specific practice of a range of mobility tasks, compared to the lower 
limb trials in the review using 1 device, typically targeting balance. The range of health condi- 
tions and inclusion of younger participants in our trial may also explain the different findings; 
however, participants with neurological health conditions and participants with worse mobil- 
ity at baseline had the greatest improvements in mobility (SPPB total score), particularly at 3 
weeks. It is difficult to tease out the contributing role of both amount and type of practice; 
however, our results suggest that attention to quality and quantity of rehabilitation practice is 
important. 
Although the physical capacity of participants in the intervention group to move around 
improved, this did not translate to increased time spent upright. Yet there was an indication of 
more steps taken by intervention participants (p = 0.09; particularly younger participants, <76 
years, p = 0.05), greater self-reported walking, and more time spent stepping and less time 
spent standing compared to control participants. This finding matches the way the interven- 
tion was delivered, with a focus on increasing the number of steps per day using a Fitbit 
tracker, rather than on standing activities. Further exploration of trial activPAL data is under- 
way to better understand our findings and to help determine how best to prescribe physical 
activity in this population. 
The success of the intervention in improving mobility is likely due to the personalisation of 
the intervention, which targeted each person’s mobility limitations. The included devices were

piloted previously [13], tested by consumer and clinician investigators, and prescribed accord- 
ing to a detailed protocol developed by the investigator team using motor learning principles 
[40]. The right level of challenge, variety, enjoyment, and support to use the devices appears 
key to successful participant engagement [14,41]. 
Study limitations include 15%–19% loss to follow-up at 6 months on co-primary outcomes, 
as anticipated in this age group of hospitalised patients. Multiplicity is also a consideration due 
to the number of outcomes measured. Additionally, there was no statistically significant differ- 
ence in the important participant-reported outcome of health-related quality of life; however, 
the measures of this outcome were in the direction favouring the intervention group, which 
may reflect low statistical power to demonstrate significance for this outcome. There was 
greater time spent with therapists in the intervention group, which could account for the dif- 
ference between groups. However, as this was a pragmatic trial, we consider our choice of 
usual care and an enhanced program to be the correct comparison, and our trial found 



additional benefits of the enhanced program. Contamination was of concern prior to com- 
mencing the study; however, only a small number of control participants reported using 
devices for mobility or physical activity. Although the range of devices was a strength, accurate 
documentation of dosage was difficult because of differences in the types of output data (e.g., 
game time, repetitions), particularly at home. Development and testing of efficient solutions 
such as clinical dashboards that enable data from diverse sources to be integrated into a com- 
mon platform [42] may facilitate tailored use and monitoring of multiple devices in 
rehabilitation. 
Further research should investigate whether future models of rehabilitation care can incor- 
porate digital devices to enhance inpatient and post-hospital rehabilitation with a higher dose 
of practice whilst conserving quality. Hybrid type II effectiveness–implementation study 
designs [43] could be used to simultaneously test the effectiveness of the clinical intervention 
(digitally enabled rehabilitation) on patient outcomes and the effectiveness of implementation 
strategies (e.g., education and training) to support clinicians to include digital devices into 
practice. 
In summary, we observed improved mobility in participants with a wide range of health 
conditions in a digitally enabled rehabilitation environment, but no between-group differences 
in upright time. To enhance generalisability, we focussed on devices likely to be affordable for 
most rehabilitation services, with elements that could transfer into the community when the 
patient is discharged. Nevertheless, this was a complex intervention, with specialised equip- 
ment and expert staff, so further analyses including economic analysis will be important in 
understanding its acceptability to purchasers and providers of healthcare.
