Abstract 
Background: Psychological factors have been reported to affect chronic pain and may lead to inactivity after total knee 
arthroplasty. This study aimed to determine whether the use of an activity diary for goal setting during occupational 
therapy would reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical performance in patients after total knee arthroplasty. 
Methods: A total of 41 total knee arthroplasty participants from two cohorts were recruited in the study and allocated 
by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n ¼ 20) or the control group (n ¼ 21). 
Occupational therapy intervention (1–2 weeks postoperatively) to promote goal achievement was performed in both 
groups, and self-monitoring was performed in the diary group by using the activity diary. The outcome indices were 
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, pain (resting pain, walking pain), pain catastrophizing (rumination, help- 
lessness, and magnification), anxiety, depression, pain self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Data were evaluated by 
using analysis of variance analyses with post hoc tests. 
Results: A time-by-group interaction emerged for Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, pain 
catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and physical activity level (p < 0.05), both favouring the diary group. The diary group 
also showed greater improvement in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, anxiety, and physical 
activity levels at four weeks postoperatively, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: The use of the activity diary in this study increased occupational therapy effectiveness, reduced patients’ 
pain, and prevented a decline in physical performance. We believe that the use of an activity diary is an effective and 
feasible addition for total knee arthroplasty patients.

Based on an epidemiological survey regarding muscu- 
loskeletal chronic pain in Japan, the rate of complaints 
was 11.1%, and approximately 30% of patients with 
chronic pain have a history of morbidity (cid:2)5 years; 
additional patients continue to receive treatment 
(Nakamura, Nishiwaki, Ushida, & Toyama, 2014). 
Because of signiﬁcant increases in medical costs due

to musculoskeletal chronic pain, as well as social losses, 
there is an increasing need to prevent musculoskeletal 
chronic pain. 
Many musculoskeletal diseases that cause chronic 
pain are reported as lumbar diseases, with the excep- 
tion of osteoarthritis of the knee. Total knee arthro- 
plasty (TKA) may be the result of chronic pain in 
approximately 15% of cases 
(Ackerman, Graves, 
Wicks, Bennell, & Osborne, 2005). Despite surgical 
operation, urgent countermeasures are needed to pre- 
vent chronic pain and reduced physical activity. 
Negative psychological factors, such as anxiety, depres- 
sion, and pain catastrophizing, etc., have been reported 
to affect chronic pain after TKA (Sullivan et al., 2011). 
However, self-efﬁcacy is regarded as a positive psycho- 
logical factor for mitigation of pain catastrophizing 
(Wylde, Dixon, & Blom, 2012). van den Akker- 
Scheek, Stevens, Groothoff, Bulstra, and Zijlstra 
(2007) reported that self-efﬁcacy affected walking and 
pain after TKA. These prior studies indicated that pain 
catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression are related to 
chronic pain after TKA; and pain and self-efﬁcacy are 
related to the restriction of activity levels. 

We previously reported a relationship between 
Performance Measure 
Canadian Occupational 
after TKA 
(COPM) 
(Hiraga, Hirakawa, Hisano, & Shiota, 
2015). 
Notably, improvement in helplessness (i.e. helplessness 
in a painful situation) was recognised by occupational 
establishing the 
therapy (OT) practitioners after 
COPM goal 
in a quasi-randomised controlled trial 
(Hiraga, Hisano, Hirakawa, & Nomiyama, 2016). 
However, improvements were not observed in pain, 
rumination (i.e. attention to pain), or magniﬁcation 
(i.e. overestimation of pain threats) (Hiraga, Hisano, 
Hirakawa, & Nomiyama, 2017). Furthermore, it was 
not possible to examine effects on anxiety, depression, 
or physical activity in the prior studies. Therefore, it 
was necessary to develop OT treatment and practice 
protocols that addressed psychological 
factors for 
chronic pain after TKA. 
There have been recent studies of interventions in 
which chronic pain patients wear pedometers to self- 
manage activity, thereby avoiding increases in pain and 
enabling them to record daily activities (Hirase et al., 
2018; McDonough et al., 2013). We previously 
reported a case in which use of an activity diary togeth- 
er with OT resulted in improvement of pain, psycho- 
logical 
the protocol 
encouraged self-management of walking and pain 
(Hiraga et al., 2017). Importantly, it is necessary to 
clarify the effects of self-management with a daily 
activity record regarding pain, psychological factors, 
and activity levels. 

Therefore, we investigated whether the use of an 
activity diary for goal setting during OT would 
reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical 
performance in patients after TKA. 


This study comprised a non-randomised controlled 
trial. Patients were divided into: the diary group (OT 
plus activity diary) or control group (OT alone). 

All participants provided informed consent, and the 
study design was approved by the appropriate ethics 
review board at Fukuoka Rehabilitation Hospital 
(FRH 2014-R-010). 
Participants 
Power analysis. We used G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, 
Lang, & Buchner, 2007) to perform preliminary test 
force analysis and estimate the required sample size. 
The power was set at 0.8, and the signiﬁcance level 
(a) was set at 0.05 (Cohen et al., 1992). Effect size 
was set at 0.25, which constitutes a moderate standard 
for two-way analysis of variance. The power analysis 
indicated that 24 patients (12 per group) were required 
for pre- and post-evaluations. 
Target participants. Inclusion criteria were TKA per- 
formed between May 2014 and September 2016 in 
Fukuoka Rehabilitation Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan); 
45 patients were evaluated. Patients hospitalised May 
2014–June 2015 were assigned to the control group; 
those hospitalised July 2015–September 2016 were 
assigned to the diary group. Exclusion criteria included 
diagnosis of dementia and obvious mental illness (e.g. 
depression) that would interfere with completion of the 
questionnaire, as well as refusal to participate in OT. 
Additional exclusion criteria comprised postoperative 
complications (e.g. nerve injury and deep vein throm- 
bosis), other signiﬁcant medical diseases interfering 
with postoperative 
rehabilitation, previous TKA 
(TKA of the opposite limb and revision), and TKA 
performed for causes other than degenerative diseases 
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and bone necrosis). Two of 
the 45 patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 
43 TKA patients from two cohorts; these patients 
were allocated by convenience to either the experimen- 
tal group using an activity diary (n ¼ 21, four males, 
17 females; age: 76.1 (cid:3) 7.1 years) or the control group 
(n ¼ 22, two males, 20 females; age: 76.4 (cid:3) 5.4 years). 



received general anaesthesia; non- 
steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs were administered 
at a dose of 60 mg (three tablets per day) for two 
weeks postoperatively. All patients followed the same 
physical therapy and OT protocols after operation. All 
patients began physical therapy, including knee joint 
range of motion exercises 
(ﬂexion–extension) and 
stretching, on the ﬁrst day postoperatively. OT began 
at 1–2 weeks postoperatively for the purpose of 
improving everyday life. Patients were discharged 
upon the physician’s approval and on patient request 
at four weeks postoperatively. 

We used a previously reported method (Hiraga et al., 
2016) for goal setting and practice in the diary and 
control groups at 1–2 weeks after surgery. The imple- 
mentation procedure used COPM (Law et al., 1990) to 
list ﬁve target goals and determine the priority of the 
goals. After determining the priority order, we evalu- 
ated the performance of each goal with a 10-point scale 
(1: not possible; 10: very good). Satisfaction was also 
evaluated on a 10-point scale (1: not satisﬁed; 10: very 
satisﬁed). Performance and satisfaction scores were 
determined for each factor. 
In practice, the patient may write, ‘I want to be able 
to do the clean-up’. The patient starts with a low load, 
such as standing position, progresses to movement, and 
then practices using what is necessary for cleaning. 
Ultimately, this practice encourages the patient to 
achieve the goal 
in cleaning. All OT interventions 
required 40 min per day. 

We used an activity diary developed by Fukuoka 
Rehabilitation Hospital for intervention in the diary 
group (Hiraga et al., 2017) but not in the control 
group. The activity diary was designed to record date, 
steps, and pain (11 items) daily; this facilitates achieve- 
ment of activity goals while encouraging active self- 
management. A pedometer (Pleasure Walker PZ-150; 
Yamasa Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used to record 
the number of steps per day; the pedometer was 
attached to the foot of 
the non-operative side. 
Previous studies have reported that a pedometer 
attached to the foot is superior to a pedometer worn 
on the wrist for detecting the amount of activity 
(Rhudy & Mahoney, 2018). In addition, we focused 
on improving activity, rather than solely evaluating 
pain. Pain levels and comments were recorded in the 
activity diary, and we implemented a feedback protocol 
to enable patients to experience achievement. For 
example, if a patient commented, ‘I am in pain every 
day’, we asked ‘why do you have knee pain?’ ‘How can 
this be done easier?’. This feedback protocol was imple- 
mented to shift from negative to positive comments. 
Such intervention was incorporated into the OT pro- 
gramme of 40 min/day. Use of the activity diary began 
on Day 1 at the start of OT (Figure 1). 

The assessment was performed pre-OT (1–2 weeks post- 
operatively) and post-OT (4 weeks postoperatively). 

Pain. The numerical 
(Jensen, 
Turner, & Romano, 1994) was used to evaluate pain 
on an 11-point scale (0: no pain; 10: worst imaginable 
pain). Resting and walking pain were both assessed on 
the NRS. 

Pain catastrophizing. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
(PCS) (Sullivan, Bishop, & Pivik, 1995) was used to 
evaluate pain catastrophizing. The PCS comprises 
13 items and uses self-evaluation on three subscales: 
rumination, helplessness, and magniﬁcation. The 
patient evaluates the time spent on the condition on a 
ﬁve-point scale (0: not at all; 4: all the time). A high 
score indicates strong pain catastrophizing. 

depression. The Hospital Anxiety and 
Anxiety 
Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) 
was used to evaluate anxiety and depression; HADS com- 
prises 14 questions. The patient evaluates anxiety and 
depression, and how much time is spent in that state, 
on a four-point scale (0: not at all; 3: most of the time). 
HADS subscale scores were also evaluated in this study. 
Pain self-efficacy. The Pain Self-Efﬁcacy Questionnaire 
(PSEQ) (Adachi et al., 2014) was used to evaluate 
self-efﬁcacy for pain. PSEQ uses self-entry of scores 
for 10 items on a seven-point scale (0: not at all conﬁ- 
dent; 6: completely conﬁdent). 
Physical activity levels. An activity meter (Active Style 
Pro; OMRON Corp., Kyoto, Japan) was used to eval- 
uate physical activity. The activity meter was worn on a 
patient’s foot for 24 hours. Steps and physical activity 
were measured, and times for metabolic equivalents 
for physical activity. 
were calculated in minutes 
Previously, Ohkawara et al. (2011) found high reliabil- 
ity in the calculation of steps and physical activity 
levels using the Active Style Pro. 

We used t-tests to evaluate signiﬁcant differences in 
age, body mass index (BMI), and hospital inpatient

days. We used Chi-squared tests for group compari- 
sons in demographics such as gender, employment, 
smoking, and drinking. We analysed the effects of the 
intervention protocol on outcome measures using a 
2 (cid:4) 2 (time (baseline and pre- to post-OT) (cid:4) group 
(diary and control groups)) analysis of variance. Post 
hoc Bonferroni tests were used for speciﬁc compari- 
sons, and two-sided signiﬁcance was determined. 
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 
Statistics Version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 

Figure 2 presents a ﬂow chart outlining participation in 
this study. In total, 45 participants were screened for 
enrolment, and two failed to meet the inclusion criteria 
(n ¼ 2). We enrolled the remaining 43 participants in 
the study and non-randomly allocated each patient to 
either the activity diary group (n ¼ 21) or the control 
group (n ¼ 22). One patient from each group withdrew 
from the trial and could not be evaluated. A total of 20 
patients in the diary group and 21 patients in the con- 
trol group completed the study. All patients in the 
diary group completed the pain, number of steps, and 
comment categories of the diary. 

Table 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of 
patients. There were no signiﬁcant differences in age, 
sex, BMI, employment, smoking, drinking, goal set- 
ting, pain intensity, psychological status, or physical 
activity between the two groups. 

The length of hospital inpatient stay was signiﬁcantly 
better for the diary group than for the control group 
(31.4 (cid:3) 4.6 days versus 40.8 (cid:3) 13.0 days; p ¼ 0.002). 

Figure 3 presents the progress of activity diary use on 
daily step count and pain (11 items). Table 2 presents 
the interaction between the groups (time (baseline and 
pre- to post-OT) (cid:4) group (diary and control groups)). 
There were no signiﬁcant differences between group 
measurements for the diary and control groups in 
NRS rest pain score, PCS rumination score, PCS help- 
lessness score, or PSEQ total score. 

Table 3 presents the results of outcome measure- 
ments in the diary and control groups. The mean 
COPM performance and satisfaction scores post-OT 
were signiﬁcantly better for the diary group than for 
the control group (COPM performance: 8.6 (cid:3) 1.3 for 
the diary group versus 6.3 (cid:3) 2.7 for 
the control 
group, p ¼ 0.001; COPM satisfaction: 8.3 (cid:3) 1.9 for

and control groups revealed within-group (diary group) 
and between-group improvements in COPM perfor- 
mance score, COPM satisfaction score, NRS walking 
score, HADS anxiety score, daily step counts, and phys- 
ical activity time. Therefore, OT that included an activity 
diary was found to be beneﬁcial for patients after TKA. 
It is also meaningful that the number of days in the diary 
group was shorter than that of the control group. 
Harkin et al. (2016) reported on the use of an activ- 
ity log and found that when goals were set and progress 
was recorded, achievement was increased and addition- 
al goals were formed. Furthermore, use of education 
incorporating self-management showed that length of 
stay in hospitals were reduced (Yoon et al., 2010). In 
addition, Seminowicz et al. (2013) reported that feed- 
back resulted in improvement in positive emotion, pain 
catastrophizing, and mental health. Based on these 
studies, reporting negative comments such as stubborn 
pain in the comment section of an activity diary can 
result in improvement of activity levels and achieve- 
ment of goals. If consciousness changes from positive 
emotion to positive activity levels, improvement can be 
observed in the HADS anxiety score. Furthermore, the 
length of hospital stay was shortened. However, dete- 
rioration in physical activity was observed in the con- 
trol group, which may be related to the possibility of 
falling, particularly these patients may have exhibited 
fear avoidance (Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000). 
A previous study (Somers et al., 2012) demonstrated 
improvement in pain self-efﬁcacy after education and 
pain self-management programme at 24 weeks postop- 
eratively among knee osteoarthritis patients. The pre- 
sent study did not show any effects of activity diary use 
on pain self-efﬁcacy. This is likely because the course of 
OT practice with the activity diary was limited to two 
weeks. However, use of the activity diary produced 
various signiﬁcant effects within a relatively short 
period of time. This study directed patients in the 


self- 
diary group to use the activity diary for 
management, in order to achieve an established goal 
in physical activity and pain management. We found 
that the performance score, satisfaction score, NRS 
walking score, HADS anxiety score, daily step 
counts, and physical activity time had been improved 
with use of the activity diary in the OT protocol. 
The limitations of this study are that it was a longi- 
tudinal study with a non-randomised design. The long- 
term effects of using activity diary on activity limitation 
after chronic pain remain unknown as this study only 
examined short-term effects. Furthermore, the history 
effects of physical therapy and medication therapy 
were not considered, and future studies must investi- 
gate those factors. 

Our OT programme was previously shown to be effec- 
tive in improving psychological factors in Japanese 
TKA patients. Use of the activity diary in this study 
increased the effectiveness, reduced patients’ pain, and 
prevented a decline in physical performance. The OT 
programme and activity diary were also well accepted 
by TKA patients in this study. We conclude that the 
use of an activity diary is an effective and feasible addi- 
tion for TKA patients.
