Abstract 
Objective: To test if pedometers, as a motivational tool, could affect mobility outcomes in inpatient 
rehabilitation. 
Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. 
Setting: Subacute hospital rehabilitation unit in Australia. 
Participants: A total of 78 participants with reduced mobility and clinician-determined capacity to improve. 
Interventions: Both groups received usual care. For the intervention group, a pedometer was worn on the 
hip with the step count visible to participant and recorded daily on an exercise log. For the control group, a 
pedometer fixed shut was worn on the hip and they recorded estimated distances walked on an exercise log. 
Main measures: Primary outcome was functional mobility – De Morton Mobility Index. Secondary outcome 
measures were walking velocity, functional independence measure, time spent upright and daily step count. 
Results: Significant improvements over time (P < 0.001) in functional mobility, comfortable walking velocity 
and functional independence measure were not influenced by the intervention. The daily average upright 
time (hours) in the first week of intervention was different (P = 0.004) between the intervention group 
(median, interquartile range (IQR): 1.67, 1.77) compared to the control group (median, IQR: 1.12, 0.82). 
Conclusion: Pedometers as a motivational tool without targets do not improve functional mobility in 
this population. Pedometers may improve daily upright time in this setting.

Patients in rehabilitation spend a large amount of 
their time physically inactive.1–4 Although the opti- 
mal level of physical activity on rehabilitation 
wards is not established, it is likely that increased 
physical activity such as walking or time spent 
upright would be associated with improved mobil- 
ity outcomes for patients. Particularly, given that

studies to date indicate that more practice of a par- 
ticular task results in better performance of that 
task.5,6 Many strategies have been trialled to 
increase physical activity, improve mobility out- 
comes and ultimately decrease length of stay in 
inpatient rehabilitation. Additional staffing on the 
weekend has had mixed results.7–9 Other approaches 
such as the use of patient individualized timeta- 
bles,10 independent programmes,8,11 group therapy7 
and structured social programmes10 have been tri- 
alled to increase physical activity and improve 
mobility outcomes. None have displayed clinically 
significant changes in functional mobility. 
Pedometers are a device commonly used in the 
general population to motivate people to increase 
their daily physical activity.12 There is currently 
limited research available regarding the use of 
pedometers as a motivational tool in both acute and 
subacute settings.13,14 More research is becoming 
available about the use of accelerometers in a simi- 
lar role in inpatient rehabilitation with some posi- 
tive findings on daily walking time.15,16 A recent 
review in the stroke population found that activity 
monitors coupled with a targeted intervention did 
not increase step count compared to the targeted 
intervention alone;17 however, this does not inform 
the effectiveness of a pedometer as a stand-alone 
intervention, or the potential impact on clinically 
validated functional mobility measures. Low-cost 
pedometers have been observed to be less accurate 
than accelerometers especially at slower walking 
velocities;18 however, these disadvantages are 
arguably outweighed by availability and simplicity. 
While there is potential for use in rehabilitation set- 
tings there is currently a lack of research in this 
area.17,19 
The primary aim of this study was to test if 
pedometers as a motivational tool can affect func- 
tional mobility outcomes in inpatient rehabilita- 
tion. The secondary aims were to see if a pedometer 
increased incidental physical activity and time 
spent upright on the ward in the first week, and to 
measure the perceived benefit of the pedometer. 

This was a single blinded randomized controlled 
trial conducted from November 2016 until February 
2018 on a slow to recover rehabilitation unit of a 
secondary referral hospital (Launceston General 
Hospital, Tasmania, Australia). Ethical approval 
for this study was received from Tasmania Health 
and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee 
(approval number H0015819). The trial was regis- 
tered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical 
Trials Network (ACTRN12616001161415). 
The rehabilitation unit focuses on patients with 
lower initial functional independence measure 
scores and longer anticipated length of stay. All 
patients admitted to the unit were consecutively 
screened for inclusion by a rehabilitation physio- 
therapist. Those with reduced mobility, ability to 
walk a minimum of three metres with or without a 
gait aid or with or without assistance of one person, 
and a clinician assessed capacity for improvement 
were included in this study. Potential participants 
were excluded if they had either severe receptive or 
expressive dysphasia, a medical condition that pre- 
cluded exercise, were not admitted under rehabili- 
tation; or an anticipated length of stay of less than 
one week. Patients were considered eligible if their 
mobility status subsequently changed and they 
met all other inclusion criteria during the duration 
of their stay. 
All participants provided written consent to a 
researcher who was not part of the clinical treating 
team. Allocation into intervention or control group 
occurred using a computer-generated block ran- 
domisation sequence of six. The randomisation 
sequence was generated by a researcher not 
involved in recruitment or assessment. Group allo- 
cation was concealed using consecutively num- 
bered opaque envelopes, opened after completion 
of baseline assessment in the presence of the 
participant. 
All participants underwent two measurements 
sessions. Baseline measures were collected on entry 
into the study prior to randomisation to ensure 
blinded assessment, and repeated at discharge, by a 
physiotherapist blinded to group allocation. The 
primary outcome was functional mobility assessed 
using the De Morton Mobility Index. This is a valid 
and accurate measure of mobility within subacute 
rehabilitation.20 Secondary outcome measures 
included gait velocity assessed using the 10-metre 
walk test, and a pedometer satisfaction scale 


adapted from a similar study13 using five point 
Likert-type scales assessing perceived levels of 
enjoyment, helpfulness and ease of use of pedome- 
ter. Functional abilities measured by the functional 
independence measure on recruitment to study and 
discharge from the ward were also collected. All 
participants were monitored for the first week dur- 
ing the study using an accelerometer (activPALTM 
– PAL technologies, Glasgow, UK), which meas- 
ured time upright and steps taken between 8 am and 
8 pm. This time period was chosen to exclude inci- 
dental night time activity and to reflect expected 
time someone would wear day clothes. Daily num- 
ber of steps taken according to the pedometers were 
collected by allied health assistants and nursing 
staff, and then reset, ensuring the pedometers were 
fixed shut in the control group. Clinical and demo- 
graphic data such as gait aid used, walking assis- 
tance required, discharge destination and adverse 
events was also collected at recruitment and dis- 
charge of the study. 
Both groups received a Yamax Digiwalker 
SW200 pedometer (Yamax Corp., Tokyo, Japan), a 
pedometer well used in research with established 
validity.18,21,22 They were instructed to wear it on 
their waist band, in line with their arm pit. It was 
encouraged to be worn for all waking hours that a 
participant was in their day clothes for the duration 
of their rehabilitation stay. For the control group, 
the pedometer was fixed in a shut position so that 
the participants could not see the step count, 
whereas the intervention group could see the step 
count on the pedometer. All participants received 
usual care. This included individualized exercise 
prescribed by a physiotherapist, carried out by 
either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant in 
individual and/or group settings. In addition, all 
participants received an independent exercise pro- 
gramme with up to three to six exercises that they 
were encouraged to carry out independently or 
with supervision as required from family, visitors 
and staff. They were provided with a fresh exercise 
log each week. All participants had walking 
included as an exercise in this programme. 
Participants in the control group were asked to esti- 
mate the distance walked each day utilizing sup- 
port material provided, and the participants in the 
intervention group were asked to record the num- 
ber of steps taken at the end of the day as displayed 
on the pedometer. Family and nursing staff were 
asked to assist. The standardized wording to par- 
ticipants, family and staff was to ‘try to walk more 
each day’ and either ‘estimate distance’ or ‘record 
steps’. 
Changes in the De Morton Mobility Index, com- 
fortable and fast walking speeds, and functional 
independence measure were assessed using general 
linear model repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) (SPSS Statistics software, version 23) to 
compare the interaction of time and group alloca- 
tion over time. Daily time spent upright and daily 
step count on pedometers and accelerometers were 
analysed using Mann–Whitney tests. Study charac- 
teristics for both groups were compared using 
Mann–Whitney tests (for continuous variable) and 
chi-square test (for categorical variables). Perceived 
levels of enjoyment, helpfulness and ease of use of 
pedometer were analysed for the intervention group 
using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). 
The sample size for this study was based on a 
previous study conducted in a subacute rehabilita- 
tion setting with a similar cohort.20 It showed the 
median De Morton Mobility Index score was 30.2 
with a standard deviation of 16.7. Sample size 
estimation was based on the group achieving a 
minimal detectable change and clinically mean- 
ingful change of 10.5 points on the De Morton 
Mobility Index. With a two-tailed significance 
threshold of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 40 partici- 
pants were required in each group. To account for 
drop outs, 88 participants were recruited for this 
study. 

A total of 88 participants consented to take part in 
the study from 239 consecutively screened patients. 
Three withdrew prior to baseline assessment, 
therefore 85 participants were randomized and 
allocated to control or intervention group (Figure 
1) and included for analysis. In several outcome 
measures n < 85, due to missed data points when 
assessments were carried out. Seven people in the 
control group were aware of their step count at 




some point throughout the study but were assessed 
as per their allocation. Participants wore the 
pedometer for a mean (SD) of 22 (16) days in the 
intervention group and 23 (13) days in the control 
group. There were no significant differences 
between groups at baseline as shown in Table 1. No 
adverse events were recorded. 
Overall, there was a significant effect of time 
showing an improvement on the De Morton 
Mobility Index, but there was no effect of group 
allocation or interaction effect between time and 
group allocation. There was a significant effect of 
time resulting in an increase in functional inde- 
pendence measure score and comfortable walk- 
ing velocity. There was a significant effect of 
time and interaction effect between time and 
group allocation resulting in an increase in fast 
walking velocity for both groups to a similar 
speed (Table 2). There were no between group 
difference in discharge destinations, the length of 
rehabilitation admissions or the time the pedom- 
eter was worn. 
The daily average upright time between 8 am and 
8 pm was significantly longer for the intervention 
group. The pedometer significantly under-reported 
daily step count compared with that measured on the 
activPALTM (Table 3). Subsequently, the steps taken 
per day were significantly more for the intervention 
group when assessed with the activPALTM but not 
the pedometer. Overall, participants in the interven- 
tion group found the pedometer enjoyable (median, 
IQR: 4, 1), helpful for their recovery (median, IQR: 
4, 1) and easy to use (median, IQR: 4, 1). 

There was no significant difference in functional 
mobility outcomes between those who could and 
could not see the step count on the pedometer, 
although those who could see the count spent sig- 
nificantly longer in an upright position in the first 
week. 
No significant differences were found between 
groups on the primary outcome of functional mobil- 
ity. This may be due to lack of individualized tar- 
gets or reduced engagement secondary to inaccuracy 
of the pedometer. Apart from the consistent 
wording of ‘try to walk more each day’, there were 
no specific targets given to participants. This 
allowed the pedometer to be assessed as a stand- 
alone motivational tool. The feedback provided by 
allied health staff upon recording and collection of 
exercise logs and step counts was not standardized. 
In a recent study, standardized regular feedback 
around performance did not appear to affect physi- 
cal activity.23 In contrast, individualized goal set- 
ting around the number of steps appeared to be an 
important factor in increasing physical activity and 
step count.12,24 Perhaps, if targeted step count goals 
depending on age, mobility and impairment were 
used, similar to walking programmes done in the 
community, there may be a greater degree of change 
between groups. 
The majority of participants required a gait aid 
and/or a person to standby or assist with their 
mobility. This is of interest as most previous stud- 
ies in the community have excluded those that 
require gait aids.25,26 The need for assistance coin- 
cides with slow gait velocities as seen at baseline 
(Table 1). Recent studies have highlighted the inac- 
curacy of step counters below walking speeds of 
0.6 m/s,18,19 especially when worn at the hip. The 
accuracy has found to be improved with more 
recent activity monitors by wearing them on the 
ankle,27 allowing greater chance for the device to 
detect acceleration. A recent study15 did include 
participants with similar gait aid and level of assis- 
tance required for walking characteristics at base- 
line; however, they were investigating the use of 
accelerometer and its ability to motivate and pro- 
mote physical activity measured in walking time. 
They also concluded that upright time may be a 
more accurate measure secondary to low walking 
speeds. 
With the research on inaccuracy of pedometers in 
slower walking speeds increasing, pedometers may 
be demotivating. Those who saw their step counts 
on the pedometer may feel it did not reflect the num- 
ber of steps they had taken. This could reduce 
engagement with the pedometer and contribute to 
the lack of change in mobility outcomes between 
groups. Steps taken with the pedometer were not dif- 
ferent between groups, however, they were signifi- 
cantly lower than the number of steps detected with

the accelerometer. The lower pedometer step count 
may also be partially due to reduced time being 
worn by the participant compared with the acceler- 
ometer. As this was a pragmatic study looking at 
feasibility in a clinical setting, pedometers were 
donned once the participant was dressed for the day 
and then removed when they got ready for bed. The 
time worn was not explicit as it was for the acceler- 
ometer, hence they are not directly comparable. 
Average daily upright time and steps taken 
according to the accelerometer between 8 am and 
8 pm were significantly different between the two 
groups in the first week of intervention. The inter- 
vention group spent approx. 24 minutes more in 
an upright position and walked approx. 350 steps 
more daily than the control group. It is difficult to 
compare between studies as many use walking 
time or step count accelerometer data15,28 and do 
not specify the time that the accelerometer was in 
place. Although a recent randomized controlled 
trial15 found a statistically significant difference 
in walking time, the clinical significance of 
seven minutes more a day is unknown. Similarly, 
24 minutes has not translated into significant 
functional mobility changes. As highlighted in 
recent research, it may be that upright time is a 
better measure as slow walking speeds are not 
accurately captured on some accelerometers.19 
This is supported by other research finding that 
there is an increase in error differentiating between 
walking and standing times when gait velocity 
less than 0.67 m/s.29

Walking velocity has been used to predict if 
someone is a household ambulator, a limited 
community ambulator or a community ambula- 
tor.30 Both groups started within the limited com- 
munity ambulatory range (0.4–0.8 m/s), remained 
in this range for comfortable velocity and 
improved to the next category within fast veloc- 
ity. This demonstrates how limited a person’s 
mobility on discharge from subacute rehabilita- 
tion is as the average velocity required to cross a 
is approximately 1.2 m/s.31,32 
street 
Functional mobility required for discharge will 
likely limit walking speed and functional inde- 
pendence measure scores. Once people get to a 
certain functional status they will be discharged, 
so it is perhaps not surprising that they did not 
achieve faster walking speeds. This is a limita- 
tion within this population. 

A limitation in this study was a small number of 
participants in the control group became aware of 
their step counts for some part of the study when 
mistakenly written on their exercise log. This may 
have biased these people to be more physically 
active than they would have if they had not been 
provided with feedback on step count. This has 
proven difficult to monitor despite clear paperwork 
and perhaps reflects the nature of having multiple 
clinical staff – nursing and allied health involved 
with assisting in pedometer use. Despite this, it is 
not expected that this influenced the results. 
To our knowledge, there have been no other rand- 
omized controlled trials that have assessed the use of 
a pedometer as a motivational tool to improve func- 
tional mobility outcomes in a subacute setting. There 
have been increasing number of studies conducted in 
subacute rehabilitation using accelerometers or other 
technology to provide regular feedback about their 
walking ability. Only one of these has found a sig- 
nificant change in walking time,15 while others have 
found changes in walking speed.33 While pedometers 
are inexpensive and more accessible than accelerom- 
eters they do underestimate step counts. This may 
demotivate users to increase step-related activity. 
Small increases in upright time and steps taken do 
not appear to translate into improvements in func- 
tional outcome measures. Further studies are war- 
ranted using pedometers that are more accurate at 
slower walking speeds to assess if accurate feedback 
provides the motivation for patients to be more 
active, and if this in turn will result in improvements 
in functional outcomes.
