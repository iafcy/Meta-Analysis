BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of higher therapeutic exercise doses on walking during inpatient 
rehabilitation, typically commencing 1 to 4 weeks poststroke. 
METHODS: This phase II, blinded-assessor, randomized controlled trial recruited from 6 Canadian inpatient rehabilitation units, 
between 2014 and 2018. Subjects (n=75; 25/group) were randomized into: control (usual care) physical therapy: typically, 
1 hour, 5 days/week; Determining Optimal Post-Stroke Exercise (DOSE1): 1 hour, 5 days/week, more than double the 
intensity of Control (based on aerobic minutes and walking steps); and DOSE2: 2 hours, 5 days/week, more than quadruple 
the intensity of Control, each for 4 weeks duration. The primary outcome, walking endurance at completion of the 4-week 
intervention (post-evaluation), was compared across these groups using linear regression. Secondary outcomes at post- 
evaluation, and longitudinal outcomes at 6 and 12-month evaluations, were also analyzed. 
RESULTS: Both DOSE1 (mean change 61 m [95% CI, 9–113], P=0.02) and DOSE2 (mean change 58 m, 6–110, P=0.03) 
demonstrated greater walking endurance compared with Control at the post-evaluation. Significant improvements were also 
observed with DOSE2 in gait speed (5-m walk), and both DOSE groups in quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L) compared with Control. 
Longitudinal analyses revealed that improvements in walking endurance from the DOSE intervention were retained during 
the 1-year follow-up period over usual care. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first preliminary evidence that patients with stroke can improve their walking recovery 
and quality of life with higher doses of aerobic and stepping activity within a critical time period for neurological recovery. 
Furthermore, walking endurance benefits achieved from a 4-week intervention are retained over the first-year poststroke. 



best-practice stroke 
itation goals for individuals poststroke. Although 
rehabilitation guidelines 
globally recommend both aerobic exercise and task- 
specific therapy (ie, walking practice) to improve walking 
recovery,1,2 there are no studies to date that have system- 
atically investigated the optimal dose of exercise to maxi- 
mize walking recovery. A meta-analysis demonstrated 
that an increased dose of physical therapy may be ben- 
eficial to optimizing functional outcome; however, these 
studies focused on the hours of any types of therapy, 
and not specific aspects of exercise prescription, such 
as number of repetitions, which are known to influence 
motor learning.3 

The Determining Optimal Post-Stroke Exercise 
(DOSE) randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed 














to specifically address this knowledge gap. We inves- 
tigated whether 2 higher doses of task-specific, pro- 
gressive, walking-related exercise manipulated from 
the subject’s heart rate and step counter data within 1 
to 10 weeks poststroke was more effective than usual 
care at improving walking recovery. We hypothesized 
that our experimental higher dose programs would result 
in greater walking distance, as well as in improved sec- 
ondary outcomes of overall function and quality of life, 
over usual care. The population targeted individuals 
during their inpatient rehabilitation (typically occurring 
2–10 weeks poststroke), when neurological recovery is 
believed to be peaking. The seminal Copenhagen Stroke 
Study found that the vast majority of those with initially 
moderate stroke reached their best neurological recov- 
ery within 10.5 weeks for moderate stroke and 15 weeks 
for severe stroke.4 
METHODS 
Study Design 
The study protocol and design for this phase II multi-site RCT 
has been described elsewhere.5 In brief, this study used an open- 
label, parallel, single-blind (evaluators), 3-group design. Ethics 
approval was obtained from the university and hospital institu- 
tional review boards for each site, and subjects provided written 
informed consent. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviewed 
reports on adverse events and subject recruitment 3×/year. 
Patients 
Before commencing the research study, each site confirmed 
that the inpatient stroke rehabilitation physical therapy treat- 
ment approach included progressive, task-specific, exercise 
to promote upper and lower extremity functional recovery but 
did not focus on high repetition aerobic exercise. Consecutive 
patient admissions into each of the 6 study inpatient rehabilita- 
tion units over 3 provinces (G.F. Strong Rehabilitation Centre, 
Holy Family Hospital, Laurel Place, Carewest Dr Vernon Fanning 
Centre, Foothills Medical Centre, Riverview Health Centre) 
with a confirmed primary diagnosis of stroke (infarct or intra- 
cerebral hemorrhage) by a neurologist using either magnetic 
resonance imaging or computed axial tomography (CT scan) 
between March 1, 2014 to July 1, 2018, were screened, and 
as appropriate, followed for study eligibility. In Canada, patients 
are typically admitted to inpatient rehabilitation units once they 
are medically stable but have serious residual effects from the 
stroke and can tolerate at least 3 hours of activity per day (typi- 
cally 1-week poststroke or later). Inclusion criteria were within 
10 weeks poststroke with lower extremity hemiparesis (<4/5 
manual muscle grade in at least one of the major lower extrem- 
ity muscles); prestroke disability <2 on the modified Rankin 
Scale; ability to ambulate ≥5 meters with up to one person 
maximum assist and assistive/orthotic device as required; 
over-ground walking speed <1.0 m/s; able to understand and 
follow directions; >18 years of age; and successful completion 
of a graded exercise stress test using criteria established by 
the American College of Sports Medicine.6 Exclusion criteria 
were a prestroke health condition that included a gait disorder, 
another neurological condition (eg, Parkinson’s), serious medi- 
cal or painful condition (eg, active cancer), or enrolled in a drug 
or exercise rehabilitation study. 
Randomization and Masking 
At the completion of the baseline evaluation, subjects were 
randomized to an intervention group (Usual Care, DOSE1, or 
DOSE2) on a 1:1:1 ratio and stratified by age (<60 or ≥60), 
using a fully concealed internet-based dynamic allocation ran- 
domization that was generated in real time. All outcome evalua- 
tions were conducted by blinded study evaluators. 
Procedures 
Only 1 to 2 front-line physical therapists per site were trained to 
deliver the DOSE intervention (DOSE1 and DOSE2) and par- 
ticipated in a 4-hour protocol workshop. Weekly audits of the 
intervention data (ie, walking steps, time in heart rate zone, total 
time in physical therapy) were conducted by the site research 
coordinator for the DOSE1 and DOSE2 subjects to ensure that 
the protocol was being administered as designed. The other 
physical therapists were therefore responsible for treating the 
subjects randomized to Usual Care. 
Usual Care 
The control intervention consisted of usual care, inpatient phys- 
ical therapy which progressed upper and lower limb functional 
exercises as tolerated and typically provided 5, 1-hour sessions 
per week, until the subject was discharged (normally after 4–6 
weeks of inpatient rehabilitation). To quantify the actual exer- 
cise intensity, wearable sensors (Alpha Mio heart rate monitor 
wrist watch, MioGlobal, Vancouver and Fitbit One step counter, 
Fitbit, Inc, San Francisco) were worn during 10 of the sessions 
(sessions 6–15). These middle 10 sessions were selected as 
therapy sessions at the beginning and end of rehabilitation pri- 
marily include assessments and discharge planning. We have 
previously demonstrated the validity of the Fitbit One in captur- 
ing slow-walking steps poststroke in the study population when 
worn on the nonparetic ankle.7 The heart rate monitor watch 
collected total time in the therapy session spent at ≥40% heart 
rate reserve (HRR). Data obtained from the monitoring equip- 
ment was not disclosed to the subject or treating therapist. 
DOSE1 
The DOSE1 intervention replaced standard inpatient physical 
therapy session for a total of 20 sessions (1 hour/day, 5 days/ 
week, for 4 weeks). The therapist progressed the subject to 
(1) complete a minimum of 30 minutes at an intensity ≥40%

HRR, gradually progressing to >60% HRR by the end of the 
4 weeks; (2) achieve >2000 walking steps using the same 
monitoring equipment as the control group, but all 20 interven- 
tion sessions were monitored. Details of the DOSE intervention 
protocol, along with progression guidelines and algorithms can 
be found at https://neurorehab.med.ubc.ca/. The remaining 
time of the session was dedicated to other physical therapy 
activities specific to the subject’s recovery (eg, upper extremity 
exercises, instruction of home exercise program). 
DOSE2 
In addition to the DOSE1 activity (typically morning), the DOSE2 
group also received an extra, 1-hour exercise session, 5 days/ 
week, for 4 weeks, which occurred later in the day (ie, typically 
from 4 to 5 pm daily). The content of the second daily exer- 
cise session was similar to the DOSE1 protocol; it contained 
a minimum of 30 minutes of weight-bearing walking related 
activities; however, the remaining time within the hour session 
was dedicated to weight-bearing lower extremity exercises (eg, 
strengthening, balance exercises). The monitoring equipment 
was worn for all 40 intervention sessions. 
Intervention Protocol Fidelity 
Subjects were considered adherent to the intervention if they 
attended at least 75% of the sessions over the 4 weeks. To 
assess whether the 3 groups actually exercised at different 
intensities, data were averaged across the 10 middle inter- 
vention sessions (sessions 6–15 across each group) for 2 
indicators: Time spent (minutes) at ≥40% HRR, and number 
of steps (measured by the Fitbit step counter) in the exercise 
session(s) per day. 
Outcomes 
Subject characteristics, including age, sex, date and type of 
stroke, and stroke severity were collected at the baseline evalu- 
ation. All outcome measures were conducted at 4 time points: 
baseline, post-evaluation (end of the 4-week intervention and 
approximately 5 weeks after the baseline evaluation), 6- and 
12-month poststroke. 
The primary end point was the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) 
at the post-evaluation, which is a valid and reliable measure 
to assess walking endurance and recovery early after stroke.8 
During the 6MWT, the subject was instructed to cover as much 
distance as possible walking, using their customary walk- 
ing/orthotic devices, and the total distance (in meters) was 
recorded.9 If necessary for the walking outcome measures, 
the minimum amount of external physical assistance was pro- 
vided to the subject to maintain personal safety (up to 1 person 
maximum assist). Secondary outcomes at the post-evaluation 
were paretic maximal isometric quadriceps strength (paretic 
knee strength) measured from a handheld dynamometer10; 
5-meter walk test11; Berg Balance Scale12; Patient Health 
Questionnaire-913; and EQ-5D-5 L.14 An EQ-5D-5 L index 
score was calculated by applying the Canadian value set15 
across the 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain, anxiety/depression). In addition, each subject’s health 
value score (/100) was used, which is based on a visual ana- 
logue scale (VAS) with “0” being “the worst health you can 
imagine” and “100” being the “best health you can imagine”. 
Adverse Events 
Study staff reported any adverse events that occurred during 
the 4-week intervention or any outcome evaluation. Study sub- 
jects also self-reported any adverse events during follow-up 
phone calls (6- and 12-month evaluations). A serious adverse 
event was defined as an incident that was life-threatening, 
required hospitalization, and/or resulted in death. 
Statistical Analyses 
A priori, we identified a minimal clinical important difference of 
50 m between Usual Care and DOSE1 and Usual Care and 
DOSE2 at post-evaluation for the primary outcome (6MWT).16 
From this, we calculated that a sample size of 75 subjects (25/ 
group) was required to detect this change with 85% power, at 
0.05 alpha, and adjusted for an attrition rate of 15%. 


Therapeutic intensity (heart rate intensity and step count dur- 
ing the middle 10 intervention sessions) was compared across 
groups using an ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey test. 
Between-group differences for the primary and secondary 
measures at the post-evaluation were compared by multiple lin- 
ear regression, while controlling for the baseline score on each 
outcome centered on the mean.17 The intercept in each model 
can be interpreted as the estimated mean of the control group 
(Usual Care) at follow-up for the outcome in question, when 
the outcome value at baseline is equal to the mean (thus the 
centered value of the baseline score would be zero). R software 
was used for the analyses. 
Longitudinal modeling was undertaken for outcomes that 
had a significant relationship with the intervention (DOSE1 
and/or DOSE2) at the post-evaluation using linear mixed 
effects modeling, with a random effect for each subject. To 
test the null hypothesis that the initial improvement from the 
intervention was maintained at 6- and 12-month poststroke 
compared with Usual Care, an interaction term between time 
and intervention group was included in each model. Because 
of the challenges of longitudinal models with small sample 
sizes,18 DOSE1 and DOSE2 were collapsed into one group 
(DOSE) and compared with Usual Care. Time was included 
as a categorical variable (post-evaluation, 6, 12 months) to 
allow for a nonlinear slope of recovery with the initial fol- 
low-up as the referent category. Baseline scores for the 
outcome of interest were included in all models. The pack- 
age lme4: Linear Mixed-Effects Models used “Eigen” and S4 
(R software), which utilizes all available data and has been 
demonstrated to be valid in the presence of data missing at 
random.19 
To explore the mechanism of missing data, the relationships 
between demographic (age, sex) and stroke-related function 
(6MWT, 5-meter walk, EQ-5D-5 L VAS) with loss to follow-up 
were assessed using bivariable logistic regression to compare 
the population lost to follow-up (those missing at 6 and 12 
months) to those who completed follow-up.

RESULTS 
Between March 2014 and July 2018, 2387 patients 
with stroke were admitted to participating study sites, of 
which 2141 of them were assessed for study eligibility. 
The 3 most frequent reasons for exclusion upon patient 
interview/chart screening were that the patient did not 
have leg hemiparesis (n=606); had a stroke >10 weeks 
on rehabilitation admission (n=315); or was unable to 
ambulate 5 meters (n=208). Seventy-five subjects were 
randomized to Usual Care (n=25), DOSE1 (n=25), or 
DOSE2 (n=25). One subject (randomized to DOSE2) 
completed the baseline, but not the post-evaluation, 
because of ongoing investigational work for a suspected 
cardiac arrhythmia, which resulted in discontinuation of 
the protocol and further evaluations. After the 12-month 
post-evaluation, one subject was found to not meet the 
inclusion criteria of having a primary diagnosis of stroke 
and their data were removed from the study. Please see 
Figure 1 for subject recruitment and flow. 
Descriptive characteristics for the 74 subjects are dis- 
played in Table 1. At the baseline evaluation, there were 
similarities across all groups with respect to mean age, 
time from stroke to study randomization, and 5-meter 
walking velocity. The mean baseline 5-meter walking 
velocity (SD) was 0.42 m/s (0.24), 41% were female, 61 
had an ischemic stroke, and subject randomization to an 
intervention group was within 4-weeks poststroke. These 
baseline characteristics are similar to other stroke reha- 
bilitation trials conducted.20 Based on logistic regression 
results, none of the tested variables were statistically sig- 
nificantly associated with attrition at 12 months (Table I 
in the Data Supplement). 
Intervention Protocol Fidelity 
The DOSE1 intervention session was designed to be 
≈1 hour in duration, matching the customary inpatient 
rehabilitation physical therapy duration. On average, the 
duration of the sessions was (mean [SD]): (1) Usual 
Care=44 (12) minutes; (2) DOSE1=52 (5) minutes; and 
(3) DOSE2=104 (15) minutes (51 [6] minutes for ses- 
sion 1 and 53 [8] minutes for session 2). 
A total of 226/240 sessions (94%) from Usual Care, 
494/500 sessions (99%) from DOSE1, and 904/960 
(94%) sessions from DOSE2 were completed. One subject 
in the study (from DOSE2) was discharged from inpatient 
rehabilitation within the first 2 weeks of the intervention 
(after completing 18/40 sessions) and was not able to con- 
tinue the intervention secondary to the remote discharge 
destination. All other subjects were adherent to the proto- 
col, completing at least 3 weeks (75%) of the intervention. 
There was a significant group effect on the 2 intensity 
variables measured: total time spent in an aerobic training 
zone (≥40% HRR) within the therapy session and total 
steps taken within the therapy session, with all 3 groups 
being significantly different from one another (P<0.005; 
Table 2). On average (mean [SD]), the Usual Care sub- 
jects spent 11 (9) minutes, DOSE1 subjects spent 27 
(11) minutes, and DOSE2 subjects 52 (24) minutes 
within an aerobic training zone (≥40% HRR). The mean 
step count (SD) for Usual Care was 580 (440) steps, 
while DOSE1 subjects walked more than double (2169 
[1106] steps), and DOSE2 subjects walked more than 
quadruple (4747 [2083] steps) compared with Usual 
Care. The Usual Care activity was similar to audits of 
other Canadian inpatient stroke rehabilitation settings.21 
POST-EVALUATION 
Primary Outcome 
The primary outcome, the 6MWT, was completed by 74 
subjects at baseline and 73 subjects at post-evaluation 
(97% completion rate; Table II in the Data Supple- 
ment). When controlling for the baseline 6MWT, the lin- 
ear regression model (Table 3) demonstrated that both 
DOSE1 (mean difference [meters] from Usual Care [95% 
CI], P-value; 61 m, 9–113, P=0.02) and DOSE2 (58 m; 
6–110; P=0.03) walked a statistically and clinically sig- 
nificantly greater distance than Usual Care subjects. 
Secondary outcomes 
A summary of the secondary outcomes is displayed in 
Table II in the Data Supplement. Significant differences 
between the Usual Care and DOSE groups were observed 
with the 5-meter walk and both the EQ-5D-5 L Index and 
VAS scores at the post-evaluation, but not for paretic knee 
strength, Berg Balance Scale or Patient Health Question- 
naire-9 (Table 3). For the 5-meter walk, a significant differ- 
ence was only observed between Usual Care and DOSE2. 
For the EQ-5D-5 L VAS score, a significant increase 
was seen with both DOSE1 (mean difference from 
Usual Care [95% CI], P-value; 9.00 points, 1.11–16.88, 
P=0.029) and DOSE2 (11.51 points, 3.79–19.23, 
P=0.005) over Usual Care. Similar findings were also 
observed with the EQ-5D-5 L index score, with both 
DOSE1 and DOSE2 having significant increases com- 
pared with Usual Care (DOSE1=0.11, 0.05–0.17, 
P=0.001; DOSE2=0.11, 0.05–0.17, P=0.001). 
LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES 
DOSE1 and DOSE2 were collapsed into one group 
(DOSE) and compared with Usual Care for the follow- 
ing reasons: (1) our apriori hypothesis was focused on 
comparing higher doses to standard of care5; (2) we 
anticipated that longitudinal models with small sample 
sizes could cause convergence problems18; and (3) our 
primary analyses showed that the mean changes for the 
DOSE1 and DOSE2 groups were similar in direction and

*After completion of the study, one subject in Usual Care was found to not meet the inclusion criteria of having a primary diagnosis of stroke. 
Therefore, this subject’s data were not included in the demographic or statistical analyses. **One subject in Determining Optimal Post-Stroke 
Exercise2 (DOSE2) did not complete the intervention. During this subject’s fifth intervention session, he was clinically asymptomatic, but the heart 
rate monitor could not accurately capture his heart rate. Suspecting an undiagnosed irregular cardiac arrhythmia, the subject was removed from 
the trial by the study investigators and referred for follow-up cardiology. Although his follow-up results were negative for any cardiac condition, it 
was too late at this point to resume his intervention. 
magnitude. At the 6-month follow-up, 66 subjects (89%) 
completed the 6MWT, 5-meter walk, EQ-5D-5 L Index, 
and EQ-5D-5 L VAS (Table II in the Data Supplement). 
At the 12-month follow-up, 57 subjects (77%) completed 
the 6MWT and 5-meter walk and 58 subjects (78%) 
completed the EQ-5D-5 L Index and EQ-5D-5 L VAS.

poststroke, the DOSE groups were able to maintain their 
improvements in the 6MWT over Usual Care (mean dif- 
ference [meters] from DOSE [95% CI], P-value) at the 
6- and 12-month evaluations as the time and group 
interaction term was not significant (6 months=−29.72, 
−71.33 to 11.89, P=0.162; 12 months=−33.55, −78.26

during the 4-week intervention; (2) myocardial infarc- 
tion reported at 12-months poststroke, and 2 DOSE 
subjects reported an serious adverse event at 6-month 
poststroke: (1) recurrent stroke and (2) leg fracture from 
a fall on ice. The subject with a transient ischemic attack 
returned to the rehabilitation hospital and completed the 
remaining evaluations, but the others did not complete 
their remaining evaluations. 
Secondary Outcomes at 6- and 12-Month 
Follow-Up Evaluations 
DOSE subjects maintained their improvements in the 
EQ-5D-5 L VAS at 6 months from the post-evaluation 
(mean difference from DOSE at post-evaluation [meters; 
95% CI], P-value; −5.12, −13.73 to 3.49, P=0.244), but 
by 12 months, the time and group interaction was statis- 
tically significant (−10.08, −19.16 to −1.00, P=0.029; 
Figure 2; Table 4) indicating that the gains were not 
maintained. The initial improvements by the DOSE group 
in the 5-meter walk and EQ-5D-5 L index observed at 
the post-evaluation do not seem to be maintained over 
the year following stroke based on the crude data and 
longitudinal modeling (Figure 2; Table 4). 
Adverse Events 
Two Usual Care subjects experienced an serious adverse 
event: (1) hospitalization for a transient ischemic attack 
DISCUSSION 
We systematically investigated the dose effect of exer- 
cise on walking and functional recovery in the early 
phase after stroke (1–10 weeks) with a 97% completion 
rate of our proposed sample size of the primary outcome 
(6MWT) at the primary end point (post-evaluation). We 
demonstrated that a 4-week exercise program with high 
movement repetitions (step counts) and greater exer- 
tion (heart rate) can immediately result in greater walk- 
ing recovery and improved quality of life, compared with 
usual care, for stroke survivors. The improvements were 
meaningful for both DOSE groups, which exceeded the 
minimal clinically important difference for the 6MWT (50 
m),16 and EQ-5D index score (0.102).22 
The 60-minute DOSE1 session was consciously 
designed to optimize the future translation of the pro- 
tocol into clinical practice. The DOSE1 protocol encom- 
passed all activities of a typical 60 minute Usual Care

physical therapy session (including upper extremity 
activities), without having to add on time. To respect the 
therapist’s professional competencies in developing an 
effective program, therapists were encouraged to use 
their clinical judgment to select appropriate exercises for 
their patient, as long as they integrated the targets for 
step counts and heart rate into their activities. Therapists 
used a wide range of stepping activities, including, but 
not limited to: walking intervals, stair climbing, walking 
obstacle courses, and body-weight supported treadmill. 
poststroke, and approximately three-quarters of sub- 
jects were dependent on physical assistance to walk at 
the baseline evaluation. Qualitative investigations of the 
DOSE protocol showed that although subjects and ther- 
apists expressed positive experiences toward the high 
intensity intervention, therapists were often surprised at 
how hard subjects could work and tolerate the intensive 
regimen.23 Therapists felt that the use of heart rate moni- 
tors and step counters as objective measures increased 
their confidence to push people harder.23 
Our higher intensity protocol was well tolerated 
by subjects, of which some were only 1- or 2-weeks

from Usual Care, and then as well with DOSE2, at least 
quadrupling the intensity from Usual Care. The high 
number of walking steps used in this study to improve 
walking recovery (DOSE1:2169; DOSE2:4747 steps) is 
consistent with the thousands of functional, challenging, 
repetitions observed in the animal model studies to pro- 
mote neurological changes.24 However, the effects were 
not necessarily additive, and some physical outcomes did 
not demonstrate any benefits. There were no differences 
between groups with respect to recovery of balance, as 
measured by the Berg Balance Scale. This may be sec- 
ondary to subjects within all groups receiving a similar 
challenge in their physical therapy sessions with respect 
to balance exercises or due to a ceiling effect of the bal- 
ance measurement scale (Berg Balance Scale). There 
was also no effect on paretic quadricep muscle strength, 
which is likely because of the focus of the protocol on 
stepping, rather than high force generation. 
Both DOSE1 and DOSE2 exceeded 50 m on the 
6MWT over the control group immediately following the 
4-week intervention, which is considered a meaning- 
ful clinical change in this measure early after stroke.16 
DOSE2 intensity was double that of DOSE1 and resulted 
in greater gait speed measured by the 5-meter walk, but 
a similar response was not seen with walking endurance, 
as measured by the 6MWT. Perhaps the extra walking 
practice completed by subjects in the DOSE2 interven- 
tion contributed to improved performance over shorter 
walking distances (ie, 5-meter walk), but further training 
duration beyond the 4-week intervention protocol may 
be necessary to see the increased gait speed translate 
to improvements in gait endurance (6MWT). 
Despite no additional physical therapy or physical 
activity counseling occurring beyond usual care after 
completing the 4-week intervention, both DOSE subjects 
and Usual Care continued to improve in the 6MWT at the 
same rate (ie, slope) until 12 months. Since the DOSE 
subjects start at a higher 6MWT value at 4 weeks, they 
end at a higher value at 12 months compared with Usual 
Care. This suggests that walking endurance improve- 
ments obtained during a time of critical neurological 
recovery may be retained long term. 
Prior research has been inconclusive on the efficacy 
of aerobic activity in improving quality of life poststroke.25 
Thus, our results demonstrate that aerobic walking activ- 
ity can improve quality of life, with both DOSE groups 
having benefits over Usual Care. Although these ben- 
efits were not retained to the 1-year follow-up evalua- 
tion, this may be attributed to the many other factors (ie, 
social supports, coping strategies, depression, cognitive 
function) that are known to contribute to quality of life 
as patients poststroke reintegrate into the community.26 
Although DOSE2 demonstrated significant improve- 
ments over Usual Care in walking velocity (5-meter walk) 
at the post-evaluation, there was no significant differ- 
ence between the groups (Usual Care, DOSE1, DOSE2)

of the protocol, and will help to replicate the protocol for 
future implementation. 
The doses were distinctly increased with DOSE1, at 
least doubling the heart rate and step count intensity

‡Tests the null hypothesis that the effect of the intervention is maintained compared with Usual Care. A significant P-value (<0.05) for the Time×Group Interactions indicate that the effects 

in this measure by the 12-month evaluation. All 3 groups 
continued to have improvements in their walking velocity 
over the first year poststroke and have similar walking 
speeds at 12 months (1.07, 1.04, 1.11 m/s, respectively). 
As these walking speeds are nearing normal walking 
velocities for healthy individuals of a similar age (≈1.3 
m/s),27 there may be a ceiling to the walking speed that 
can be obtained within the first year poststroke. 
A number of study limitations do exist for this study. 
Although our study was a multisite, multiprovince trial, 
the study needs to be replicated with a larger sample 
size. With respect to our subject recruitment, we included 
individuals that could ambulate at least 5 meters with up 
to 1-person maximum assist, so subjects commenced at 
times ranging from 1 to 9 weeks poststroke. However, 
despite subjects starting the intervention at slightly dif- 
ferent times, we did see significant improvements with 
the intervention groups. The therapy sessions for both 
DOSE1 and DOSE2 were ≈10 minutes longer than 
Usual Care because the protocol dictated the duration 
of the DOSE sessions while the Usual Care duration var- 
ied depending on the site’s usual practice. It would be 
extremely unlikely, based on the subjects’ baseline walk- 
ing velocity (0.42 m/s) that the additional 1500 steps 
undertaken by the DOSE groups in their physical therapy 
sessions could be accounted for if an extra 10 minutes 
was provided in the therapy session. Also, our subjects 
mean age was younger than typical stroke. Although 3/6 
sites recruited subjects with a higher mean age (65, 69, 
and 73), the majority of our subjects were recruited from 
the remaining 3 sites that had a lower mean age (49, 54, 
and 57) secondary to a mandate for admitting younger 
adults with stroke. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A 4-week exercise program, which has at least double 
the aerobic and step intensity of usual care delivered 
during stroke inpatient rehabilitation, is safe and feasible, 
and results in improved walking recovery and quality of 
life. The use of low-cost commercially available wearable 
sensors to monitor and set intensity targets will enable 
the replication and implementation of this protocol.
