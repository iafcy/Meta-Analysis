Abstract 
Background Early mobilization is one essential item within the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept, but lacks solid 
evidence and a standardized assessment. The aim was to monitor and increase the postoperative mobilization of patients after 
major visceral surgery by providing a continuous step count feedback using activity tracking wristbands. 
Methods The study was designed as a randomized controlled single-center trial (NCT02834338) with two arms (open and 
laparoscopic surgery). Participants were randomized to either receive feedback of their step counts using an activity tracker 
wristband or not. The primary study endpoint was the mean step count during the first 5 postoperative days (PODs). 
Results A total of 132 patients were randomized. After laparoscopic operations, the average step count during PODs 1–5 was 
significantly increased by the feedback compared with the control group (P < 0.001); the cumulative step count (9867 versus 
6103, P = 0.037) and activity time were also significantly increased. These results could not be confirmed in the open surgery 
arm. Possible reasons were a higher age and significantly more comorbidities in the open intervention group. Patients who 
achieved more than the median cumulative step count had a significantly shorter hospital stay and lower morbidity in both arms. 
The average step count also correlated with the length of hospital stay (R = − 0.341, P < 0.001). 
Conclusion This study is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the use and feasibility of activity tracking to monitor 
and enhance postoperative mobilization in abdominal surgery. Our results demonstrate that activity tracking can enhance 
perioperative mobilization after laparoscopic surgery.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs aim to 
minimize postoperative stress and accelerate postoperative 
recovery.1–3 ERAS protocols have resulted in significantly 
shorter length of hospital stay and overall complications in 
colorectal surgery,4 and consequently have been established 
in other fields, such as hepatopancreatobiliary and esophageal 
The data were presented at the annual meeting of the European Surgical 
Association (ESA) in Trieste on May 12, 2018.

surgery.5–11 A majority of the ERAS elements are well de- 
fined, whereas there is a lack of evidence for early mobiliza- 
tion protocols and their monitoring. Current ERAS guidelines 
for colonic, rectal, pancreatic, and pelvic surgery recommend 
early postoperative mobilization for up to 6 h out of bed and 
its monitoring by the use of diaries or simple monitoring de- 
vices, although randomized clinical trials have not yet clearly 
supported a beneficial effect of postoperative mobilization.3 
Compared with colorectal surgery, patients who undergo ma- 
jor oncological visceral (abdominal) surgery, including 
hepatopancreatic or gastric resections, may not achieve equal 
mobilization targets in the early postoperative period. In fact, 
studies reporting on early mobilization targets did not discrim- 
inate between the extents of surgery.12–15 We recently found 
that many of these patients do not achieve common ERAS 
mobilization targets when mobilization was assessed diary- 
based. This study also pointed out that almost 50% of the 

patients lacked intrinsic motivation for enhanced postopera- 
tive mobilization following major abdominal surgery.16 
Consequently, novel or innovative methods have to be evalu- 
ated to establish an objective and accurate monitoring of pa- 
tient mobilization, and to increase the intrinsic motivation for 
early mobilization after major visceral surgery. One such pos- 
sibility is the usage of activity tracker devices. In line with this, 
a cohort trial reported a significant relationship between the 
early recovery step count and the length of hospital stay in 
elderly, cardiac surgery patients.17 The aim of the present 
study is to assess postoperative mobilization of patients and 
the effect of an (auto-) feedback system using activity trackers, 
versus no feedback on postoperative step count and recovery 
after major visceral surgery. 


The enhanced perioperative mobilization (EPM) trial is a ran- 
domized, controlled, single-center, two-arm (open and laparo- 
scopic surgery) trial, comparing the effect of continuous auto- 
feedback plus feedback from the study team on postoperative 
physical activity using activity tracker wristbands after open 
and laparoscopic major visceral surgery. The trial design is in 
accordance with the SPIRIT statement and a detailed study 
protocol was published recently.18 This study was registered 
on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02834338) and approved by the 
local Ethics Committee of the TU Dresden (decision number 
EK226062016). There was no external funding for this trial. 
The study results were reported in line with the CONSORT 
guidelines. 

In brief, the study population consisted of all patients sched- 
uled for elective open and laparoscopic surgery of the colon 
and rectum (colectomy, hemicolectomy, segment resection, 
rectum extirpation, deep anterior rectum resection, sigmoid 
resection, proctocolectomy), of the stomach (total, subtotal, 
and atypical gastric resections), of the pancreas, and of the 
liver (hemihepatectomy, atypical resection, anatomical seg- 
ment resection). According to the ERAS concept, minimally 
invasive surgery was preferred over open surgery. Selection 
for open surgery was based on the following criteria: previous 
major abdominal operations, locally advanced tumors, pan- 
creatic head resection, or major anatomic hepatic resections 
(e.g., extended hemihepatectomy). All patients were treated 
within an ERAS setting in accordance with current 
guidelines.16 Further inclusion criteria were age between 18 
and 75 years, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) 
score < IV, and a completed informed consent. Exclusion 

criteria were emergency surgery, mental inability to complete 
postoperative assessment protocols, or preoperatively immo- 
bile patients. Reasons for dropout from the study were cases of 
non-resectability, postoperative mechanical ventilation > 12 h, 
prolonged stay in the intensive care unit > 48 h, lack of com- 
pliance with the wearing of the activity tracker wristband, or 
allergic reactions from the wristband. Preoperative mobility of 
all participants was assessed using the International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).19 

The study is based on the superiority hypothesis that a contin- 
uous feedback of the daily activity during the first 5 postop- 
erative days (PODs) following major visceral surgery using 
activity tracking wristbands (intervention) results in a higher 
mean daily step count, compared with no activity tracking 
feedback (control). Consequently, the primary endpoint of 
the study was the average step count during the first 5 PODs 
in the intervention (feedback) and control groups, respective- 
ly. Secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients in the 
two groups who mastered predefined mobilization (step 
count) targets, the assessment of the activity data from the 
devices (cumulative step count, activity time), length of hos- 
pital stay, the number of patients who received physiotherapy, 
30-day mortality, and the 30-day overall morbidity.20 
The wristbands were continuously worn after the operation 
to record and monitor the patients’ steps until the beginning of 
POD 6. The Polar Loop activity tracker with the Flow Sync 
and Polar flow software was used for activity tracking (Polar 
Electro GmbH, Germany). The device was approved by the 
Medical Devices Act (EU Medical Device Directive 93/42/ 
EWG/CD 0537) and is recommended for medical use. 
Patients in the control group wore an activity tracker wrist- 
band with a blinded display, using adhesive tape to prevent 
auto-feedback of the step count status. The study nurses 
checked the complete coverage of the display a few times 
daily. The intervention group received an unblinded wrist- 
band. The handling of the activity trackers was explained to 
the patients in detail and a predefined mobilization target (step 
count) for each of the first 5 PODs was communicated. The 
daily target step count was set at the 85% quartile, obtained 
from our previous pilot study18 (Table 1). A surgical fellow or 
a study nurse assessed and monitored the patients in the 













Data represent the 85% percentile of the daily step count generated in a

intervention group twice daily between 09:00 and 11:00 and 
between 15:00 and 17:00 during the first 5 PODs to read out 
the step count, to ensure its proper use and functioning, and to 
communicate the step count results to the patients (feedback). 
These visits were implemented to ensure that the patients were 
aware of their current step count and targets. 

To avoid a systematic bias because of different surgical ap- 
proaches and stress responses, two study arms were generated 
before randomization (open versus laparoscopic). The ran- 
domization (control versus intervention group) was performed 
intraoperatively after the surgeon had confirmed the re- 
sectability, using a block randomization with fixed block 
sizes in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomization se- 
quence was generated using the R statistical software 
package (R version 3.1.3, the R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing). The block size was kept confidential until 
completion of the recruitment. 

Based on a previous pilot trial,18 an assumed difference in step 
count of 250 steps daily (intervention group versus control 
group) was estimated. These 250 steps/day were the differ- 
ence between the 85% percentile and the median (50% per- 
centile) of the daily step count in the pilot cohort (see Table 1). 
Thus, the hypothesis for sample size calculation was that ac- 
tivity tracking feedback could enhance the daily step count 
from the 50% to the 85% percentile. 
To achieve an 80% power with a two-sided P value of less 
than 0.05, and a dropout rate of 12%, the total sample size was 
calculated by a two-tailed unpaired t test and resulted in 120 
patients with 30 patients in each group. 
Statistical analysis was based on an intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis and was performed with the Statistical Package for 
Social Science (version 18.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) software. 
The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare continuous 
variables, and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical 
variables. The difference in daily step counts between the 
groups was compared using the two-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) test. Logistic regression analyses were computed to 
identify factors determining the patient cohort that achieved 
the mobilization targets (secondary endpoint). The following 
variables were considered for the regression analysis: age, sex, 
body mass index (BMI), operative time, oncologic versus 
non-oncologic indications, type of surgery (pancreatic, liver, 
intestinal, gastric), IPAQ score, and technique of surgery (lap- 
aroscopic versus open). Data are presented as mean ± standard 
deviation of the mean, if not indicated otherwise. Spearman’s 
rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the 
correlation between variables. 


Some 173 patients were screened for participation in the study 
and 132 patients were randomized. The dropout rate was 
16.6% (n = 22). The most two frequent reasons for dropout 
were a prolonged postoperative intensive care unit stay (n = 
13) and technical problems with the activity tracker during the 
postoperative course (n = 4). One hundred ten patients were 
analyzed (Fig. 1, CONSORT compatible study flow chart). 
The mean age of the entire study cohort was 58.9 ± 11 years 
and 59.3% of the patients were male. Fifty-eight percent of the 
patients had substantial comorbidities. Importantly, the control 
group patients in the open surgery arm were younger (P = 
0.052) and had significantly fewer preoperative comorbidities 
(44.4% versus 81.5%, P = 0.005). The ASA score and BMI 
were not significantly different (Table 2). In the laparoscopic 
arm, the demographic data including preoperative comorbid- 
ities were not significantly different. The majority of patients 
underwent surgery for malignant tumors (72.7%): hepatic tu- 
mors (23.6%), colon cancer (14.5%), rectal cancer (12.7%), 
pancreatic cancer (11.8%), and gastric cancer (10%). There 
was no significant difference between the subgroups regard- 
ing the underlying diagnosis, operation time, or blood loss 
(Table 3). Moreover, the following median ERAS outcome 
variables did not differ significantly between the intervention 
and control subgroups: postoperative day of abdominal 
wound drain removal, discontinuation of epidural anesthesia, 
removal of urinary catheters, start of oral liquids (POD 0–1), 
and tolerance of solid food intake. Compared with open cases, 
an epidural analgesia was not routinely used for laparoscopic 
cases (Table 2). The urinary catheter was removed within 24 h 
after the operation (laparoscopic group), or with a median 
delay of 2–3 days (open group). 

The mean daily step counts on PODs 1–5 significantly dif- 
fered and were higher in the open control, compared with the 
open intervention group (P < 0.001, Fig. 2a). Likewise, the 
mean cumulative daily step count during the first 5 PODs 
was significantly lower in the open intervention, compared 
with the open control group (4635 versus 7483, P = 0.041). 
This translated into a longer cumulative activity time for the 
open control patients (462.4 ± 315 min versus 290.3 ± 
186.8 min, P = 0.038). Only 33% of the patients in the open 
intervention group achieved their mobilization targets, com- 
pared with 48% in the open control group (P = 0.268). There 
was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity and 
the length of hospital stay between the two groups in the open 
arm (Table 4). Patients with comorbidities in the open group 
had a significantly lower step count, compared with patients 


without comorbidities (P = 0.045). When only patients with- 
out comorbidities (intervention: n = 5; control: n = 15) were 
compared, there was no significant difference in the step count 
(P = 0.168). 
In the laparoscopic arm, the activity feedback (intervention) 
significantly increased the mean daily (P < 0.001) and cumula- 
tive step count (9867 versus 6103, P = 0.037) of the patients 
during the first 5 PODs, compared with the control group 
(Fig. 2b). Further, the cumulative activity time of patients with 
activity feedback was significantly longer (P = 0.037), and the 
percentage of patients who achieved their mobilization targets 
was higher. The percentage of patients who were exercised by 
professional physiotherapists at least for 3 days, postoperative 
morbidity, and the length of hospital stay were not significant- 
ly different in the respective intervention groups (Table 4). 
The mean daily activity time of the patients recorded 
by the activity tracking devices between the PODs 1–5 
ranged between 28 and 138 min (open arm) and 44–115 min 
(laparoscopic arm). 



The cumulative step count of the entire cohort was negatively 
correlated with the length of hospital stay (Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient − 0.341, P < 0.001) and age of the pa- 
tients (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient − 0.25, P = 
0.009), respectively. No significant correlation was found for 
BMI, intraoperative blood loss, and operation time.

Interestingly, a cox proportional hazard model showed that the 
step count on POD 1 significantly correlated with a short 
hospital stay in the entire cohort (P = 0.002) and the laparo- 
scopic group (P < 0.001, Fig. 3). 
Logistic regression analysis further revealed that patients 
with open surgery and a hospital stay shorter than 12 days 
(= median length of hospital stay in the open arm) had a 
significantly reduced postoperative morbidity (7.1% versus 
57.7%, P < 0.001) and a significantly higher mean cumulative

are plotted as mean ± standard 
error of the mean. The control

line, respectively 

5.9 days, P = 0.017; laparoscopic, 12.5 ± 7 versus 9.1 ± 
3.4 days, P = 0.034) and had a higher complication rate (open, 
50% versus 14%, P = 0.005; laparoscopic, 31.8% versus 
4.3%, P = 0.016) in both arms. However, the presence of pre- 
operative comorbidities was not significantly different be- 
tween these subgroups. 

A recent meta-analysis concluded that there were only a few 
comparative studies, which evaluated the impact of early mo- 
bilization protocols on outcomes after abdominal and thoracic 
surgery, and that the quality of these studies was poor and the 
results were conflicting.21 
Previously published studies in pancreatic surgery de- 
scribed mobilization targets of up to 1 h out of bed on the first 
POD and up to 4 h on POD 3, but it was not reported whether 
the targets were achieved.5,22,23 In comparison, only 20–28% 
of patients were mobilized on the first POD after liver surgery, 
despite predefined mobilization targets (e.g., Bfour times 
daily^).11,24,25 Others reported that only the minority of pa- 
tients (23.5%) achieved the mobilization target of more than 
6 h out of bed on the first POD, which could not be improved 
by the implementation of an ERAS pathway.26 Overall, the 
mobilization targets described in most of the studies were 
either imprecisely defined, measured, or monitored. 
The daily activity time during the early postoperative 
course of our cohort ranged between 28 and 138 min (open 
arm) and 44–115 min (laparoscopic arm), which is much 
shorter than expected and differs from the ERAS recommen- 
dations postulated to date. On the other hand, we report here 
on a novel and electronically measured parameter, which is 
compared with a mostly subjective observation of postopera- 
tive ambulation. Therefore, the parameter Bactivity time^ of 
the used devices should be validated for postoperative patients 
in the future. This parameter includes standing, moving slow- 
ly (low-intensity activity and sitting < 1 h), walking, as well as 
high-intensity activity. Then, pedometer or activity tracking 
devices allow an objective measurement of postoperative mo- 
bilization or activity data and thereby can deliver objective 
outcome parameters in clinical trials. 
Our study further demonstrated that the length of hospital 
stay was negatively correlated with the cumulative postoper- 
ative step count. Cook et al. reported similar results.17 In this 
study, a significant relationship between the number of steps 
during the early recovery period, the length of hospital stay, 
and discharge disposition was observed in a cohort trial with

Fig. 3 Length of hospital stay plotted against the step count on postoperative day 1 (POD 1) in the entire study cohort (a) and the laparoscopic arm (b). 
Study subjects in the intervention subgroups are plotted in red, and control subjects are in black. A linear regression line is plotted in green 
150 patients after cardiac surgery.17 Neither of the studies 
answers the question whether this correlation is caused by 
the increased ambulation of the patients or by the selection 
of the fittest patients and those with no complications. 
However, the step count on the first postoperative day alone 
inversely correlated with the hospital stay, which suggests 
some degree of independency between postoperative mobili- 
zation and morbidity, because many complications occur later 
during the postoperative course. 
Most interestingly, the present trial observed a discordant 
effect of the intervention between the laparoscopic and the 
open surgery arm. A possible reason may be the fact that the 
demographic data and preoperative comorbidities were not 
balanced between the groups in the open arm, although this 
interaction could not be statistically proved. However, a ret- 
rospective analysis of the collected data did not identify any 
other factor, which might explain the low step counts of the 
patients in the open intervention subgroup. Other factors, such 
as the surgical stress response or pain after open surgery, can 
theoretically mitigate the effect of activity feedback after ma- 
jor abdominal surgery, as seen in the laparoscopic arm. In line 
with this, more patients in the open group underwent a 
hemihepatectomy (8 versus 2, P = 0.05) or pancreatic head 
resection (12 versus none, P < 0.01) compared with the lapa- 
roscopic group with a higher percentage of gastric (9 total or 
subtotal laparoscopic gastrectomies versus 2 in the open 
group, P = 0.05) or colon resections (17 laparoscopic 
hemicolectomies or sigmoid resections versus 4 in the open 
group, P < 0.01). 
One could also argue that smoking habits necessitate pa- 
tients to mobilize more. The percentage of smokers was lower 
in the laparoscopic control group compared with the laparo- 
scopic intervention group, but the difference was not signifi- 
cant and the number of smokers was too low for a reliable 
statistical analysis. 
The present trial has some limitations. The anticipated mo- 
bilization targets were derived from an own small pilot trial, 
but, in retrospect, were not optimally chosen; only a minority 
of the patients achieved these targets (secondary endpoint) in 
the present trial. Moreover, the trial included many types of 
operations covering hepatopancreatic, gastrointestinal, and 
colorectal surgery, which might have a different impact on 
the postoperative patients’ physiology and ability to ambulate. 
This broad range of operations generated an inhomogeneous 
study cohort, but it was intentional in order to increase the 
applicability and generalizability of the study. There were no 
differences between the groups regarding the preoperative 
mobility assessed by the IPAQ. However, compliance to com- 
plete the IPAQ was very low in our study population (49%). 
Discrepancies between the self-reported, preoperative mobil- 
ity assessed by the IPAQ, and the actual, quantitative mobility 
could not be excluded. In addition, the IPAQ was not designed 
for patients in a hospital setting (inpatients), but is considered 
an appropriate tool to assess physical activity in daily life.27 

This is the first trial reporting on postoperative activity track- 
ing in major abdominal surgery. The study demonstrated that 
activity tracking in the postoperative course after major ab- 
dominal surgery is feasible and has the potential to increase 
mobilization after laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, activity 
tracking devices enable the monitoring of additional health 
parameters, which might be useful for postoperative monitor- 
ing and intervention. The step count of patients during the first 
postoperative days might be an early predictor for complica- 
tions and the length of hospital stay.
