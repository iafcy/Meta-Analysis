Abstract
Background: Psychological factors have been reported to affect chronic pain and may lead to inactivity after total knee
arthroplasty. This study aimed to determine whether the use of an activity diary for goal setting during occupational
therapy would reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical performance in patients after total knee arthroplasty.
Methods: A total of 41 total knee arthroplasty participants from two cohorts were recruited in the study and allocated
by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n 20) or the control group (n 21).
¼ ¼
Occupational therapy intervention (1–2 weeks postoperatively) to promote goal achievement was performed in both
groups, and self-monitoring was performed in the diary group by using the activity diary. The outcome indices were
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, pain (resting pain, walking pain), pain catastrophizing (rumination, helplessness, and magnification), anxiety, depression, pain self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Data were evaluated by
using analysis of variance analyses with post hoc tests.
Results: A time-by-group interaction emerged for Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, pain
catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and physical activity level (p < 0.05), both favouring the diary group. The diary group
also showed greater improvement in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, anxiety, and physical
activity levels at four weeks postoperatively, compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The use of the activity diary in this study increased occupational therapy effectiveness, reduced patients’
pain, and prevented a decline in physical performance. We believe that the use of an activity diary is an effective and
feasible addition for total knee arthroplasty patients.

## Introduction


Based on an epidemiological survey regarding musculoskeletal chronic pain in Japan, the rate of complaints
was 11.1%, and approximately 30% of patients with
chronic pain have a history of morbidity 5 years;

to musculoskeletal chronic pain, as well as social losses,
there is an increasing need to prevent musculoskeletal
chronic pain.
Many musculoskeletal diseases that cause chronic
pain are reported as lumbar diseases, with the exception of osteoarthritis of the knee. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be the result of chronic pain in
approximately 15% of cases (Ackerman, Graves,
Wicks, Bennell, & Osborne, 2005). Despite surgical
operation, urgent countermeasures are needed to prevent chronic pain and reduced physical activity.
Negative psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing, etc., have been reported
to affect chronic pain after TKA (Sullivan et al., 2011).
However, self-efficacy is regarded as a positive psychological factor for mitigation of pain catastrophizing
(Wylde, Dixon, & Blom, 2012). van den AkkerScheek, Stevens, Groothoff, Bulstra, and Zijlstra
(2007) reported that self-efficacy affected walking and
pain after TKA. These prior studies indicated that pain
catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression are related to
chronic pain after TKA; and pain and self-efficacy are
related to the restriction of activity levels.
We previously reported a relationship between
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
(COPM) and pain catastrophizing after TKA
(Hiraga, Hirakawa, Hisano, & Shiota, 2015).
Notably, improvement in helplessness (i.e. helplessness
in a painful situation) was recognised by occupational
therapy (OT) practitioners after establishing the
COPM goal in a quasi-randomised controlled trial
(Hiraga, Hisano, Hirakawa, & Nomiyama, 2016).
However, improvements were not observed in pain,
rumination (i.e. attention to pain), or magnification
(i.e. overestimation of pain threats) (Hiraga, Hisano,
Hirakawa, & Nomiyama, 2017). Furthermore, it was
not possible to examine effects on anxiety, depression,
or physical activity in the prior studies. Therefore, it
was necessary to develop OT treatment and practice
protocols that addressed psychological factors for
chronic pain after TKA.
There have been recent studies of interventions in
which chronic pain patients wear pedometers to selfmanage activity, thereby avoiding increases in pain and
enabling them to record daily activities (Hirase et al.,
2018; McDonough et al., 2013). We previously
reported a case in which use of an activity diary together with OT resulted in improvement of pain, psychological factors, and activity levels; the protocol
encouraged self-management of walking and pain
(Hiraga et al., 2017). Importantly, it is necessary to
clarify the effects of self-management with a daily
activity record regarding pain, psychological factors,
and activity levels.

Therefore, we investigated whether the use of an
activity diary for goal setting during OT would
reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical
performance in patients after TKA.

## Methods

 Study design

This study comprised a non-randomised controlled
trial. Patients were divided into: the diary group (OT
plus activity diary) or control group (OT alone).

## Ethical considerations

All participants provided informed consent, and the
study design was approved by the appropriate ethics
review board at Fukuoka Rehabilitation Hospital
(FRH 2014-R-010).

## Participants

Power analysis. We used G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder,
Lang, & Buchner, 2007) to perform preliminary test
force analysis and estimate the required sample size.
The power was set at 0.8, and the significance level
(a) was set at 0.05 (Cohen et al., 1992). Effect size
was set at 0.25, which constitutes a moderate standard
for two-way analysis of variance. The power analysis
indicated that 24 patients (12 per group) were required
for pre- and post-evaluations.

Target participants. Inclusion criteria were TKA performed between May 2014 and September 2016 in
Fukuoka Rehabilitation Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan);
45 patients were evaluated. Patients hospitalised May
2014–June 2015 were assigned to the control group;
those hospitalised July 2015–September 2016 were
assigned to the diary group. Exclusion criteria included
diagnosis of dementia and obvious mental illness (e.g.
depression) that would interfere with completion of the
questionnaire, as well as refusal to participate in OT.
Additional exclusion criteria comprised postoperative
complications (e.g. nerve injury and deep vein thrombosis), other significant medical diseases interfering
with postoperative rehabilitation, previous TKA
(TKA of the opposite limb and revision), and TKA
performed for causes other than degenerative diseases
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and bone necrosis). Two of
the 45 patients were excluded, resulting in a total of
43 TKA patients from two cohorts; these patients
were allocated by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n 21, four males,
¼
17 females; age: 76.1 7.1 years) or the control group
�
(n 22, two males, 20 females; age: 76.4 5.4 years).

All patients received general anaesthesia; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were administered
at a dose of 60 mg (three tablets per day) for two
weeks postoperatively. All patients followed the same
physical therapy and OT protocols after operation. All
patients began physical therapy, including knee joint
range of motion exercises (flexion–extension) and
stretching, on the first day postoperatively. OT began
at 1–2 weeks postoperatively for the purpose of
improving everyday life. Patients were discharged
upon the physician’s approval and on patient request
at four weeks postoperatively.

## OT for each group: Goal setting and practice

We used a previously reported method (Hiraga et al.,
2016) for goal setting and practice in the diary and
control groups at 1–2 weeks after surgery. The implementation procedure used COPM (Law et al., 1990) to
list five target goals and determine the priority of the
goals. After determining the priority order, we evaluated the performance of each goal with a 10-point scale
(1: not possible; 10: very good). Satisfaction was also
evaluated on a 10-point scale (1: not satisfied; 10: very
satisfied). Performance and satisfaction scores were
determined for each factor.
In practice, the patient may write, ‘I want to be able
to do the clean-up’. The patient starts with a low load,
such as standing position, progresses to movement, and
then practices using what is necessary for cleaning.
Ultimately, this practice encourages the patient to
achieve the goal in cleaning. All OT interventions
required 40 min per day.

## OT using the activity diary

We used an activity diary developed by Fukuoka
Rehabilitation Hospital for intervention in the diary
group (Hiraga et al., 2017) but not in the control
group. The activity diary was designed to record date,
steps, and pain (11 items) daily; this facilitates achievement of activity goals while encouraging active selfmanagement. A pedometer (Pleasure Walker PZ-150;
Yamasa Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used to record
the number of steps per day; the pedometer was
attached to the foot of the non-operative side.
Previous studies have reported that a pedometer
attached to the foot is superior to a pedometer worn
on the wrist for detecting the amount of activity
(Rhudy & Mahoney, 2018). In addition, we focused
on improving activity, rather than solely evaluating
pain. Pain levels and comments were recorded in the
activity diary, and we implemented a feedback protocol
to enable patients to experience achievement. For
example, if a patient commented, ‘I am in pain every


day’, we asked ‘why do you have knee pain?’ ‘How can
this be done easier?’. This feedback protocol was implemented to shift from negative to positive comments.
Such intervention was incorporated into the OT programme of 40 min/day. Use of the activity diary began
on Day 1 at the start of OT (Figure 1).

## Assessment

The assessment was performed pre-OT (1–2 weeks postoperatively) and post-OT (4 weeks postoperatively).

Pain. The numerical rating scale (NRS) (Jensen,
Turner, & Romano, 1994) was used to evaluate pain
on an 11-point scale (0: no pain; 10: worst imaginable
pain). Resting and walking pain were both assessed on
the NRS.

Pain catastrophizing. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale
(PCS) (Sullivan, Bishop, & Pivik, 1995) was used to
evaluate pain catastrophizing. The PCS comprises
13 items and uses self-evaluation on three subscales:
rumination, helplessness, and magnification. The
patient evaluates the time spent on the condition on a
five-point scale (0: not at all; 4: all the time). A high
score indicates strong pain catastrophizing.

Anxiety and depression. The Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983)
was used to evaluate anxiety and depression; HADS comprises 14 questions. The patient evaluates anxiety and
depression, and how much time is spent in that state,
on a four-point scale (0: not at all; 3: most of the time).
HADS subscale scores were also evaluated in this study.

Pain self-efficacy. The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire
(PSEQ) (Adachi et al., 2014) was used to evaluate
self-efficacy for pain. PSEQ uses self-entry of scores
for 10 items on a seven-point scale (0: not at all confident; 6: completely confident).

Physical activity levels. An activity meter (Active Style
Pro; OMRON Corp., Kyoto, Japan) was used to evaluate physical activity. The activity meter was worn on a
patient’s foot for 24 hours. Steps and physical activity
were measured, and times for metabolic equivalents
were calculated in minutes for physical activity.
Previously, Ohkawara et al. (2011) found high reliability in the calculation of steps and physical activity
levels using the Active Style Pro.

## Statistical analysis

We used t-tests to evaluate significant differences in
age, body mass index (BMI), and hospital inpatient

days. We used Chi-squared tests for group comparisons in demographics such as gender, employment,
smoking, and drinking. We analysed the effects of the
intervention protocol on outcome measures using a
2 2 (time (baseline and pre- to post-OT) group
� �
(diary and control groups)) analysis of variance. Post
hoc Bonferroni tests were used for specific comparisons, and two-sided significance was determined.
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics Version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

## Results

Figure 2 presents a flow chart outlining participation in
this study. In total, 45 participants were screened for
enrolment, and two failed to meet the inclusion criteria
(n 2). We enrolled the remaining 43 participants in
¼
the study and non-randomly allocated each patient to
either the activity diary group (n 21) or the control
¼
group (n 22). One patient from each group withdrew
¼
from the trial and could not be evaluated. A total of 20
patients in the diary group and 21 patients in the control group completed the study. All patients in the
diary group completed the pain, number of steps, and
comment categories of the diary.

## Baseline characteristics

Table 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of
patients. There were no significant differences in age,


sex, BMI, employment, smoking, drinking, goal setting, pain intensity, psychological status, or physical
activity between the two groups.

## Length of hospital stay

The length of hospital inpatient stay was significantly
better for the diary group than for the control group
(31.4 4.6 days versus 40.8 13.0 days; p 0.002).

and control groups revealed within-group (diary group)
and between-group improvements in COPM performance score, COPM satisfaction score, NRS walking
score, HADS anxiety score, daily step counts, and physical activity time. Therefore, OT that included an activity
diary was found to be beneficial for patients after TKA.
It is also meaningful that the number of days in the diary
group was shorter than that of the control group.
Harkin et al. (2016) reported on the use of an activity log and found that when goals were set and progress
was recorded, achievement was increased and additional goals were formed. Furthermore, use of education
incorporating self-management showed that length of
stay in hospitals were reduced (Yoon et al., 2010). In
addition, Seminowicz et al. (2013) reported that feedback resulted in improvement in positive emotion, pain
catastrophizing, and mental health. Based on these
studies, reporting negative comments such as stubborn
pain in the comment section of an activity diary can


result in improvement of activity levels and achievement of goals. If consciousness changes from positive
emotion to positive activity levels, improvement can be
observed in the HADS anxiety score. Furthermore, the
length of hospital stay was shortened. However, deterioration in physical activity was observed in the control group, which may be related to the possibility of
falling, particularly these patients may have exhibited
fear avoidance (Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000).
A previous study (Somers et al., 2012) demonstrated
improvement in pain self-efficacy after education and
pain self-management programme at 24 weeks postoperatively among knee osteoarthritis patients. The present study did not show any effects of activity diary use
on pain self-efficacy. This is likely because the course of
OT practice with the activity diary was limited to two
weeks. However, use of the activity diary produced
various significant effects within a relatively short
period of time. This study directed patients in the


-----

diary group to use the activity diary for selfmanagement, in order to achieve an established goal
in physical activity and pain management. We found
that the performance score, satisfaction score, NRS
walking score, HADS anxiety score, daily step
counts, and physical activity time had been improved
with use of the activity diary in the OT protocol.
The limitations of this study are that it was a longitudinal study with a non-randomised design. The longterm effects of using activity diary on activity limitation
after chronic pain remain unknown as this study only
examined short-term effects. Furthermore, the history
effects of physical therapy and medication therapy
were not considered, and future studies must investigate those factors.

## Conclusion

Our OT programme was previously shown to be effective in improving psychological factors in Japanese
TKA patients. Use of the activity diary in this study
increased the effectiveness, reduced patients’ pain, and
prevented a decline in physical performance. The OT
programme and activity diary were also well accepted
by TKA patients in this study. We conclude that the
use of an activity diary is an effective and feasible addition for TKA patients.
