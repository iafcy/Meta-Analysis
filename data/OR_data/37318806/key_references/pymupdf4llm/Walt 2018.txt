8 BACKGROUND:

9 Commercial wrist worn activity monitors have the potential to accurately assess activity levels, and

10 are being increasingly adopted in the general population. The aim of this study was to determine if


11 feedback from a commercial activity monitor improves activity levels over the first 6 weeks after

12 total hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA).

13 METHODS:

14 163 consecutive subjects undergoing primary TKA or THA were randomized into 2 groups. Subjects

15 received an activity tracker with the step display obscured 2 weeks prior to surgery and completed

16 patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). On day 1 after surgery participants were randomized

17 to either the “Feedback Group” (FB) or the “Non Feedback Group” (NFB). The FB group were able to

18 view their daily step count, and were given a daily step goal. Participants in the NFB group wore the

19 device with the display obscured for 2 weeks after surgery, after which time they were also able to

20 see their daily step count, but did not receive a formal step goal. The mean daily steps at 1, 2, 6

21 weeks, and 6 months were monitored. At 6 months after surgery subjects repeated PROMS and daily

22 step count collection.

23 RESULTS:

24 Of the 163 subjects, 95 underwent THA and 68 underwent TKA. FB subjects had a significantly higher

25 (p<0.03) mean daily step count by 43% in week 1, 33% in week 2, 21% in week 6, and 17% at 6

26 months, compared to NFB. FB subjects were 1.7 more likely to achieve a mean 7,000 steps per day

27 than NFB subjects at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02). There was no significant difference between the

28 groups in PROMS at 6 months. 91% of FB and 83% of NFB reported they were satisfied with the

29 results of the surgery (p=0.08). At 6 months after surgery 70% of subjects had a greater mean daily

30 step count compared to their preoperative level.

31 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:

32 Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had

33 significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6 weeks and 6 months,

34 compared to subjects who did not receive feedback in a randomized controlled trial. Commercial

35 activity trackers may be a useful and effective adjunct after arthroplasty.

38 **Introduction**

39 Mobility and physical activity are imperative to healthy aging. Evidence supports the positive


40 benefits of regular physical activity with higher activity being associated with reduction in the risk of

41 chronic disease and premature mortality[1, 2]. More recently associations like The Committee on

42 Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorse regular physical


43 activity and even classify it as a modifiable risk factor for prevention in cardiovascular disease and

44 other chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint

45 diseases, and depression[3].

46
47 After joint replacement surgery the aim should therefore not only be to improve pain and function,

48 but also lead to improved activity. This activity should preferably meet the recommended daily

49 activity levels as recommended by the WHO, US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart

50 Foundation of Australia [4] [5].

51

52 Historically, post-operative activity has been monitored by using participant completed subjective

53 questionaries. [6, 7]. However, reports in literature have questioned the accuracy and validity of this

54 form of assessment. It has been identified that in self-assessment of physical activity people tend to

55 overestimate their level of activity by as much as 50%.[5] Verlaan et al. reported that up to 62% of the

56 general population meet the activity intensity guidelines according to their self-assessment questionnaire

57 whereas only 9.6% meet these same guidelines when defined from objective physical activity

58 monitoring[8].

59

60 With the recent development of commercial-based accelerometers (activity trackers) the

61 “subjective” error has been decreased and it has become easier to accurately measure daily activity

62 level. It has also been identified that these activity trackers have a great potential to accurately

63 assess activity level before and after joint arthroplasty[9]. These devices are largely used in the

64 fitness industry as a motivational tool for those wanting to monitor and improve fitness. More

65 importantly these devices have been shown to be a valid and reliable assessment tool for activity

66 levels in normal participants[10], and participants after cardiac surgery[11].

67

68 In this study, we used commercial activity trackers to monitor and encourage higher activity levels in

69 a series of participants before and after Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Total hip arthroplasty (THA).

70 Our hypothesis was that subjects who received feedback of step count in the first 2 weeks after

71 surgery would have higher mean daily step count over the first 6 weeks after TKA or THA. We also

72 examined whether this impacted participant satisfaction, participant reported outcome measures or

73 6 month activity level.

74 **Materials and Methods:**

75 This was a single center parallel group randomized controlled study with an equal allocation ratio.


76 Eligible patients were all adults undergoing primary elective hip or knee arthroplasty under the care


77 of one of the investigating surgeons between May 2016 and December 2016. Patients were required

78 to provide written informed consent and were randomised to either control (NFB) or device

79 feedback (FB) groups. Subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory disease, and

80 those undergoing hip arthroplasty after an acute femoral fracture were excluded. Subjects who were

81 not contactable within 2 weeks of their surgery were excluded.

82 Two weeks prior to surgery, subjects were contacted via telephone and invited to participate. All

83 potential participants were informed the purpose of the study. Participants were emailed or posted

84 the written Participant Information and Consent Form as approved by the Hospitals Human

85 Research Ethics Committee. If the participant consented they received a Garmin Vivofit2 device for 2

86 weeks prior to their surgery. The Garmin Vivofit®2 uses a 3-axis MEMS accelerometer to estimate

87 step count. This device has a long battery life of roughly 12 months and the retail cost is AUD$109.

88 The device has been shown to be valid and reliable for assessment of step count [12-14].

89 The display on the Vívofit®2 device which indicates the number of steps per day was obscured in all

90 participants in the preoperative period. On day 1 after arthroplasty, randomisation was performed.

91 The randomisation was blocked in multitudes of 40 with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The random

92 permutation list was generated from www.randomization.com. From this list a series of 40

93 numbered and sealed envelopes were created with the words “Feedback Group” or “No Feedback

94 Group” generated in the order determined by the permutation list. When a participant was to be

95 randomised the researcher obtained the next sequentially numbered envelope from a contact who

96 was independent of the recruitment process for allocation consignment.

97 A researcher visited the subject on the first day after surgery and advised as to which group they had

98 been allocated. If the subject was in the ‘Feedback Group’ the cover over the vivofit display was

99 removed to make the step count visible and he or she was given a daily step goal as indicated in

100 Table 1. Subjects were advised this goal should be considered a rough guide based on average

101 activity level after arthroplasty, and may need to be adjusted in some circumstances for medical or

102 lifestyle reasons. The weekly step goal was selected based on mean daily steps observed in a

103 previous study of subjects with activity monitors after arthroplasty[15]. The goal of 7000 steps by

104 week 6 was selected as this is the recommended daily step count for healthy older adults(>65)[16]

105 Participants in the “Non- Feedback Group” continued to wear the device with the display obscured

106 for 2 weeks after surgery and were not given a daily step goal.


107 The mean daily steps from each group for the first 2 weeks was recorded and compared. After 2

108 weeks all participants were permitted to remove the cover over the display and see the step count.

109 The non randomised group were not given the login or password required to sync the device and


110 therefore could not access their data until after they were unblinded. All participants from both

111 groups continued to wear their device until 6 weeks after surgery. Where possible the Garmin

112 Vivofit2 device was synced to the subject’s mobile device (phone or tablet) using the Garmin

113 Connect mobile application. If the subject did not have a suitable mobile device, arrangements were

114 made for the device to be synced at least every 3 weeks with the research unit’s computers, either

115 in person or via post. At 6 weeks after surgery participants returned the Garmin Vívofit®2 in person

116 or via post. At 6 months after surgery subjects wore the Garmin Vívofit®2 again for a period of 3

117 weeks.

118 All subjects completed patient reported outcome questionnaires (PROMS) preoperatively and at 6

119 months after surgery. The questionnaire included the disease specific measure of the Knee injury

120 and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score

121 (HOOS), and the general measure of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D): an instrument for measuring quality of

122 life. At 6 months patients also completed the satisfaction component of the Knee Society Score, and

123 graded their satisfaction with their outcome of surgery on a 5-point scale from very satisfied to very

124 disappointed. They were also asked if they would have the same surgery again under the same

125 circumstances (Yes/No/Unsure).

126 The study was performed at the Mater Hospital, a private hospital located in Sydney, Australia at

127 which over 2000 arthroplasty procedures are performed annually. The routine care of subjects

128 undergoing arthroplasty was admission on day of surgery, 5-day postoperative stay in acute care

129 orthopaedic ward, commencement of mobilization on Day 1 after surgery and twice daily

130 physiotherapy sessions for 5 days. The vast majority of subjects then attend inpatient rehabilitation

131 for a further 7-10 days, and outpatient sessions twice a week until 6 weeks from surgery.

132 The study was initially designed to recruit 300 participants. Prior to commencement of the study a

133 series of 30 participants undergoing TKA wore a Garmin Activity monitor for 6 weeks after surgery.

134 In this population the mean number of recorded steps per day was 6700 (standard deviation 3200)

135 before surgery and 5700 at 6 weeks (standard deviation 2600). This data was used to determine the

136 study sample size for the RCT design. Power calculations from (http://www.statisticalsolutions.net/)

137 determined that in order to detect a 25% variation in mean step count, with a power of 0.8 and a

138 significance level of 0.05, 113 participants were required for each group. By over sampling an


139 additional 37 participants in each group, we account for potential withdrawals and losses to follow
140 up. A single planned interim analysis of the primary outcome measures was performed 7 months


141 after commencement of the study, after recruitment of over 200 subjects. A statistically significant

142 difference between the Feedback and Non- Feedback Groups was evident on all primary outcome

143 measures of 1, 2 and 6 week step count, therefore recruitment was ceased after enrollment of 202

144 subjects.

145

146 **Statistical Methods**

147

148 The primary endpoint of the study was the average daily step count as measured with the Garmin

149 Vivofit device at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks after surgery. This was expressed as a percentage of the

150 subject’s preoperative step count. Secondary endpoints were 6-month PROMS and mean daily step

151 count. Continuous variables such as mean step count and patient reported scores were compared

152 between treatment groups with independent t-tests. Changes over time were assessed with paired

153 t-tests. The magnitude of mean differences between treatment groups were assessed with Cohen’s

154 d. Difference in proportions of patients between treatment groups were assessed with the Chi test

155 (χ2 test). Fisher's exact test was used for comparing proportions when the cell counts were less than

156 5. Risk ratios and 95% Confidence intervals were calculated for proportions as a risk estimate.

158 **Results:**

159 Between May 2016 and December 2016, 395 subjects underwent primary hip or knee arthroplasty


160 under the care of the investigating surgeons. Participant flow is shown according to the CONSORT

161 guidelines in Figure 1. 202 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 9 were

162 excluded as their surgery was cancelled or postponed and 30 patients were excluded as there was


163 insufficient data for baseline step count. The final groups included 81 subjects in the Feedback

164 Group and 82 subjects in the No Feedback Group.

165 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table 2. There were

166 no significant differences between the feedback and no feedback group for any of the baseline

167 variables or characteristics. Daily step count was recorded for each subject a mean of 36 of a

168 possible 42 days in the first 6 weeks after surgery. Days missing step counts was either due to non
169 compliance with wearing the device, or difficulties with successfully syncing the device to retrieve

170 step counts.

171 Mean daily step count for the 2 groups at 1- week, 2-week, 6- week and 6- months is shown in Table

172 3 and Figure 2. The feedback group had a significantly higher mean step count at all review points

173 than the no feedback group. Cohen’s d was 0.4-0.5, indicating a moderate effect size[17]. The mean

174 difference between groups ranged from 6-20% between 1 week and 6 months after surgery. For the

175 Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7069 preoperatively to 8326 at 6 months

176 after surgery (p=0.001). For the No Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7748

177 preoperatively to 8467 at 6 months after surgery (p=0.001).

178 7000 steps per day is recommended as a suitable activity level for subjects over 65 years[16]. The

179 proportion of subjects achieving a mean of 7000 or more steps each day is shown in Figure 3.

180 Subjects is the Feedback Group were 1.7 (95CI% 1.2-2.6) more likely to be achieve a mean 7000

181 steps per day than subjects in the No Feedback group at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02).

182 The patient reported outcome scores reported at 6 months for the 2 groups is shown in Table 4.

183 There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for patient reported outcome scores at 6

184 months after surgery.

185 Patient satisfaction with the outcome was assessed at 6 months and the results are shown in Table

186 5. There was a trend (p=0.089) towards higher proportion of satisfied or very satisfied subjects in the

187 Feedback Group, compared to the No Feedback Group.

188 30 day readmission was monitored for all subjects. One patient in the feedback group was

189 readmitted with a post operative wound dehiscence at 17 days postoperatively and underwent


190 debridement of the surgical wound and administration of intravenous antibiotics for 5 days. Tissue

191 culture returned staphylococcus epidermidis. No further treatment was necessary. One patient in


192 the non feedback group was readmitted after 28 days for investigation of pyrexia of unknown origin

193 for investigation. No treatment required.

194

195 **Discussion**


196 Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had

197 significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty at all measured time points over 6

198 months, compared to subjects who did not receive feedback. Feedback from activity trackers was

199 found to be an effective tool to increase early mobilization with subjects motivated to “achieve their

200 daily goal”.

201 This study is the first to report the positive effect of the use of activity monitors after knee and hip

202 arthroplasty. Our results indicated that in the feedback group the patients receiving a daily goal and

203 daily feedback in the first two weeks after surgery led to increased activity in the acute phase,

204 increased activity at 6 months, and a trend to improved higher patient satisfaction at 6 months

205 (p=0.09). The Feedback Group had significantly higher activity than the Non- Feedback Group by 45%

206 at one week, 34% at two-weeks, 26% at six weeks and then finally the 17% at six-month mark. With

207 the evident benefits of physical activity to healthy aging, especially after surgery, this increased

208 activity can be considered a positive effect for a successful surgery.

209

210 The success following joint replacement surgery can be measured by a variety of parameters. It is

211 important to aim to improve pain and function, but also physical activity. Physical activity includes

212 an improvement in mobility which can be measured by daily step count. However, until now a

213 reliable objective measure of improved step count following arthroplasty has not been reported. The

214 World Health Organisation (WHO), US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart Foundation

215 of Australia have released a list of recommendations of daily activity or step count to improve an

216 individuals’ health and reduce the risk of disease. According to their recommendations the average

217 individual needs to take 10,000 steps a day to improve their health and reduce the risk of


218 disease.[18-20] It is further specified that the recommended daily step count for healthy older

219 adults(>65) is 7,000-10,000 [21]. The proportion of subjects taking 7000 steps or more increased


220 from 50% prior to surgery to 70% at 6 months after surgery. The mean daily step count at 6 months

221 was increased compared to preoperative status in 66% of subjects. Even though a value of 10,000

222 steps/day currently is promoted as a target for obtaining health benefits the increase seen in these

223 patients after arthroplasty can be seen as a step in the right direction towards improving their health

224 outcomes.

225

226 It should be noted that the group were differentiated by the presence or absence of feedback from

227 the activity monitor only for the first 2 weeks after surgery. After this time both groups were able to

228 see their daily step count on the device, but only the Feedback Group were encouraged to use the

229 weekly step goals (see Table 1). It is interesting that the positive effect of the early feedback from

230 the device and the use a goal had a positive effect over the full 6 months of the study. We

231 hypothesise that the early feedback was a powerful and persisting motivator for subjects to be

232 aware of their activity level over the long term.

233

234 With the recent rise in technological based assessment tools it is important for the orthopaedic

235 fraternity to stay up to date [22] According to the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity

236 should be assessed by its four components: frequency, intensity, time, as well as type of activity

237 (abbreviated as FITT). Modern commercially available activity trackers have the ability to monitor all

238 of the FITT components. Physical performance is used as an assessment tool of patient recovery,

239 rehabilitation, and clinical progress postoperatively. It is therefore important to be able to measure

240 this accurately. The devices used in this study did not include a heart rate monitor to assess

241 intensity, rather we deliberately focused on the daily step count, as it is our opinion that in the older

242 population group, simpler goals may just be more appropriate. There are different forms of activity

243 monitors with increasing levels of complexity and accuracy but ultimately just a basic, accurate

244 activity monitor proved to be valuable in the rehabilitation of the post joint replacement patients.

245 Patient satisfaction is the ultimate indicator of successful surgery. At 6 months after surgery, 91% of

246 subjects in the Feedback Group reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of

247 the surgery, compared to 83% of the subjects in the No Feedback Group (p=0.089). While this trend

248 is encouraging, it was not reflected in the other patient reported outcomes at 6 months, with no

249 significant difference observed between the groups for the disease specific KOOS/HOOS sub scores

250 (p>0.65), or the EQ5D general health measure (p>0.17).


251 In 2001 a group of surgeons from Europe coined the term “ERAS”. Enhanced recovery after surgery.

252 Their research has highlighted the focus on quality of post-operative recovery and rested on several

253 factors: a multimodal team approach, preoperative counselling, standardized analgesic and

254 anaesthetic protocols, optimization of nutrition and early mobilization. Paying attention to these

255 elements they stated: “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery practices improve the opportunity for

256 rapid, uncomplicated recovery after surgery with both short- and long-term benefits for patients

257 while improving quality and saving money” [23] With the focus on early mobilization in joint

258 replacement surgery it has historically been difficult to monitor post-operative mobility with an

259 objective scoring system or scale that accurately identified the patients level of activity. We believe

260 the use of activity monitors can potentially lead to improved monitoring and ultimately improved

261 activity outcomes. Activity monitors have been enthusiastically adopted by the younger populations.

262 A recent commercial consumer reports of 1000 respondents suggest that over 50% of 18-64 year

263 olds own at least one wearable device, and report health as the primary motivation for

264 purchase[24]. It is likely that this technology will be used with increasing frequency in the

265 arthroplasty population of the future.

266

267 Subjects in this study stayed in acute care hospital for a mean of 5 days after arthroplasty surgery.

268 The most common practice was that they then attended inpatient rehabilitation for a further week.

269 This practice is considerably slower than the usual care after arthroplasty seen in majority of other

270 centres. This limits the generalisabilty of our findings. However it is plausible that the benefit of

271 receiving feedback from an activity monitor is relevant to populations of both slow stream and fast

272 stream rehabilitated protocols.

273

274 We identified some limitations to our study. We question the accuracy of these activity trackers at

275 low speeds. The devices make an estimate of daily step count using a combination of motion

276 sensors, including an accelerometer, which then use an algorithm to estimate step count. It is the

277 algorithm that allows the device to differentiate between simple movements of the arm and

278 walking. It can be expected that the algorithms are based on ‘normal’ walking speeds and so lack the

279 sensitivity to accurately measure very slow speed walking, or movement patterns that are

280 complicated by use of walking aids, such as crutches or walking frames. This is especially a concern in

281 the first days after surgery when activity levels are expected to be at a slower rate. [25-27]. This

282 potential error would affect both groups in this study equally so should not have unevenly biased

283 our early results. Regardless we advocate that these devices are probably better used after the first

284 week from surgery when walking patterns are starting to normalise. Additionally, we lost a number

285 of patients in our follow up either due to failure of device or information loss. We contributed this to


286 possible hardware or user failure. Overall the activity monitors were well tolerated by subjects but

287 for some elderly there were challenges with successfully managing the technology. Certainly, setting

288 up the devices correctly required some form of assistance in a significant proportion of these

289 subjects. This is likely to become less of an issue over time as the younger populations are vastly

290 more familiar and comfortable with using modern technologies. Lastly during our exclusion process,

291 30 patients had to be excluded due to late arrival or delivery of their devices (more than 1-week post

292 op). Despite these difficulties we achieved a more than 90% of successful data retrieval of the study

293 cohort, and remained suitably powered for detecting differences in step counts between the groups.

294 **Conclusion:**

295

296 In a randomized controlled trial subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker

297 with a daily step goal had significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6

298 months, compared to subjects who did not receive feedback. Commercial, non-invasive, light

299 weight, low cost accelerometers may be a useful and effective adjunct to treatment after

300 arthroplasty.
