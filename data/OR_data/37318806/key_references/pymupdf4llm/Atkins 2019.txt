**Abstract**
**Objective:** To test if pedometers, as a motivational tool, could affect mobility outcomes in inpatient
rehabilitation.
**Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.**
**Setting: Subacute hospital rehabilitation unit in Australia.**
**Participants: A total of 78 participants with reduced mobility and clinician-determined capacity to improve.**
**Interventions: Both groups received usual care. For the intervention group, a pedometer was worn on the**
hip with the step count visible to participant and recorded daily on an exercise log. For the control group, a
pedometer fixed shut was worn on the hip and they recorded estimated distances walked on an exercise log.
**Main measures: Primary outcome was functional mobility – De Morton Mobility Index. Secondary outcome**
measures were walking velocity, functional independence measure, time spent upright and daily step count.
**Results: Significant improvements over time (P** < 0.001) in functional mobility, comfortable walking velocity
and functional independence measure were not influenced by the intervention. The daily average upright
time (hours) in the first week of intervention was different (P = 0.004) between the intervention group
(median, interquartile range (IQR): 1.67, 1.77) compared to the control group (median, IQR: 1.12, 0.82).
**Conclusion: Pedometers as a motivational tool without targets do not improve functional mobility in**
this population. Pedometers may improve daily upright time in this setting.

## Introduction

Patients in rehabilitation spend a large amount of
their time physically inactive.[1–4] Although the optimal level of physical activity on rehabilitation
wards is not established, it is likely that increased
physical activity such as walking or time spent
upright would be associated with improved mobility outcomes for patients. Particularly, given that

studies to date indicate that more practice of a particular task results in better performance of that
task.[5,6] Many strategies have been trialled to
increase physical activity, improve mobility outcomes and ultimately decrease length of stay in
inpatient rehabilitation. Additional staffing on the
weekend has had mixed results.[7–9] Other approaches
such as the use of patient individualized timetables,[10] independent programmes,[8,11] group therapy[7]
and structured social programmes[10] have been trialled to increase physical activity and improve
mobility outcomes. None have displayed clinically
significant changes in functional mobility.
Pedometers are a device commonly used in the
general population to motivate people to increase
their daily physical activity.[12] There is currently
limited research available regarding the use of
pedometers as a motivational tool in both acute and
subacute settings.[13,14] More research is becoming
available about the use of accelerometers in a similar role in inpatient rehabilitation with some positive findings on daily walking time.[15,16] A recent
review in the stroke population found that activity
monitors coupled with a targeted intervention did
not increase step count compared to the targeted
intervention alone;[17] however, this does not inform
the effectiveness of a pedometer as a stand-alone
intervention, or the potential impact on clinically
validated functional mobility measures. Low-cost
pedometers have been observed to be less accurate
than accelerometers especially at slower walking
velocities;[18] however, these disadvantages are
arguably outweighed by availability and simplicity.
While there is potential for use in rehabilitation settings there is currently a lack of research in this
area.[17,19]
The primary aim of this study was to test if
pedometers as a motivational tool can affect functional mobility outcomes in inpatient rehabilitation. The secondary aims were to see if a pedometer
increased incidental physical activity and time
spent upright on the ward in the first week, and to
measure the perceived benefit of the pedometer.

## Methods

This was a single blinded randomized controlled
trial conducted from November 2016 until February


2018 on a slow to recover rehabilitation unit of a
secondary referral hospital (Launceston General
Hospital, Tasmania, Australia). Ethical approval
for this study was received from Tasmania Health
and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee
(approval number H0015819). The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical
Trials Network (ACTRN12616001161415).
The rehabilitation unit focuses on patients with
lower initial functional independence measure
scores and longer anticipated length of stay. All
patients admitted to the unit were consecutively
screened for inclusion by a rehabilitation physiotherapist. those with reduced mobility, ability to
walk a minimum of three metres with or without a
gait aid or with or without assistance of one person,
and a clinician assessed capacity for improvement
were included in this study. Potential participants
were excluded if they had either severe receptive or
expressive dysphasia, a medical condition that precluded exercise, were not admitted under rehabilitation; or an anticipated length of stay of less than
one week. Patients were considered eligible if their
mobility status subsequently changed and they
met all other inclusion criteria during the duration
of their stay.
All participants provided written consent to a
researcher who was not part of the clinical treating
team. Allocation into intervention or control group
occurred using a computer-generated block randomisation sequence of six. The randomisation
sequence was generated by a researcher not
involved in recruitment or assessment. Group allocation was concealed using consecutively numbered opaque envelopes, opened after completion
of baseline assessment in the presence of the
participant.
All participants underwent two measurements
sessions. Baseline measures were collected on entry
into the study prior to randomisation to ensure
blinded assessment, and repeated at discharge, by a
physiotherapist blinded to group allocation. The
primary outcome was functional mobility assessed
using the De Morton Mobility Index. This is a valid
and accurate measure of mobility within subacute
rehabilitation.[20] Secondary outcome measures
included gait velocity assessed using the 10-metre
walk test, and a pedometer satisfaction scale

adapted from a similar study[13] using five point
Likert-type scales assessing perceived levels of
enjoyment, helpfulness and ease of use of pedometer. Functional abilities measured by the functional
independence measure on recruitment to study and
discharge from the ward were also collected. All
participants were monitored for the first week during the study using an accelerometer (activPAL[TM]
– PAL technologies, Glasgow, UK), which measured time upright and steps taken between 8 am and
8 pm. This time period was chosen to exclude incidental night time activity and to reflect expected
time someone would wear day clothes. Daily number of steps taken according to the pedometers were
collected by allied health assistants and nursing
staff, and then reset, ensuring the pedometers were
fixed shut in the control group. Clinical and demographic data such as gait aid used, walking assistance required, discharge destination and adverse
events was also collected at recruitment and discharge of the study.
Both groups received a Yamax Digiwalker
SW200 pedometer (Yamax Corp., Tokyo, Japan), a
pedometer well used in research with established
validity.[18,21,22] They were instructed to wear it on
their waist band, in line with their arm pit. It was
encouraged to be worn for all waking hours that a
participant was in their day clothes for the duration
of their rehabilitation stay. For the control group,
the pedometer was fixed in a shut position so that
the participants could not see the step count,
whereas the intervention group could see the step
count on the pedometer. All participants received
usual care. This included individualized exercise
prescribed by a physiotherapist, carried out by
either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant in
individual and/or group settings. In addition, all
participants received an independent exercise programme with up to three to six exercises that they
were encouraged to carry out independently or
with supervision as required from family, visitors
and staff. They were provided with a fresh exercise
log each week. All participants had walking
included as an exercise in this programme.
Participants in the control group were asked to estimate the distance walked each day utilizing support material provided, and the participants in the


intervention group were asked to record the number of steps taken at the end of the day as displayed
on the pedometer. Family and nursing staff were
asked to assist. The standardized wording to participants, family and staff was to ‘try to walk more
each day’ and either ‘estimate distance’ or ‘record
steps’.
Changes in the De Morton Mobility Index, comfortable and fast walking speeds, and functional
independence measure were assessed using general
linear model repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (SPSS Statistics software, version 23) to
compare the interaction of time and group allocation over time. Daily time spent upright and daily
step count on pedometers and accelerometers were
analysed using Mann–Whitney tests. Study characteristics for both groups were compared using
Mann–Whitney tests (for continuous variable) and
chi-square test (for categorical variables). Perceived
levels of enjoyment, helpfulness and ease of use of
pedometer were analysed for the intervention group
using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs).
The sample size for this study was based on a
previous study conducted in a subacute rehabilitation setting with a similar cohort.[20] It showed the
median De Morton Mobility Index score was 30.2
with a standard deviation of 16.7. Sample size
estimation was based on the group achieving a
minimal detectable change and clinically meaningful change of 10.5 points on the De Morton
Mobility Index. With a two-tailed significance
threshold of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 40 participants were required in each group. To account for
drop outs, 88 participants were recruited for this
study.

## Results

A total of 88 participants consented to take part in
the study from 239 consecutively screened patients.
Three withdrew prior to baseline assessment,
therefore 85 participants were randomized and
allocated to control or intervention group (Figure
1) and included for analysis. In several outcome
measures _n_ < 85, due to missed data points when
assessments were carried out. Seven people in the
control group were aware of their step count at

some point throughout the study but were assessed
as per their allocation. Participants wore the
pedometer for a mean (SD) of 22 (16) days in the
intervention group and 23 (13) days in the control
group. There were no significant differences
between groups at baseline as shown in Table 1. No
adverse events were recorded.
Overall, there was a significant effect of time
showing an improvement on the De Morton
Mobility Index, but there was no effect of group
allocation or interaction effect between time and
group allocation. There was a significant effect of
time resulting in an increase in functional independence measure score and comfortable walking velocity. There was a significant effect of
time and interaction effect between time and
group allocation resulting in an increase in fast
walking velocity for both groups to a similar
speed (Table 2). There were no between group
difference in discharge destinations, the length of
rehabilitation admissions or the time the pedometer was worn.
The daily average upright time between 8 am and
8 pm was significantly longer for the intervention
group. The pedometer significantly under-reported
daily step count compared with that measured on the
activPAL[TM] (Table 3). Subsequently, the steps taken
per day were significantly more for the intervention
group when assessed with the activPAL[TM] but not
the pedometer. Overall, participants in the intervention group found the pedometer enjoyable (median,
IQR: 4, 1), helpful for their recovery (median, IQR:
4, 1) and easy to use (median, IQR: 4, 1).

## Discussion

There was no significant difference in functional
mobility outcomes between those who could and
could not see the step count on the pedometer,
although those who could see the count spent significantly longer in an upright position in the first
week.
No significant differences were found between
groups on the primary outcome of functional mobility. This may be due to lack of individualized targets or reduced engagement secondary to inaccuracy
of the pedometer. Apart from the consistent


wording of ‘try to walk more each day’, there were
no specific targets given to participants. This
allowed the pedometer to be assessed as a standalone motivational tool. The feedback provided by
allied health staff upon recording and collection of
exercise logs and step counts was not standardized.
In a recent study, standardized regular feedback
around performance did not appear to affect physical activity.[23] In contrast, individualized goal setting around the number of steps appeared to be an
important factor in increasing physical activity and
step count.[12,24] Perhaps, if targeted step count goals
depending on age, mobility and impairment were
used, similar to walking programmes done in the
community, there may be a greater degree of change
between groups.
The majority of participants required a gait aid
and/or a person to standby or assist with their
mobility. This is of interest as most previous studies in the community have excluded those that
require gait aids.[25,26] The need for assistance coincides with slow gait velocities as seen at baseline
(Table 1). Recent studies have highlighted the inaccuracy of step counters below walking speeds of
0.6 m/s,[18,19] especially when worn at the hip. The
accuracy has found to be improved with more
recent activity monitors by wearing them on the
ankle,[27] allowing greater chance for the device to
detect acceleration. A recent study[15] did include
participants with similar gait aid and level of assistance required for walking characteristics at baseline; however, they were investigating the use of
accelerometer and its ability to motivate and promote physical activity measured in walking time.
They also concluded that upright time may be a
more accurate measure secondary to low walking
speeds.
With the research on inaccuracy of pedometers in
slower walking speeds increasing, pedometers may
be demotivating. Those who saw their step counts
on the pedometer may feel it did not reflect the number of steps they had taken. This could reduce
engagement with the pedometer and contribute to
the lack of change in mobility outcomes between
groups. Steps taken with the pedometer were not different between groups, however, they were significantly lower than the number of steps detected with

the accelerometer. The lower pedometer step count
may also be partially due to reduced time being
worn by the participant compared with the accelerometer. As this was a pragmatic study looking at
feasibility in a clinical setting, pedometers were
donned once the participant was dressed for the day
and then removed when they got ready for bed. The
time worn was not explicit as it was for the accelerometer, hence they are not directly comparable.
Average daily upright time and steps taken
according to the accelerometer between 8 am and
8 pm were significantly different between the two
groups in the first week of intervention. The intervention group spent approx. 24 minutes more in
an upright position and walked approx. 350 steps
more daily than the control group. It is difficult to


compare between studies as many use walking
time or step count accelerometer data[15,28] and do
not specify the time that the accelerometer was in
place. Although a recent randomized controlled
trial[15] found a statistically significant difference
in walking time, the clinical significance of
seven minutes more a day is unknown. Similarly,
24 minutes has not translated into significant
functional mobility changes. As highlighted in
recent research, it may be that upright time is a
better measure as slow walking speeds are not
accurately captured on some accelerometers.[19]
This is supported by other research finding that
there is an increase in error differentiating between
walking and standing times when gait velocity
less than 0.67 m/s.[29]

Walking velocity has been used to predict if
someone is a household ambulator, a limited
community ambulator or a community ambulator.[30] Both groups started within the limited community ambulatory range (0.4–0.8 m/s), remained
in this range for comfortable velocity and
improved to the next category within fast velocity. This demonstrates how limited a person’s
mobility on discharge from subacute rehabilitation is as the average velocity required to cross a
street safely is approximately 1.2 m/s.[31,32]
Functional mobility required for discharge will
likely limit walking speed and functional independence measure scores. Once people get to a
certain functional status they will be discharged,
so it is perhaps not surprising that they did not
achieve faster walking speeds. This is a limitation within this population.
A limitation in this study was a small number of
participants in the control group became aware of
their step counts for some part of the study when
mistakenly written on their exercise log. This may
have biased these people to be more physically
active than they would have if they had not been
provided with feedback on step count. This has
proven difficult to monitor despite clear paperwork
and perhaps reflects the nature of having multiple
clinical staff – nursing and allied health involved
with assisting in pedometer use. Despite this, it is
not expected that this influenced the results.
To our knowledge, there have been no other randomized controlled trials that have assessed the use of
a pedometer as a motivational tool to improve functional mobility outcomes in a subacute setting. There

have been increasing number of studies conducted in
subacute rehabilitation using accelerometers or other
technology to provide regular feedback about their
walking ability. Only one of these has found a significant change in walking time,[15] while others have
found changes in walking speed.[33] While pedometers
are inexpensive and more accessible than accelerometers they do underestimate step counts. This may
demotivate users to increase step-related activity.
Small increases in upright time and steps taken do
not appear to translate into improvements in functional outcome measures. Further studies are warranted using pedometers that are more accurate at
slower walking speeds to assess if accurate feedback
provides the motivation for patients to be more
active, and if this in turn will result in improvements
in functional outcomes.


**Clinical messages**

 - Pedometers alone do not improve
functional mobility in subacute
population

 - Pedometers alone do not affect speed
of recovery

 - Pedometers did increase the time
spent upright in the first week of
being worn.
