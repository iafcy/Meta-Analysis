OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether specific ambulation
goals affect the adequacy or perceived barriers to
ambulation in hospitalized surgical patients after major
gynecologic surgery.

METHODS: One hundred forty-six surgical inpatients
were randomized to specific ambulation goals or routine
care. We assessed the number of pedometer-recorded
steps in the 24 hours preceding discharge as well as
patient-identified barriers to ambulation. Groups were
compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

RESULTS: Of the 129 participants with outcome data, 12%
were discharged without any pedometer-recorded steps.
We did not detect an effect of specific ambulation goals by
group (routine care: 87 compared with ambulation goals:
80, P5.7). The three main barriers to ambulation from
a patient perspective were indwelling catheters (38.5%),
intravenous poles (28%), and pain (12.5%) The median number of postoperative steps was higher after minimally invasive surgery (143) compared with laparotomy (27) (P5.035).

CONCLUSION: Approximately 12% of gynecologic surgical patients do not walk while hospitalized despite
formal encouragement to ambulate. Ambulation is easily
quantified and may improve with attention to modifiable
barriers, potentially improving postoperative recovery.

arly ambulation after surgery is important and
desired for most operations.[1][–][3] The surgical litera
# E

ture documents the favorable effect of postoperative
ambulation on reduction of surgical complications
such as atelectasis, pneumonia[4] and venous thromboembolism.[5,6] In addition, early ambulation has also
been shown to shorten recovery time[7] and to decrease
the length of hospital stay.[8]

Ambulation is usually a discharge requirement;
however, there is no standard definition of ambulation
nor guidelines to determine the adequacy of postsurgical ambulation. Little data are available that
quantify how much the average patient ambulates after
abdominal surgery. In a study of patients undergoing
total knee arthroplasty, Ilfeld et al[9] described sufficient
ambulation as at least 30 meters without a time limit as
a discharge criteria. In a separate study about enhanced
recovery programs, Maessen[10] included ambulation in
his discharge criteria measured by independence in
activities of daily living but did not define or quantify
ambulation. Browning et al[11] recorded upright mobilization in minutes after upper abdominal surgery
and concluded that the average postoperative
upright mobilization time is low. Another small
study found that women especially benefit from the
use of an accelerometer and standardized encouragement after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[12] A recent
Cochrane Review about enhanced recovery programs in postoperative care was not informative as
a result of the lack of randomized controlled trials.[13]

The lack of a quantifiable, standardized definition for
adequate ambulation may be an opportunity
for health care teams to improve the metrics used
for sufficient ambulation. This study was designed
to estimate whether enhanced encouragement of
ambulation affects the number of pedometerrecorded steps taken in the 24 hours before discharge
when compared with the usual postoperative care.

##### MATERIALS AND METHODS
This randomized controlled trial was approved by the
institutional review board at Loyola University and
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01254851).
Patients who were to undergo gynecologic surgery
were enrolled from January 2011 to June 2011 at Loyola University Medical Center. We approached adult
(aged 18 years or older) English-speaking women
before undergoing major gynecologic surgery who
were expected to have at least a 24-hour hospital stay
postoperatively. We excluded non-English speakers
and women who were not able to walk independently
before surgery. All participants provided written and
oral consent for research participation.

A Student’s t test was used to compare proportions of age and body mass index (BMI, calculated as
weight (kg)/[height (m)][2]); a x[2] test was used to compare proportions of type of surgery, gynecologic service, and race and ethnicity; and a Mann-Whitney U
test was used to compare discharge days (Table 1).

A resident physician enrolled participants before
surgery. Randomization occurred after completion of
their surgery when the surgeon had determined that
no intraoperative events had changed the preoperative
plan for the patient to ambulate freely immediately
postoperatively. Patients were randomized to usual
care or specific ambulation goals using sequentially

numbered opaque envelopes that had been prepared
by the study biostatistician using a computer-generated list of randomization using a permuted block.
The resident physician on service opened the randomization envelope and initiated the intervention
when applicable.

The primary outcome was the number of
pedometer-recorded steps documented in the 24 hours
immediately before discharge. The 24 hours before
discharge was chosen for ease of comparison between
patients regardless of the length of their hospital stay.
Furthermore, if ambulation is used as a discharge
criterion, a patient’s ambulation should be highest in
the timeframe immediately before discharge. Steps
were recorded with a commercially available pedometer, which was placed around the patient’s neck with
a lanyard in the postoperative recovery room. The
manufacturer reported a precision of step-counting
65% for this device tested by a vibration-testing
machine. Patients were instructed to wear the pedometer at all times except during showers. Placement and
retrieval events were documented in the patient’s chart
and pedometer data were downloaded using the Omron Health Management software.

The study group was given specific ambulation
goals as our standardized intervention. We used
bedside signs and signs on the patient’s hospital room
door to reinforce the specific ambulation goal of at
least 500 steps before discharge. The health care team
(doctors and nurses) was instructed to remind the
patients in the intervention group to ambulate with
every patient encounter. The control group received
standard postoperative care with no extra encouragement for ambulation. In our hospital there is no specific protocol for standard care in terms of ambulation
in place. It is the expectation that health care workers
are consistently encouraging and aiding patient ambulation; however, this is not quantified in any way.

Patients also completed a visual analog scale (0–10)
to rate their difficulty with ambulation both preoperatively and postoperatively immediately before discharge.
A Student’s t test for related samples was used to test for
differences in these ratings. We also assessed patient perception of obstacles to ambulation using a 10-question
nonvalidated patient survey, which included options
such as urinary catheters, lack of privacy, embarrassment
from hospital gowns, lack of help from staff, and pain.
This questionnaire was developed by the study authors
and was completed by study participants on the day of
their discharge. Finally, we performed a subgroup analysis that compared open and minimally invasive (vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic) operative approaches
using the Mann-Whitney U test for group comparison.

Given the lack of data in the literature, we
performed a pilot study to inform our study design.
This pilot study involved 25 patients who had major
gynecologic surgery to assess the timing, frequency,
and amount of postoperative ambulation. This pilot
study was able to demonstrate the feasibility of using
a pedometer to quantify ambulation in the postoperative setting. The data from this study revealed a wide
range of steps (0–3,458) with a surprisingly low
median number of steps in the 24 hours before discharge (40). The distribution of steps was highly
skewed with just over one-fourth of the participants
having no pedometer-recorded steps before hospital
discharge. Given these data, we anticipated that a nonparametric test of significance would be needed to
examine the effect of ambulation encouragement in
our randomized trial.

We also considered that a clinically significant
effect of encouragement would be evidenced if 65% of
patients in the control group were at or below the
median number of steps in the treatment group (as
opposed to 50%, which would indicate no treatment
effect). From this, calculations indicated that 59
patients per group would be necessary to provide
80% power using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test
with a .05 a level.

the flow of patients through the study. Ultimately data
from 129 surgical patients were analyzed; 68 in the
usual care group and 61 in the goal enhanced ambulation group. The loss of data resulted from loss of the
pedometers before downloading the data.

We did not detect significant group differences in
mean age (53 compared with 56 years), mean BMI
(30.6 compared with 30.5 kg/m[2]), race, type of surgery, gynecologic service, or discharge day (Table 1).
Roughly 50% of the study participants were included
in the study from the gynecologic oncology service
with the primary procedures being robotic or staging
laparotomies for endometrial or ovarian cancer.
Another 30% of our study patients were undergoing
urogynecologic procedures including robotic, laparoscopic, and vaginal hysterectomies with prolapse
repair. The final 20% of all study participants underwent hysterectomy for benign indications, including
leiomyoma and abnormal uterine bleeding or adnexal
procedures for benign reasons.

The majority of all study patients (n581 [62.8%])
were discharged on postoperative day 1, which means
that the number of steps in the 24 hours before discharge corresponds to the total number of steps taken
during their entire hospitalization. Twenty-five percent
(n533) of patients were discharged on postoperative
day 2, and the remaining patients were discharged on
postoperative days 3–9. There was no significant group
difference in discharge day between the routine and
goal-enhanced care groups (1.71 compared with 1.54,
P5.388, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no statistically significant group difference between numbers of
steps (ambulation goal group: median 80 steps [range 0–
2,353] compared with usual care group: median 87 steps

[range 0–3,576], Mann-Whitney U test, P5.70) (Fig. 2).

Eight patients (12%) in each group took no
pedometer-recorded steps before discharge. There
was no significant difference between the group of
participants that did not walk (n516) and the group
that walked (n5113) in age, BMI, race, discharge day,
type of surgery or preoperative, and postoperative
difficulty score (Table 2). Groups were compared with
a Student’s t test for age, BMI, and discharge day; a x[2]

test for race and type of surgery; and a Mann-Whitney
U test for preoperative and postoperative difficulty
walking scale.

Participants reported a mean preoperative ambulation difficulty score of 1.47 out of 10 compared with
a mean postoperative difficulty score of 4.79 out of 10
on a visual analog scale. There was a statistically
significant difference in these ratings (P,.001). Most
(80%) participants returned the ambulation barrier
survey. Urinary catheters (38.5%), intravenous poles

ambulation barriers overall. There was no significant
difference in barrier perception between the intervention group and the control group (indwelling urinary

taken between those who underwent a minimally
invasive procedure (median 143, range 0–3,576) and
those who had an open abdominal procedure (median

##### DISCUSSION
This study provides baseline data to quantify postoperative ambulation in hospitalized patients recovering from gynecologic surgery. Despite widespread
acceptance of ambulation as a discharge criterion, we
found that ambulation appears insufficient with at
least one in 10 patients taking no pedometer-recorded
steps before discharge.

The lack of ambulation and an operational, quantifiable definition of “ambulation” highlight opportunities to improve patient care. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of quantifying ambulation in hospitalized
postoperative patients. Given the importance of ambulation, we suggest that further research be considered to
facilitate an operational definition that is universally
accepted. Perhaps ambulation could be treated as a vital
sign quantified and reported regularly among health
care team members. This study shows one easy way
in which physicians can quantify patients’ ambulation
to decide if they are ready for discharge.

Although ambulation was a discharge criterion, at
least one in 10 patients were discharged without
pedometer-recorded steps. Although pedometer failure
was a possibility, we do not believe that pedometer
function is the cause of this finding, because we
confirmed pedometer function in each of these situations
consistent with our protocol. We did not assess whether
the health care team’s discharge decision would have
been altered with knowledge of insufficient ambulation,
but this seems to be an important area for future study.

Although we did not detect improvements in
ambulation with specific ambulation goals, we believe
that this may be the result of an insufficient intervention, lack of attention to patient-identified barriers, or
other factors. We found some easily modifiable
barriers to ambulation as identified by patients in
a questionnaire. Simple interventions such as early
discontinuation of indwelling catheters, discontinuation of intravenous fluids, and improving pain control
have the potential to increase postoperative ambulation and thus overall postoperative outcome.

Body mass index and age (factors that are not
modifiable at the time of surgery) were not correlated
with ambulation. It seems that patients can be categorized into walkers who have an active lifestyle and
nonwalkers, patients who have a more sedentary

lifestyle. This seems to be a matter of personality and is
not directly correlated to their BMI or age. Older age is
often associated with medical comorbidities such as
arthritis, visual disturbances, unsteady gait, shortness of
breath, and so on. Patients with these types of comorbidities might be more hesitant to freely ambulate in
a nonfamiliar environment. There is a possibility that
just the intervention of wearing a pedometer could
increase the amount of ambulation in hospitalized
patients, but this effect was not quantified in this study.

As clinically anticipated, patients who underwent
minimally invasive surgery had a statistically significant
higher number of steps postoperatively compared with
those who underwent an open abdominal procedure.
This provides further support for the benefits of
a minimally invasive approach to surgery whenever
clinically reasonable.

Because our patient population included a wide
range of age, BMI, and race, we consider our results as
generally valid and reproducible to a larger sample.
Weaknesses of this study include the difficulty ensuring
that encouragement was given in a uniform manner,
because we did not quantify the frequency of encouragement by the health care team. Although the data are
generalizable to the entire gynecologic population, the
number of patients in each subspecialty is too low to
comment on significance in these areas. The study has
several strengths. It provides quantifiable baseline data
about average postoperative ambulation after modern
gynecologic surgery. The feasibility of quantifying
ambulation allows many further studies that are likely
to enhance patient safety and the quality of postoperative care. Ambulation quantification may also improve
the precision of health care team communication
regarding an individual patient’s postoperative status.

We believe our findings provide a baseline for
further research into methods to optimize postoperative ambulation.
