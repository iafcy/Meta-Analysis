**Abstract**
_Background. Regaining independent ambulation is important to those with stroke. Increased walking practice during “down_
time” in rehabilitation could improve walking function for individuals with stroke. Objective. To determine the effect of
providing physiotherapists with accelerometer-based feedback on patient activity and walking-related goals during inpatient
stroke rehabilitation. Methods. Participants with stroke wore accelerometers around both ankles every weekday during
inpatient rehabilitation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily feedback about walking activity via their
physiotherapists (n = 29) or to receive no feedback (n = 28). Changes in measures of daily walking (walking time, number
of steps, average cadence, longest bout duration, and number of “long” walking bouts) and changes in gait control and
function assessed in-laboratory were compared between groups. _Results. There was no significant increase in walking_
time, number of steps, longest bout duration, or number of long walking bouts for the feedback group compared with the
control group (P values > .20). However, individuals who received feedback significantly increased cadence of daily walking
more than the control group (P = .013). From the in-laboratory gait assessment, individuals who received feedback had a
greater increase in walking speed and decrease in step time variability than the control group (P values < .030). Conclusion.
Feedback did not increase the amount of walking completed by individuals with stroke. However, there was a significant
increase in cadence, indicating that intensity of daily walking was greater for those who received feedback than the control
group. Additionally, more intense daily walking activity appeared to translate to greater improvements in walking speed.

## Introduction

Improved walking function is the most common rehabilitation goal poststroke.[1,2] Evidence suggests that high-volume,[3-5] task-specific[6-10] rehabilitation delivered early
poststroke[3,8] improves function. Therefore, individuals with
stroke who wish to improve walking function should do
extensive walking practice, if possible, early in rehabilitation. Increasing walking activity outside of structured inpatient rehabilitation could be one strategy to increase walking
practice. However, previous studies report that individuals
with stroke walk very little during inpatient rehabilitation,[11-14] typically in short-duration bouts (<1 minute)[11,12,14,15]
to essential activities (eg, washroom, dining area, or therapy).[11] Therefore, methods to increase daily walking activity
during inpatient stroke rehabilitation should be explored.[16]


Goal setting, in which rehabilitation goals are determined by patients in collaboration with the interprofessional health care team, is an essential part of rehabilitation.
Appraisal and feedback are important constructs in

goal-setting theory.[17,18] Feedback of progress toward goals
can increase motivation, improve self-efficacy, and aid
action planning.[18] Accelerometers can be used to quantify
daily walking activity[16,19] to provide such feedback.
This study aimed to determine the benefit of providing
feedback regarding characteristics of patients’ daily walking activity to their physiotherapists as part of a goal-setting process. Feedback of the amount and intensity of daily
walking, durations of walking bouts, and times of day
when patients walked was provided. Our primary hypothesis was, compared with a control group, those who
received feedback of daily walking activity would increase
total daily walking activity, as measured by total walking
time and total number of steps. To examine characteristics
of daily walking, we also compared changes in length of
walking bouts (ie, frequency of walking bouts >5 minutes
and longest walking bout) and intensity of daily walking
activity (ie, average cadence) between groups. We expected
that increased walking activity would translate to better
walking outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that the
feedback group would show greater improvements in
walking function and control than the control group, as
measured with laboratory-based gait assessment (ie,
increased self-selected walking speed, decreased variability, and improved spatiotemporal symmetry). Assuming
that feedback improves self-efficacy and that increased
walking activity helps participants achieve walking goals,
we hypothesized that participants who received feedback
would have greater increases in stroke self-efficacy and
higher rates of attainment of rehabilitation goals than the
control group.

## Methods

 Study Design

This single-blind randomized controlled trial spanned inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient rehabilitation, and postrehabilitation community reintegration; the current article
focuses on data from the inpatient rehabilitation phase. The
study was approved by the institution’s research ethics
board. Further protocol details can be found elsewhere.[19]

## Participants

Individuals with subacute stroke attending inpatient rehabilitation at Toronto Rehab were recruited. To be considered
for inclusion, participants (a) had a walking-related rehabilitation goal and (b) were able to walk without supervision at the time of enrolment. Patients who were not
ambulatory on admission were reassessed for eligibility 2 to
3 times per week until they either became eligible or were
discharged. Individuals unable to provide consent due to


_p_

foreign language or cognitive impairment were excluded.
Participants provided written informed consent prior to
participation.

## Group Allocation and Blinding

Participants were assigned using blocked stratified randomization (block size = 4) to 1 of 2 groups: (a) feedback (FBK)
or (b) no feedback (ie, control group; CON). There were 2
strata based on self-selected walking speed at enrolment
(slow walkers: <0.42 m/s; moderate-fast walkers: ≥0.42
m/s); stratification ensured that the 2 groups did not differ
on walking speed, an important predictor of functional
mobility.[20] Concealed group allocation was performed
using a computer-generated random sequence by an investigator who was not involved in participant screening. A
blinded research assistant screened and enrolled participants, conducted the assessments, processed data, and generated reports. Reports for FBK participants were delivered
to the physiotherapist by an investigator who was not
involved in data collection. The physiotherapists administered goal-setting/planning, including incorporating the
walking activity report for FBK participants. Participants
were not blinded and were informed of the chance of being
allocated to either group.

## Activity Monitoring

Participants wore 2 lightweight commercially available triaxial accelerometers (Model X6-2mini, Gulf Data Concepts,
LLC, Waveland, MS), one on each limb, for all waking
hours every weekday (excluding statutory holidays) from
the time of enrolment into the study until discharge from
inpatient rehabilitation. The accelerometers recorded
3-dimensional accelerations in blocks of 8 hours at 40 Hz.
Participants were instructed to only remove the accelerometers before going to sleep at night, when showering, and
when required for clinical testing. Each morning before the
start of therapies (ie, before 9 am) a research assistant
replaced the accelerometers and documented protocol deviations (eg, difficulty wearing accelerometers or if they were
removed before the end of the day).
Data were transferred from the accelerometers and processed using a custom-written algorithm implemented in
MATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). The 3 dimensions of raw accelerations were high-pass filtered at 0.25Hz
to remove the gravity component[21] and low-pass filtered at
5 Hz. Data were automatically reoriented to obtain a consistent frame of reference. A supervised machine learning
algorithm was used to automatically detect walking
sequences. Specifically, a RUSBoost binary classifier[22] was
trained on a set of manually labeled data containing walking
and various other activities from 17 participants outside of


-----

_f_

this study. Since accelerometer data have a significant class
imbalance, that is, more time not walking than walking,
RUSBoost was seen as an appropriate algorithmic choice as
it randomly undersamples the majority class in the training
data so that the number of examples of each class is equal.
We used a MATLAB implementation of RUSBoost that
used decision trees internally. The training data included
nonwalking segments, including samples where participants used exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in
order to help differentiate other reciprocal lower-limb activity from walking. By analyzing labeled training data, the
algorithm learned to automatically identify patterns corresponding to walking, and was then used to assign a label to
short, 1-second long, segments of study data. By sliding a
query segment along a long sequence of accelerometer data,
we identified times when participants were walking and the
duration of each walking bout. A bout of walking was
defined by ≥4 consecutive steps with <10 seconds between
steps; if there was a pause of 10 seconds or more between
steps, a new bout was identified.[11] Number of steps, bout
duration, and cadence were calculated for each walking
bout.
The algorithm was based on one previously validated for
measuring walking activity among individuals with subacute stroke.[11] The older algorithm[11] relied on the 2 accelerometers being precisely synchronized in time, which was
not always possible with the current accelerometers, and
classified reciprocal nonwalking activity (eg, cycling) as
walking. The new algorithm has good agreement with the
previously validated algorithm among a subset of 34 participants (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.89 for walking time and 0.87 for step count).

## Intervention

Walking feedback was provided within the context of the
rehabilitation team’s standard goal-setting process.
Participants identified their own rehabilitation goals at
admission. Participants and their physiotherapists collaboratively identified specific and measureable subgoals.
For example, one goal might be “to be able to walk to my
local subway station.” The physiotherapist could then
assign a walking program of incrementally increasing difficulty based on the estimated time to walk to the subway
station. For example, if the subway station is 15 minutes
from the participant’s home, then the program might
involve walking 5 times per day starting with 5 minutes
continuously and increasing by 1 minute each day until the
target time is achieved. Participants received 1 hour of
physiotherapy per day; thus, physiotherapists had daily
opportunities to discuss progress with physiotherapyrelated rehabilitation goals (eg, walking goals) with participants. Additionally, participants met with their goal


coordinators (assigned interprofessional team member)
weekly to discuss progress with all rehabilitation goals.
Daily individualized occupational therapy, speech and
language pathology, and/or group therapies may have
been prescribed to participants on an as-needed basis.
Involvement in this study did not influence participation
in other therapeutic activities.
A daily report was generated for each participant summarizing the previous days’ walking activity data (see the
appendix). Reference values for target steps/day for various
populations,[23,24] and interpretation of cadence values[25] were
also provided. Physiotherapists of participants assigned to
the FBK group received the walking activity report daily as
means to appraise achievement of walking goals and subgoals.[17] Walking reports were provided daily to physiotherapists from the second day of enrolment until the participant
either withdrew or was discharged. Physiotherapists decided
how best to use the information provided given participantspecific goals and language, communication, cognitive, and
mobility impairments. Physiotherapists generally used the
information to determine how much daily walking activity
participants completed (ie, total walking time, number of
steps, or bout durations) and if participants complied with
an assigned walking program. In the case of noncompliance, the physiotherapist and participant discussed a strategy for better integrating walking activity into the
participants’ day. In the event that the participant met his/
her specific subgoals for walking activity, more challenging
goals were identified. For CON participants, physiotherapists did not receive accelerometer-based feedback of daily
walking activity. Physiotherapists discussed walking goals
with CON participants daily, but relied on participants’ selfreport for the appraisal portion of the goal-setting process,
as per usual practice.
The physiotherapists were involved in all aspects of the
study design and were supportive of the implementation of
accelerometer-based feedback. The physiotherapists and
research team met regularly prior to, during, and after completing data collection to discuss the study, including the
format and clinically relevant variables to be included in the
report, interpretation of walking data, consensus on guidelines for walking activity feedback, and interpretation of the
study results.

## Measures

The following cohort descriptors were obtained from clinical charts on admission to rehabilitation: age, sex, stroke
onset date, lesion location, usual gait aid, Berg Balance
Scale,[26] and Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment leg
score.[27] The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale[28]
was scored by the research assistant at enrolment. The primary outcome measure was change in walking activity


-----

(total walking duration and total number of steps) from
enrolment into the study to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, as obtained from the accelerometers. Secondary
measures of daily walking activity were average cadence of
each bout, longest bout duration, and number of long walking bouts (>5 minutes).
Additional secondary outcomes pertained to control of
walking, self-efficacy, and goal attainment. Spatiotemporal
features of walking were measured using a 4-m-long pressure sensitive mat (GAITRite, CIR Systems, Inc,
Havertown, PA). Participants started walking at least 1 m
before the start of the mat and were instructed to walk at
their usual pace until they reached a mark 1 m after the end
of the mat. Gait assessment was completed without participants’ usual walking aid, if possible. Participants completed
enough passes across the mat such that at least 18 footfalls
were recorded (typically 3-5 passes), with measures averaged over all passes. Step length, step width, swing time,
and step time were calculated for each step. Spatiotemporal
symmetries were calculated as ratios of left and right step
length and swing time, with the larger number used as the
numerator such that all values were >1.[29] Standard deviations of step length and time were calculated for each limb
separately; variability was the average of the standard deviations for the left and right limbs. Step width variability was
the standard deviation of step width. Walking speed was
also calculated. The Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire
(SEQ)[30] was used to measure stroke-specific self-efficacy.
This 13-item questionnaire asks participants to rate confidence in completing various tasks, including walking
indoors and outdoors, on a scale from 0 to 10. Goal attainment was determined from patient charts at discharge from
inpatient rehabilitation. Goals were classified “achieved,”
“partially achieved,” “not completed,” or “discontinued.”
Falls were documented for safety monitoring purposes.

## Sample Size Estimate

Change in total walking time from the initial assessment to
discharge from inpatient rehabilitation was the primary outcome for sample size estimates. Prior to undertaking this
work, we measured daily walking activity in 5 consecutive
patients attending inpatient stroke rehabilitation (unpublished data). We observed an average increase in total daily
walking activity from 35 minutes on initial assessment to 54
minutes at discharge (~13 days apart); the standard deviation for change in walking time was 23 minutes. Assuming
an average increase in walking activity of ~20 minutes from
admission to discharge with no feedback, we expected that
an increase in daily walking activity of 40 minutes in the
FBK group would be clinically meaningful (ie, twice that
expected with no feedback). Using a sample size formula
for repeated measures ANOVA,[31] a 20-minute greater


_p_

increase in walking time in the FBK than the CON group,
standard deviation of 23 minutes, type I error probability of
.05, and type II error probability of .1, 28 individuals per
group would be required in the final analysis.

## Data Analysis

Baseline characteristics were compared between the FBK
and CON groups with Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests
(continuous or ordinal variables) or χ[2] tests (categorical
variables).
We initially planned to compare walking activity over the
first 3 days with the last 3 days of monitoring.[19] However,
due to a change service delivery at the institution between
the time of study design and execution, many patients were
discharged soon after attaining independent ambulation
leaving fewer days between enrolment and discharge. Due
to shortened length of stay, physiotherapists requested daily
activity reports to begin immediately following study enrolment. Therefore, the first day of monitoring was used as the
baseline measure of walking activity, and the mean of the
last 3 days was used to measure of change over the course
of rehabilitation. The second day was excluded from analysis as feedback was typically initially received during this
day. Change in walking activity across the whole sample
was initially analyzed using paired _t tests comparing the_
daily mean of each measure over the last 3 days to the baseline value.
To test the hypotheses, we subtracted the baseline value
from the mean of the final 3 days of monitoring and included
the difference score in the analysis; fewer days were averaged for individuals with <5 days of monitoring. The pre- to
postintervention difference was also calculated for walking
control measures and SEQ. One-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) was used to compare between-group differences in change in walking activity, spatiotemporal characteristics of walking, and SEQ at the end of the monitoring
period. The difference score was the dependent variable; the
baseline value and time between assessments were included
as covariates. The rate of goal attainment was compared
between the 2 groups using χ[2] tests. Alpha was .05 for all
analyses. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed whenever
possible.

## Results

 Participant Recruiting, Screening, and Retention

All patients admitted between October 2012 and January
2014 were assessed for eligibility (n = 238). Of these, 63
were eligible and agreed to participate. Three withdrew
prior to completing the gait assessment and could not be
randomized; therefore, 60 participants were allocated. Of

**Figure 1. Flow of participants through the study.**
Reasons for exclusion were the following: unable to walk without supervision (n = 60); length of stay too short (eg, participant discharged <3 days
after becoming eligible for the study; n = 37); communication, language, or cognitive impairment prevented obtaining informed consent (n = 20); no
walking-related rehabilitation goal (n = 12); unable to participate due to infection control precautions (n = 6); and unknown (patient did not consent to
screening; n = 3).


those allocated, 9 (4 FBK, 5 CON) walked <0.42 m/s at
study enrolment. Three withdrew with <3 days of activity
monitoring due to early discharge (2 participants) or a
change in medical status (1 participant). On chart review it
was discovered that 2 participants (FBK) did not identify
walking-related rehabilitation goals; however, they were
not excluded as they were referred to the study by their
physiotherapists who considered them to be appropriate for
monitoring and feedback. Therefore, 57 participants (29
FBK, 28 CON) were available for analysis of the primary
outcomes (Figure 1). The 2 groups did not differ on any
baseline measures (Table 1).
Six participants withdrew from the study prior to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation; 4 (2 FBK, 2 CON)
declined further participation, one (FBK) was withdrawn
because of illness, and one (CON) was withdrawn because
accelerometers were lost repeatedly. All available walking
activity data for these 6 participants were included in
analysis.

## Intervention Adherence and Adverse Events

There were 508 activity monitoring days for both groups
combined; participants completed 3 to 26 days of monitoring (mode = 11 days). Reports were generated for all
monitoring days, except those with technical difficulties


(5 days), and delivered to the physiotherapists (FBK participants); a note was included with the report when
accelerometers were not worn for the full day (16 days)
or when temporary illness limited activity (2 days). One
participant (FBK) experienced a fall during activity
monitoring. The fall occurred while bending to retrieve
something from the floor so was unlikely to be related to
increased walking activity. No other adverse events were
reported.

## Missing Data

Ten participants (7 FBK, 3 CON) had fewer than 3 days at
the end of activity monitoring for inclusion in analysis. For
9 participants, this was due to discharge soon after enrolment (<5 days), whereas 1 participant (FBK) had 5 days of
activity monitoring but 1 day was excluded from analysis as
he removed the accelerometers after just 4 hours. In addition to the 6 individuals who withdrew prior to discharge,
gait data were not available for 3 participants (2 FBK, 1
CON) who declined discharge assessment. Gait data were
also excluded from analysis if participants were assessed
under different conditions at the 2 time points (6 FBK, 7
CON); that is, if they were unable to walk without an aid
on the initial assessment but no longer required an aid on
discharge. Therefore, 35 participants (18 FBK, 17 CON)

were included in analysis of gait data. Twenty-nine participants declined the SEQ at one or both time points, or were
unable to complete the SEQ due to communication or cognitive difficulties; therefore, analysis of SEQ data was limited to 22 participants (12 FBK, 10 CON). Analysis of goal
attainment was limited to those who identified walking
goals during inpatient rehabilitation (27 FBK, 28 CON).

## Daily Walking Activity

Table 2 shows walking activity for both groups on the first
and last 3 days of monitoring. On average, participants
increased walking time, number of steps, average cadence,
and longest bout duration (t - 2.10; _P < .040), but not_
56
number of long walking bouts (t = 1.29; P = .20), from the
56
time of enrolment until discharge. There were no significant
between-group differences in changes in walking time,
number of steps, number of long walking bouts, or longest
bout duration (P -values > .20). FBK participants showed a


greater increase in average cadence than CON participants
(F = 6.61; _P = .013). To further explore changes in_
1,53
cadence, we calculated the average time spent in slow walking (60-79 steps/min), medium walking (80-99 steps/min),
and brisk walking (100-119 steps/min; Figure 2).[25] FBK
participants appeared to spend slightly less time in slow
walking but increased the amount of time in medium and
brisk walking from enrolment to discharge.

## Laboratory Gait Assessment, Self-Efficacy, and Goal Attainment

FBK participants had a greater increase in walking speed
(F1,31 = 5.54; P = .025) and a greater decrease in step time
variability (F = 5.29; P = .029) than CON participants
1,31
(Table 3). There were no other significant between-group
differences in changes in gait control measures (P values

- .15). There was no significant between-group difference in change in SEQ (F = 0.53; _P = .48; Table 3)._

Intensity of walking was categorized based on reference values from
Tudor-Locke et al.[25] Time spent walking at lower or higher cadences
was minimal and excluded from the figure.

Eighty-nine percent of FBK participants (24/27) and 82%
of CON participants (23/28) reported that rehabilitation
goals were fully achieved. One participant (CON)
reported that rehabilitation goals were not completed; the
remaining participants (3 FBK, 4 CON) reported that
rehabilitation goals were partially achieved. There was no
significant between-group difference in goal attainment
(P = .56).

## Discussion

This study aimed to determine if incorporating accelerometer-based feedback about daily walking into patients’
rehabilitation goal-setting process would increase the
amount and influence characteristics of daily walking
activity, thereby improving walking outcomes among


individuals attending inpatient stroke rehabilitation. The
hypothesis regarding amount of walking was not supported; there was no greater increase in daily walking
activity for individuals whose physiotherapists received
feedback than those who did not. However, one feature of
daily walking did improve with feedback—average
cadence. We interpret the increase in cadence to mean that
daily walking was faster (ie, more intense) when feedback
was received. Indeed, because the ratio between cadence
and step length tends to be consistent at various walking
speeds,[32,33] the modest increase in cadence of daily walking
(6%) likely meant that walking speed was even further
increased (ie, by ~12%). Individuals attending inpatient
stroke rehabilitation may have limited capacity to increase
overall walking time for various reasons, including limited
space or suboptimal environmental layout,[11] stroke-related
motor impairments,[34] low endurance[15] or fatigue, and limited time due to a busy therapy schedule. However, this
work suggests that the intensity (speed of walking) can be
increased.
Increased cadence of daily walking appeared to translate
to faster in-laboratory walking speed. The FBK group more
clearly transitioned from walking speeds typical of “limited
community ambulation” (0.4-0.8 m/s) to those of “full community ambulation” (>0.8 m/s).[35] This finding is clinically
meaningful as individuals with stroke with gait velocity
gains that result in transition to a higher walking speed classification have better function and quality of life than those
who do not.[36] Physiotherapists typically provided feedback
to participants regarding amount of walking to encourage
more walking and rarely referred to cadence. Despite lack
of attention to cadence, participants increased intensity of
daily walking. A specific focus on cadence could lead to
even further increases in daily walking intensity and walking speed.[37] The only other feature of walking control to
improve more in the FBK group than the CON group was
step time variability, which implies a more consistent

aGait data are presented for 35 participants (18 in the feedback group and 17 in the control group), and self-efficacy data are presented for 22
individuals (12 in the feedback group and 10 in the control group). Values presented are means [95% confidence interval]. The p-value is for the

cadence and possibly improved stability.[38] These results
support specificity of practice; that is, increased intensity of
daily walking seemed to lead to greater improvements in
walking speed,[39,40] but not other features of walking, such
as symmetry.
Participants took, on average, 5000 steps/day; this is
similar to some studies reporting walking activity in inpatient stroke rehabilitation (~5500 steps/day[12]) but much
higher than others (<3000 steps/day[11,41]). Therefore, it is
possible that many participants had little room for
improvement, which may partially explain the negative
findings for overall walking activity. When comparing
activity data between studies, it is important to note that
many authors do not identify the daily monitoring duration.[12,41] In the current study, we monitored participants
for all waking hours—typically at least 12 hours per day—
and observed that participants were often active in the evenings. Lower step counts in previous studies could be
partially due to only observing participants during “work
hours” (eg, 9 am to 5 pm).[11,14] Additionally, since participants in both groups wore accelerometers daily and were
aware that their daily walking was being measured, monitoring alone may have been enough to increase walking
activity.
There were no between-group differences in goal
attainment or change in stroke self-efficacy. The large
majority of participants in both groups (>80%) reported
that rehabilitation goals were achieved. Thus, it is possible that these measures are not sensitive enough to
detect between-group differences with the current sample size.


This study is limited by between-participant variability
in intervention duration and method of delivery. The goalsetting process, including feedback and appraisal, was
delivered by participants’ physiotherapists, who may have
been inconsistent in the manner in which feedback was
provided and in how goals were progressed. Additionally,
feedback was provided from the time participants achieved
independent ambulation until discharge from inpatient
rehabilitation. Some participants had very few days of
monitoring (<1 week), and those with longer lengths of
stay may have had more time to benefit from feedback.
However, these inconsistencies reflect the reality of implementation of this type of intervention in clinical practice.
Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the effects observed in
this study would also be observed on clinical implementation. Our ability to detect changes in walking activity is
potentially limited by error in the estimate of baseline
activity; due to a short length of stay for many participants,
we relied on a single day to measure baseline walking
activity.
To conclude, this study found that incorporating accelerometer-based feedback of daily walking activity into the
goal-setting process of individuals attending inpatient
stroke rehabilitation increased intensity (ie, average
cadence, indicating increased speed of daily walking) but
not overall amount of daily walking. Increased intensity of
daily walking appeared to translate to increases in selfselected walking speeds. Additional feedback (eg, related
to gait symmetry) could improve other gait
characteristics.
