## Abstract

Purpose: To investigate whether the use of an activity tracker with feedback increases physical activity and
is safe in patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for gynecologic disorders.
Methods: Patients who were planned to undergo a midline laparotomy for gynecologic diseases wore an
activity tracker at baseline and from postoperative days 1–6. Patients in the experimental arm could monitor
their step counts and were encouraged to achieve the individualized step-count goal daily. In contrast,
patients in the control arm did not monitor their step-counts and received the usual encouragement for
ambulation. The primary endpoint was the percentage of the average step-count at postoperative days 4–5
divided by the baseline activity count.
Results: Seventy-three patients were randomized; 63 patients underwent a surgery and wore an activity
tracker; 53 patients were evaluable for primary endpoint. The activity recovery rate was significantly higher
in the experimental arm compared to the control arm (71% vs 41%, p < 0.01). However, the study arm was
not significantly associated with the activity recovery rate in multivariate analysis. The brief pain inventory
score, brief fatigue inventory score, day of first flatus, day of soft blend diet initiation, ileus incidence, and
length of postoperative hospital stay were similar between arms. The incidence of wound dehiscence and
other adverse events were similar between arms. There were no grade 3 of 4 adverse events.
Conclusion: The use of an activity tracker with feedback is safe and may increase physical activity in
patients who have undergone major gynecologic surgery.

## Introduction

Physical activity reflects functional status and is associated with health outcomes in many conditions. For
example, lower levels of physical activity have been
associated with a longer hospital stay in elderly


inpatients.[1] Health outcomes can be improved by
increasing physical activity. For example, physical
exercise has been shown to reduce the readmission
rate in patients with coronary heart disease,[2] and
physical exercise improves obesity and quality of life
in breast cancer survivors.[3]

Low physical activity levels in the perioperative
period are associated with increased complication rates
and prolonged hospital stay. For example, a low physical activity level in the postoperative period was
reported to be associated with pulmonary embolism and
deep vein thrombosis in patients who underwent heart
surgery.[4,5] The time to ambulation after hip fracture surgery was related to delirium, pneumonia, and prolonged
hospital stay,[6] and a low postoperative physical activity
level was associated with prolonged hospital stay in
patients who underwent coronary artery surgery.[7]

To improve surgical outcomes, several studies have
examined the effect of exercise therapy in diverse settings. For example, inpatient exercise therapy reduced
hospital stay in colon cancer patients.[8] Pre- and early
post-rehabilitation, including intensive mobilization,
reduced the length of hospital stay in patients who
underwent spinal surgery.[9] However, exercise therapy requires resources. For example, in one trial, the
exercise therapy comprised a 15-min exercise session
under therapist supervision twice a day,[8] while in
another trial, an intensified exercise program, protein
supplements, and balanced pain therapy were used.[9]

Therefore, the adoption of exercise therapies in routine practice is challenging.
Simpler methods such as the use of an activity
tracker were reported to increase physical activity and
decrease body mass index and blood pressure mainly
in outpatient settings.[10] The use of an activity tracker
with feedback also accelerated recovery in women who
underwent day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy,[11]

and self-monitoring of physical activity using an activity tracker increased physical activity in hospitalized
cardiac patients.[12] However, there are few studies
examining the effect of activity tracker use in inpatients
who have undergone major surgery, and therefore, it is
unclear whether they are safe and effective in these
patients. For example, unsupervised ambulation in surgical inpatients could result in falls.
We investigated whether activity tracker use, with
feedback, increased physical activity and was safe in
patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for
gynecologic diseases.

## Materials and Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, open-label trial
comparing the effect of using an activity tracker with
feedback with usual care, on physical activity in
patients who underwent a midline laparotomy for


gynecologic diseases. After the institutional review
board approved the protocol (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital IRB, No. E-1311/225-002) and
[registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02344095),](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)
patients were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Republic of Korea from January 2014 to August 2015. All
subjects gave informed consent. The inclusion criterion was a planned midline laparotomy for gynecologic disease. The major exclusion criteria were
conditions in which physical activity should be
restricted, the patient being unable to ambulate independently, anticipated intensive care unit admission,
and anticipated discharge before postoperative day 5.
Before the patients were admitted for surgery, they
were requested to wear an activity tracker (Lifegram,
LA11M-BS, LG) on the wrist for 2 days to determine
the baseline activity that was calculated by averaging
the step-counts for two complete days. When only
one complete day count was measured, we used this
as the baseline activity. After the baseline activity was
measured, patients were randomized into the experimental and control arms in a 1:1 ratio using block randomization. Stratification factors were age (<=60
vs >60) and indication for surgery (confirmed or suspicious cancer vs not cancer). Randomization and
notification of result were performed by the statistics
center of our institute.
Patients in both trial arms wore an activity tracker
from the morning of postoperative day 1 to the morning of postoperative day 6. Patients in the experimental arm self-monitored their step-counts via the
activity tracker and were encouraged to achieve
the individualized step-count goal daily. The goal on
postoperative day 1 was 5% of baseline activity. For
example, a patient with a baseline activity of 10 000
was encouraged to walk 500 steps or more on postoperative day 1. If the patient achieved this, the goal
became the next level. The goals were set at 5%, 15%,
30%, 50%, 80%, 120%, 170%, and 230% of baseline
activity and patients were encouraged to achieve
these daily. Patients were allowed to surpass several
levels in a day. In contrast, patients in the control arm
wore an activity tracker but could not monitor their
step counts because the screen of the activity tracker
was blinded. They received the usual encouragement
for ambulation but no goals were set.
The primary endpoint was the activity recovery
rate at postoperative days 4–5, which is the percentage of the average step count on postoperative days
4 and 5 divided by the baseline activity. For example,
when baseline activity is 10 000 and step counts at

postoperative days 4 and 5 are 3000 and 5000, the
activity recovery rate is 40%. In some cases, only one
complete day of step counts was measured on postoperative days 4–5 because the patient was discharged
at postoperative day 5. In these cases, we used the
one complete day step count as the average step
count of postoperative days 4 and 5. The secondary
endpoints were pain, measured with the brief pain
inventory (BPI) at postoperative days 2 and 5; fatigue,
measured with the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) on
postoperative day 5; day of passing first flatus; day of
initiation of a soft blend diet; ileus incidence, and
postoperative hospital stay. Safety endpoints were the
incidence and grade of wound dehiscence and other
adverse events. The grade was determined according
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.
Based on previous studies,[10,13] the activity recovery
rates in the experimental and control arms were estimated as 36% and 30%, respectively. The standard
deviation of activity recovery rate was assumed as
8%. With alpha error 0.05, power 80%, drop-out rate
10%, and two-sided test, the sample size was determined as 64.
For analysis, two cohorts were defined. The safety
cohort was defined as patients who underwent midline laparotomy and wore an activity tracker for any
duration. Baseline characteristics, surgery characteristics, and safety endpoints were measured in the safety
cohort. The efficacy cohort was defined as patients
who wore an activity tracker until postoperative day
5 and whose activity recovery rates were calculated.
Efficacy endpoints were evaluated in the efficacy
cohort.
To compare variables between arms, the student’s
t-test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact
test were used according to the type of variables and
normality. All analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.1 [5 July, 2019]). This study is being reported
in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Guidelines.

## Results

Seventy-three patients were randomized but
63 patients received surgery and wore an activity
tracker (safety cohort). Ten patients were dropped
due to early discharge, therefore, the remaining
53 patients made up the efficacy cohort (Figure 1). All
baseline and surgery characteristics were balanced


between the experimental and control arms except the
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score
which was lower in the experimental arm (Table 1).
The baseline activity levels were similar between
the experimental and control arms. However, activity
levels at postoperative days 4–5 tended to be higher
in the experimental arm. Therefore, the activity recovery rate was significantly higher in the experimental
than in the control arm (71% vs 41%, p-value <0.01)
(Table 2). However, in the unplanned multivariate
logistic regression analysis including the ASA score
and study arm, the activity recovery rate was associated with the ASA score (1 [ref] vs 2 or 3,
coefficient = �40, p = 0.04) but not with the study
arm (control arm [ref] vs experimental arm,
coefficient = �2, p = 0.90).
The BPI score on postoperative days 2 and 5, the
BFI score at postoperative day 5, the day of first flatus, day of soft blend diet initiation, ileus incidence,
and postoperative hospital stay were similar between
the study arms (Table 2).
The incidence of wound dehiscence and other
adverse events were similar between the arms. There
were no adverse events of grade 3 or higher (Table 3).
In addition, venous thromboembolism did not occur.

## Discussion

The use of an activity tracker with feedback is safe
and may increase physical activity in patients who
have undergone major surgery for gynecological conditions. The difference in activity recovery rate
between the experimental and control arms was substantial, but the ASA score was not balanced between
both arms. In addition, the multivariate analysis
including study arm and ASA score showed that the
activity recovery rate was associated with the ASA
score but not with the study arm. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution. In future
studies investigating the physical activity in surgery
patients, the effect of the ASA score should be
controlled.
Activity tracker use with feedback increased physical activity in outpatient settings.[10] However, the
effect varied according to specific situations. For
example, in patients who underwent bariatric surgery, the use of an activity tracker with exercise
counseling increased physical activity. However,
using an activity tracker without exercise counseling
did not increase physical activity.[14] In another study,

activity tracker use with a smartphone application
did not increase physical activity in breast cancer survivors.[15] Studies of the effect of using an activity
tracker with feedback on physical activity in an inpatient setting are rare and studies on surgical inpatients
are extremely rare. In one randomized trial, the use of
an activity tracker with ambulation goal-setting did
not increase the physical activity in gynecologic surgical patients. However, the hospital stay was less than


2 days, and 12% of the patients were discharged without any physical activity.[16] In patients who underwent major abdominal visceral surgery, the use of an
activity tracker increased the physical activity in the
laparoscopic surgery group but not in open surgery
group.[17] To our knowledge, the present study is the
first to suggest that an activity tracker with feedback
is safe to use and may increase physical activity in
inpatients who underwent gynecologic open surgery.

The present study has several limitations. A major
limitation is the imbalance of the ASA score between
arms, which made the results difficult to interpret.
Second, the absence of baseline measurements of BPI
and BFI scores also makes comparisons difficult.
Third, the short duration of observation and the small
sample make this study underpowered for detecting
the changes in rare and long-term adverse events such
as incisional hernia.
In conclusion, the use of an activity tracker with
feedback is safe and may increase physical activity in
patients who have undergone major surgery for gynecological diseases. However, our findings should be
interpreted with caution because of an imbalance of
ASA scores between arms.
