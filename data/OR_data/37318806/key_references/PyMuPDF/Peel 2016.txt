Abstract
Background
Low activity levels in inpatient rehabilitation are associated with adverse outcomes. The
study aimed to test whether activity levels can be increased by the provision of monitored
activity data to patients and clinicians in the context of explicit goal setting.
Methods
A randomized controlled trial in three sites in Australia included 255 inpatients aged 60 and
older who had a rehabilitation goal to become ambulant. The primary outcome was patients’
walking time measured by accelerometers during the rehabilitation admission. Walking
times from accelerometry were made available daily to treating therapists and intervention
participants to motivate patients to improve incidental activity levels and reach set goals.
For the control group, ‘usual care’ was followed, including the setting of mobility goals; how-
ever, for this group, neither staff nor patients received data on walking times to aid the set-
ting of daily walking time targets.
Results
The median daily walking time in the intervention group increased from 10.3 minutes at
baseline to 32.1 minutes at day 28, compared with an increase from 9.5 to 26.5 minutes per
day in the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly higher non-ther-
apy walking time by about 7 minutes [mean (95% CI): 24.6 (21.7, 27.4)] compared to those
in the control group [mean(95% CI): 17.3 (14.4, 20.3)] (p = 0.001).

Conclusions
Daily feedback to patients and therapists using an accelerometer increased walking times

related activities to assist goal setting.

Introduction
For frail older people, low levels of mobility during hospitalization are associated with func-
tional decline and deconditioning (decline in muscle strength and bulk as a result of physical
inactivity), leading to increased length of stay, post discharge readmission or transfer to perma-
nent residential care [1]. Observational studies [2–4] have shown that activity levels in older
people undergoing inpatient rehabilitation are low, with only 7% to 9% of a monitored eight
hour period spent walking [3] and 65% of daytime hours either asleep or completely inactive
[2]. The factors that contribute to low activity in rehabilitation have not been well studied. One
survey of older patients in a post-acute hospital setting found that, whilst attitudes to exercise
were generally positive, patients over-estimated the adequacy of their activity levels. They were
unsure if they should be doing more exercise and only 11% recalled having been advised to
exercise regularly by a health professional [5]. Subjective clinician assessment of the level of
patient activity in a rehabilitation setting has also been shown to be inaccurate [6].
Rehabilitation for older people should have specific goals, set in conjunction with the
patient, family members and multi-disciplinary team [7]. Goal-setting enhances both the pro-
cess and outcome of clinical care and is a core practice in rehabilitation [8]. To restore physical
function and independence in frail and deconditioned patients, it is important to set measur-
able, attainable mobility goals and to monitor progress carefully [9]. Monitoring and feedback
are essential tenets in health promotion strategies to change behavior, since exercise is signifi-
cantly influenced by self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to exercise) and exercise outcome
expectations [10]. The setting of activity targets (such as achieving a particular heart rate or
step count) has been used to increase levels of physical activity in healthy older people [9].
However, measuring and targeting activity in older patients in rehabilitation settings using
models of exercise prescription and monitoring developed for healthy individuals may not be
appropriate or accurate [9].
Pedometers, widely used to promote physical activity [11] are inaccurate when assessing
step counts as a measure of activity in elderly populations with varying levels of physical dys-
function and gait anomalies [12]. Advances in technology over the past decade have led to the
development of wearable devices, such as accelerometers, with potential for continuous ambu-
latory activity monitoring of older adults in clinical settings [13–16]. Such devices have been
used in research studies of gait and balance analysis for falls risk assessment and to detect pos-
ture changes for activity monitoring in groups such as amputees, medical and surgical patients,
and those with Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, stroke and multiple sclerosis [14].
While the importance of physical activity in the functional recovery of older rehabilitation
patients has been recognized [17], questions remain about the optimal methods to promote

and monitor activity for frail older people in post-acute hospital settings. Based on the findings
of a small feasibility study [18], this study was developed to evaluate the efficacy of using accel-
erometry to promote activity for older inpatients in rehabilitation settings.
The primary aim was to test whether incidental activity levels can be increased by the provi-
sion of objectively measured activity data to patients and clinicians in the context of explicit
goal setting. Secondary aims were to explore the effects of increased walking activity (if
achieved) on patient outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Setting
The study design was a parallel group randomized controlled trial, complying with the recom-
mendations from the CONSORT statement [19]. Before selecting this approach, a variety of
designs, including matched controlled, before-after and cluster randomized trials were exten-
sively considered, against a set of criteria which included feasibility, degree of contamination,
cost and power. The setting was post-acute care Geriatric Rehabilitation Units or Geriatric
Evaluation and Management Units with at least a 40 bed capacity, at three Australian sites.
The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registra-
tion number ACTRN12611000034932).
Participants
Patients admitted to post-acute care rehabilitation who were (1) aged 60 years and older; (2)
able to ambulate independently or with supervision/assistance and had a rehabilitation goal to
become ambulant within the context of the current admission and (3) expected to have a length
of stay of at least two weeks, were eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria were those (1) with
lower limb amputation; (2) with delirium or agitated dementia, as documented by the geriatric
treating team; or (3) not expected to walk within four weeks of admission.
The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at each site. Patients
gave informed written consent to participate; in the event of incapacity to consent, assent for
participation was sought from next of kin or carers.
Study Protocol
Accelerometers were used to monitor patients’ activity in both the intervention and control
groups. For the intervention group, accelerometer data was downloaded daily. Feedback was
provided to the intervention participant and their therapists of the previous day’s walking time
in numerical and graphical form, showing walking time outside therapy sessions compared
with walking target. The treating therapist, in consultation with the patient, set mobility goals,
including provisional targets for daily walking time. These goals were reviewed weekly and
modified, informed by the accelerometer data, to motivate the patient to improve incidental
activity levels outside of therapy sessions and reach set targets. Walking times over a week were
summarized in chart form and made available at the weekly case conference. All staff were
trained in the use of accelerometry data and asked to encourage patients to meet their activity
goals. For the control group, ‘usual care’ was followed, including the setting of mobility goals.
However, neither staff nor patients received data on walking times to aid the setting of walking
time targets.
The monitoring period was four weeks from date of study entry, unless in the interim, the
patient was discharged or unable to continue by virtue of a sudden change in condition which
precluded mobility.

Data Collection and Measures
The primary outcome measure was walking time per day in minutes. Walking time was divided
into time within and outside of therapy sessions, based on recorded therapy session times. Sec-
ondary outcome measures included lower extremity function and functional status, quality of
life, length of monitoring period, and discharge destination measured at study exit and hospital
readmissions at 28 day follow-up post study exit.
Walking time was downloaded daily from the accelerometer by the research assistant
responsible for activity monitoring. A variation in protocol occurred with change in the
activity monitoring device. The accelerometer devices initially used in this study were triaxial
ALIVE Heart and Activity Monitors, manufactured by Alive Technologies Pty. Ltd, Ash-
more, Queensland, Australia. The device was fitted to a band worn around the waist. Based
on validated algorithms [18], the accelerometer measured daily sitting, standing and walking
times. A record was kept of periods when the accelerometer was not being worn, mainly at
night, and calibrated with times when the signal indicated no activity. Due to difficulties with
supply and servicing, the devices were changed part way through the study to ActivPal TM
(PAL Technologies LTD, Glasgow, UK), a validated device [20] which classifies an indivi-
dual's activity into periods spent sitting or lying, standing and walking. The ActivPal is
attached to the front of the mid-thigh with waterproof tape and is capable of continuous
monitoring for three to seven days.
A comprehensive geriatric assessment supported by the interRAI Acute Care Post-Acute
Care (AC-PAC) instrument was administered by a research nurse within three days of entry
into the study, at the 14th day and at discharge or exit from the study. The interRAI instrument
[21] measures a comprehensive set of items including patient demographics, cognition, mood,
functional and mobility status, diagnoses and social support. A number of scales imbedded in
interRAI instruments combine single items belonging to a domain, such as personal and
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL, IADL), which were used to describe the presence
and extent of deficits in that domain [21].
Lower extremity function was assessed by the research nurse at entry into the study, on
the 14th day and at discharge or exit from the study, using the Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB) [22]. The SPPB is a brief, quantitative estimate of future risk for hospitaliza-
tion and decline in health and function, validated in clinical populations of older adults [23].
The SPPB score is based on timed measures of standing balance, walking speed, and ability to
rise from a chair. Each of the three performance measures was assigned a score ranging from
0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the
test. A summary score (range 0–12) is subsequently calculated by adding the three scores
[24].
Health-related quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D three level, a concise measure
widely used internationally across many different diseases and health states [25]. The output of
the instrument is in the form of a utility value (between zero and one) representing quality of
life at that point in time. These utilities can be used to estimate quality adjusted life years
(QALYs), a common measure of health gain or benefit attributable to an intervention. The EQ-
5D was administered by the research nurse at study entry and exit.
A telephone follow-up by the research nurse at 28 days post exit from the study assessed
current living arrangements (community, institutional care, died) and adverse outcomes such
as readmissions to hospital. According to the approved research protocol, this information
could be obtained from the carer, in the event of participant incapacity to respond. All data col-
lection instruments were administered by trained assessors.

Data Management
An Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) was developed and validated following Good Clinical
Practice standards on Food and Drug Administration approved OpenClinica (www.
openclinica.org), a clinical trial software platform for Electronic Data Capture (EDC). The
eCRF development and online data capture was managed by a dedicated data manager from
the Queensland Clinical Trials and Biostatistics Unit.
Recruitment and Randomization Procedure
At each site, at admission to post-acute rehabilitation, potentially eligible patients were identi-
fied by clinical staff and their names provided to the research assistant who obtained informed
consent for participation for those who met eligibility criteria. A random number sequence was
generated for the order of group allocation at each site. The randomization codes were gener-
ated by the Queensland Clinical Trials and Biostatistics Unit and placed in sealed envelopes.
Patients who consented to participate were allocated a unique identification number (ID) and
the research assistant opened the sealed envelope for that ID, which contained the randomiza-
tion code for group allocation. Once opened, the envelope was dated, signed, securely stored
and accessed only by the research assistant who was responsible for activity monitoring. A
research nurse, trained in the use of assessment instruments and blinded to group allocation,
conducted assessments. Rehabilitation staff were not be able to be blinded to the patient’s
allocation.
Statistical Methods
The power analysis for this study was based on accelerometry pilot data of 60 patients [3] with
a mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) daily walking time of 45 (51) minutes, correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.20 between baseline and 14 day follow-up measurements and a correlation coefficient
of 0.60 between the follow-up measurements. Comparative power analyses were conducted for
14 to 20 days of possible repeated measures of daily activities. To observe an increase of activity
by at least 15 minutes (33%) in the intervention group, 108 patients were required in each
group with 14 days of measurements and 105 patients in each group with 20 days of measure-
ments, with 80% power at two-sided 5% level of significance. During the conduct of the study,
activity data were collected for a maximum of 28 days on 255 subjects, thereby significantly
increasing the power of the study.
The basic statistics on study parameters were presented by number (%), mean (SD) or
median (Interquartile Range (IQR)), as appropriate. Intervention and control groups were
compared using Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact tests for categorical variables and t-tests or
Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables, depending on the distribution of the data,
with p value <0.05 taken as the level of significance. The longitudinal trajectories of the daily
in-therapy and non-therapy walking time over 28 days were compared between the treatment
groups using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, with normal distribution
and identity link. The bootstrapped standard errors were obtained, and hence the bootstrapped
95% CI of walking time were presented. The GEE regression model based analyses were
weighted by the use of two devices. The changes in the secondary outcome measures at dis-
charge from admission were presented by mean and 95% confidence interval (CI), compared
between the treatment groups. All analyses were conducted following the intention-to-treat
approach. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 23.0 (Armonk, NY) and Stata
Statistical Software, Release 14 (College Station, TX).

Results
A total of 270 subjects (90 from each of the three sites) were randomized equally between the
intervention and control group. A total of 128 intervention and 127 control subjects received
and continued to follow the study protocol during the course of the study (Fig 1). The median
(IQR) length of the monitoring period was 14 (11–18) days, with 6% of patients completing 28
days of monitoring. There was no significant difference in accelerometer device used by treat-
ment group with 141 (55%) of the participants using the ActivPal (71 intervention; 70 control).
The daily monitoring period of ActivPal users was 24 hours, as the device was worn continu-
ously. For the ALIVE Heart and Activity Monitor users, the median (IQR) daily hours of moni-
toring was 8.3 (6.7, 9.6) for the intervention group and 7.3 (6.0, 9.0) for the control group, with
no significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.07).
The mean (SD) age of subjects was 81 (8) years, 42% were male, 16% had BMI above 30 kg/
m2, and the mean (SD) number of co-morbidities was 8 (4) at randomization. At admission,
84% (n = 215) subjects required supervision or person assistance for walking, and only 16%
(n = 40) could walk unsupervised. Gait speed mean (SD) of 0.32 (0.25) m/sec was slow, charac-
teristic of a population in a sub-acute setting with functional dependence and mobility disabil-
ity [26]. The primary diagnosis in 88 (34.5%) patients was a fracture, most frequently hip
fracture (n = 47). Other primary diagnoses were infections (n = 47), including pneumonia and
urinary tract infections, neurological conditions (n = 29) including stroke, and cardio-pulmo-
nary conditions (n = 25). There were no significant differences between intervention and con-
trol groups on baseline characteristics as shown in Table 1.
The average in-therapy and non-therapy walking time during the 28-day measurement
period are presented in Figs 2 and 3. Subjects in the intervention groups had significantly
higher non-therapy walking time by about 7 minutes [mean (95% CI): 24.6 (21.7, 27.4)]

compared to those in the control group [mean (95% CI): 17.3 (14.4, 20.3)] (p = 0.001, Table 2).
The separation of the non-therapy walking time between treatment groups was evident from
day 3 post study initiation (Fig 2). There was an observed significant difference in average
walking time during therapy (although this is unlikely to be clinically important) (intervention:
4.4 minutes, control: 3.7 minutes, p = 0.021) (Table 2). The median daily walking time in the
intervention group increased from 10.3 minutes at baseline to 32.1 minutes at day 28, com-
pared with increase in median walking times from 9.5 to 26.5 minutes per day in the control
group.
In regard to secondary outcomes (Table 3), the median (IQR) length of stay was 23 days
(16, 35) and was not different between the treatment groups (p = 0.52). Overall, 16% (n = 41)
were discharged to a higher level of care and 7.5% (n = 19) subjects were readmitted within 28
days of discharge. The proportions were not significantly different between the treatment
groups (p = 0.63 and p = 0.46 respectively). The improvements in the short physical perfor-
mance battery (SPPB) and the ADL scale between study entry and exit were not significantly
different between the treatment groups. The average levels of individual components of EQ-5D
scores were similar between the treatment groups.
With the exception of one patient from the control group who withdrew from the study
after two hours because they could not tolerate wearing the accelerometer belt, no adverse
events were recorded from the use of accelerometers.

Discussion
Patients in the intervention arm achieved significantly higher non-therapy walking time by 7.6
min/day on average, compared to the control group. Whether this increase in walking time
confers a clinically meaningful benefit is debatable, although it is possible that any increase in
walking relative to individualised baseline values could confer important health benefits [27].

The prognostic value of physical activity measures such as walking time has not yet been estab-
lished in a rehabilitation setting, although correlations with physical performance measures
such as gait speed have been demonstrated [3, 28]. Remote monitoring using wireless technol-
ogy is seen as a possible supplementary measure to assess outcomes.
No significant differences were found between treatment groups on secondary outcome
measures, although this may be a reflection of the short timeframe of intervention (maximum
four weeks) and follow-up (28 days post discharge). Lack of sensitivity to change could also be
a factor in not observing differences in the secondary outcome measures, and because a num-
ber of physical capacity measures including components of the Short Physical Performance
Battery (such as gait speed, chair rise time and balance tests) have floor effects [28].
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial that utilized accelerometers as a strategy
to improve walking activity for the general population of older patients in a geriatric rehabilita-
tion setting. Two trials to increase walking activity through monitoring and feedback in reha-
bilitation of stroke patients have recently been published [29, 30]. In contrast to our study, no
significant increase in walking time in the intervention group was reported. It was suggested
that the rehabilitation environment, patient fatigue and time allocated for other priorities lim-
ited opportunities to ambulate more frequently [29, 30].

Comparability of walking times achieved in our study with those in previous studies moni-
toring activity in geriatric rehabilitation using wearable devices [28–33] are problematic
because of differences in population characteristics (including primary diagnosis and acuity),
setting (acute, sub-acute or post-acute rehabilitation), period of monitoring and activity mea-
sured (eg step count, walking, or ‘uptime’ which includes standing and walking). For example,
compared with a baseline median daily walking time of 10 minutes in the current study, daily
walking activity varied from 4 minutes in a study of a comparable population referred for reha-
bilitation therapy [33], to 7 minutes in a study of patients rehabilitated following hip fracture
[28] and 23 minutes in moderately impaired elderly stroke patients [31]. Increase in walking
time over the duration of rehabilitation shows similar wide variation, depending on diagnostic
group and period of monitoring.
While it is widely believed that bed rest and inactivity in hospital are detrimental for mobil-
ity and function [34], there are currently no definitive clinical guidelines on optimum physical
activity levels for older adults to guide clinicians in the management for older people admitted
to rehabilitation [35]. Barriers to mobility during hospitalization of older patients that need to
be taken into account in planning successful strategies include health problems, especially
weakness, pain, and fatigue; being attached to a medical device such as intravenous drip or
catheter; being concerned about falls; and lack of staff to assist with out-of-bed activity [36, 37].
Low mobility among hospitalized older adults has also been attributed to lack of patient moti-
vation [36] and environmental factors such as hospital traffic, noise and clutter that present
physical barriers to ambulation [37] and lack of places to go in hospital environs (i.e. patients
are not motivated to move) [33].
Strengths and Limitations
Compared to previous studies, the sample size was large and sufficiently powered to detect
changes in the primary outcome measure of difference in walking time between intervention
and control groups. Because physical therapy sessions could reflect on time spent walking [33],
the walking time in this study was measured for in-therapy and non-therapy times, since the
aim of the study was to motivate patients to increase incidental walking activity. Analyses
included adjustment for monitoring device.
Accelerometry devices may find difficulty differentiating between walking and standing
during very slow walking. This may cause an underestimation of the time spent walking. The
absolute percentage error for the ActivPalTM when discriminating between standing and walk-
ing is <1% at walking speeds from 0.67–1.56 m/s [38] and 3.5% at 0.45 m/s [39]. Since the par-
ticipants in this study had a mean gait speed (as measured by the SPPB) of 0.32 m/sec at
admission and 0.51 m/sec at discharge, the time spent walking may well be underestimated,
and, for this reason, measures of upright time may be more accurate. Changing accelerometry
devices during the study could potentially have influenced results, although there was no signif-
icant difference in the proportions of participants using each device by treatment group.
Contamination cannot be discounted, since blinding of both therapists and patients was not
possible. Both intervention and control groups were aware that activity was being monitored.
Such motivation may have minimized possible differences.
Conclusions
Objective monitoring for the amount of physical activity per day in hospitalized older adults
could provide clinicians with information on clinically important, mobility-related activities to
assist goal setting. Activity prescription could then be a routine component of the care plan,
with professional staff and the patient contributing and responding to the activity plan.
