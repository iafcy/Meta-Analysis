Abstract 
7 
BACKGROUND: 
8 
Commercial wrist worn activity monitors have the potential to accurately assess activity levels, and 
9 
are being increasingly adopted in the general population. The aim of this study was to determine if 
10 
feedback from a commercial activity monitor improves activity levels over the first 6 weeks after 
11 
total hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA). 
12 
METHODS: 
13 
163 consecutive subjects undergoing primary TKA or THA were randomized into 2 groups. Subjects 
14 
received an activity tracker with the step display obscured 2 weeks prior to surgery and completed 
15 
patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). On day 1 after surgery participants were randomized 
16 
to either the “Feedback Group” (FB) or the “Non Feedback Group” (NFB). The FB group were able to 
17 
view their daily step count, and were given a daily step goal. Participants in the NFB group wore the 
18 
device with the display obscured for 2 weeks after surgery, after which time they were also able to 
19 
see their daily step count, but did not receive a formal step goal. The mean daily steps at 1, 2, 6 
20 
weeks, and 6 months were monitored. At 6 months after surgery subjects repeated PROMS and daily 
21 
step count collection. 
22 
RESULTS: 
23 
Of the 163 subjects, 95 underwent THA and 68 underwent TKA. FB subjects had a significantly higher 
24 
(p<0.03) mean daily step count by 43% in week 1, 33% in week 2, 21% in week 6, and 17% at 6 
25 
months, compared to NFB. FB subjects were 1.7 more likely to achieve a mean 7,000 steps per day 
26 
than NFB subjects at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02). There was no significant difference between the 
27 
groups in PROMS at 6 months. 91% of FB and 83% of NFB reported they were satisfied with the 
28 
results of the surgery (p=0.08). At 6 months after surgery 70% of subjects had a greater mean daily 
29 
step count compared to their preoperative level.  
30 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: 
31 
Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had 
32 
significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6 weeks and 6 months, 
33 
compared to subjects who did not receive feedback in a randomized controlled trial. Commercial 
34 
activity trackers may be a useful and effective adjunct after arthroplasty.

Introduction 
38 
Mobility and physical activity are imperative to healthy aging. Evidence supports the positive 
39 
benefits of regular physical activity with higher activity being associated with reduction in the risk of 
40 
chronic disease and premature mortality[1, 2]. More recently associations like The Committee on 
41 
Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorse regular physical 
42 
activity and even classify it as a modifiable risk factor for prevention in cardiovascular disease and 
43 
other chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint 
44 
diseases, and depression[3]. 
45 
 
46 
After joint replacement surgery the aim should therefore not only be to improve pain and function, 
47 
but also lead to improved activity. This activity should preferably meet the recommended daily 
48 
activity levels as recommended by the WHO, US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart 
49 
Foundation of Australia [4] [5]. 
50 
 
51 
Historically, post-operative activity has been monitored by using participant completed subjective 
52 
questionaries. [6, 7].  However, reports in literature have questioned the accuracy and validity of this 
53 
form of assessment. It has been identified that in self-assessment of physical activity people tend to 
54 
overestimate their level of activity by as much as 50%.[5] Verlaan et al. reported that up to 62% of the 
55 
general population meet the activity intensity guidelines according to their self-assessment questionnaire 
56 
whereas only 9.6% meet these same guidelines when defined from objective physical activity 
57 
monitoring[8].  
58 
 
59 
With the recent development of commercial-based accelerometers (activity trackers) the 
60 
“subjective” error has been decreased and it has become easier to accurately measure daily activity 
61 
level. It has also been identified that these activity trackers have a great potential to accurately 
62 
assess activity level before and after joint arthroplasty[9]. These devices are largely used in the 
63 
fitness industry as a motivational tool for those wanting to monitor and improve fitness. More 
64 
importantly these devices have been shown to be a valid and reliable assessment tool for activity 
65 
levels in normal participants[10], and participants after cardiac surgery[11]. 
66 
 
67 
In this study, we used commercial activity trackers to monitor and encourage higher activity levels in 
68 
a series of participants before and after Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Total hip arthroplasty (THA).   
69 
Our hypothesis was that subjects who received feedback of step count in the first 2 weeks after 
70 
surgery would have higher  mean daily step count over the first 6 weeks  after TKA or THA. We also

examined whether this impacted participant satisfaction, participant reported outcome measures or 
72 
6 month activity level.

Materials and Methods: 
74 
This was a single center parallel group randomized controlled study with an equal allocation ratio. 
75 
Eligible patients were all adults undergoing primary elective hip or knee arthroplasty under the care 
76 
of one of the investigating surgeons between May 2016 and December 2016. Patients were required 
77 
to provide written informed consent and were randomised to either control (NFB) or device 
78 
feedback (FB) groups. Subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory disease, and 
79 
those undergoing hip arthroplasty after an acute femoral fracture were excluded. Subjects who were 
80 
not contactable within 2 weeks of their surgery were excluded. 
81 
Two weeks prior to surgery, subjects were contacted via telephone and invited to participate. All 
82 
potential participants were informed the purpose of the study. Participants were emailed or posted 
83 
the written Participant Information and Consent Form as approved by the Hospitals Human 
84 
Research Ethics Committee. If the participant consented they received a Garmin Vivofit2 device for 2 
85 
weeks prior to their surgery. The Garmin Vivofit®2 uses a 3-axis MEMS accelerometer to estimate 
86 
step count. This device has a long battery life of roughly 12 months and the retail cost is AUD$109. 
87 
The device has been shown to be valid and reliable for assessment of step count [12-14].  
88 
The display on the Vívofit®2 device which indicates the number of steps per day was obscured in all 
89 
participants in the preoperative period. On day 1 after arthroplasty, randomisation was performed. 
90 
The randomisation was blocked in multitudes of 40 with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The random 
91 
permutation list was generated from www.randomization.com. From this list a series of 40 
92 
numbered and sealed envelopes were created with the words “Feedback Group” or “No Feedback 
93 
Group” generated in the order determined by the permutation list. When a participant was to be 
94 
randomised the researcher obtained the next sequentially numbered envelope from a contact who 
95 
was independent of the recruitment process for allocation consignment.   
96 
A researcher visited the subject on the first day after surgery and advised as to which group they had 
97 
been allocated. If the subject was in the ‘Feedback Group’ the cover over the vivofit display was 
98 
removed to make the step count visible and he or she was given a daily step goal as indicated in 
99 
Table 1. Subjects were advised this goal should be considered a rough guide based on average 
100 
activity level after arthroplasty, and may need to be adjusted in some circumstances for medical or 
101 
lifestyle reasons. The weekly step goal was selected based on mean daily steps observed in a 
102 
previous study of subjects with activity monitors after arthroplasty[15]. The goal of 7000 steps by 
103 
week 6 was selected as this is the recommended daily step count for healthy older adults(>65)[16]

Participants in the “Non- Feedback Group” continued to wear the device with the display obscured 
105 
for 2 weeks after surgery and were not given a daily step goal.  
106 
The mean daily steps from each group for the first 2 weeks was recorded and compared. After 2 
107 
weeks all participants were permitted to remove the cover over the display and see the step count. 
108 
The non randomised group were not given the login or password required to sync the device and 
109 
therefore could not access their data until after they were unblinded. All participants from both 
110 
groups continued to wear their device until 6 weeks after surgery. Where possible the Garmin 
111 
Vivofit2 device was synced to the subject’s mobile device (phone or tablet) using the Garmin 
112 
Connect mobile application. If the subject did not have a suitable mobile device, arrangements were 
113 
made for the device to be synced at least every 3 weeks with the research unit’s computers, either 
114 
in person or via post. At 6 weeks after surgery participants returned the Garmin Vívofit®2 in person 
115 
or via post. At 6 months after surgery subjects wore the Garmin Vívofit®2 again for a period of 3 
116 
weeks. 
117 
All subjects completed patient reported outcome questionnaires (PROMS) preoperatively and at 6 
118 
months after surgery. The questionnaire included the disease specific measure of the Knee injury 
119 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
120 
(HOOS), and the general measure of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D): an instrument for measuring quality of 
121 
life. At 6 months patients also completed the satisfaction component of the Knee Society Score, and 
122 
graded their satisfaction with their outcome of surgery on a 5-point scale from very satisfied to very 
123 
disappointed. They were also asked if they would have the same surgery again under the same 
124 
circumstances (Yes/No/Unsure).   
125 
The study was performed at the Mater Hospital, a private hospital located in Sydney, Australia at 
126 
which over 2000 arthroplasty procedures are performed annually. The routine care of subjects 
127 
undergoing arthroplasty was admission on day of surgery, 5-day postoperative stay in acute care 
128 
orthopaedic ward, commencement of mobilization on Day 1 after surgery and twice daily 
129 
physiotherapy sessions for 5 days. The vast majority of subjects then attend inpatient rehabilitation 
130 
for a further 7-10 days, and outpatient sessions twice a week until 6 weeks from surgery.   
131 
The study was initially designed to recruit 300 participants. Prior to commencement of the study a 
132 
series of 30 participants undergoing TKA wore a Garmin Activity monitor for 6 weeks after surgery. 
133 
In this population the mean number of recorded steps per day was 6700 (standard deviation 3200) 
134 
before surgery and 5700 at 6 weeks (standard deviation 2600). This data was used to determine the 
135 
study sample size for the RCT design. Power calculations from (http://www.statisticalsolutions.net/)

determined that in order to detect a 25% variation in mean step count, with a power of 0.8 and a 
137 
significance level of 0.05, 113 participants were required for each group. By over sampling an 
138 
additional 37 participants in each group, we account for potential withdrawals and losses to follow-
139 
up. A single planned interim analysis of the primary outcome measures was performed 7 months 
140 
after commencement of the study, after recruitment of over 200 subjects. A statistically significant 
141 
difference between the Feedback and Non- Feedback Groups was evident on all primary outcome 
142 
measures of 1, 2 and 6 week step count, therefore recruitment was ceased after enrollment of 202 
143 
subjects.    
144 
 
145 
Statistical Methods 
146 
 
147 
The primary endpoint of the study was the average daily step count as measured with the Garmin 
148 
Vivofit device at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks after surgery.  This was expressed as a percentage of the 
149 
subject’s preoperative step count. Secondary endpoints were 6-month PROMS and mean daily step 
150 
count. Continuous variables such as mean step count and patient reported scores were compared 
151 
between treatment groups with independent t-tests. Changes over time were assessed with paired 
152 
t-tests. The magnitude of mean differences between treatment groups were assessed with Cohen’s 
153 
d. Difference in proportions of patients between treatment groups were assessed with the Chi test 
154 
(χ2 test). Fisher's exact test was used for comparing proportions when the cell counts were less than 
155 
5. Risk ratios and 95% Confidence intervals were calculated for proportions as a risk estimate.

Results: 
158 
Between May 2016 and December 2016, 395 subjects underwent primary hip or knee arthroplasty 
159 
under the care of the investigating surgeons. Participant flow is shown according to the CONSORT 
160 
guidelines in Figure 1. 202 subjects met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 9 were 
161 
excluded as their surgery was cancelled or postponed and 30 patients were excluded as there was 
162 
insufficient data for baseline step count. The final groups included 81 subjects in the Feedback 
163 
Group and 82 subjects in the No Feedback Group.  
164 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table 2. There were 
165 
no significant differences between the feedback and no feedback group for any of the baseline 
166 
variables or characteristics. Daily step count was recorded for each subject a mean of 36 of a 
167 
possible 42 days in the first 6 weeks after surgery. Days missing step counts was either due to non-
168 
compliance with wearing the device, or difficulties with successfully syncing the device to retrieve 
169 
step counts.  
170 
Mean daily step count for the 2 groups at 1- week, 2-week, 6- week and 6- months is shown in Table 
171 
3 and Figure 2. The feedback group had a significantly higher mean step count at all review points 
172 
than the no feedback group. Cohen’s d was 0.4-0.5, indicating a moderate effect size[17]. The mean 
173 
difference between groups ranged from 6-20% between 1 week and 6 months after surgery. For the 
174 
Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7069 preoperatively to 8326 at 6 months 
175 
after surgery (p=0.001).  For the No Feedback Group the mean daily step count increased from 7748 
176 
preoperatively to 8467 at 6 months after surgery (p=0.001).  
177 
7000 steps per day is recommended as a suitable activity level for subjects over 65 years[16]. The 
178 
proportion of subjects achieving a mean of 7000 or more steps each day is shown in Figure 3. 
179 
Subjects is the Feedback Group were 1.7 (95CI% 1.2-2.6) more likely to be achieve a mean 7000 
180 
steps per day than subjects in the No Feedback group at 6 weeks after surgery (p=0.02).  
181 
The patient reported outcome scores reported at 6 months for the 2 groups is shown in Table 4. 
182 
There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for patient reported outcome scores at 6 
183 
months after surgery. 
184 
Patient satisfaction with the outcome was assessed at 6 months and the results are shown in Table 
185 
5. There was a trend (p=0.089) towards higher proportion of satisfied or very satisfied subjects in the 
186 
Feedback Group, compared to the No Feedback Group.

30 day readmission was monitored for all subjects. One patient in the feedback group was 
188 
readmitted with a post operative wound dehiscence at 17 days postoperatively and underwent 
189 
debridement of the surgical wound and administration of intravenous antibiotics for 5 days. Tissue 
190 
culture returned staphylococcus epidermidis. No further treatment was necessary. One patient in 
191 
the non feedback group was readmitted after 28 days for investigation of pyrexia of unknown origin 
192 
for investigation. No treatment required.

Discussion 
195 
Subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had 
196 
significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty at all measured time points over 6 
197 
months, compared to subjects who did not receive feedback. Feedback from activity trackers was 
198 
found to be an effective tool to increase early mobilization with subjects motivated to “achieve their 
199 
daily goal”. 
200 
This study is the first to report the positive effect of the use of activity monitors after knee and hip 
201 
arthroplasty. Our results indicated that in the feedback group the patients receiving a daily goal and 
202 
daily feedback in the first two weeks after surgery led to increased activity in the acute phase,  
203 
increased activity at 6 months, and a trend to improved higher patient satisfaction at 6 months 
204 
(p=0.09). The Feedback Group had significantly higher activity than the Non- Feedback Group by 45% 
205 
at one week, 34% at two-weeks, 26% at six weeks and then finally the 17% at six-month mark. With 
206 
the evident benefits of physical activity to healthy aging, especially after surgery, this increased 
207 
activity can be considered a positive effect for a successful surgery. 
208 
 
209 
The success following joint replacement surgery can be measured by a variety of parameters. It is 
210 
important to aim to improve pain and function, but also physical activity. Physical activity includes 
211 
an improvement in mobility which can be measured by daily step count. However, until now a 
212 
reliable objective measure of improved step count following arthroplasty has not been reported. The 
213 
World Health Organisation (WHO), US Centre for Disease Control and the National Heart Foundation 
214 
of Australia have released a list of recommendations of daily activity or step count to improve an

individuals’ health and reduce the risk of disease. According to their recommendations the average 
216 
individual needs to take 10,000 steps a day to improve their health and reduce the risk of 
217 
disease.[18-20] It is further specified that the recommended daily step count for healthy older 
218 
adults(>65) is 7,000-10,000 [21]. The proportion of subjects taking 7000 steps or more increased 
219 
from 50% prior to surgery to 70% at 6 months after surgery. The mean daily step count at 6 months 
220 
was increased compared to preoperative status in 66% of subjects. Even though a value of 10,000 
221 
steps/day currently is promoted as a target for obtaining health benefits the increase seen in these 
222 
patients after arthroplasty can be seen as a step in the right direction towards improving their health 
223 
outcomes.  
224 
 
225 
It should be noted that the group were differentiated by the presence or absence of feedback from 
226 
the activity monitor only for the first 2 weeks after surgery. After this time both groups were able to 
227 
see their daily step count on the device, but only the Feedback Group were encouraged to use the 
228 
weekly step goals (see Table 1). It is interesting that the positive effect of the early feedback from 
229 
the device and the use a goal had a positive effect over the full 6 months of the study. We 
230 
hypothesise that the early feedback was a powerful and persisting motivator for subjects to be 
231 
aware of their activity level over the long term.  
232 
 
233 
With the recent rise in technological based assessment tools it is important for the orthopaedic 
234 
fraternity to stay up to date [22] According to the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity 
235 
should be assessed by its four components: frequency, intensity, time, as well as type of activity 
236 
(abbreviated as FITT). Modern commercially available activity trackers have the ability to monitor all 
237 
of the FITT components. Physical performance is used as an assessment tool of patient recovery, 
238 
rehabilitation, and clinical progress postoperatively. It is therefore important to be able to measure 
239 
this accurately. The devices used in this study did not include a heart rate monitor to assess 
240 
intensity, rather we deliberately focused on the daily step count, as it is our opinion that in the older 
241 
population group, simpler goals may just be more appropriate. There are different forms of activity 
242 
monitors with increasing levels of complexity and accuracy but ultimately just a basic, accurate 
243 
activity monitor proved to be valuable in the rehabilitation of the post joint replacement patients. 
244 
Patient satisfaction is the ultimate indicator of successful surgery. At 6 months after surgery, 91% of 
245 
subjects in the Feedback Group reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of 
246 
the surgery, compared to 83% of the subjects in the No Feedback Group (p=0.089). While this trend 
247 
is encouraging, it was not reflected in the other patient reported outcomes at 6 months, with no

significant difference observed between the groups for the disease specific KOOS/HOOS sub scores 
249 
(p>0.65), or the EQ5D general health measure (p>0.17).  
250 
In 2001 a group of surgeons from Europe coined the term “ERAS”. Enhanced recovery after surgery. 
251 
Their research has highlighted the focus on quality of post-operative recovery and rested on several 
252 
factors: a multimodal team approach, preoperative counselling, standardized analgesic and 
253 
anaesthetic protocols, optimization of nutrition and early mobilization. Paying attention to these 
254 
elements they stated: “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery practices improve the opportunity for 
255 
rapid, uncomplicated recovery after surgery with both short- and long-term benefits for patients 
256 
while improving quality and saving money” [23] With the focus on early mobilization in joint 
257 
replacement surgery it has historically been difficult to monitor post-operative mobility with an 
258 
objective scoring system or scale that accurately identified the patients level of activity. We believe 
259 
the use of activity monitors can potentially lead to improved monitoring and ultimately improved 
260 
activity outcomes. Activity monitors have been enthusiastically adopted by the younger populations. 
261 
A recent commercial consumer reports of 1000 respondents suggest that over 50% of 18-64 year 
262 
olds own at least one wearable device, and report health as the primary motivation for 
263 
purchase[24]. It is likely that this technology will be used with increasing frequency in the 
264 
arthroplasty population of the future. 
265 
 
266 
Subjects in this study stayed in acute care hospital for a mean of 5 days after arthroplasty surgery. 
267 
The most common practice was that they then attended inpatient rehabilitation for a further week. 
268 
This practice is considerably slower than the usual care after arthroplasty seen in majority of other 
269 
centres.  This limits the generalisabilty of our findings. However it is plausible that the benefit of 
270 
receiving feedback from an activity monitor is relevant to  populations of both slow stream and fast

We identified some limitations to our study. We question the accuracy of these activity trackers at 
274 
low speeds. The devices make an estimate of daily step count using a combination of motion 
275 
sensors, including an accelerometer, which then use an algorithm to estimate step count. It is the 
276 
algorithm that allows the device to differentiate between simple movements of the arm and 
277 
walking. It can be expected that the algorithms are based on ‘normal’ walking speeds and so lack the 
278 
sensitivity to accurately measure very slow speed walking, or movement patterns that are 
279 
complicated by use of walking aids, such as crutches or walking frames. This is especially a concern in 
280 
the first days after surgery when activity levels are expected to be at a slower rate. [25-27]. This 
281 
potential error would affect both groups in this study equally so should not have unevenly biased

our early results. Regardless we advocate that these devices are probably better used after the first 
283 
week from surgery when walking patterns are starting to normalise.  Additionally, we lost a number 
284 
of patients in our follow up either due to failure of device or information loss. We contributed this to 
285 
possible hardware or user failure. Overall the activity monitors were well tolerated by subjects but 
286 
for some elderly there were challenges with successfully managing the technology. Certainly, setting 
287 
up the devices correctly required some form of assistance in a significant proportion of these 
288 
subjects. This is likely to become less of an issue over time as the younger populations are vastly 
289 
more familiar and comfortable with using modern technologies. Lastly during our exclusion process, 
290 
30 patients had to be excluded due to late arrival or delivery of their devices (more than 1-week post 
291 
op). Despite these difficulties we achieved a more than 90% of successful data retrieval of the study 
292 
cohort, and remained suitably powered for detecting differences in step counts between the groups. 
293 
Conclusion: 
294 
 
295 
In a randomized controlled trial subjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker 
296 
with a daily step goal had significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6 
297 
months, compared to subjects who did not receive feedback. Commercial, non-invasive, light 
298 
weight, low cost accelerometers may be a useful and effective adjunct to treatment after 
299 
arthroplasty.
