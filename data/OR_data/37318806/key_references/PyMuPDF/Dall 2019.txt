Background: Physical inactivity is common during hospitalisation and poses a threat to functional capacity and
independency in the elderly.
Aim: We aimed to assess the eﬀect of physical activity measurements with visual feedback about time spent in
various activities on the average daily time spent out of bed during hospitalisation.
Methods: We recorded physical activity during hospitalisation by accelerometers and compared the eﬀect of the
visual feedback (intervention) with no feedback (control) on time spent out of bed. Patients admitted to the
pulmonary ward were invited and assigned to intervention with feedback or control with no feedback in 6
alternating waves of approximately 18 patients each. The order of feedback/no feedback was randomised at the
outset of the study. The visual feedback intervention group was provided with visual feedback of the daily time
spent in bed, sitting, standing, and walking. The control group did not receive feedback.
Results: 93 patients completed the study with a median length of stay of 5 days. Across all patients there were no
statistically signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in daily time out of bed; however, patients with independent mobility
spent 51 minutes (95% CI 0 to 102; P = .049) more out of bed when provided with visual feedback compared to
no feedback.
Conclusions: A simple technology assisted physical activity intervention with visual feedback to encourage
mobility was not eﬀective at increasing time spent out of bed among hospitalised patients. With feedback, a
subgroup of patients with independent walking abilities increased time out of bed and may beneﬁt from this type
of intervention.

1. Introduction
During hospitalisation, physical inactivity is largely accepted, and
the focus is on treating the medical disease. It has been demonstrated
that older hospitalised patients spend as much as 17–20 h in bed per
day [1,2]. This is unfortunate, since prolonged bed rest can have ne-
gative consequences, in terms of reduced ability to perform activities of
daily living (ADL), including the ability to be independent in transfer-
ring, walking, dressing and toileting - fundamental activities that
greatly impact quality of life [3]. Also, a strong association between low
physical activity during hospitalisation and increased risk of death in
older patients hospitalised for medical disease after discharge has been
observed [4]. Such decrease in functional capacity and physical activity
can be attributed to loss of muscle tissue. Immobilisation for < 14 days
has been seen to reduce muscle mass with 5–9% in otherwise healthy
individuals [3,5,6]. Both in young and older adults the muscle atrophy
can present a number of health complications and in older patients
hospitalised for medical disease the loss of muscle mass leads to delayed
regain of physical function [3].
Thus, prolonged bed rest or inactivity associated with hospitalisa-
tion poses a threat to functional capacity and independency in the el-
derly. Pulmonary function and particular pulmonary functional residual
capacity increases with a more upright position to its largest in the
standing position [7]. Also, a physically active body in an upright po-
sition is ideal for gas exchange, ventilation and circulation and is thus of
great importance for patients with respiratory and pulmonary diseases
[8,9]. There is no existing medication that prevents the detrimental
eﬀects of inactivity. Therefore, physical activities and exercises should

be a more integrated part of the hospital intervention and should re-
ceive more attention from the multidisciplinary staﬀ.
Being more physically active requires a conscious choice by the
patient. During hospitalisation, where bedrest is the prevailing culture,
this can require external motivation. Recent developments in tech-
nology provides a feasible means of measuring physical activity and
providing feedback to the patient via miniaturised activity sensors
(accelerometers) and visual display of the amount of physical activity
during a day. Indeed, physical activity during hospitalisation has been
measured using accelerometers [4,10,11]. While these studies docu-
ment a high degree of physical inactivity, the information was not
utilised to promote increased physical activity during hospitalisation.
Consequently, the aim of this study was to assess the eﬀect of a
physical activity measuring system with visual feedback about the pa-
tient's activity level on the amount of physical activity during hospi-
talisation.
2. Methods
We performed a randomised study of patients hospitalised to the
pulmonary ward at Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg hospital in Copenhagen,
Denmark. The protocol (available from corresponding author) was
submitted to the Regional Health Research Ethics Committee (Journal
no.: 17017548) and was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identiﬁer:
NCT01945749) before commencement of the study. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
2.1. Participants
We
invited
patients
admitted
to
the
pulmonary
ward
from
November 6th 2017 to June 2nd 2018 to participate. The inclusion
criteria were: Signed informed consent and ability to read and speak
Danish. Exclusion criteria were: isolated patients (e.g. due to highly
contagious infections), known allergy to band-aids, expected stay
for < 24 h, participation in other studies, and previous enrolment in
this study (re-admission).
2.2. Design
The study was designed as a single cluster-randomised cross-over
study to compare a group that had physical activity recorded with vi-
sual feedback (intervention) with a group that had physical activity
recorded but did not receive visual feedback (control). Participants
were recruited in 6 cohorts. Three cohorts (1, 3 & 5) were allocated to
the control group with no feedback and three cohorts (2, 4 & 6) to the
feedback intervention group. Assignment of the cohorts was determined
at the outset of the study before any recruitment took place by a coin
toss. The cohort sizes were set to 18 in each cohort corresponding to the
number of beds on the ward. Participants were assigned to the cohorts
in order of admission to the ward; i.e. the ﬁrst 18 included patients
were assigned to cohort one, the next 18 to cohort two and so on. Once
18 patients had been allocated to a cohort, inclusion to that cohort was
stopped. When all patients in a cohort had left the ward (either by
discharge or department transfer), inclusion to the next cohort was
started. This means that there were smaller periods in which no patients
were included. Physical activity recordings were terminated at dis-
charge or after a maximum of 7 days for all patients in all cohorts. As
this was an “open-label” study neither the participants nor the clinical
staﬀwere blinded to treatment allocation.
2.3. Assessment of physical activity
To assess physical activity two small tri-axial accelerometers em-
bedded in medical Band-Aids were used. The accelerometers were
discretely worn on the chest and on the lateral aspect of the thigh. The
devices are water proof and does not interfere with other activities
related to the treatment or care of the patients. The band-aid used is a
standard medical band-aid, tested for allergens and can be changed and
moved under supervision.
The accelerometers sampled accelerations at 12.5 Hz continuously
during hospitalisation and were connected via Bluetooth technology to
a dedicated app installed on a tablet that uploads data to a secure
server. The device has on board memory capacity for several weeks to
prevent data loss due to occasional lack of connectivity. In the

dedicated app, an inbuilt algorithm detects the orientation and move-
ments of the accelerometers and classify the recordings as bedridden
(lying down), sitting, standing (including small bouts of shuﬄing), and
walking summarized every 10 s.
2.4. Procedures
As close to admission as possible the patients were seen by a phy-
siotherapist who invited the patient to participate. Oral and written
information material was handed out, and it was stressed to all po-
tential participants that physical activity is important – also during a
hospital stay.
Upon signed informed consent, the physiotherapist assessed the
patients' basic mobility using the cumulated ambulatory score (CAS)
[12]. The CAS describes a patient's independence regarding getting in
and out of bed, sit-to-stand-to-sit from a chair, and walking (use of a
walking aid allowed). Each activity is assessed on a three-point ordinal
scale from 0 to 2 (0 = Not able to, despite assistance and verbal cueing,
1 = Able to, with assistance and/or verbal cueing, 2 = Able to safely,
without assistance or verbal cueing) resulting in a total CAS score
ranging from 0 to 6 [12].
Based on the CAS-walking score the patients were categorized as
being unable to walk (CAS-walking score 0), needing some assistance to
walk (CAS-walking score 1) or having independent walking ability
(CAS-walking score 2).
Subsequently, the physiotherapists mounted the accelerometers,
and if appropriate according to allocation, installed feedback screens
(7 in. tablets) on the bedside table. Upon discharge, department transfer
or after 7 days of recording the accelerometers were inactivated and
removed.
2.5. Visual feedback intervention
The visual feedback intervention cohorts (cohorts no. 2, 4 & 6) were
provided with visual feedback of the daily time spent lying in bed,
sitting, standing, and walking. The visual feedback was provided via a
Fig. 2. Example of a visual feedback screen.

tablet (connected to the accelerometers via Bluetooth) placed on the
bedside table. The feedback consisted of horizontal bars (with numbers)
representing the daily time (in minutes) spent bedridden (lying down),
sitting, standing, and walking. The display showed the current day's
activities together with the preceding days. Furthermore, ‘smiley-faces’
were displayed in diﬀerent colours depending on time spent lying
down, sitting, and walking (see Fig. 2). Based on the CAS-walking ca-
tegorization, the thresholds for a colour change of the ‘smileys’ diﬀered:
CAS-walking 0: No feedback on walking – only feedback on time spent
sitting
and
lying
down;
CAS-walking
1:
Red
0–15 min,
yellow
15–30 min, green 30+ min; CAS-walking 2: Red 0–30 min, yellow
30–60 min, green 60+ min.
The feedback was available constantly and the summarized data
were updated regularly (approximately every 5 min). Hence, the feed-
back information was visible to the patients, their relatives and other
visitors, and the health care personnel.
In the control group no visual feedback was provided.
2.6. Outcome measures
The protocol of this study deﬁned the primary outcome as time
spent out of bed (standing or walking) measured in minutes related to
the total hospitalisation time (minutes). However, as the total hospi-
talisation time was quite diﬀerent from the accelerometer wear time,
the interpretation of the accelerometer outcomes is easier if related to
the actual accelerometer wear time. Hence, we report the time spent
out of bed (minutes) related to the accelerometer wear time (minutes)
and report it as average daily time out of bed (minutes/day) during the
hospital stay while wearing the accelerometer. The time out of bed
variable is deﬁned as the sum of time spent standing and walking.
Secondary outcomes were average daily time spent in bed (lying down),
sitting, standing and walking (minutes/day).
2.7. Sample size
We aimed to include 108 participants in 6 cohorts of 18 each. This
was pragmatically estimated, since we were unaware of any similar
study that could be used to calculate a sample size. However, 108 pa-
tients in two groups of equal sizes would allow for approximately 90%
power to detect a diﬀerence in average daily time out of bed of 30 min,
with an estimated standard deviation of 45 min/day and a signiﬁcance
level of 0.05.
2.8. Statistical analyses
Only patients who had accelerometer recordings of at least 24 h
were included in the analysis set. To assess comparability of the two
groups (with vs without feedback) at admission, the baseline char-
acteristics were compared using unpaired t-tests. The primary and
secondary outcomes were tested for group diﬀerences using analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA).
To test if the visual feedback intervention worked diﬀerently on the
subgroups of patients (the CAS-walking score categorization) we added
the mobility-level as a factor (3 levels), together with its interaction
with group (group * mobility) to the ANCOVAs.
As sensitivity analyses we assessed if the cohort number (re-
presenting carry-over-eﬀects from previous cohorts, seasonal or other
contaminating eﬀects) and the accelerometer wear time (exposure
time) aﬀected the results, we adjusted the ANCOVAs further for the
cohort number, exposure time (in minutes) and for total hospitalisation
time (in minutes).
All statistical tests were two-sided and statistical signiﬁcance is
claimed if the computed p-value is equal to or < 0.05.
3. Results
A total of 463 admissions were recorded from November 2017 to
June 2018. Of those, 322 patients were not eligible for participation,
the main reasons being expected stay < 24 h (n = 88), isolation
(n = 84), and not being able to provide informed consent (n = 64). 141
patients gave informed consent and were included in the present study,
with 72 being allocated to the visual feedback intervention and 69 to
the control (no visual feedback). During participation, 3 withdrew their
informed consent and 1 experienced an allergic reaction to the Band-
Aid and was withdrawn from the study. Upon data analysis, 25 in
feedback group and 19 in no feedback group were excluded due to
recordings of < 24 h (see Fig. 1). These 44 patients were younger
(mean 66 years) than those completing the study, but otherwise there
were no diﬀerences (data not shown).
The clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1, according to
group allocation. The most common diagnoses were pneumonia and
COPD. The average accelerometer wear time was approximately
3.5 days (corresponding to 63% of average hospital stay), whereas the
average length of stay was 7 to 8 days. This diﬀerence was due to some
prolonged stays in a few patients aﬀecting the average and due to ac-
celerometer recordings being stopped after a max of 7 days. There were
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in patient characteristics (data not
shown).
Across all included patients the visual feedback provided no statis-
tically signiﬁcant reduction in time spent out of bed compared to no
visual feedback (Table 2). The feedback group spent 81 min per day out
of bed and the no feedback group spent 64 min per day out of bed. The
group diﬀerence was 18 min per day (95% CI -42 to 78; P = .56) nu-
merically in favour of the visual feedback. There were no statistically
signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in the other measures of physical activity
(Table 2).
However, the subgroup analyses revealed that patients with in-
dependent walking ability (CAS-walking score = 2) were 51 min (95%
CI 0 to 102; P = .049) more out of bed when provided with visual
feedback compared to the same subgroup of patients who did not re-
ceive feedback (Table 3). Further, the same subgroup spent statistically
signiﬁcantly more time standing during a day than when provided with
visual feedback compared to the no feedback group (mean diﬀerence:
31 min/day (95% CI 4 to 59; P = .027) (Table 3). A similar tendency
was seen for time spent walking, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant
(Table 3). Consequently, the independent mobility subgroup was si-
milarly less inactive (Table 3).
The results were robust to the sensitivity analyses (with adjustment
for cohort number, accelerometer wear time and total hospitalisation
time) as the estimates only changed slightly (supplementary Tables S1&
S2).
There were no recorded fall incidences in either group.
4. Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to combine information from accelerometers
and providing a direct visual feedback around the clock to the patients,
visitors and the staﬀin a hospital setting. Overall, we found no eﬀect of
the visual feedback of time spent in various physical activities on time
spent out of bed in patients hospitalised at a pulmonary ward. However,
the subgroup with independent walking ability spent 51 min/day more
out of bed when provided with visual feedback group compared to the
no-feedback group, which we ﬁnd very promising.
During hospitalisation, the focus is on treating the disease and
generally physical inactivity is largely accepted. Several studies have
reported that patients are bedridden for of 17–20 h per day during
hospitalisation [1,10,11]. In Brown et al. from 2009 [1] the amount of
time hospitalised patients spent lying was in average 20 h per day. This
is in line with our study with patients generally were inactive (lying/
sitting) for 22.7 h per day. Studies on the impact of bedrest have

54

demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in muscle strength and mass [1,13].
These physiological consequences contribute to the functional decline
frequently observed after hospitalisation [14], including reduced ability
to independent transferring, walking, and toileting that are funda-
mental activities of independent living [15]. In broader terms physical
inactivity can act as an additional stressor besides that of the acute
illness [14]. Indeed, bedrest has been deemed toxic to older adults and
there have been repeated calls for hospital mobility actions [16].
Despite the well-established knowledge about mechanisms and
outcomes, studies of hospital mobility interventions are very sparse. A
randomised study from 2017 showed that an early rehabilitation pro-
gram in survivors of critical illness led to an earlier discharge from the
hospital, improved functional recovery, and was also cost-eﬀective and
safe [17]. In 2016 an in-hospital mobility program versus usual care
was tested [16]. The mobility program consisted of assisted walking
twice daily for 15-min and enabled patients to maintain their pre-
hospitalization community mobility, whereas those in the control group
experienced clinically signiﬁcant declines.
The amount of time spent out of bed in a hospital setting necessary
for secondary beneﬁts to occur is not known. In Brown et al. [16] total
mobilisation time was up to 40 min per day, which is similar to the
subgroup eﬀect observed in the present study of almost 1 h per day.
This suggest that the present intervention could yield similar secondary
eﬀects on post-hospital functioning. Unfortunately, we did not assess
these secondary beneﬁts of less physical inactivity, but the observed
reduction of physical inactivity holds a promising perspective. While
the overall eﬀect was not evident the intervention was successful at
mobilising patients who had most to lose, i.e. those with independent
mobility at admission.
It is not surprising that the intervention with visual feedback was
eﬀective in the subgroup with independent mobility, and not in the
other subgroups who need assistance to transfer to/from bed and to
locomote. The visual feedback may have motivated all patients, but
those without resources to be more physically active had no opportu-
nity to react on the motivation. The data suggest that patients with
severe mobility limitations are unsuited for a technology assisted
feedback intervention without professional backup. The technology
may be a potential tool to identify patients who need assistance and/or
additional motivation to avoid excess physical inactivity during hos-
pitalisation.
This study focused on testing if a technology-based intervention
would decrease time spent physically inactive during hospitalisation.
The visual feedback was provided continuously throughout the hospital
stay. This does not only provide an external motivation for the patients
but may also be used actively by the hospital staﬀ. The eﬀects of the
feedback intervention had a multifactorial component, of which some
were not quantiﬁed by this study, but likely inﬂuencing both patients,
staﬀand visitors. Among other things, the visual display may serve as
simple visualisation, but also encourage the patients to work against a
goal, and/or animate staﬀto encourage patients to move. The tech-
nology is most likely aﬀecting a combination of mechanisms. In pos-
sible future applications, the information may also be used to better
allocate physiotherapy resources to the patients with impaired mobility
or those who do not respond to the feedback. The intervention is easy to
implement. The mounting and activation of the accelerometers and
feedback screens do not require specialist skills, and the technology has
the potential to be incorporated into standard care at most hospital
wards. An important note is that the present study focused on the use of
technology to increase physical activity during hospitalisation. It is
likely that the eﬀects can be augmented if the technology is combined
with other stimuli, such as education, advice, environmental con-
siderations etc.
Because this study was performed in a pulmonary ward, it may not
be generalizable across all types of wards or hospitals. Further, there
were a substantial number of patients who were not eligible, which also
limits generalisability to the general medicine population. However, the
patient population had a signiﬁcant burden of comorbidities, as in-
dicated by their comorbidity count, and is fairly representative of the
general population at the pulmonary ward. Medical procedures were
not considered as a potential confounder as the patient characteristics
are quite similar between the groups. We excluded patients a priori who
had accelerometer recordings for < 24 h. These patients were not in-
cluded until the day after the admission (e.g. admitted in the evening
where study staﬀwas not present). Inclusion of these patients may have
altered the results but may also have introduced unwanted noise as the
recordings will for some patients only relate to evening/night time and
others to only to daytime.
Although this is a small study that needs replication, it provides
evidence of the eﬃcacy of a technology assisted physical activity in-
tervention.
5. Conclusion
A technology assisted physical activity intervention with bedside
visual feedback to encourage mobility was overall not eﬀective at in-
creasing time spent out of bed in hospitalised patients. However, the
subgroup of patients with independent walking abilities increased the
time spent out of bed and may beneﬁt from this type of intervention.
The subgroup ﬁndings are promising and need replication in larger
populations before implementation can be recommended.
