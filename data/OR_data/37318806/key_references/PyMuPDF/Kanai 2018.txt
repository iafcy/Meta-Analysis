Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effect of accelerometer-based feedback on physical activity in hospitalized 
patients with ischemic stroke.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Acute care hospital.
Subjects: A total of 55 patients with ischemic stroke who could walk without assistance were randomly 
assigned to the intervention group (n = 27) or the control group (n = 28).
Interventions: At the baseline measurement, patients did not receive accelerometer-based feedback. At 
follow-up, a physical therapist provided instruction on accelerometer-based feedback, discussed physical 
activity targets and encouraged the patients to walk more until discharge.
Main measures: The average daily number of steps taken was used as the index of daily hospitalized 
physical activity.
Results: The study sample consisted of 48 patients, of whom 23 patients comprised the intervention group and 
25 patients comprised the control group. Although there were no significant differences in physical activity values 
between the two groups at the baseline measurement, the values in the intervention group at follow-up were 
significantly higher than those in the control group (5180.5 ± 2314.9 vs. 3113.6 ± 1150.9 steps/day, P = 0.0003). 
The effect size of physical activity values (Cohen’s d = 1.15) at follow-up was large between the two groups.
Conclusion: Exercise training combined with accelerometer-based feedback effectively increased 
physical activity in hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke.

Introduction
In stroke rehabilitation, early mobilization is ben-
eficial for recovery of walking1 and a favorable 
outcome.2 However, timing of early mobilization is 
controversial.3–5 Increasing movement and activity 
from an early stage after stroke improves walking 
ability,6 functional outcome,7,8 and possibly the 
extent of recovery from stroke. Increasing the 
amount of rehabilitation also improves activity,9 
but therapy time is often limited in the acute phase. 
Thus, the patient is required to undertake an 
increase in activity by themselves. Few clinical 
data are reported about the promotion of physical 
activity during hospitalization, and the results were 
controversial.10–12 Previously, we reported that 
accelerometer-based feedback increased physical 
activity and self-efficacy for physical activity in 
hospitalized patients with mild ischemic stroke.12 
In that study, patients monitored their activity and 
increased physical activity by themselves, and the 
study was of a pre-post design without a control 
group. Mansfield et al.10 reported that accelerome-
ter feedback of walking activity combined with a 
goal setting process did not increase the amount of 
walking, and Dorsch et al.11 reported that the aug-
mented feedback intervention was not associated 
with a greater amount of time spent walking.
In contrast, some studies reported that providing 
feedback from an accelerometer coupled with 
behavioral change techniques improved physical 
activity in elderly people,13 diabetes mellitus 
patients,14 and cardiac patients.15,16 Izawa et al.15 
also reported in randomized controlled trials that 
accelerometer-based feedback may increase energy 
expenditure16 and self-efficacy for physical activ-
ity. Because increasing activity with these inter-
ventions was effective in patients with various 
diseases, a further trial of feedback from an accel-
erometer is justified for patients with stroke.
We hypothesized that exercise training com-
bined with accelerometer-based feedback would 
increase hospitalized physical activity such as 
number of steps, energy expenditure and duration 
of activity time in patients with ischemic stroke. 
Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the effect of accelerometer-based 
feedback on physical activity in hospitalized 
patients with ischemic stroke.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study was a prospective, single-blinded, rand-
omized, controlled trial. Informed consent was 
obtained from each patient. The study was approved 
by the Itami Kousei Neurosurgical Hospital Research 
Ethics Committee (approval no. 20140002) and was 
registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, 
number UMIN000029120.
We enrolled consecutive patients in the acute 
phase of ischemic stroke who were admitted to 
Itami Kousei Neurosurgical Hospital less than 
48 hours from stroke onset and who underwent 
rehabilitation from April 2016 to March 2017. 
Patient inclusion criteria included fulfillment of 
both criteria: magnetic resonance or computerized 
tomographic imaging showing an acute ischemic 
stroke and patients who could walk without assis-
tance or gait aid within one week of admission. 
Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with 
aphasia, visual field defect, or dementia (Mini-
Mental State Examination score17 < 23) as evalu-
ated by the primary physician; age >80 years old; 
premorbid modified Rankin Scale score18 > 2 due 
to a history of musculoskeletal disease; severe car-
diopulmonary disease or psychiatric disease based 
on the patient’s medical record as evaluated by a 
physical therapist; and patient refusal to participate 
in the study.
The study sample size was determined as n = 26 
per group based on the effect size of our previous 
pilot study12 (r = 0.87) (two-tailed type 1 error 0.05; 
type 2 error 80%), which evaluated the effect of the 
accelerometer-based feedback on physical activity. 
An independent person who was not involved in 
enrollment or outcome assessment performed the 
randomization using a computer-generated 1:1 
allocation sequence and permuted block size of 2. 
Participants were randomly assigned to the inter-
vention group or the control group by this inde-
pendent person. The sequence was concealed until 
intervention. This study did not blind physical 
therapists as to which patients were in the interven-
tion group or control group.
We evaluated several patient characteristics: 
age, sex, body mass index, subtypes of stroke 
according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute 

Kanai et al.

Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification of sub-
types of acute ischemic stroke,19 stroke side, 
National Institutes of Stroke Scale (NIHSS),20 
comorbidities, medications and duration of intra-
venous drip. Patients were assessed on the basis of 
previous exercise habits, walking speed test and 
Berg balance scale21 by a physical therapist at 
patient enrollment. Previous exercise habits were 
assessed using the stages of exercise behavior 
change.22 We considered the patient’s previous 
exercise habits as the preparation, action and main-
tenance stages of exercise behavior change. 
Walking speed was calculated as the result of a 
10-m walking test.23 Speed was derived from tim-
ing the patient’s walking over 10 m with a stop-
watch. Measurements were taken over the middle 
10 m of a 14-m walkway. Patients were instructed 
to walk at a comfortable speed. Afterwards, walk-
ing speed was calculated as 10 m/time required in 
seconds. We calculated the time between admis-
sion and study enrollment, the time between admis-
sion and discontinuance of the intravenous drip, 
the average duration of supervised rehabilitation 
time per day over the study period and the length of 
hospital stay based on the patients’ medical records.
Physical activity and rehabilitation 
program
After enrollment, all patients wore an accelerome-
ter on their waist belt 24 hours/day until discharge 
except when bathing. The average daily number of 
steps taken was used as the index of daily hospital-
ized physical activity. This was measured by a 
Fitbit One (Fitbit, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) 
three-dimensional accelerometer that calculates 
steps taken, floors climbed, distance traveled, calo-
ries burned and sleep quality. It has been used for 
stroke patients,12,24,25 and the accuracy of Fitbit 
models has been shown in stroke patients (Fitbit 
Ultra)26 and in community-dwelling older adults 
(Fitbit One).27 At discharge, the Fitbit One was 
returned to us.
All patients underwent 40–120 minutes of a 
supervised rehabilitation program 5–6 times a 
week. The program consisted of physical therapy 
and occupational therapy and was mainly com-
posed of body stretches, body weight resistance 
exercise, aerobic exercise and a cool-down period. 
In addition, patients who needed to improve their 
balance, walking ability, or activities of daily living 
skills received specific exercise instruction. Body 
weight resistance exercise comprised upper 
extremity exercises (shoulder flexion and abduc-
tion from anatomic position) and lower extremity 
exercises (squats and calf raises). Exercise inten-
sity during aerobic exercise was 40%–60% of max-
imum predicted heart rate or at an intensity of 
11–13 (per the Borg 6–20 scale28) with cycle 
ergometer exercise.
Intervention
After enrollment, the first two days were used for 
the baseline measurement of physical activity. 
Patients in both groups underwent only the super-
vised rehabilitation program as mentioned above 
and did not receive any feedback. After baseline 
measurement, patients in the intervention group 
were instructed in the use of accelerometer-based 
feedback to promote hospitalized physical activity 
in addition to participating in the supervised reha-
bilitation program.
The accelerometer-based feedback used in this 
study was previously described by Kanai et al.12 
and Izawa et  al.15,16 During the intervention, all 
patients in the intervention group were asked by a 
physical therapist to record physical activity meas-
ured with the accelerometer on an exercise calen-
dar. Our goal for this intervention was to promote 
physical activity in the patient by the physical ther-
apist to greater than that currently performed dur-
ing the baseline period. The accelerometer-based 
feedback used in this study was based on the self-
efficacy theory of Bandura,29 which posits that the 
performance of a specific behavior is strongly 
influenced by the confidence of individuals in their 
ability to perform that behavior. To enhance self-
efficacy, the patients determined their physical 
activity target including steps per day or objective 
activity and long-term goals based on the thera-
pist’s advice. However, this target was initially set 
at a low and feasible level. For example, the physi-
cal therapist asked the patient to walk 100–500 
steps more than the previous day. Patients were 
allowed to confirm their number of steps in real 
time so that they could attain their target steps. If 
the patient attained the target of physical activity,

the physical therapist praised the patient. If the 
patient could not attain the target of physical activ-
ity, the physical therapist discussed a modified 
physical activity target with the patient by viewing 
the feedback log. Thus, with this intervention, the 
patients were expected to maintain physical activ-
ity behavior and to adopt other positive health 
behaviors. Although patients in the control group 
also continued to undergo the supervised rehabili-
tation program, they were not instructed on meth-
ods to confirm their number of steps or to promote 
physical activity. At discharge, a physical therapist 
provided them with report about the daily number 
of steps taken while hospitalized.
Outcome measures
The main outcome was physical activity values 
derived from the average number of steps. 
Secondary outcomes were exercise energy expend-
iture, duration of activity time and self-efficacy for 
physical activity. These outcomes were calculated 
or evaluated both at baseline measurement and at 
follow-up. We confirmed the number of steps, 
exercise energy expenditure and duration of activ-
ity time by downloading data files to Fitbit online 
dashboard software.30 To download these out-
comes, we needed to input each patient’s setup 
parameters such as age, sex, height and weight in 
the device software. Duration of activity time (min/
day) was calculated for each intensity (light: 1–3 
metabolic equivalents (METs)), moderate: 3–6 
METs and vigorous: > 6 METs).24 Self-efficacy for 
physical activity, which was originally devised for 
patients with myocardial infarction,31 measures 
self-confidence for the performance of a given 
activity or task and represents an individual’s per-
ceptions or beliefs about how capable he or she is 
of performing that specific activity or task.29,32 The 
self-efficacy for physical activity score was meas-
ured with the Japanese version, whose reliability 
has been validated.32 The measure consists of four 
subscales: the domains of walking, stair climbing, 
weight lifting and push off. We evaluated the 
domain of walking, which we used as the index of 
self-efficacy for physical activity in this study. 
Subscale scores range from 0 to 100, with lower 
scores indicating a poor level of self-efficacy for 
physical activity and higher scores indicating better 
levels. The self-efficacy for physical activity score 
was measured at the baseline measurement and 
again at end of the follow-up. These outcomes were 
evaluated by a physical therapist who was aware of 
the exposure status of the study participants.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD and count rate 
(%). We defined physical activity at baseline meas-
urement as day 2 after enrollment because the 
patients did not wear an accelerometer for 24 hours 
on day 1. We further defined physical activity at 
follow-up as the average number of steps per day 
taken from day 3 after enrollment to the day prior 
to hospital discharge. The average values of exer-
cise energy expenditure and duration of activity 
time were calculated the same way. An independ-
ent t-test and χ2 test were used to compare patient 
characteristics between groups. Two-way repeated 
measures analysis of variance was used to compare 
outcomes. The within-participants factor was term 
(baseline vs. follow-up), and the between-partici-
pants factor was group (intervention group vs. con-
trol group). An independent person blinded to 
group allocation conducted these analyses. A 
P-value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statis-
tical significance. Statistical analyses were per-
formed with IBM SPSS 24 statistical software 
(IBM SPSS Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). In addition, 
effect size (Cohen’s d) was calculated using data at 
baseline measurement and intervention period. 
Values for Cohen’s d of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were inter-
preted as small, moderate and large, respectively.
Results
Participant flow through this study is shown in 
Figure 1. In total, 55 patients met the criteria and 
were randomly assigned to either the intervention 
group (n = 27) or the control group (n = 28). 
However, seven patients dropped out. Therefore, 
the study sample consisted of 48 patients, of whom 
23 patients comprised the intervention group and 
25 patients comprised the control group.

Clinical characteristics of the patients are shown 
in Table 1. There were no significant differences 
between the two groups. Most patients were dis-
charged within two weeks of admission.
Differences in physical activity and self-effi-
cacy for physical activity score between the base-
line measurement and follow-up in the two groups 
are shown in Table 2. There were significant terms

by group interactions for physical activity values 
derived from the number of steps detected. Physical 
activity values in the intervention group at follow-
up were significantly higher than those in the con-
trol group. There were also significant terms by 
group interactions for exercise energy expenditure 
and light activity time detected. Exercise energy 
expenditure and light and moderate activity time at 
follow-up were significantly higher in the interven-
tion group than those in the control group. In the 
comparison between terms, all outcomes at follow-
up were significantly higher than those at the 
baseline measurement in the intervention group. 
However, physical activity values, moderate activ-
ity time, vigorous activity time and self-efficacy 
for physical activity score at follow-up were sig-
nificantly higher than those at the baseline meas-
urement in the control group.
Discussion
The results of this study indicated that the acceler-
ometer-based feedback may increase physical 
activity, exercise energy expenditure and the

duration of activity time in hospitalized patients 
with ischemic stroke.
The number of steps taken at follow-up in the 
intervention group was about 2500 steps higher than 
that at the baseline measurement. In our previous 
study, promotion of physical activity was mainly 
attained by the promotion of unsupervised physical 
activity.12 Although we did not analyze unsuper-
vised physical activity in this study, the supervised 
rehabilitation program was the same for each group, 
and the average duration of the program was not dif-
ferent between the groups. Thus, the increase in 
unsupervised physical activity might be mainly 
attributed to the promotion of physical activity. To 
promote physical activity, two previous studies con-
ducted randomized controlled trials during inpatient 
stroke rehabilitation to determine the effect of accel-
erometer-based feedback by therapists.10,11 The 
results of these studies indicated that accelerometer-
based feedback did not promote increases in physi-
cal activity or daily walking time in the hospitalized 
patients. However, there were discrepancies between 
their interventions and that of this study. First, these 
two studies included the subacute phase of stroke, 
and time between enrollment or the number of days 
monitored varied with each patient. Second, 
although we encouraged the patients to confirm their 
number of steps and record daily physical activity 
on an exercise calendar, patients in these other stud-
ies might have received accelerometer-based feed-
back passively. Third, the patients determined their 
own physical activity target. Self-monitoring of  
progress and goal setting are important sources of 
self-motivation.33 Mansfield et al.10 also set a walk-
ing-related goal; however, the patients’ physical 
activity target in this study was initially set at a low 
level and was accomplishable. To promote walking, 
Bird et  al.34 reported in a systematic review that 
behavior change techniques such as “prompt self-
monitoring of behavior” and “prompt intention for-
mation” were coded in more than half of the 
intervention studies. In this study, we considered

these components and incorporated them to promote 
physical activity. Therefore, the patients in the inter-
vention group may have been active and had 
enhanced confidence for the promotion of physical 
activity.
The self-efficacy for physical activity score 
measured at follow-up was significantly higher 
than that at the baseline measurement in the inter-
vention group, which concurred with the findings 
reported by Kanai et  al.12 and Izawa et  al.15 
However, the self-efficacy for physical activity 
score also increased in the control group at follow-
up, and there were no significant differences in the 
score between the groups. Thus, improvement in 
the self-efficacy for physical activity score did not 
mediate the promotion of physical activity in this 
study. Because the Japanese version of the self-
efficacy for physical activity measure was origi-
nally developed for cardiac patients,32 this measure 
might not be sensitive for patients with stroke. 
Although we evaluated previous exercise habits in 
both groups, we could not assess the type or inten-
sity of exercise. These factors might affect the vari-
ability of the self-efficacy for physical activity 
scores within the domain of walking. Izawa et al.15 
showed 
that 
accelerometer-based 
feedback 
improved self-efficacy for physical activity in car-
diac patients after discharge and improved the rate 
of exercise maintenance compared to controls. 
Therefore, further study is needed to clarify the 
effect of accelerometer-based feedback on self-
efficacy for physical activity and exercise mainte-
nance in patients with ischemic stroke after 
discharge.
Several studies reported on energy expenditure 
or physical activity level among stroke patients 
during hospitalization.24,35,36 In this study, the 
accelerometer-based feedback might not only be 
effective in increasing the number of steps taken 
but also in increasing energy expenditure on exer-
cise or duration of activity time. Because the 
patients in the intervention group walked to attain 
their target level of physical activity, the more 
physical activity was promoted, the greater was the 
energy expenditure on exercise and the METs 
increased. Lacroix et  al.36 reported that active 
energy expenditure was 91 kcal among patients 
hospitalized in a rehabilitation unit and 221 kcal 
among patients who reached the recommendation 
that at least 30 minutes of physical activity be per-
formed per day. Because that study measured 
active energy expenditure only during the daytime, 
we could not unconditionally compare energy 
expenditure and duration of activity time. Although 
accelerometer-based feedback increased the dura-
tion of activity time, only about 10 minutes of mod-
erate to vigorous physical activity was performed 
per day in the intervention group at follow-up. 
Tudor-Locke et al.37 suggested that 30 minutes of 
moderate to vigorous physical activity be recom-
mended for older adults and/or special populations 
living with disability. Patients in this study could 
not achieve this recommend level, which was also 
not achievable by stroke patients in a hospital reha-
bilitation unit35,36 or by community-dwelling stroke 
patients.38,39 Thus, we might need to consider 
incorporating moderate to vigorous physical activ-
ity into our rehabilitation program and to empha-
size the importance of this activity during 
hospitalization so that the patients will continue to 
be physically active after discharge.
There are several limitations in this study. First, it 
was conducted at a single center, and the sample 
population was small. We calculated sample size 
before the study and included n > 26 patients per 
group, but seven patients dropped out of the study. 
Even so, our analysis yielded statistically significant 
findings indicating that the effect size may be large. 
Second, we included only patients who could walk 
without assistance. Thus, we do not know if acceler-
ometer-based feedback would promote activity in 
patients with moderate to severe stroke. A previous 
study suggested that patients with moderate to 
severe stroke tend to remain inactive during the first 
14 days of acute stroke unit care.40 Further study will 
be necessary to establish a method to promote physi-
cal activity or decrease sedentary behavior in these 
patients. Third, we did not conduct functional tests 
such as walking speed and the Berg balance scale at 
discharge. Improvements in these aspects might 
possibly contribute to changes in the patients’ physi-
cal activity. Finally, because the measurement of 
physical activity was performed only during hospi-
talization, we do not know whether the effect of

physical activity promotion will continue over time 
and influence the long-term prognosis. Several stud-
ies showed that hospitalized physical activity has 
effects on readmission41 and mortality.42 Therefore, 
additional study is needed to determine whether the 
benefits of accelerometer-based feedback will con-
tinue over time.
An important clinical implication of this study 
is that the physical activity of hospitalized patients 
with stroke could be increased with simple meth-
ods through appropriate feedback and goal setting. 
Because physical inactivity during hospitalization 
is associated with poor functional outcome,7 physi-
cal therapists need to consider these interventions 
in the practice of rehabilitation to make the best of 
limited therapy time.
Clinical Messages
••
Exercise training combined with acceler-
ometer-based feedback and goal setting 
may be an effective method to increase 
physical activity in hospitalized patients 
with ischemic stroke.
••
This study can contribute to the develop-
ment of methods to promote physical 
activity in hospitalized patients with 
stroke.
