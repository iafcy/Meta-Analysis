            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To examine associations between dimensions of sedentary behavior and cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sedentary behavior variables were measured using thigh-worn activPALs, and included total daily sitting time, time in long sitting bouts, sit-to-stand transitions, and standing time. Cognitive function was assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Domain. Separate multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between sedentary behavior variables with the cognitive domain scores of attention, executive functioning, episodic memory, working memory, and information processing speed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty breast cancer survivors with a mean age of 62.2 (SD = 7.8) years who were 2.6 (SD = 1.1) years since diagnosis completed study assessments. In multivariable linear regression models, more time spent standing was associated with faster information processing (b: 5.78; p = 0.03), and more time spent in long sitting bouts was associated with worse executive function (b: -2.82; p = 0.02), after adjustment for covariates. No other sedentary behavior variables were statistically significantly associated with the cognitive domains examined in this study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Two important sedentary constructs that are amenable to intervention, including time in prolonged sitting bouts and standing time, may be associated with cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. More research is needed to determine whether modifying these dimensions of sedentary behavior will improve cognitive function in women with a history of breast cancer, or prevent it from declining in breast cancer patients."

Trauma-induced bleeding into joints and muscles may be associated with participation in physical activities. Recognizing this, persons with haemophilia may limit physical activities to avoid bleeding. The characterization of physical activity profiles (type, intensity, frequency and duration) in children with differing severities of haemophilia has not been well documented. This is required to better understand the relationship between physical activity and bleeding in children with haemophilia.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      This study was a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study to compare the quantity, type and intensity of physical activity as measured by accelerometry in boys with different haemophilia severities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Subjects wore an accelerometer daily for 1 week and completed validated self-report PedHAL and 3DPAR questionnaires.

Subjects average age was 11.52 years (±3.99) and their average BMI was 20.74 kg m(2) (±5.68). Boys with severe haemophilia reported significantly more time per day spent in sedentary activities compared to those with mild/moderate haemophilia. Furthermore, the amount of time engaged in sedentary activities increased with age in those boys with severe haemophilia, whereas the opposite was true in those with mild/moderate haemophilia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We speculate that prophylaxis in children with severe haemophilia permitted them to engage in similar amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as children with mild/moderate haemophilia. Increasing sedentary time in the severe cohort with age may be attributed to increasing arthropathy among other psychosocial factors."

After computing 4-year changes in mean T2 relaxation time for six femoral cartilage regions and mean daily times spent in the sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity ranges, we performed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to find a linear combination of times spent in different activity intensity ranges (Activity Index) that was maximally correlated with a linear combination of regional changes in cartilage microstructure (Cartilage Microstructure Index).

Estimated energy expenditure values derived from the questionnaire were 35.9 +/- 3.0 and 36.2 +/- 4.1 Kcal.kg-1.d-1 (NS), respectively. Thus, when measured directly with an accelerometer, activity was lower in MS compared with sedentary control subjects.

The primary outcome was patients' walking time measured by accelerometers during the rehabilitation admission. Walking times from accelerometry were made available daily to treating therapists and intervention participants to motivate patients to improve incidental activity levels and reach set goals. For the control group, 'usual care' was followed, including the setting of mobility goals; however, for this group, neither staff nor patients received data on walking times to aid the setting of daily walking time targets.\n## RESULTS\nThe median daily walking time in the intervention group increased from 10.3 minutes at baseline to 32.1 minutes at day 28, compared with an increase from 9.5 to 26.5 minutes per day in the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly higher non-therapy walking time by about 7 minutes [mean (95% CI): 24.6 (21.7, 27.4)] compared to those in the control group [mean(95% CI): 17.3 (14.4, 20.3)] (p = 0.001).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDaily feedback to patients and therapists using an accelerometer increased walking times during rehabilitation admissions.

Physical activity of 530 6-year-olds and their mothers was measured concurrently using accelerometry for ≤7 days. Cross-sectionally, two-level mixed-effects linear regression was used to model the association between maternal-child daily activity behaviour at age 6 [minutes sedentary (SED); in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)]. Interactions with demographic factors and time of the week were tested; how the association differed across the day was also explored. Change in the association between maternal-child physical activity (from age 4-6) was assessed in a subset (n = 170) [outcomes: SED, MVPA and light physical activity (LPA)].\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mother-child daily activity levels were positively associated (SED: β = 0.23 [0.20, 0.26] minutes/day; MVPA: 0.53 [0.43, 0.64] minutes/day).

For SED, the association was stronger for those children with older siblings (vs. none); for MVPA, a stronger association was observed for those who had both younger and older siblings (vs. none) and a weaker relationship existed in spring compared to winter. Longitudinally, the association between mother-child activity levels did not change for SED and LPA. At age 6 (vs. age 4) the association between mother-child MVPA was weaker across the whole day (βi: - 0.16 [- 0.31, - 0.01]), but remained similar at both ages between 3 and 11 pm.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      More active mothers have more active 6-year-olds; this association was similar for boys and girls but differed by time of week, season and by age of siblings at home. Longitudinally, the association weakened for MVPA between 4 and 6 years, likely reflecting the differing activities children engage in during school hours and increased independence. Family-based physical activity remains an important element of children's activity behaviour regardless of age. This could be exploited in interventions to increase physical activity within families."

To date, only a scarce number of studies have investigated these associations among youths. The aim was to elucidate the relationship between CRF and accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior with WBC counts and subfraction concentrations of particular WBC (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) in a large representative national sample of US children and adolescents. Participants accumulating 60 min/day or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were considered active or inactive otherwise. Participants were also categorized into low, average, and high CRF level.

Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and direct observation were used as the criterion measure. Predicted metabolic equivalents were calculated using the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation (activPAL™ software version 5.8.0). Predictive validity was evaluated using dependent-samples t-tests. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to develop and cross-validate an intensity threshold for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold. The classification accuracy of the developed threshold was cross-validated using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic-curve.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation significantly overestimated metabolic equivalents during sedentary behaviors and significantly underestimated metabolic equivalents for light-intensity physical activities, moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities and total metabolic equivalents compared to measured metabolic equivalents (all P<0.001). The developed threshold of ≥1418 counts per 15s resulted in good classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The current activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation requires further development before it can be used to accurately estimate metabolic equivalents in preschoolers.

            "abstract": "Use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) is a well-established therapy in patients with acute or chronic autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The aim of the present open, prospective study was to investigate efficacy and safety of the novel IVIG preparation BT681 (Biotest Pharma GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) in adult patients with chronic ITP (cITP). In order to fulfil high standards of purity and viral safety, an additional HPLC step has been introduced and validated virus removal and inactivating procedures are included in the manufacturing process of BT681. A total of 24 patients with platelet counts between 3/nl and 27/nl received a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight BT681 in standard dosage regimens: 1.0 g/kg/day for 2 days in 15 patients and 0.4 g/kg/day for five consecutive days in nine patients. Platelet response (platelet count > or =50/nl) and regression of haemorrhages were documented during the 28 days study period and safety parameters including adverse events, laboratory investigations and vital signs were regularly monitored. The overall response rate was 91.7%, that is 22/24 patients responded to BT681 treatment. The median time to platelet response was 3.0 days, the duration of response 25.5 days; the median max. platelet count 222/nl and the time to max. platelet count 7.5 days. During the entire observation period, platelet counts below baseline were only observed in five responders; in half of the patients, platelet counts were even above 50/nl at the end of follow-up. Corresponding to the good platelet response, the clinical symptoms improved markedly in the majority of patients within the first week after start of BT681 infusions with 88.9% overall regression of haemorrhages in comparison with baseline. The evaluation of platelet parameters showed a slight tendency in favour of the 5 days group, evaluation of haemorrhage severity slight advantages for the 2 days group. The adverse event data indicate that the therapy with BT681 was safe and well tolerated in both treatment groups even if minor effects were more frequent in patients treated with the 2 days regimen. The large majority of adverse events were known intolerabilities during the treatment phase described as mild and transient. The results demonstrate that the new immunoglobulin preparation BT681 is effective and safe in the treatment of adult patients with cITP."

            "abstract": "Prosthetic elevated vacuum is a suspension method used to reduce daily volume changes of the residual limb. Evaluation of the effectiveness of these systems is limited due to a lack of correlation to actual socket air pressure, particularly during unconstrained movements. This may explain some of the variability in functional outcomes reported in the literature. Our objective was to develop a light-weight portable socket measurement system to quantify internal socket air pressure, temperature, and acceleration; and to present preliminary results from implementation with three transtibial prosthesis users with mechanical elevated vacuum pumps. Participants completed five functional tasks with and without the vacuum pumps actively connected, including the 2-Minute Walk test, 5-Times Sit-to-Stand test, 4-Square Step test, L-Test, and Figure-8 test. Results demonstrated different gait profiles and pressure ranges for each user. Two of the participants demonstrated substantially lower air pressure (higher vacuum) over time while the pump was active compared to inactive. The minimum air pressure measured for all participants was -34.6 ± 7.7 kPa. One participant did not show substantial changes in pressure over time for either pump condition. Functional task performance was not significantly different between pump conditions. Correlation with accelerometer readings indicated peak positive pressures occurred just following initial contact of the foot in early stance, and the most negative pressures (highest vacuum) were observed throughout swing. This study has demonstrated the use of a portable data logging tool that may serve the clinical and research communities to quantify the operation of elevated vacuum systems, and better understand the variability of mechanical pump operation and overall system performance."

The nephron index is a novel methodology for non-invasively estimating the number of functional nephrons, under the assumption that serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentrations should correlate with phosphate excretion per nephron. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional associations between daily sedentary time and the nephron index in middle-aged and older adults with or without CKD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The daily time spent in sedentary behavior was assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer in 294 participants (182 non-CKD adults and 112 CKD patients).

Additionally, CKD patients with more sedentary time also had a greater nephron index decrease compared to those with less sedentary time (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the independent association between sedentary time and the nephron index after adjusting for age, sex, presence of CKD, overweight/obesity, medication use, and total wear time (β = -0.13, P = 0.035).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These cross-sectional findings suggest that age- or CKD-related decreases in the estimated nephron number (that is, the nephron index) may be accelerated by increased sedentary behavior."

This study tested a simple, low-resource, low-cost home walking program. Methods: In this single center, 3-month study, 115 COPD patients were randomized to a control cohort or a goal setting cohort. Each patient met with study staff and received 5 telephone calls at 2-week intervals. During these contacts, the Goal group was assisted by a wellness coach who helped them set personal activity goals. All patients wore a pedometer to record daily steps, the primary study outcome. Results: Over the 12-week interval, the average step-per-days was 36% higher for the Goal cohort patients (Week 12 mean = 4390) than for Control patients (mean = 3790). No group differences emerged on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, the COPD Assessment Test, or the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Secondary analyses indicated that even patients with greater disease severity, including those with an mMRC score >2 or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted below 50%, increased their walking relative to Control patients. Almost half (48%) of Goal patients successfully reached at least one personal goal such as increasing stamina and activity, or decreasing shortness of breath or weight. Conclusions: A relatively low-resource wellness coaching, goal-setting intervention resulted in a small improvement in the activity level of COPD patients over a 12-week period including those with marked pulmonary impairment. Further investigation should be directed at understanding the optimal blend of in person and remote coaching needed to produce the greatest cost-to-benefit ratio."

To assess HRQOL, the COPD assessment test (CAT) was completed. Patients performed spirometry and 6-min walk test. Physical activity was measured by the SenseWear Mini Armband on 7 consecutive days. By performing a multiple linear regression analysis, independent predictors of CAT score were identified.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Age (β = -0.39, p = 0.001), average daily steps (β = -0.31, p = 0.033) and 6-min walk distance (β = -0.32, p = 0.019) were found to be independent predictors of CAT score, whereas physical activity duration above 3 METs (p = 0.498) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s in% of predicted (p = 0.364) showed no significant association.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study showed that average daily steps and functional capacity are independent determinants of HRQOL in patients with COPD. This emphasizes the importance to remain active and mobile, which is associated with better HRQOL."

This study aims to determine: 1) the trajectory in daily step counts before, during and after the lockdown in China, and 2) the characteristics associated with the trajectories.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From December 2019 to July 2020, smartphone-based step counts were continuously collected in 815 Chinese adults residing in Shanghai over 202 days across three phases: before, during, and after the lockdown. Participant characteristics were reported, and height, weight and body composition measured before the lockdown. A 'sharp' regression discontinuity design with cluster robust standard errors was used to test the effect of the lockdown and reopening on daily steps and a linear mixed model was used to examine the characteristics associated with trajectories during the observed period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Based on 164,630 person-days of data, we found a sharp decline in daily step counts upon the lockdown (24/01/2020) by an average of 3796 (SE = 88) steps, followed by a significant trend of increase by 34 steps/day (SE = 2.5; p < .001) until the end of the lockdown (22/03/2020). This increasing trend continued into the reopening phase at a slower rate of 5 steps per day (SE = 2.3; p = 0.029). Those who were older, married, university educated, insufficiently active, had an 'at risk' body composition, and those in the control group, were slower at recovering step counts during the lockdown, and those who were older, married, without university education and with an 'at risk' body composition recovered step counts at a slower pace after the reopening.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite later increases in step counts, COVID-19 lockdown led to a sustained period of reduced physical activity, which may have adverse health implications.

            "abstract": "Although patients with chronic pain are often considered to have reduced levels of everyday physical activity, data on their activity levels are scarce and inconclusive. Therefore, this study explored whether patients with chronic pain have reduced activity levels, as objectively measured with an activity monitor. The activity monitor is based on long-term ambulatory monitoring of signals from body-fixed accelerometers during everyday life, aimed at assessment of mobility-related activities. Measurements with the monitor were performed during a weekday (24 h) in 18 patients with chronic pain and compared with measurements obtained from 18 gender and age matched healthy comparison subjects. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 44 (11) years, and the mean (SD) duration of their complaints was 8 (7) years. Compared with the healthy subjects, the duration of dynamic activities was not significantly reduced (p=0.10) in the patient group. Mean (SD) intensity of everyday physical activity was lower (p=0.03) in the patients than in the healthy comparison subjects (0.021 [0.006] g versus 0.026 [0.004] g), and patients spent more time lying down (47.0 [10.2]% versus 34.3 [5.6] %; p=0.000) and less time sitting (29.2 [8.9]% versus 36.4 [9.3]%; p=0.03) than the healthy comparison subjects. In spite of significant differences between patients and healthy comparison subjects for some aspects of the activity pattern (which may reflect pain behaviour), the impact of chronic pain on everyday physical activity was relatively small."

Behavioural transitions toward more sedentary lifestyles coupled with increased consumption of high calorie foods has resulted in rising proportions of overweight/obesity and decreasing levels of physical activity in school-aged children. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and to investigate factors associated with overweight/obesity and physical activity in Kenyan children aged 9 to 11 years.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Body composition and physical activity measures of participating children were accomplished by anthropometric assessment, accelerometry, and administration of questionnaires related to diet and lifestyle, and the school and neighbourhood environments.

Mean daily sedentary time was 398 minutes, time spent in light physical activity was 463 minutes, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 36 minutes based on activity cut-points developed by Treuth et al. Only 12.6% of participating children were meeting the recommendation of ≥ 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and 45.7% of participants used active transportation to/from school. Increasing parental education level, total annual household income, and attending a private rather than public school were associated positively with being overweight/obese and negatively with meeting physical activity guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provided the evidence for an existing prevalence of childhood overweight/obesity in Nairobi. Children were spending a considerable amount of time in sedentary and light intensity physical activity, with few meeting physical activity guidelines. Higher socioeconomic status and parental education attainment were associated with a higher likelihood of children being overweight/obese and a lower likelihood of children meeting the physical activity recommendations. Interventions and strategies should be attentive to the potential health consequences of lifestyle transitions resulting from urbanisation and economic prosperity."

During assisted stepping, the soleus H-reflex was conditioned by percutaneous stimulation of the ipsilateral common peroneal nerve at one fold TA M-wave motor threshold with a single pulse delivered at a short conditioning-test interval. To counteract movement of recording and stimulating electrodes, a supramaximal stimulus at 80-100 ms after the test H-reflex was delivered. Stimuli were randomly dispersed across the step cycle which was divided into 16 equal bins. The conditioned soleus H-reflex was significantly facilitated throughout the stance phase, while during swing no significant changes on the conditioned H-reflex were observed when compared to the unconditioned soleus H-reflex recorded during stepping. Spontaneous clonic activity in triceps surae muscle occurred in multiple phases of the step cycle at a mean frequency of 7 Hz for steps with and without stimulation. This suggests that electrical excitation of TA and soleus group Ia afferents did not contribute to manifestation of ankle clonus. Absent reciprocal inhibition is likely responsible for lack of soleus H-reflex depression in swing phase observed in these patients. The pronounced reduced reciprocal inhibition in stance phase may contribute to impaired levels of co-contraction of antagonistic ankle muscles. Based on these findings, we suggest that rehabilitation should selectively target to transform reciprocal facilitation to inhibition through computer controlled reflex conditioning protocols."

Step count variability was positively correlated with measures of physical function: SPPB (r=0.50, p<0.05), gait speed (r=0.59, p<0.05), handgrip strength (r=0.71, p<0.05), Instrumental ADLs (r=0.44, p<0.05) and life space mobility (r=0.54, p<0.05).There was a weak inverse correlation between post-dialysis step counts (4-hour blocks after a dialysis session) and post-dialysis interval fatigue [r=-0.19 (n=102, p=0.06).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Physical activity assessment via accelerometer is feasible for older adults receiving hemodialysis.

            "abstract": "Genes involved in circadian regulation, such as circadian locomotor output cycles kaput [CLOCK], cryptochrome [CRY1] and period [PER], have been associated with sleep outcomes in prior animal and human research. However, it is unclear whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with the sleep disturbances commonly experienced by adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe polymorphisms in selected circadian genes that are associated with sleep duration or disruption as well as the sleep-wake rhythm strength and phase timing among adults living with HIV/AIDS. A convenience sample of 289 adults with HIV/AIDS was recruited from HIV clinics and community sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. A wrist actigraph was worn for 72 h on weekdays to estimate sleep duration or total sleep time (TST), sleep disruption or percentage of wake after sleep onset (WASO) and several circadian rhythm parameters: mesor, amplitude, the ratio of mesor to amplitude (circadian quotient), and 24-h autocorrelation. Circadian phase measures included clock time for peak activity (acrophase) from actigraphy movement data, and bed time and final wake time from actigraphy and self-report. Genotyping was conducted for polymorphisms in five candidate genes involved in circadian regulation: CLOCK, CRY1, PER1, PER2 and PER3. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated as potential covariates. Interactions between genotype and HIV variables (i.e. viral load, years since HIV diagnosis) were also evaluated. Controlling for potentially confounding variables (e.g. race, gender, CD4+ T-cell count, waist circumference, medication use, smoking and depressive symptoms), CLOCK was associated with WASO, 24-h autocorrelation and objectively-measured bed time; CRY1 was associated with circadian quotient; PER1 was associated with mesor and self-reported habitual wake time; PER2 was associated with TST, mesor, circadian quotient, 24-h autocorrelation and bed and wake times; PER3 was associated with amplitude, 24-h autocorrelation, acrophase and bed and wake times. Most of the observed associations involved a significant interaction between genotype and HIV. In this chronic illness population, polymorphisms in several circadian genes were associated with measures of sleep disruption and timing. These findings extend the evidence for an association between genetic variability in circadian regulation and sleep outcomes to include the sleep-wake patterns experienced by adults living with HIV/AIDS. These results provide direction for future intervention research related to circadian sleep-wake behavior patterns."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Saturated fatty acids (SFA) have been reported to promote inflammation. Nevertheless, evidence linking dietary SFA and low-grade inflammation in adolescents is scarce and inconsistent. The modulatory role of physical activity (PA) on fat metabolism and inflammation may provide a potential explanation. Thus, we assessed the association of dietary SFA with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a marker of low-grade inflammation, in 15-year-olds, and evaluated possible interactions between dietary SFA and different levels of PA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Children participating in the 15-year follow-ups of the GINIplus and LISA German birth cohort studies were included (N = 824). SFA intake was estimated by means of a food frequency questionnaire and PA recorded by accelerometers. Average daily minutes of PA were classified into \"sedentary\", \"light\" and \"moderate-to-vigorous\" (MVPA), using Freedson's cut-offs. HsCRP concentrations were measured in serum and categorized into 3 sex-specific levels (below detection limit (I), above 75th percentile (III), in between (II)). Sex-stratified cross-sectional associations between SFA and hsCRP were assessed using multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Interaction terms were included between SFA and the different PA levels; and if significant interactions were observed, analyses stratified by tertiles of the relevant PA levels were performed. Relative risk ratios (RRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were presented for a 1% increase in SFA.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      An inverse association was observed between SFA intake and hsCRP (II vs. I) in males (RRR = 0.85 [95%CI = 0.76;0.96], p = 0.008), whereas no significant association was observed in females. A significant interaction was observed with \"sedentary\" and \"light\" PA but not with MVPA in both sexes (p < 0.05). Stratified analyses indicated a significant inverse association between SFA and medium hsCRP levels in males in the highest light PA tertile (hsCRP II vs. I: 0.67 [0.517;0.858], p = 0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings do not support a detrimental role of dietary SFA in low-grade inflammation among adolescents. In males, higher dietary SFA was associated with lower hsCRP, although this should be interpreted in the context of possibly correlated nutrients. Children spending the most time in light PA drove the observed inverse association, suggesting a synergistic effect of SFA and lifestyle PA in the resultant inflammatory response."

Patients with dizziness experience balance problems and anxiety, which can lead to decreased physical activity levels and participation in their daily activities. Moreover, recovery of vestibular function from vestibular injury requires physical activity. Although there are reports that decreased physical activity is associated with handicap, anxiety, postural instability and reduced recovery of vestibular function in patients with chronic dizziness, these data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Therefore, the objective data of physical activity and the relationships between physical activity, handicap, anxiety and postural stability in patients with chronic dizziness are not clear. The purpose of this research was to objectively measure the physical activity of patients with chronic dizziness in daily living as well as handicap, anxiety and postural stability compared to healthy adults. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the relationships between physical activity, handicap, anxiety and postural stability in patients with chronic dizziness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-eight patients with chronic dizziness of more than 3 months caused by unilateral vestibular hypofunction (patient group) and twenty-eight age-matched community dwelling healthy adults (healthy group) participated in this study.

A non-invasive bed sensor (Emfit) may provide advantages over actigraphy for long-term sleep assessment in the home. This study compared sleep-wake measurements between this sensor and a validated actigraph.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty healthy subjects (6 to 54 years) underwent simultaneous monitoring with both devices for 14 days and filled out a daily sleep diary. Parameters included bed entry time, sleep start, sleep end, bed exit time, rest interval duration, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). The agreement between the two devices was measured using Bland-Altman plots and inter-class correlation coefficients (ICC). In addition, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparisons of Emfit and actigraphy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen percent of the subjects reported that wearing the actigraph was a burden. None reported that using the bed sensor was a burden. The minimal detectable change between Emfit and actigraphy was 11 minutes for bed entry time, 14 minutes for sleep start, 14 minutes for sleep end, 10 minutes for bed exit time, 20 minutes for rest interval duration, and 110 minutes for WASO. Inter-class correlation coefficients revealed an excellent agreement for all sleep parameters (ICC=0.99, 95% CI 98-99) except for WASO (ICC=0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.56). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.62, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively.

Participants: People with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 24, male:female 18:6) and their spousal carers (n = 24, 6:18); stroke survivors (n = 24, 16:8) and age- and sex-matched healthy adults (n = 19, 11:8). Level of physiological impairment was measured with post-bronchodilator spirometry (FEV1 %predicted) for people with COPD, and walking speed for people with stroke. Outcomes: Participants were monitored over seven days (triaxial accelerometer, Sensewear armband) to obtain objective data on daily sedentary time, and prolonged sedentary bouts (≥ 30 min). During the monitoring period, a 24-hour use of time recall instrument was administered by telephone interview to explore the context of sedentary activities (e.g. television, computer or reading). Sedentary time was quantified using accelerometry and recall data, and group differences were explored. Linear regression examined associations between physiological impairment and sedentary time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participant groups were similar in terms of age (COPD 75 ± 8, carers 70 ± 11, stroke 69 ± 10, healthy 73 ± 7 years) and body mass index (COPD 28 ± 4, carers 27 ± 4, stroke 31 ± 4, healthy 26 ± 4 kg.m-2). The healthy group had the lowest sedentary time (45% of waking hours), followed by the carer (54%), stroke (60%) and COPD (62%) groups (p < 0.0001). Level of physiological impairment was an independent predictor of waking sedentary time (p = 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      People with a chronic health condition spent more time sedentary than those without a chronic condition, and there were small but clear differences between groups in the types of activities undertaken during sedentary periods. The study findings may aid in the design of targeted interventions to decrease sedentary time in people with chronic health conditions."

General practitioners are well placed to offer physical activity counseling but insufficient time is a barrier. Although referral to an exercise specialist is an alternative, in Australia, these allied health professionals are only publicly funded to provide face-to-face counseling to patients who have an existing chronic illness. Accordingly, this trial aims to determine the efficacy of GP referral of insufficiently active patients (regardless of their chronic disease status) for physical activity counseling (either face-to-face or predominately via telephone) by exercise specialists, based on patients' objectively assessed physical activity levels, compared with usual care. If the trial is efficacious, the equivalence and cost-effectiveness of face-to-face counseling versus telephone counseling will be assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This three arm pragmatic randomized trial will involve the recruitment of 261 patients from primary care clinics in metropolitan and regional areas of New South Wales, Australia. Insufficiently active (less than 7000 steps/day) consenting adult patients will be randomly assigned to: 1) five face-to-face counseling sessions, 2) one face-to-face counseling session followed by four telephone calls, or 3) a generic mailed physical activity brochure (usual care). The interventions will operationalize social cognitive theory via a behavior change counseling framework. Participants will complete a survey and seven days of pedometry at baseline, and at three and 12 months post-randomization. The primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat principles and will compare: (i) mean change in average daily step counts between baseline and 12 months for the combined intervention group (Group 1: face-to-face, and Group 2: telephone) and usual care (Group 3); (ii) step counts at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include: self-reported physical activity, sedentary behavior, quality of life, and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If referral of primary care patients to exercise specialists increases physical activity, this process offers the prospect of systematically and sustainably reaching a large proportion of insufficiently active adults.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a family intervention on physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) in children and their parents. In this controlled pilot study, all 8-9-year-old children from four schools from a socioeconomically disadvantaged area in Sweden were invited and 67 children and 94 parents were included. The intervention was run by a foundation in co-operation with the municipality. The 9-month program included: (1) activity sessions, (2) healthy meals, (3) health information and (4) parental support groups. PA was primary outcome and ST was secondary outcome, measured by accelerometry. In total, 40 of the children (60%) and 45 of the adults (50%) had at least one day of valid accelerometer data at both baseline and follow-up. Significant intervention effects for the whole group were found in total PA (p = 0.048, mean difference (MD) intervention/control 150 counts per minute) and in vigorous PA (p = 0.02, MD 8 min/day) during the weekends. There were no differences between groups in the other PA variables or ST. This pilot study shows that it is possible to influence PA in families from a disadvantaged area through a family program."

A better understanding of their interrelationships is crucial to develop effective therapies. Moreover, measurement of daily physical activity (DPA) in HD patients is tricky, as it is usually assessed by subjective self-report questionnaires. Therefore, we aimed to objectively measure sponteanous DPA with motion sensors and to explore its relation with fatigue and depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      DPA was assessed for seven consecutive days in 37 HD patients based on their daily step count measured with the SenseWear™ Armband.

            "abstract": "Locomotion control uses proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular signals. The vestibular contribution has been analyzed previously with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which constitutes mainly a virtual head-fixed rotation in the roll plane that causes polarity-specific deviations of gait. In this study we examined whether a visual disturbance has similar effects on gait when it acts in the same direction as GVS, i.e., when roll vection is induced by head-fixed visual roll motion stimulation. Random dot patterns were constantly rotated in roll at +/-15 degrees /s on a computer-driven binocular head-mounted display that was worn by eight healthy participants. Their gait trajectories were tracked while they walked a distance of 6 m. A stimulation effect was observed only for the first three to four steps, but not for the whole walking distance. These results are similar to the results of previous GVS studies, suggesting that in terms of the direction of action visual motion stimulations in the roll plane are similar to GVS. Both kinds of stimulation cause only initial balance responses in the roll plane but do not contribute to the steering of gait in the yaw plane."

Aspects related to timing of a person's sleep routine provide important clues regarding diagnosis and treatments. Solutions for sleep complaints may sometimes rely solely on changes in habits and life style, based on what is learned from daily rest-activity patterns. This paper describes an approach for determining two states, in-bed and out-of-bed, using load cells under the bed. These states are important because they can help characterize rest-activity patterns at nighttime or detect bed exits in hospitals or nursing homes. The information derived from the load cells is valuable as an objective and continuous measure of daily patterns, and it is particularly valuable in sleep studies in populations who would not be able to remember specific hours to complete sleep diaries. The approach is evaluated on data collected in a laboratory experiment, in a sleep clinic, and also on data collected from residents of an assisted-living facility."

We do not know how long-term control of disease activity impacts upon daily PA levels and if treated patients attain PA levels seen in healthy controls. We therefore compared habitual levels of PA and SB between female RA patients with low disease activity achieved by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, those with active arthritis (aRA) and non-RA controls. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional comparison of 40 RA patients on anti-TNF therapy for >2 years with DAS28<3.2 (tRA), 32 patients on conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs with DAS28>3.2 (aRA) and 34 healthy controls (C) with the groups matched for age and body mass index. PA was assessed using the ActiGraph accelerometer to determine step count and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light activity and sedentary time. Results: Daily step count was 72% higher in tRA and 40% higher in C in comparison to aRA (p<0.01). Sedentary time (as a proportion of wear time) was 10% less in tRA than aRA (p=0.03), while light activity time was 18% higher (p=0.014). Both RA groups had 40% lower MVPA time than C (p=0.001). Only half of either RA group fulfilled current WHO guidelines for PA compared with 82% of controls. Conclusion: RA patients who had long-term disease suppression were more physically active with less SB compared to RA patients with active disease. They had similar light PA and SB to controls although lower MVPA. Behavioral change interventions are likely to be needed in order to restore moderate exercise, further reduce SB and to meet guidelines for daily PA."

However, a sedentary lifestyle increases cardiovascular risk, and therefore, inactive smokers have a particularly enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this secondary analysis of mActive-Smoke, a 12-week observational study, we investigated adherence to guideline-recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in smokers and its association with the urge to smoke.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled 60 active smokers (≥3 cigarettes per day) and recorded continuous step counts with the Fitbit Charge HR. MVPA was defined as a cadence of greater than or equal to 100 steps per minute. Participants were prompted to report instantaneous smoking urges via text message 3 times a day on a Likert scale from 1 to 9. We used a mixed effects linear model for repeated measures, controlling for demographics and baseline activity level, to investigate the association between MVPA and urge.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 53 participants (mean age 40 [SD 12] years, 57% [30/53] women, 49% [26/53] nonwhite, and 38% [20/53] obese) recorded 6 to 12 weeks of data. Data from 3633 person-days were analyzed, with a mean of 69 days per participant. Among all participants, median daily MVPA was 6 min (IQR 2-13), which differed by sex (12 min [IQR 3-20] for men vs 3.5 min [IQR 1-9] for women; P=.004) and BMI (2.5 min [IQR 1-8.3] for obese vs 10 min [IQR 3-15] for nonobese; P=.04). The median total MVPA minutes per week was 80 (IQR 31-162). Only 10% (5/51; 95% CI 4% to 22%) of participants met national guidelines of 150 min per week of MVPA on at least 50% of weeks. Adjusted models showed no association between the number of MVPA minutes per day and mean daily smoking urge (P=.72).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of MVPA was low in adult smokers who rarely met national guidelines for MVPA. Given the poor physical activity attainment in smokers, more work is required to enhance physical activity in this population."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Young children depend on adult caregivers to provide opportunities for physical activity. Research has focused on barriers and facilitators to children's physical activity while in childcare, but parental influences remain largely unknown. This study examines parent's attitudes about preschoolers' physical activity and outdoor time, compares them with those of childcare providers and determines the association between parental attitudes and preschoolers' measured activity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Parents and childcare providers from 30 childcare centres were surveyed regarding attitudes towards preschoolers' physical activity and outdoor time. Children's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was determined by using 24-h accelerometry. Parent and childcare providers' responses were compared. Mixed-effect linear regression examined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time as outcomes with parental attitudes as predictors, family demographics as covariates and centre as a random effect.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three hundred eighty-eight parents and 151 childcare providers participated. On average, children were 4.3 (0.7) years old. Parents and childcare providers both considered daily physical activity important for preschoolers, but providers rated the importance of daily outdoor time higher on a 10-point scale (8.9 vs. 7.6, P < 0.001). More parents than providers believed that children would get sick by playing outside in the cold (25 vs. 11%, P < 0.05). Parents were more comfortable with their child playing outside at childcare compared with outside at home (8.9 vs. 6.9, P < 0.001). Lower income parents felt less comfortable than higher income parents with their child playing outside either near home or at childcare. Neither home nor total child activity levels were associated with most parental attitudes queried.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While parents and childcare providers value daily physical activity for children, some parents expressed discomfort about their young children engaging in outdoor play, especially around home and in cold weather. These findings highlight the importance of childcare-based interventions to promote preschoolers' physical activity and outdoor play."

Following a week of self-selected sleep duration, adolescents were randomized to a five-night deficient sleep opportunity (6.5 hr in bed) or a healthy sleep opportunity (10 hr in bed) obtained by systematically changing bedtimes. Wake time remained consistent across all 3 weeks (including weekends). Daily reports of sleep patterns and asthma symptoms, actigraphy, and daily peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), as well as weekly spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide were collected.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants averaged 3.2 hr less sleep (P < 0.001) per night in the short sleep condition versus the long sleep condition. Further, they had an 8.4% decrease overnight in PEFR (P = 0.007), and reported more asthma symptoms interfering with activities in the past 24 hr (P = 0.02) in the short sleep condition than the long sleep condition. No significant differences between experimental weeks were found for weekly spirometry or exhaled nitric oxide.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a cross-over sleep manipulation protocol in adolescents with asthma. Since overnight decrease in PEFR is a marker of nocturnal asthma, and has been associated with the severity of daytime airflow limitation, these early-stage results suggest that shortened sleep duration may exacerbate adolescent asthma and associated functional impairments."

The aim of this study was to characterize and contrast the levels and patterns of PA between stroke survivors with different ambulation status living in low-income areas in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 45 community-dwelling stroke survivors living in low-income areas in Cape Town participated. Accelerometers (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) were used to assess PA levels (vector magnitude counts and number of steps) and time spent sedentary, in light and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Total daily PA and within-day activity patterns were compared between limited community ambulators (gait speed: <0.8 m/s) and community ambulators (gait speed: ≥0.8 m/s). Results: Limited community ambulators (n = 23) took fewer steps per day (1091 vs. 3524 steps, P < .001), spent more time sedentary (80% vs 68%, P = .002) and less time in light PA (18% vs 25%, P = .008) and MVPA (1% vs 5%, P < .001) than community ambulators (n = 22). The limited ambulation group had a consistent pattern of PA across the day without any significant variations in PA levels or intensity, whereas the unlimited ambulating group was most active in the morning followed by a gradual reduction in PA throughout the day. Conclusions: Community ambulating stroke survivors showed greater PA levels and a more variable diurnal pattern in contrast to the limited ambulation group. Different interventions may be required to assist the different groups to start engaging in health-enhancing PA."

(2) Methods: this was a planned secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of BMI vs. HEP for hemodialysis patients with depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The primary outcome for the analysis was the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). The secondary outcome was consolidation of daily inactivity (ConDI), an actigraphy measure that describes sleep continuity and is based on a sleep detection algorithm validated by polysomnography. We also explored whether changes in AIS and ConDI were associated with changes in depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores over 8-week follow-up. (3) Results: BMI and HEP groups did not differ significantly from one another. Exposure to BMI or HEP improved sleep quality (baseline AIS 9.9 (±5.0) vs. 8-week follow-up 6.4 (±3.9), (V = 155.5, p = 0.015)), but not ConDI. Improvements in AIS were associated with lower depression scores (Rho = 0.57, p = 0.01) and higher quality-of-life scores (Rho = 0.46, p = 0.04). (4) Conclusions: mindfulness and HEP may be helpful interventions to improve self-reported sleep quality in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Small studies indicate that people with CMT have reduced daily activity levels.

Alternatively, this finding may indicate that people with CMT engage more in activities or movement not related to walking. Implications for Rehabilitation Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: • People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease did not show a difference in energy expenditure over seven days compared to healthy controls, but this may be due to higher energy costs of walking, and/or an over estimation of energy expenditure by the activity monitor in a population where there is muscle wasting. This needs to be considered when interpreting activity monitor data in people with neuromuscular diseases. • Compared to healthy controls, people with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease had a lower step count over seven days, but exhibited more frequent transitions from sedentary to active behaviors • High Body Mass Index and increased time spent sedentary were related factors that have implications for general health status. • Understanding the profile of physical activity and behavior can allow targeting of rehabilitation interventions to address mobility and fitness."

Physical activity (PA) after arthroplasty is frequently determined with the use of questionnaires, which are known for their subjective nature, recall bias, and ceiling effect. These disadvantages are not applicable to physical activity monitoring (AM) using sensors. We compared objectively measured PA at long-term follow-up in a matched cohort of HRA and stemmed THA subjects.Patients and methods - We compared 2 groups of 16 patients (12 males) in each group, one having received unilateral HRA (median age 56 years at surgery) and a matched group having received unilateral stemmed THA with a small diameter femoral head (28 mm) on conventional polyethylene (median age 60 years at surgery) with osteoarthritis as indication for surgery, 10 years after surgery. Groups were matched by sex, age at surgery, and BMI. The daily habitual PA was measured over 4 consecutive days in daily living using a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Both quantitative parameters (time standing, sitting, walking, number of steps, and sit-stand transfers) and qualitative parameters (walking cadence) were determined.Results - The AM was worn for a median 13 (11-16) hours per day. The median daily step count was 5,546 (2,274-9,966) for the HRA group and 4,583 (1,567-11,749) for the stemmed THA-group with 39 (21-74) versus 37 (24-62) daily sit-stand transfers respectively. The other PA parameters were also similar in both groups.Interpretation - We found similar median PA levels and also identical ranges. While short-term effects may exist, ageing and related behavioral adaptations or other effects seem to render the theoretical activity benefits from HRA irrelevant at longer follow-up."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading rapidly worldwide since late January 2020. The strict lockdown strategy prompted by the Italian government, to hamper severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) spreading, has reduced the possibility of performing either outdoor or gym physical activity (PA). This study investigated and quantified the reduction of PA in patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of sudden death.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Daily PA of 24 patients was estimated by processing recorded data from ICD-embedded accelerometric sensors used by the rate-responsive pacing systems.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the forced 40-d in-home confinement, a mean 25% reduction of PA was observed as compared with the 40-d confinement-free period (1.2 ± 0.3 vs 1.6 ± 0.5 hr/d, respectively, P = .0001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This objective quantification of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA determined by an ICD device showed an abrupt and statistically significant reduction of PA in primary prevention ICD patients, during the in-home confinement quarantine. To counteract the deleterious effects of physical inactivity during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients should be encouraged to perform indoor exercise-based personalized rehabilitative programs."

We included people who were aged 40-67 years, had sedentary work tasks, and had a body-mass index (BMI) between 25 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2. After the baseline measurement, we stratified participants by their BMI (25-30 kg/m2 and >30 to 40 kg/m2); subsequently, an external statistician randomly assigned these participants (1:1) to either the intervention group (who received treadmill workstations for optional use) or the control group (who continued to work at their sit-stand desks as usual). Participants in the intervention group received reminders in boosting emails sent out to them at four occasions during the study period. Researchers were masked to group assignment until after analysis of the primary outcome. After the baseline measurement, participants were not masked to group belongings.

Actigraphy and TM measures were related for total sleep time (median = 382 vs 393 min, respectively [r = .71; P < .01]), sleep onset latency (median = 31.4 vs 27.5 min [r = .61; P < .01]), time in bed (433.3 vs 489.3 min [r = .74; P < .01]), and sleep efficiency (77% vs 86% [r = .45; P = .005]).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant adolescents is a major public health concern. Excess GWG increases risk of pregnancy complications as well as postpartum and offspring obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Prevention interventions for pregnant adults that target lifestyle modification (i.e., healthy eating/physical activity) show insufficient effectiveness. Pregnant adolescents have distinct social-emotional needs, which may contribute to excess GWG. From an interpersonal theoretical framework, conflict and low social support increase negative emotions, which in turn promote excess GWG through mechanisms such as overeating and physical inactivity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The current manuscript describes the design of a pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial of adolescent interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to address social-emotional needs and prevent excess GWG. Up to 50 pregnant, healthy adolescents 13-19y, 12-18 weeks gestation are recruited from an interdisciplinary adolescent maternity hospital clinic and randomized to IPT + usual care or usual care alone. IPT involves 6 individual 60-minute sessions delivered by a trained behavioral health clinician during 12-30 weeks gestation. Sessions include relationship psychoeducation, emotion identification and expression, and teaching/role-playing communication skills. Between sessions, adolescents are instructed to complete a daily journal and to have conversations to work on relationship goals. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, mid-program, post-program, and 3-months postpartum. Primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability based upon rate of recruitment, session attendance, program acceptability ratings, and follow-up retention. Secondary outcomes are perinatal social functioning, stress, depression, and eating behaviors assessed with validated surveys and interviews; perinatal physical activity and sleep measured via accelerometer; GWG from measured weights; and at 3-months postpartum only, maternal adiposity by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, maternal insulin sensitivity derived from 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, and infant adiposity by air displacement plethysmography.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This pilot trial will address a key gap in extant understanding of excess GWG prevention for a high-risk population of adolescents. If feasible and acceptable, brief psychotherapy to address social-emotional needs should be tested for its effectiveness to address excess GWG and postpartum maternal/infant health. If effective, such an approach has potential to interrupt an adverse, intergenerational cycle of social-emotional distress, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease among young mothers and their offspring.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03086161, retrospectively registered."

The primary objective of the study is to assess changes from baseline (Week 0) to Week 12 in exercise capacity measured by the 6-min walk test and in daily non-sedentary daytime activity. Physical activity and objective sleep parameters will be measured by accelerometry using a wrist-worn device, worn continuously from screening (Week -2) until the end of study (Week 12). As a co-primary outcome, changes from baseline in sub-maximal exercise capacity will be assessed by the 6-min walk test. Patient- and physician-reported questionnaires will be used to assess quality of life, changes in signs and symptoms of HF and sleep parameters.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      OUTSTEP-HF will be the largest randomised trial in HF to date to use non-invasive accelerometry to assess whether treatment with sacubitril/valsartan improves patients' daily physical activity and exercise capacity compared with enalapril."

The aim was to monitor and increase the postoperative mobilization of patients after major visceral surgery by providing a continuous step count feedback using activity tracking wristbands.\n## METHODS\nThe study was designed as a randomized controlled single-center trial (NCT02834338) with two arms (open and laparoscopic surgery). Participants were randomized to either receive feedback of their step counts using an activity tracker wristband or not. The primary study endpoint was the mean step count during the first 5 postoperative days (PODs).\n## RESULTS\nA total of 132 patients were randomized. After laparoscopic operations, the average step count during PODs 1-5 was significantly increased by the feedback compared with the control group (P < 0.001); the cumulative step count (9867 versus 6103, P = 0.037) and activity time were also significantly increased. These results could not be confirmed in the open surgery arm. Possible reasons were a higher age and significantly more comorbidities in the open intervention group. Patients who achieved more than the median cumulative step count had a significantly shorter hospital stay and lower morbidity in both arms. The average step count also correlated with the length of hospital stay (R = - 0.341, P < 0.001).\n## CONCLUSION\nThis study is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the use and feasibility of activity tracking to monitor and enhance postoperative mobilization in abdominal surgery. Our results demonstrate that activity tracking can enhance perioperative mobilization after laparoscopic surgery.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02834338.\n"

In particular, toddler's unique behaviors, such as riding in a stroller or being carried by an adult, have not yet been examined. The objective of this study was to describe accelerometry signal outputs recorded during participation in nine types of behaviors (i.e., running, walking, climbing up/down, crawling, riding a ride-on toy, standing, sitting, riding in a stroller/wagon, and being carried by an adult) among toddlers. Twenty-four toddlers aged 13 to 35 months (50% girls) performed various prescribed behaviors during free play in a commercial indoor playroom while wearing ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on a hip and a wrist. Participants' performances were video-recorded. Based on the video data, accelerometer data were annotated with behavior labels to examine accelerometry signal outputs while performing the nine types of behaviors. Accelerometer data collected during 664 behavior assessments from the 21 participants were used for analysis. Hip vertical axis counts for walking were low (median = 49 counts/5 s). They were significantly lower than those recorded while a toddler was \"carried\" by an adult (median = 144 counts/5 s; p < 0.01). While standing, sitting, and riding in a stroller, very low hip vertical axis counts were registered (median ≤ 5 counts/5 s). Although wrist vertical axis and vector magnitude counts for \"carried\" were not higher than those for walking, they were higher than the cut-points for sedentary behaviors. Using various accelerometry signal features, machine learning techniques showed 89% accuracy to differentiate the \"carried\" behavior from ambulatory movements such as running, walking, crawling, and climbing. In conclusion, hip vertical axis counts alone may be unable to capture walking as physical activity and \"carried\" as sedentary behavior among toddlers. Machine learning techniques that utilize additional accelerometry signal features could help to recognize behavior types, especially to differentiate being \"carried\" from ambulatory movements."

Participants were randomized to an intervention (n=250) and a control group (n=246). The intervention group was given a wrist-worn physical activity monitor (Polar Active) with physical activity feedback and access to a gamified Web-based mobile service, providing fitness guidelines, tailored health information, advice of youth services, social networking, and feedback on physical activity. Through the trial, the physical activity of the men in the control group was measured continuously with an otherwise similar monitor but providing only the time of day and no feedback.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Screen viewing is a sedentary behaviour reported to interfere with sleep and physical activity. However, few longitudinal studies have assessed such associations in children of preschool age (0-6 years) and none have accounted for the compositional nature of these behaviours. We aimed to investigate the associations between total and device-specific screen viewing time at age 2-3 years and accelerometer-measured 24 h movement behaviours, including sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at age 5·5 years.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study is an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study in Singapore, which began in June 2009. We recruited pregnant women during their first ultrasound scan visit at two major public maternity units in Singapore. At clinic visits done at age 2-3 years, we collected parent-reported information about children's daily total and device-specific screen viewing time (television, handheld devices, and computers). At 5·5 years, children's movement behaviours for 7 consecutive days were measured using wrist-worn accelerometers. We assessed the associations between screen viewing time and movement behaviours (sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, MVPA, and sleep) using Dirichlet regression, which accounts for the compositional nature of such behaviours. This study is active but not recruiting and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01174875.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between June 1, 2009, and Oct 12, 2010, 1247 pregnant women enrolled and 1171 singleton births were enrolled. 987 children had parent-reported screen data at either 2 or 3 years, of whom 840 attended the clinic visit at age 5·5 years, and 577 wore an accelerometer. 552 children had at least 3 days of accelerometer data and were included in the analysis. Total screen viewing time at age 2-3 years had a significant negative association with sleep (p=0·008), light physical activity (p<0·0001), and MVPA (p<0·0001) in relation to sedentary behaviour at age 5·5 years. Compared with children who spent 1 h or less per day screen viewing at age 2-3 years, children who screen viewed for 3 h or more per day at 2-3 years engaged in more sedentary behaviour (439·8 mins per day [≤1 h screen viewing time] vs 480·0 mins per day [≥3 h screen viewing time]), and less light physical activity (384·6 vs 356·2 mins per day), and MVPA (76·2 vs 63·4 mins per day) at age 5·5 years. No significant differences in time spent sleeping were observed between the groups (539·5 vs 540·4 mins per day). Similar trends were observed for television viewing and handheld device viewing.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Longer screen viewing time in children aged 2-3 years was associated with more time spent engaged in sedentary behaviour and shorter time engaged in light physical activity and MVPA in later childhood. Our findings indicate that screen viewing might displace physical activity during early childhood, and suggest that reducing screen viewing time in early childhood might promote healthier behaviours and associated outcomes later in life.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Singapore National Research Foundation, and Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)."

This study examined the WALK-FOR program's effects on HAFD prevention.\n## METHODS\nA quasi-experimental pre-post two-group (intervention group [IG] n = 188, control group [CG] n = 189) design was applied in two hospital internal medical units. On admission, patients reported pre-hospitalization functional status, which was assessed again at discharge and 1-month follow-up. Primary outcome was decline in basic activities of daily living (BADL), using the Modified Barthel Index. Secondary outcomes were decline in instrumental ADL (Lawton's IADL scale) and community mobility (Yale Physical Activity Survey). All participants (75.1 ± 7 years old) were cognitively intact and ambulatory at admission. The WALK-FOR included a unit-tailored mobility program utilizing patient-and-staff education with a specific mobility goal (900 steps per day), measured by accelerometer.\n## RESULTS\nDecline in BADL occurred among 33% of the CG versus 23% of the IG (p = .02) at discharge, and among 43% of the CG versus 30% in the IG (p = .01) at 1-month follow-up. Similarly, 26% of the CG versus 15% of the IG declined in community mobility at 1-month follow-up (p = .01). Adjusted for major covariates, the intervention reduced the odds of decline in BADL by 41% (p = .05) at discharge and by 49% at 1-month follow-up (p = .01), and in community mobility by 63% (p = .02). There was no significant effect of the intervention on IADL decline (p = .19).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe WALK-FOR intervention is effective in reducing HAFD.\n"

            "abstract": "The restless legs syndrome is a disorder belonging to the family of movement disorders during sleep, often remains unrecognized, although it is the second most common cause of chronic sleep deficiency and daytime sleepiness. In accordance with international guidelines, pharmacotherapy of this disorder should begin with a dopamine agonist. Owing to their efficacy and favorable safety profile, newly introduced, selective dopamine agonists have become extensively used for this purpose. This study evaluated the efficacy of one of the products in this group, pramipexole. Fifty-one patients suffering from idiopathic restless legs syndrome underwent monotherapy with pramipexole in daily doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using three tools, i.e. follow-up questionnaires, actigraphy, and Forced Immobilisation Test. An excellent therapeutic effect was seen in more than 80 per cent of the study population. As shown by findings of the follow-up questionnaires, pramipexole resulted in substantial improvements of both daytime and nighttime symptoms of RLS. Actigraphy monitoring demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the ratio of time spent without limb movement to the time spent in bed; furthermore, the result of the Forced Immobilisation Test also improved. It seems fair to conclude from the findings of this study that pramipexole monotherapy is an effective treatment in restless legs syndrome."

However, recent data reveal that only a small portion of Canadian children are regularly physically active and/or meet sedentary behaviour guidelines. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between physical literacy and movement behaviour guidelines. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between physical literacy scores in Canadian children who meet or do not meet physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Children (n = 2956; 56.6% girls) aged 8-12 years from 10 Canadian cities had their physical literacy levels measured using the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy, which consists of four domains (Physical Competence; Daily Behaviour; Knowledge and Understanding; and Motivation and Confidence) that are aggregated to provide a composite physical literacy score. Physical activity levels were measured by pedometers, and sedentary behaviour was assessed through self-report questionnaire. Analyses were conducted separately for each guideline, comparing participants meeting versus those not meeting the guidelines. Comparisons were performed using MANOVA and logistic regression to control for age, gender, and seasonality.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants meeting physical activity guidelines or sedentary behaviour guidelines had higher physical literacy domain scores for Physical Competence and for Motivation and Confidence compared to those not meeting either guideline (both p < 0.0001).

Methods: SB, PA and joint-specific disability of 16 patients (68.9 ± 6.8 years) were assessed by accelerometry and questionnaires before and 9 months after arthroplasty. Results: All patients reported substantial postoperative improvements of their joint-related complaints (p ≤ 0.001). Accelerometry showed changes in neither daily SB (10-60 min sedentary bouts, p ≥ 0.569) nor in PA (steps, time in mild-to-vigorous activity and energy expenditure, p ≥ 0.255). Correlation analyses revealed that patients with severe preoperative disability showed a decrease in sedentary time, which was the opposite in patients with mild preoperative disability. Conclusion: SB and PA do not necessarily change after arthroplasty in older orthopedic patients. Even longer bouts of uninterrupted sitting, which are detrimental to health, do not decrease. Preoperative patient education is recommended to foster behavioral changes following elective arthroplasty."

There is yet to be consensus on the most appropriate way to categorise raw accelerometer data into behaviourally relevant metrics such as intensity, especially in chronic disease populations. Therefore the aim of this study was to estimate acceleration values corresponding to inactivity and MVPA during daily living activities of patients with heart failure (HF), via calibration with oxygen consumption (VO2) and to compare these values to previously published, commonly applied PA intensity thresholds which are based on healthy adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-two adults with HF (mean age 71 ± 14 years) undertook a range of daily living activities (including laying down, sitting, standing and walking) whilst measuring PA via wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers and VO2 via indirect calorimetry.

ADL-impaired PDD patients showed fewer sedentary bouts than non-ADL-impaired PD-MCI (p = 0.01, odds ratio [OR] = 8.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-45.2) and PD-NC (p = 0.01, OR = 10.3, CI = 1.6-67.3) patients, as well as a longer sedentary bout length (PD-NC: p = 0.02, OR = 0.1, CI = 0.02-0.65; PD-MCI: p = 0.02, OR = 0.14, CI = 0.03-0.69). These differences were mainly caused by fewer (PD-NC: p = 0.02, OR = 9.6, CI = 1.5-62.4; PD-MCI: p = 0.01, OR = 8.5, CI = 1.5-37.3) but longer sitting bouts (PD-NC: p = 0.03, OR = 0.12, CI = 0.02-0.80; PD-MCI: p = 0.04, OR = 0.19, CI = 0.04-0.93). Tests assessing executive function, visuoconstruction and attention correlated significantly with specific activity parameters (ρ ≥ 0.3; p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Objective assessment of physical behavior, in particular the detection of sedentary bouts, is a promising contributor to the discrimination between PD-MCI and PDD."

All patients were routinely assisted to mobilise by physiotherapists from postoperative day 1, and continued daily with exercise and progression of mobility as per usual practice. Physical activity was measured with SenseWear Pro 3 armband physiologic motion sensors between postoperative day 1-4. The motion sensors recorded step count, time spent in 'sedentary'/ 'moderate' activity, and energy expenditure. Frequency of postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) and postoperative LOS were also observed. Multivariate analyses were performed using forward stepwise logistic regression; results are displayed as odds ratio (95% confidence intervals).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      n = 99, median (interquartile range) steps 472 (908) over combined postoperative days 2/ 3, sedentary activity (< 3 METs) 99%.

On regression analysis age ≥ 75 years, predicted FEV1 < 70% and poor preoperative activity were predictive of lower postoperative activity. Factors limiting mobility on day 1 included pain and dizziness.

When the intervention unit was compared with itself before and after implementation of the wireless technology, there was also a significant increase in HH after implementation (74.5 vs 90.1 episodes/patient-day, respectively, P = .01). There was also an increase in mean alcohol-based handrub consumption between the 2 phases (68.9 vs 103.1 mL/patient-day, respectively, P = .04) in the intervention unit.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We demonstrated an improvement in alcohol gel usage via implementation of real-time feedback via wireless technology."

Core stability exercises (CSE) are a good strategy to improve local strength of trunk, balance and gait. Methods and analysis: This is a single-blind multicenter randomized controlled trial. Two parallel groups are compared, and both perform the same type of therapy. A control group (CG) (n = 110) performs conventional physiotherapy (CP) (1 h per session) focused on improving balance. An experimental group (EG) (n = 110) performs CSE (30 min) in addition to CP (30 min) (1 h/session in total). EG is divided in two subgroups, in which only half of patients (n = 55) perform CSE plus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Primary outcome measures are dynamic sitting, assessed by a Spanish version of Trunk Impairment Scale and stepping, assessed by Brunel Balance Assessment. Secondary outcomes are postural control, assessed by Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke patients; standing balance and risk of fall assessed by Berg Balance Scale; gait speed by BTS G-Walk (accelerometer); rate of falls, lower-limb spasticity by Modified Ashworth Scale; activities of daily living by Barthel Index; and quality of life by EQ-5D-5L.

            "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) levels in healthy adults are predominately based on self-reporting measures, which generally overestimate PA but underestimate SB. Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) eligible for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) follow an individualized program; thus, objective assessment of physical performance and regular daily activity is required. This study aimed to compare self-reported and objectively measured PA and SB in patients with CAD prior to out-patient CR. We included 91 patients with CAD and assessed their PA with an accelerometer for 8 days prior to CR, along with the short form of the international physical activity questionnaire. We found that most patients were sedentary (61%, ~8 h/day), and on average performed 63 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Males performed less daily light-intensity physical activity (-5%, p = 0.011) and performed more MVPA (+2%, p = 0.002) compared to females. Maximal aerobic capacity was significantly associated with MVPA (Spearman rho = 0.483, p < 0.001) and MVPA > 10 min bouts (Spearman rho = 0.391, p < 0.001). Self-reported measures overestimated MVPA (total MVPA, +108 min/day, p < 0.001; MVPA > 10 min bouts, +152 min, p < 0.001) and underestimated SB (-174 min/day, p < 0.001) compared to objective measures. There was no significant correlation between methods in MVPA (Spearman rho = 0.147, p = 0.165)), MVPA > 10 min bouts (Spearman rho = -0.059, p = 576), and SB (Spearman rho = 0.139, p = 0.187). Quantitative analysis demonstrated the huge proportional bias for MVPA, MVPA > 10 min bouts, and SB. Our findings demonstrate that self-reported physical activity provides inaccurate estimates of MVPA and SB in patients with CAD entering the ambulatory CR. This strongly supports the more objective assessments of daily PA, preferably using an accelerometer."

Participants were 30 children with cerebral palsy (10-18 y), with GMFCS I-III. Daily physical activity was measured with an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer in free living environment during seven consecutive days. The percent of time spent in sedentary, in moderate to vigorous physical activity and the number of steps per day were computed from the accelerometer data. Kinematics parameters did not correlate with physical activity. Moderate correlations were found between spatio-temporal parameters and physical activity, for instance timing of toe-off (r = -0.40, p = 0.03).

This study aimed to determine whether the use of an activity diary for goal setting during occupational therapy would reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical performance in patients after total knee arthroplasty.\n## METHODS\nA total of 41 total knee arthroplasty participants from two cohorts were recruited in the study and allocated by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n = 20) or the control group (n = 21). Occupational therapy intervention (1-2 weeks postoperatively) to promote goal achievement was performed in both groups, and self-monitoring was performed in the diary group by using the activity diary. The outcome indices were Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, pain (resting pain, walking pain), pain catastrophizing (rumination, helplessness, and magnification), anxiety, depression, pain self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Data were evaluated by using analysis of variance analyses with post hoc tests.\n## RESULTS\nA time-by-group interaction emerged for Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and physical activity level (p < 0.05), both favouring the diary group. The diary group also showed greater improvement in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, anxiety, and physical activity levels at four weeks postoperatively, compared to the control group (p < 0.05).\n## CONCLUSION\nThe use of the activity diary in this study increased occupational therapy effectiveness, reduced patients' pain, and prevented a decline in physical performance.

Eighteen COPD patients with NAID (ferritin <100 ng/mL or ferritin 100-299 ng/mL with a transferrin saturation <20%) and 18 COPD patients without this abnormality, matched for age, gender, and the degree of airflow limitation (control group), were enrolled to the study. The primary outcome was the level of DPA assessed by accelerometers. Patients were (mean [SD]) 66 (7) years and were mostly male (70%) and former smokers (52%). Their forced expiratory volume at 1 second was 41 (16)% predicted, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was 47 (14)% predicted and oxygen arterial pressure reached 70 (11) mmHg. DPA and the number of steps per day were lower in NAID COPD patients compared with controls (physical activity level 1.39 vs 1.59, P<0.05; and 4,402 vs 6,975 steps/day, P<0.05, respectively). The percentage of patients with increased time spent sitting per day (>6 hours) was higher in patients with NAID compared with controls (73% vs 37%, P<0.05). In addition, the percentage of patients doing moderate to vigorous physical activity per day (>3 metabolic equivalents of task, at least 30 minutes) was lower in this group (66% vs 100%, P<0.05). The presence of iron deficiency was associated with reduced DPA in COPD patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate iron reposition and their impact on the level of physical activity in these patients."

            "abstract": "The 40-Something RCT aimed to determine if a 12-month health professional-led intervention could modify diet and physical activity behaviour for obesity prevention, in 44-50 year old, non-obese (BMI = 18.5-29.9 kg/m(2)) premenopausal women. Women were monitored for an additional 12 months to determine if effects could be maintained. This paper aimed to explore dietary and physical activity behavioural mediators hypothesised to be causally associated with weight change. Fifty-four women were randomised to a Motivational Interviewing Intervention (MI) (n = 28; five health professional consultations) or a Self-Directed Intervention (n = 26; written advice). Compliance to 10 study recommendations was measured at three months by a four-day weighed food and physical activity record including pedometer-measured step counts, self-reported exercise minutes and sitting time. The 10 compliance scores were independently assessed in mediation models for 12- and 24-month weight change. The MI effect on step count was an increase of 0.99 points on the 10-point compliance scale (p ≤ 0.01). This MI effect on step count significantly mediated the 12 and 24 month effect on weight (12 months AB = -0.74, 95%CI = -1.95, -0.14; 24 months AB = -1.06, 95% CI = -2.56, -0.36), accounting for 37.23% and 53.79% of the effect, respectively. The MI effect on vegetable serves was an increase of 1.50 points on the compliance scale (p = 0.02). The MI effect on vegetable compliance significantly mediated the effect on weight at 24 months (AB = -0.54, 95% CI = -1.50, -0.04), accounting for 24.92% of the effect. The remaining eight dietary and physical activity compliance scores did not significantly mediate weight loss. Encouraging women to take 10,000 steps and eat five vegetable serves per day may be a promising strategy to achieve long-term weight control at mid-life."

It has been observed that despite near-normal lung function, exercise intolerance and reductions in quality of life (QOL) often persist up to years after transplantation. Several modifiable pre- and posttransplant factors are known to contribute to these persisting impairments. Physiological changes associated with severe and chronic lung disease, limb muscle dysfunction, inactivity/deconditioning, and nutritional depletion can affect exercise capacity and physical functioning in candidates for lung transplantation. After transplantation, extended hospital and intensive care unit stay, prolonged sedentary time, persisting inactivity, immunosuppressant medications and episodes of organ rejection may all impact lung recipients' recovery. Available evidence will be reviewed and content will be proposed (both evidence and experience based) for rehabilitation interventions prior to transplantation, during hospitalization after transplantation, and in both the immediate (≤12 months after hospital discharge) and long-term (>12 months after hospital discharge) posttransplant phase. Outpatient rehabilitation programs including supervised exercise training have been shown to be effective in improving limb muscle dysfunction, exercise capacity, and QOL both before and after transplantation if offered appropriately. Unmet research needs included the absence of sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials measuring the effects of rehabilitation interventions on crucial long-term outcomes such as sustained improvements in QOL, participation in daily activity, survival, incidence of morbidities and cost-effectiveness. Remotely monitored (telehealth) home-based exercise or pedometer-based walking interventions might be interesting alternatives to supervised outpatient rehabilitation interventions in the long-term posttransplant phase and warrant further investigation."

Additionally, associations between ST and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were examined.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from 736 women and 655 men age 43 to 82 yr were analyzed. Participants wore the Actigraph GT3X for 7 d on two occasions approximately 6 months apart, and the average of the measurements was used. Physical activity energy expenditure was estimated by subtracting resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food from doubly labeled water estimates of total daily energy expenditure. Cross-sectional associations were analyzed using isotemporal substitution modeling.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Reallocation of prolonged ST to nonprolonged was not associated with increased PAEE and only significantly associated with lower BMI (β = -0.57 kg·m; 95% confidence interval, -0.94 to -0.20) and waist circumference (β = -1.61 cm; 95% confidence interval, -2.61 to -0.60) in men. Replacing either type of ST with light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was significantly associated with higher PAEE, and lower BMI and waist circumference in both women and men.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Limiting time spent sedentary as well as decreasing ST accumulated in prolonged bouts may have beneficial effects on BMI and waist circumference. Replacing any type of ST with activities of light or higher intensity may also have a substantial impact on PAEE."

            "abstract": "With the addition of variable bed speed capabilities, continuous bed motion (CBM) becomes an acquisition generalization for axial sensitivity modeling and therefore a flexible tool in axial local image quality adjustment. In this paper, we describe the principles behind CBM mode planning and its influence on image reconstruction. The data correction method underwent the most changes compared to the commonly used step and shoot (S&S) mode. The CBM normalization array accommodates for activity decay, dead time correction, and the fact that various detector pairs acquire the same data for different durations. The normalization array is computed by simulating the movement of an object through the scanner, assisted by the monitoring of basic scanner acquisition parameters such as the singles rate. The sensitivity, which is the number of counts acquired per image plane, is an intrinsic part of normalization computing. Basic equations to estimate acquisition time at matched sensitivity between single speed CBM and S&S mode are presented. The CBM feature was implemented on a Siemens clinical scanner and initial studies of phantoms and patients are presented. The equivalence of single speed CBM and S&S image quality is demonstrated."

            "title": "Increased daily physical activity and fatigue symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome.",
            "abstract": "Individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been shown to have reduced activity levels associated with heightened feelings of fatigue. Previous research has demonstrated that exercise training has beneficial effects on fatigue-related symptoms in individuals with CFS. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to sustain an increase in daily physical activity in CFS patients for 4 weeks and assess the effects on fatigue, muscle pain and overall mood. METHODS: Six CFS and seven sedentary controls were studied. Daily activity was assessed by a CSA accelerometer. Following a two week baseline period, CFS subjects were asked to increase their daily physical activity by 30% over baseline by walking a prescribed amount each day for a period of four weeks. Fatigue, muscle pain and overall mood were reported daily using a 0 to 100 visual analog scale and weekly using the Profile of Mood States (Bipolar) questionnaire. RESULTS: CFS patients had significantly lower daily activity counts than controls (162.5 +/- 51.7 x 103 counts/day vs. 267.2 +/- 79.5 x 103 counts/day) during a 2-week baseline period. At baseline, the CFS patients reported significantly (P < 0.01) higher fatigue and muscle pain intensity compared to controls but the groups did not differ in overall mood. CFS subjects increased their daily activity by 28 +/- 19.7% over a 4 week period. Overall mood and muscle pain worsened in the CFS patients with increased activity. CONCLUSION: CFS patients were able to increase their daily physical activity for a period of four weeks. In contrast to previous studies fatigue, muscle pain, and overall mood did not improve with increased activity. Increased activity was not presented as a treatment which may account for the differential findings between this and previous studies. The results suggest that a daily \"activity limit\" may exist in this population. Future studies on the impact of physical activity on the symptoms of CFS patients are needed."

Two primary care 12-week pedometer-based walking interventions in adults and older adults (PACE-UP and PACE-Lift) found sustained objectively measured PA increases at 3 and 4 years, respectively. We aimed to evaluate trial intervention effects on long-term health outcomes relevant to walking interventions, using routine primary care data.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      Randomisation was from October 2012 to November 2013 for PACE-UP participants from seven general (family) practices and October 2011 to October 2012 for PACE-Lift participants from three practices. We downloaded primary care data, masked to intervention or control status, for 1,001 PACE-UP participants aged 45-75 years, 36% (361) male, and 296 PACE-Lift participants, aged 60-75 years, 46% (138) male, who gave written informed consent, for 4-year periods following randomisation. The following new events were counted for all participants, including those with preexisting diseases (apart from diabetes, for which existing cases were excluded): nonfatal cardiovascular, total cardiovascular (including fatal), incident diabetes, depression, fractures, and falls. Intervention effects on time to first event post-randomisation were modelled using Cox regression for all outcomes, except for falls, which used negative binomial regression to allow for multiple events, adjusting for age, sex, and study. Absolute risk reductions (ARRs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were estimated. Data were downloaded for 1,297 (98%) of 1,321 trial participants. Event rates were low (<20 per group) for outcomes, apart from fractures and falls. Cox hazard ratios for time to first event post-randomisation for interventions versus controls were nonfatal cardiovascular 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.77, p = 0.02), total cardiovascular 0.34 (95% CI 0.12-0.91, p = 0.03), diabetes 0.75 (95% CI 0.42-1.36, p = 0.34), depression 0.98 (95% CI 0.46-2.07, p = 0.96), and fractures 0.56 (95% CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.02). Negative binomial incident rate ratio for falls was 1.07 (95% CI 0.78-1.46, p = 0.67). ARR and NNT for cardiovascular events were nonfatal 1.7% (95% CI 0.5%-2.1%), NNT = 59 (95% CI 48-194); total 1.6% (95% CI 0.2%-2.2%), NNT = 61 (95% CI 46-472); and for fractures 3.6% (95% CI 0.8%-5.4%), NNT = 28 (95% CI 19-125). Main limitations were that event rates were low and only events recorded in primary care records were counted; however, any underrecording would not have differed by intervention status and so should not have led to bias.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Routine primary care data used to assess long-term trial outcomes demonstrated significantly fewer new cardiovascular events and fractures in intervention participants at 4 years. No statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups were demonstrated for other events. Short-term primary care pedometer-based walking interventions can produce long-term health benefits and should be more widely used to help address the public health inactivity challenge.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registrations:\n        \n      \n      PACE-UP isrctn.com ISRCTN98538934; PACE-Lift isrctn.com ISRCTN42122561."

There has been interest in addressing this problem by the 'mHealth', or mobile Health, arena, which is concerned with the confluence of mobile technology and health promotion. The newer generation of activity pedometers has the ability to automatically upload information, to enable aggregation and meta-data analysis of individual patient data. We conducted a ten-week pilot trial of the Fitbit Zip® pedometer using a validated tool in ten volunteers, finding it highly acceptable to both participants and investigators. Data synching was ranked as 'very easy' or 'easy' by all participants, and investigators could successfully monitor activity levels remotely. Median (interquartile range) daily step counts of participants over the ten-week trial ranged from 5471 (4591-7026) to 18779 (15031-21505) steps. Sedentary time over the study period ranged from 1.4% to 33.3% of study days. Percentage of days reaching the target activity level of >10,000 steps/day varied markedly between participants from 4.5% to 95.7%. This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely monitored pedometer-guided physical activity intervention. This technology may be useful to encourage increased exercise as a form of 'prehabilitation' of adequately screened at-risk surgical or obstetric patients."

Such associations, however, vary greatly across studies in pediatric populations, with no studies involving infants found in the literature. This prospective observational study was designed, therefore, to examine the association between physical activity and sleep patterns in infants. A total of 183 healthy infants aged 6 months wore an actigraph for 7 days to measure physical activity and sleep. Parents and caregivers completed a sleep-activity diary over the same period documenting the different types of infant activities. Daily mean time spent in screen-time-or-limited physical activity, including screen-based (e.g., watching television or other electronic devices) and non-screen based activity (e.g., quiet play or restricted infant movement when carried by caregivers or seated in high chairs, swings, or bouncer seats), was 6.68 hr (SD = 1.99), which represented 47.50% of daytime waking hours (SD = 13.73). We found that 65 (35.5%) infants engaged in some screen time during the study, with 10 (5.5%) infants having an average daily screen time >30 min. In our multivariate linear regression model, more hours of screen-time-or-limited physical activity per day were significantly associated with a decrease in total daily 24 hr sleep duration (p < 0.01). Findings from our study suggest that reducing screen-time-or-limited physical activity might be an approach for promoting adequate sleep and lengthening infant daily sleep duration."

The average claudicating patient takes 3586 steps per day at an average intensity of 1.77 metabolic equivalents of task (METs, a physiological measure expressing the energy cost of physical activities). Average physical activity intensity and peak intensity fluctuate very little during the day, and they rarely exceed the level of light activity (light = <3 METs maximum effort, such as casual walking or light housework).

            "abstract": "Different aspects of the daily movement pattern--sitting, light intensity physical activity, and moderate- and vigorous intensity physical activity--have each independently been associated with health and longevity. Previous knowledge of the amount and distribution of these aspects in the general Swedish population, as well as the fulfilment rate of physical activity recommendations, mainly relies on self-reported data. More detailed data assessed with objective methods is needed. The aim of the study was to present descriptive data on the daily movement pattern in a middle-aged Swedish population assessed by hip-worn accelerometers. The cohort consisted of 948 participants (51% women), aged 50 to 64 years, from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage pilot Study. In the total sample, 60.5% of accelerometer wear time was spent sitting, 35.2% in light physical activity and 3.9% in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Men and participants with high educational level spent a larger proportion of time sitting, compared to women and participants with low educational level. Men and participants with a high educational level spent more time, and the oldest age-group spent less time, in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Only 7.1% of the study population met the current national physical activity recommendations, with no gender, age or education level differences. Assessment of all three components of the daily movement pattern is of high clinical relevance and should be included in future research. As the fulfilment of national physical activity recommendations is very low and sitting time is very high in our middle-aged population, the great challenge remains to enhance the implementation of methods to increase the level of physical activity in this population."

At both time-points, anthropometry, lower limbs muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer), balance in bipedal stance (force platform), daily physical activity (accelerometry), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, there were no differences between CG and IG for all parameters analyzed.

Muscle strength displayed a divergent evolution 6 months after BS, with a decrease in absolute strength but an increase in relative strength. Although BS did not induce significant changes in time spent in different physical activity intensities, it decreased time in sedentary behavior and increased number of daily steps.

            "abstract": "Exercise capacity and physical activity are different concepts: the former refers to what an individual is capable of performing, while the latter refers to what the individual does in daily life. Low levels of physical activity (PA), which are very common in individuals with COPD, are associated with poor health outcomes, including increased symptoms, a more rapid decline in lung function, increased health care utilization and increased mortality risk. Because of these pervasive negative outcomes, attempts have been made to increase physical activity in individuals with COPD, hoping that success in this area will mitigate the negative effects of inactivity. Based on its ability to increase exercise capacity and reduce dyspnea in COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) would be expected also increase physical activity in these patients. However, accessibility to pulmonary rehabilitation programs is problematic in some areas, and studies testing its effectiveness in this outcome area have had inconsistent results. Using telehealth interventions using technology to provide medical care conveniently over a distance would have the benefit of reaching a larger proportion of individuals with COPD. A systematic review of clinical trials testing telehealth to promote physical activity had mixed results and low-certainty evidence, resulting in the inability to recommend any single type of intervention. Thus, using telehealth interventions to promote physical activity for individuals with chronic respiratory diseases, while promising, remains an area where future investigations are needed to identify its optimal modalities and clarify its benefits."

The purpose of this study was to characterise issues of safety and reproducibility arising in TUG tests.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our population was 7 hospitalised patients (4 men, 3 women) with PD and 1 healthy control.

The typical PD patient experienced freezing of gait when rounding the reflective cone marker in the TUG test, and after turning, experienced gait festination. The patient thus encountered difficulty in using the reflective marker. Moreover, because of the characteristic PD shuffling gait, the patient's steps were difficult to count automatically. After the turn, the patient's body leaned heavily; however, if the physiotherapist or the robot applied a light force in the direction of the positive axis, it was possible to prevent a fall.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      When applied to patients with PD, the TUG test requires modifications for safety and more accurate step counting to improve reproducibility.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe presence of a sense of security with the attendant or the robot is related to walking speed.The TUG test must be reproducible in patients with PD, regardless of whether there is a rhythm or an attendant, and must be able to count the steps in a shuffling gait.The TUG test must consider safety in patients with PD, because it is easier to fall after a turn and when sitting on a chair, and it is instructed to be in hurry walk.After making a turn, a patient's body may lean heavily; however, if a physiotherapist or a Yorisoi (snuggling nursing robot) robot applies a light force in the direction of the positive axis, it is possible to prevent a fall.Assertive technology, such as the Yorisoi robot, may be used to improve the safety TUG test in patients with PD."

            "title": "Are patients with knee osteoarthritis and patients with knee joint replacement as physically active as healthy persons?",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      It is well documented that patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) suffer from reduced physical function and that function of the affected knee is improved after knee joint replacement (KJR). However, it remains uncertain whether patients with KOA are less physically active than healthy people and whether patients increase their level of physical activity after surgery to a level comparable with that of healthy people. The aim of this study was to examine whether patients with KOA are less physically active than healthy participants and whether patients who have undergone KJR show an increased activity and achieve the same level of physical activity as healthy participants 5 years postoperatively.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-four patients with KOA (29 women; mean age 62 ± 8.6; mean body mass index (BMI) 27 ± 5), 52 patients who had KJR due to KOA 5 years earlier (26 women; mean age 66 ± 7.2; mean BMI 30 ± 5) and 171 healthy participants (76 women, mean age 64 ± 9.7, mean BMI 26 ± 5) were included in this cross-sectional study. The level of physical activity was measured over a mean period of 5.5 days with a triaxial accelerometer mounted on the thigh. Number of daily steps, number of daily short walking bouts of <10 s duration and number of daily transfers from sitting to standing position were recorded. Data were analysed using two sample t tests and were adjusted for age, gender and BMI.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients with KOA did not differ significantly from healthy participants regarding daily steps (+321, p = 0.50) or daily transfers from sitting to standing (+1.9, p = 0.52) but performed significantly less daily short walking bouts <10 s (-11.9, p = 0.02). Patients after KJR did not differ significantly from healthy participants regarding daily steps (-281, p = 0.60) of transfers from sitting to standing position (-3.2, p = 0.32) but performed significantly less daily short walking bouts <10 s (-21.7, p = 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients with KOA and KJR showed no significant reduction in number of daily step counts and transfers from sitting to standing position when compared with matched healthy controls. However, the number of short walking bouts was reduced in patients with KOA and by twice as much in patients with KJR. This indicates that KOA and treatment with KJR hardly affect health-related general activity but do affect specific physical activity behaviour potentially indicative of KOA or post-KJR functional limitations.\n    \n\n\n          The translational potential of this article:\n        \n      \n      Activity monitoring with an accelerometer-based method gives insights into health-related general activity levels such as total daily steps and specific parameters such as short walking bouts, which may serve as an objective outcome measure in clinical practice."

According to a Bland-Altman plot, the hourly step counts had a relative large mean bias across participants (161 step counts). The differences were partially explained by activity intensity: higher intensity denoted higher differences, and light intensity denoted lower differences.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Fitbit One step counts are comparable to Actigraph step counts in a sample of 9-10-year-old children engaged in habitual physical activity in sedentary and light physical activity intensities.

In the United States, individuals spend 55-70% of their waking day being sedentary. Since most individuals spend large portions of their daily lives at work, quantifying the time engaged in sedentary behavior at work is emerging as an important health determinant. Studies profiling academic institutions, where a variety of personnel with diverse job descriptions are employed, are limited. Available studies focus mostly on subjective methods, with few using objective approaches. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to assess sedentary behavior among all occupational groups of a college in the Northeastern United States utilizing both a subjective and an objective method.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      College employees (n = 367) completed the Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ). A sub-sample of these employees (n = 127) subsequently wore an activPAL3 accelerometer 24 h per day for seven consecutive days. Outcome variables were time spent sitting, standing, stepping, and total number of steps. To assess fragmentation of sedentary behavior, the average duration of a sitting bout and sitting bouts/sitting hour were calculated. Differences between administrators, faculty, and staff, were analyzed using multivariate and univariate analyses of variance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The OSPAQ results indicated that administrators spent more of their working day sedentary (73.2 ± 17.7%) than faculty members (58.5 ± 19.6%, p < 0.05). For the objective phase of the study, complete data were analyzed from 86 participants. During a waking day, administrators (64.0 ± 8.1%) were more sedentary than faculty (56.0 ± 7.9%, p < 0.05) and fragmented their sitting less than staff (3.7 ± 0.7 and 4.5 ± 7.9 bouts of sitting/sitting hour, respectively; p < 0.05). This pattern was also seen during working hours, with administrators (4.9 ± 2.1) taking fewer breaks per hour than staff (6.9 ± 3.0, p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Administrators are the most sedentary members of the campus community.

            "abstract": "Poor sleep is an increasingly recognised problem with chronic pain and further increases the effect on daily function. To identify the relationship between chronic pain, opioid analgesia and sleep quality, this study investigated activity and sleep patterns in patients taking opioid and non-opioid analgesia for chronic back pain. Thirty-one participants (10 healthy controls, 21 patients with chronic pain: 6 on non-opioid medication; 15 on opioid medication) were assessed using actigraphy, polysomnography and questionnaires. Patients with chronic pain subjectively reported significant sleep and wake disturbances as shown by decreased overall sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, p < 0.001), increased symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, p < 0.001) and increased fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, p = 0.002). They also spent increased time in bed (p = 0.016), took longer to get to sleep (p = 0.005) and had high interindividual variability in other measures of activity but no overall irregular rest-activity pattern. Patients on high doses of opioids (> 100 mg morphine-equivalent/day) demonstrated distinctly abnormal brain activity during sleep suggesting that polysomnography is necessary to detect sleep disturbance in this population in the absence of irregular rest-activity behaviour. Night-time sleep disturbance is common in individuals suffering from chronic pain and may be further exacerbated by opioid treatment. Considerations must be made regarding the appropriate use of combined actigraphy and miniaturised polysomnography for future population-based studies."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis as entire populations have been asked to self-isolate and live in home-confinement for several weeks to months, which in itself represents a physiological challenge with significant health risks. This paper describes the impact of sedentarism on the human body at the level of the muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and nervous systems and is based on evidence from several models of inactivity, including bed rest, unilateral limb suspension, and step-reduction. Data form these studies show that muscle wasting occurs rapidly, being detectable within two days of inactivity. This loss of muscle mass is associated with fibre denervation, neuromuscular junction damage and upregulation of protein breakdown, but is mostly explained by the suppression of muscle protein synthesis. Inactivity also affects glucose homeostasis as just few days of step reduction or bed rest, reduce insulin sensitivity, principally in muscle. Additionally, aerobic capacity is impaired at all levels of the O2 cascade, from the cardiovascular system, including peripheral circulation, to skeletal muscle oxidative function. Positive energy balance during physical inactivity is associated with fat deposition, associated with systemic inflammation and activation of antioxidant defences, exacerbating muscle loss. Importantly, these deleterious effects of inactivity can be diminished by routine exercise practice, but the exercise dose-response relationship is currently unknown. Nevertheless, low to medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise, easily implementable in home-settings, will have positive effects, particularly if combined with a 15-25% reduction in daily energy intake. This combined regimen seems ideal for preserving neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular health."

Seven days of free-living physical activity were measured simultaneously using both the Model 7164 and GT1M in 30 Indian adolescents (mean age 15.8 years, s = 0.6). The GT1M was on average 9% lower per epoch than model 7164, thus a correction factor of 0.91 is suggested for comparison between the two monitors. The differences between monitors increased in magnitude with intensity of activity (P < 0.001) but remained randomly distributed (r = 0.01, P = 0.96). No significant difference was observed between monitors for time spent in moderate (P = 0.31) and vigorous (P = 0.34) physical activity when using the same epoch length. The Model 7164 classified less time as sedentary (P < 0.001) and more time as light-intensity activity (P < 0.001) than the GT1M. In conclusion, data from the GT1M can be compared with historical data using average counts per minute with a correction factor, and the two models might be comparable for assessing time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity in children when using the same epoch length."

            "abstract": "Outcome evaluations of lower extremity joint reconstructions should include an assessment of patient activity. In vivo wear assessments of total joint prostheses should be based on a measure of use, not time in situ or a proxy such as age or gender; however, clinicians lack a simple method to reliably assess the activity of patients with joint replacement. The modern pedometer can be a satisfactory means of quantifying the use of lower extremity joints. The pedometer, however, requires special effort on the part of the physician or evaluator and the patient. Therefore, we compared the quantitative assessment of walking activity of 100 total joint replacement patients, as measured with a pedometer, to the UCLA activity score and a simple visual analog scale that can easily be employed during a routine office evaluation. Both the UCLA activity rating (P = .002) and the visual analog scale rating of the investigator (P = .00001) had a strong correlation with the average steps per day as recorded by the pedometer. There was, however, up to a 15-fold difference in the average steps per day for individual patients with the same UCLA score. The visual analog scale as rated by the patients of their own activity did not have as strong a correlation with the pedometer data (P = .08) as did patient age (P = .049). For practical reasons, the pedometer is probably best reserved for the evaluation of extreme cases of activity (or inactivity). This study indicates that both the UCLA activity rating and the investigator visual analog scale are valid for routine activity assessment in a clinical setting. Adjustments of the UCLA activity score for the frequency and intensity of activity, as can be done with the investigator visual analog scale, increase the accuracy of the activity rating."

Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a variety of chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint diseases (eg, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis), depression, and colon and breast cancer. Population aging and the related increase in chronic diseases have a major impact on the health care systems of most Western countries and will produce an even more significant effect in the future. Monitoring PA is a valuable method of determining whether people are performing enough PA so as to prevent chronic diseases or are showing early symptoms of those diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants aged 70 to 90 years with the ability to walk safely without any walking aid for at least 300 meters, who had no walking disabilities or episodes of falling while walking in the last 12 months, were asked to walk 150 meters at their preferred pace wearing a vívoactive HR device (Garmin Ltd) and actual steps were monitored and tallied by a researcher using a hand-tally counter to assess the performance of the device at a natural speed. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the difference between manually counted steps and wearable device-measured steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed (with a 95% confidence interval) between step measurements. The generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) ICCs were estimated, providing a random effect term (random intercept) for the individual measurements (gold standard and device).

Participants were encouraged to walk daily at a moderate intensity in bouts ≥ 10 minutes during morning hours to overcome time-related obstacles and establish a PA habit.

At postintervention, a greater proportion of participants whose longest MVPA bouts occurred during morning hours (n = 11) achieved the public health guideline (ie, ≥150 bout-related MVPA minutes/week) versus those whose longest MVPA bouts occurred during nonmorning hours (n = 19; 63.6% vs. 26.3%, P = .04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Intervention-related increases in PA tended to be greatest when PA was performed in the morning.

BED showed high reliability for identification of long term infections while LAg-Avidity is highly accurate for identification of recent infections. Using BED as initial assay to identify the long term infections and LAg-Avidity as a confirmatory assay for those classified as recent infection by BED, explores the strengths of both while reduces the workload. The short recency window of p31 antibodies allows to discriminate very early from early infections based on this marker. BED recent infection results not confirmed by LAg-Avidity are considered to reflect a period more distant from the infection time. False recency predictions in this group can be minimized by elimination of patients with a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/mm3 or without no p31 antibodies. For 566 cross sectional sample the outcome of the decision tree confirmed the infection timing based on the results of all 3 markers but reduced the overall cost from 13.2 USD to 5.2 USD per sample.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A step-wise multi assay decision tree allows accurate timing of the HIV infection at diagnosis at affordable effort and cost and can be an important new tool in studies analyzing the dynamics of local epidemics or the effects of prevention strategies."

Notably, 6 distinct domains of physical function and sleep are identified to represent the objective temporal patterns: ''activity capacity'' and ''moderate and overall activity (declined immediately after surgery); ''sleep disruption and sedentary activity (increased after surgery); ''overall sleep'', ''sleep onset'', and ''light activity'' (no clear changes were observed after surgery). These patterns can be linked to individual patients preopera-tive immune state using cross-validated canonical-correlation analysis. Importantly, the pSTAT3 signal activity in monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells predicted a slower recovery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Accelerometry-based recovery trajectories are scalable and objective outcomes to study patient-specific factors that drive physical recovery."

There are minimal medical care and personal trainers' methods to monitor a patient's actual physical activity types. To improve activity monitoring, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach to classify physical movement activity patterns. In more detail, we employ two deep learning (DL) methods, namely a deep feed-forward neural network (DNN) and a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for this purpose. We evaluate the two models on two physical movement datasets collected from several volunteers who carried tri-axial accelerometer sensors. The first dataset is from the UCI machine learning repository, which contains 14 different activities-of-daily-life (ADL) and is collected from 16 volunteers who carried a single wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer. The second dataset includes ten other ADLs and is gathered from eight volunteers who placed the sensors on their hips. Our experiment results show that the RNN model provides accurate performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in classifying the fundamental movement patterns with an overall accuracy of 84.89% and an overall F1-score of 82.56%. The results indicate that our method provides the medical doctors and trainers a promising way to track and understand a patient's physical activities precisely for better treatment."

We explored cross-sectional associations of PA and SED in varying time segments throughout the school day with the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents from rural Northeastern Ontario, Canada. A total of 161 students (56% female, M = 10.3 years old) wore accelerometers for 8 days (7 nights) and completed a self-report survey (parent reported for children younger than 11). Mental health was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Accelerometer-measured SED, light PA (LPA), and moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA) were estimated in the time-segments before school (06:00-08:44), school time (08:45-15:04), after school (15:05-16:59), and evenings (17:00-21:59). Associations were tested with multilevel linear regressions while adjusting for confounding factors. Students spent 72.6 min in MVPA, 209.0 min in LPA, and 621.0 min in SED per day. Daily SED was associated with less conduct problems (β = -0.27, p < 0.05).

However, children with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) have been understudied. Accelerometers are commonly used to measure SB in typically developing populations but may be inappropriate for IDD populations due to differences in body movement and physiologic responses to the activity.

Trunk movements were measured as an outcome of disturbed gait. The vertical asymmetry index especially was able to differentiate between persons with stroke and healthy controls. Persons with stroke showed less ambulatory activity, measured as steps per day, than sedentary controls. Triaxial accelerometry was able to distinguish between varying activity levels. Upper-extremity use was lesser in persons with stroke. It was impossible to calculate a minimal clinical difference for arm use by a uniaxial accelerometer.

If unable to meet the recommendations due to health conditions, international guidance advises being as physically active as possible. Evidence from community interventions of physical activity indicate that people living with medical conditions are sometimes excluded from participation in studies. In this review, we considered the effects of activity-promoting interventions on physical activity and well-being in studies, as well as any adverse events experienced by participants living with inherited or acquired neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions designed to promote physical activity in people with NMD compared with no intervention or alternative interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      On 30 April 2020, we searched Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.Gov. WHO ICTRP was not accessible at the time.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials, including cross-over trials, of interventions designed to promote physical activity in people with NMD compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. We specifically included studies that reported physical activity as an outcome measure. Our main focus was studies in which promoting physical activity was a stated aim but we also included studies in which physical activity was assessed as a secondary or exploratory outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard Cochrane procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      The review included 13 studies (795 randomised participants from 12 studies; number of participants unclear in one study) of different interventions to promote physical activity. Most studies randomised a minority of invited participants. No study involved children or adolescents and nine studies reported minimal entry criteria for walking. Participants had one of nine inherited or acquired NMDs. Types of intervention included structured physical activity support, exercise support (as a specific form of physical activity), and behaviour change support that included physical activity or exercise. Only one included study clearly reported that the aim of intervention was to increase physical activity. Other studies reported or planned to analyse the effects of intervention on physical activity as a secondary or exploratory outcome measure. Six studies did not report results for physical activity outcomes, or the data were not usable. We judged 10 of the 13 included studies at high or unclear risk of bias from incomplete physical activity outcome reporting. We did not perform a meta-analysis for any comparison because of differences in interventions and in usual care. We also found considerable variation in how studies reported physical activity as an outcome measure. The studies that reported physical activity measurement did not always clearly report intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis or whether final assessments occurred during or after intervention. Based on prespecified measures, we included three comparisons in our summary of findings. A physical activity programme (weight-bearing) compared to no physical activity programme One study involved adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and reported weekly duration of walking during and at the end of a one-year intervention using a StepWatch ankle accelerometer. Based on the point estimate and low-certainty evidence, intervention may have led to an important increase in physical activity per week; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) included the possibility of no difference or an effect in either direction at three months (mean difference (MD) 34 minutes per week, 95% CI -92.19 to 160.19; 69 participants), six months (MD 68 minutes per week, 95% CI -55.35 to 191.35; 74 participants), and 12 months (MD 49 minutes per week, 95% CI -75.73 to 173.73; 70 participants). Study-reported effect estimates for foot lesions and full-thickness ulcers also included the possibility of no difference, a higher, or lower risk with intervention. A sensor-based, interactive exercise programme compared to no sensor-based, interactive exercise programme One study involved adults with DPN and reported duration of walking over 48 hours at the end of four weeks' intervention using a t-shirt embedded PAMSys sensor. It was not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention from the very low-certainty evidence (MD -0.64 hours per 48 hours, 95% CI -2.42 to 1.13; 25 participants). We were also unable to draw conclusions about impact on the Physical Component Score (PCS) for quality of life (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI -5.98 to 6.46; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although intervention may have made little or no difference to the Mental Component Score (MCS) for quality of life (MD 5.10 points, 95% CI -0.58 to 10.78; 35 participants; low-certainty evidence). A functional exercise programme compared to a stretching exercise programme One study involved adults with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and reported a daily physical activity count at the end of 12 weeks' intervention using an Actical accelerometer. It was not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of either intervention (requiring compliance) due to low-certainty evidence and unconfirmed measurement units (MD -8701, 95% CI -38,293.30 to 20,891.30; 43 participants). Functional exercise may have made little or no difference to quality of life compared to stretching (PCS: MD -1.10 points, 95% CI -5.22 to 3.02; MCS: MD -1.10 points, 95% CI -6.79 to 4.59; 49 participants; low-certainty evidence). Although studies reported adverse events incompletely, we found no evidence of supported activity increasing the risk of serious adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found a lack of evidence relating to children, adolescents, and non-ambulant people of any age. Many people living with NMD did not meet randomised controlled trial eligibility criteria. There was variation in the components of supported activity intervention and usual care, such as physical therapy provision. We identified variation among studies in how physical activity was monitored, analysed, and reported. We remain uncertain of the effectiveness of promotional intervention for physical activity and its impact on quality of life and adverse events. More information is needed on the ITT population, as well as more complete reporting of outcomes. While there may be no single objective measure of physical activity, the study of qualitative and dichotomous change in self-reported overall physical activity might offer a pragmatic approach to capturing important change at an individual and population level."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Physical activity (PA) and exercise have become an accepted and valued component of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Regular PA and exercise can positively impact pulmonary function, improve physical fitness, and enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, motivating people to be more active is challenging. Supervised exercise programs are expensive and labour intensive, and adherence falls off significantly once supervision ends. Unsupervised or partially supervised programs are less costly and more flexible, but compliance can be more problematic. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a partially supervised exercise intervention along with regular motivation on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at 6 months in a large international group of CF patients. Secondary endpoints include patient reported HRQoL, as well as levels of anxiety and depression, and control of blood sugar.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      It is planned that a total of 292 patients with CF 12 years and older with a FEV1 ≥ 35% predicted shall be randomised. Following baseline assessments (2 visits) patients are randomised into an intervention and a control group. Thereafter, they will be seen every 3 months for assessments in their centre for one year (4 follow-up visits). Along with individual counselling to increase vigorous PA by at least 3 h per week on each clinic visit, the intervention group documents daily PA and inactivity time and receives a step counter to record their progress within a web-based diary. They also receive monthly phone calls from the study staff during the first 6 months of the study. After 6 months, they continue with the step counter and web-based programme for a further 6 months. The control group receives standard care and keeps their PA level constant during the study period. Thereafter, they receive the intervention as well.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first large, international multi-centre study to investigate the effects of a PA intervention in CF with motivational feedback on several health outcomes using modern technology.

            "abstract": "Increased physical activity (PA) has been associated with a decreased risk for the occurrence and recurrence of many cancers. PA is an important outcome measure in rehabilitation interventions within cancer and may be used as a proxy measure of recovery or deterioration in health status following treatment and in the palliative care setting. PA is a complex multi-dimensional construct which is challenging to measure accurately. Factors such as technical precision and feasibility influence the choice of PA measurement tool. Laboratory-based methods are precise and mainly used for validation purposes, but their clinical applicability is limited. Self-report methods such as questionnaires are widely used due to their simplicity and reasonable cost; however, accuracy can be questionable. Objective methods such as pedometers measure step count but do not measure intensity, frequency or duration of activity. Accelerometers can measure PA behaviour at both ends of the movement spectrum from sedentary to vigorous levels of activity and can also provide objective data about the frequency, intensity, type and duration of PA. Balancing precision with ease of use, accelerometry may be the best measure of PA in cancer-based studies, but only a small number of studies have incorporated this measurement. This review will provide a background to PA and an overview of accelerometer measurement as well as technical and practical considerations, so this useful tool could be more widely incorporated into clinical trial research within cancer."

Significant positive associations were identified within 7 of 12 study sites, with differences ranging from 4.6 min (95% CI: 0.3-8.9; P=0.04, in Canada) to 10.2 min (95% CI: 5.9-14.4; P<0.0001, in Brazil) more of daily MVPA among children who engaged in AST compared with motorized transport.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The present study demonstrated that AST was associated with children spending more time engaged in MVPA throughout the day and less time in LPA before school.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, 29 women with pSS were objectively assessed for habitual physical activity levels (using accelerometry) and compared with 20 healthy women (CTRL) frequency-matched for physical activity levels, age, body mass index, and body fat percentage with regard to physical capacity and function, fatigue, depression, pain, and health-related quality of life. Results pSS showed 8.5 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) when only MVPA accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min was considered; when considering total MVPA (including bouts < 10 min), average levels were 26.3 min/day, with 62% of pSS patients achieving the recommendation (≥ 21.4 min/day). Moreover, pSS showed lower VO2peak, lower muscle strength and function, higher fatigue, and poorer health-related quality of life when compared with CTRL ( p < 0.05). These differences (except for aerobic capacity) were sustained even when only individuals achieving the minimum of 21.4 min/day of total MVPA in both groups were compared. Finally, MVPA time was significantly correlated with aerobic conditioning, whereas total counts and sedentary time were associated with lower-body muscle strength and the bodily-pain domain of SF-36 in patients with pSS. Conclusion When compared to physical activity-matched healthy controls, pSS patients showed reduced physical capacity and function, increased fatigue and pain, and reduced health-related quality of life. Except for aerobic conditioning, these differences were sustained when only more physically active participants were compared, indicating that minimum recommended levels of physical activity for the general population may not be sufficient to counteract pSS comorbidities."

Therefore, it should be clinically assessed as a vital sign of patients' general physical condition prior to any exercise-based intervention. This cross-sectional study describes physical activity in the daily life of 100 chronic respiratory patients before pulmonary rehabilitation, comparing subjective and objective measures. The assessment combined the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 4-day accelerometer and oximeter telemonitoring with SMARTREAB technology, assessing heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation and activity-related energy expenditure by metabolic equivalent of task (MET). According to IPAQ, 49% of patients had a moderate level of physical activity in daily life (PADL), a weekly mean level of 2844 ± 2925 MET.min/week, and a mean sedentary time of 5.8 ± 2.7 h/day. Alongside this, SMARTREAB telemonitoring assessed maximum activity ranging from 1.51 to 4.64 METs, with 99.6% daytime spent on PADL below 3 METs and 93% of patients with daily desaturation episodes. Regardless of the self-reported IPAQ, patients spend at least 70% of daytime on PADL below 2 METs. SMARTREAB was demonstrated to be an innovative methodology to measure PADL as a vital sign, combining oximetry with accelerometry, crossmatched with qualitative patient data, providing important input for designing patient-tailored pulmonary rehabilitation."

Several methods have been proposed for the automatic, unsupervised detection and classification of levodopa induced dyskinesia. Recently, we have demonstrated that neural networks are highly successful to detect dyskinesia and to distinguish dyskinesia from voluntary movements. The aim of this study was to use the trained neural networks to extract parameters, which are important to distinguish between dyskinesia and voluntary movements. Thirteen patients were continuously monitored in a home-like situation performing in about 35 daily life tasks for a period of approximately 2.5 h. Behavior of the patients was measured using triaxial accelerometers, which were placed at six different positions of the body. A neural network was trained to assess the severity of dyskinesia. The neural network was able to assess the severity of dyskinesia and could distinguish dyskinesia from voluntary movements in daily life. For the trunk and the leg, the important parameters appeared to be the percentage of time that the trunk or leg was moving and the standard deviation of the segment velocity of the less dyskinetic leg. For the arm, the combination of the percentage of time, that the wrist was moving, and the percentage of time, that a patient was sitting, explained the largest part of the variance of the output. Dyskinesia differs from voluntary movements in the fact that dyskinetic movements tend to have lower frequencies than voluntary movements and in the fact that movements of different body segments are not well coordinated in dyskinesia."

This analysis examined changes in light, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time, and the association between changes in MVPA and weight loss in adolescents and young adults with IDD and overweight and obesity participating in a 6-month multi-component weight loss intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Adolescents and young adults with IDD and overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 85 percentile, n = 110, age ~16 years, 52.7% female) and a parent were randomised to one of three intervention groups: face-to-face delivery/conventional reduced energy diet (n = 36), remote delivery (RD)/conventional reduced energy diet (n = 39), or RD/reduced energy enhanced stop light diet (eSLD) (n = 35.) Participants were asked to engage in 60 min/day of MVPA on 5 or more days/wk. Participants and a parent attended twice monthly education/behavioural counselling sessions with a health educator to assist participants in complying with dietary and MVPA recommendations. Education/counselling in the RD arms was delivered remotely using video conferencing, and self-monitoring of MVPA and daily steps was completed using a wireless activity tracker. Education/counselling in the face-to-face arm was delivered during home-visits and self-monitoring of MVPA and daily steps was completed by self-report using paper tracking forms designed for individuals with IDD. MVPA, light activity, and sedentary time were assessed over 7 days at baseline and 6 months using a portable accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3x-BT).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mixed modelling analysis completed using participants with valid accelerometer data (i.e. ≥4-10 h days) at baseline (n = 68) and 6 months (n = 30) revealed no significant changes in light, moderate- MVPA, or sedentary time across the 6-month intervention (all P > 0.05). Participants obtained 15.2 ± 21.5 min/day of MVPA at baseline and 19.7 ± 19.7 min/day at 6 months (P = 0.119). Mixed modelling indicated no significant effects of group (P = 0.79), time (P = 0.10), or group-by-time interaction (P = 0.21) on changes in MVPA from baseline to 6 months. Correlational analysis conducted on participants with valid accelerometer data at both baseline and 6 months (n = 24) revealed no significant associations between baseline sedentary time (r = 0.10, P = 0.40) and baseline MVPA (r = -0.22, P = 0.30) and change in MVPA across the 6-month intervention. Additionally, attendance at education/counselling sessions (r = 0.26, P = 0.22) and frequency of self-monitoring of MVPA were not significantly associated with change in MVPA from baseline to 6 months (r = 0.26, P = 0.44). Baseline MVPA (r = 0.02, P = 0.92) and change in MVPA from baseline to 6 months (r = 0.13, P = 0.30) were not associated with changes in body weight across the 6-month intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We observed a non-significant increase in MVPA (30%), which was not associated with the magnitude of weight loss in a sample of adolescents and young adults with IDD who participated in a 6-month multi-component weight loss intervention. Additional strategies to increase MVPA in adolescents and young adults with IDD participating in weight loss interventions need to be developed and evaluated."

The powerful onboard computing capacity of smartphones, along with the unique relationship individuals have with their mobile phones, suggests that mobile devices have the potential to influence behavior. However, no previous trials have been conducted using smartphone technology to promote physical activity. This project has the potential to provide robust evidence in this area of innovation.

After randomization, all participants will complete a baseline period of one week during which a baseline mean daily step count will be established. The intervention group will be instructed in the usability features of the smartphone application, will be encouraged to try to achieve 10,000 steps per day as an exercise goal and will be given an exercise promotion leaflet. The control group will be encouraged to try to walk an additional 30 minutes per day along with their normal activity (the equivalent of 10,000 steps) as an exercise goal and will be given an exercise promotion leaflet. The primary outcome is mean difference in daily step count between baseline and follow-up. Secondary outcomes are systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, mental health score using HADS and quality of life score using Euroqol. Randomization and allocation to the intervention and groups will be carried out by an independent researcher, ensuring the allocation sequence is concealed from the study researchers until the interventions are assigned. The primary analysis is based on mean daily step count, comparing the mean difference in daily step count between the baseline and the trial periods in the intervention and control groups at follow up."

Design The design of this study used a population-based, cross-sectional sample. Methods A subsample of participants in the Health 2011 Study in Finland used the tri-axial accelerometer (≥4 days, >10 h/day, n = 1398). Sedentary behaviour (sitting, lying) and standing still in six-second epochs were recognised from raw acceleration data based on intensity and device orientation. The intensity of physical activity was calculated as one-minute moving averages of mean amplitude deviation of resultant acceleration and converted to metabolic equivalents. Metabolic equivalents were categorised to light physical activity (1.5-2.9 metabolic equivalents) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity≥3.0 metabolic equivalents). Daily sedentary behaviour, standing still, light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were expressed as mean daily total time, accumulated time and number of different bouts (from 30 s to >30 min), mean daily metabolic equivalent and weekly peak metabolic equivalent levels of different bout lengths and number of breaks in sedentary behaviour. The ten-year cardiovascular disease risk was based on the Framingham risk model. Results The mean number of daily sedentary behaviour bouts was more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk than mean daily total time. In the best model, smaller waist circumference, greater value of mean daily metabolic equivalent levels of one-minute bouts, higher accumulated time of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity lasting ≤30 min, higher number of >5 min standing bouts and a higher number of long (>30 min) bouts of light physical activity were significantly associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk (R2 = 0.836). Conclusions The objectively measured number and accumulated time from different bout lengths of physical activity and sedentary behaviour were associated with cardiovascular disease risk, which is considered relevant for estimating cardiovascular diseases and for devising preventive actions."

A measure of CTS function in cancer patients could thus provide novel prediction information for outcomes, and help to identify novel specific therapies. The rest-activity circadian rhythm is a reliable and non-invasive CTS biomarker, which was monitored using a wrist watch accelerometer for 2 days in 436 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The relative percentage of activity in-bed versus out-of-bed (I < O) constituted the tested CTS measure, whose prognostic value for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was determined in a pooled analysis of three patient cohorts with different treatment exposures. Median OS was 21.6 months [17.8-25.5] for patients with I < O above the median value of 97.5% as compared to 11.9 months [10.4-13.3] for those with a lower I < O (Log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses retained continuous I < O as a joint predictor of both OS and PFS, with respective hazard ratios (HR) of 0.954 (p < 0.001) and 0.970 (p < 0.001) for each 1% increase in I < O. HRs had similar values in all the patient subgroups tested. The circadian physiology biomarker I < O constitutes a robust and independent quantitative predictor of cancer patient outcomes, that can be easily and cost-effectively measured during daily living. Interventional studies involving 24-h schedules of clock-targeted drugs, light intensity, exercise and/or meals are needed for testing the relevance of circadian synchronization for the survival of patients with disrupted rhythms."

            "abstract": "Large epidemiological studies that use accelerometers for physical behavior and sleep assessment differ in the location of the accelerometer attachment and the signal aggregation metric chosen. This study aimed to assess the comparability of acceleration metrics between commonly-used body-attachment locations for 24 hours, waking and sleeping hours, and to test comparability of PA cut points between dominant and non-dominant wrist. Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18-41 years) were included and GT3X + accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g (ENMO), Low-pass filtered ENMO (LFENMO), Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) and ActiGraph activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 36, 10 women, 22-30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r2: 0.19-0.97, all p < 0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on ENMO to classify sedentary time (<50 mg), light PA (50-110 mg), moderate PA (110-440 mg) and vigorous PA (≥440 mg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. ENMO and LFENMO were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with MAD. However, counts were not comparable with ENMO, LFENMO and MAD."

            "abstract": "Background: The importance of daily physical activity is crucial for healthy development during the early years. Currently, a formal written physical activity policy is lacking in Canadian childcare centers, but holds promise for offering consistent physical activity opportunities. With eight recommendations, the Childcare PLAY policy is an evidence-informed, institutional-level document, targeting children's physical activity, outdoor play, and sedentary time. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the Childcare Physical Activity (PLAY) policy on the physical activity and sedentary time of young children (18 months-4 years) in childcare. Methods: Nine childcare centers in London, Ontario participated in the cluster, randomized controlled trial. The centers in the control condition (n = 4) continued their typical daily routines, while the centers in the intervention condition (n = 5) implemented the PLAY policy for eight weeks. To assess physical activity levels, toddlers and preschoolers wore ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers for five consecutive days during childcare hours, at baseline, mid- and post-intervention, and at the six-month follow-up. Raw accelerometry data were converted to 15 s epochs, and age- and device-specific cut-points were applied. The participants with two or more days of at least 5 h/day of wear-time at baseline, and at one additional time point, were included in the linear mixed-effects models. An adjusted alpha (p < 0.017) was used to account for multiple comparison bias. Results: A total of 148 children (31.92 ± 7.41 months) had valid accelerometry data. The intervention resulted in a significant increase in light physical activity among the participants in the experimental group at the six-month follow-up (+1.07 min/h, an 11.16% increase; p = 0.0017). The intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on the total physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, or sedentary time. Conclusions: The findings indicate that the Childcare PLAY policy was effective at increasing the toddlers' and preschoolers' light physical activity. This pilot intervention appears promising for supporting some improved movement behaviors among children in childcare settings; however, additional investigations are needed to explore the feasibility and effectiveness with larger and more-diverse samples."

The study was a 6-week randomized controlled trial that included 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After 10 days of baseline activity, patients were randomized into 2 groups: control and active. The control group (n = 15) was instructed to continue with their baseline activity for 6 weeks. The active group (n = 15) was instructed to walk at least 10000 steps per day 5 or more days per week, for 6 weeks. Data relevant to glycemic control and other parameters of health were collected at study weeks 0 and 6. There were no differences in the baseline activity between groups (P = .36). Subjects in the active group significantly increased physical activity by 69% during the intervention phase of the study (P = .002), whereas there was no change in the physical activity of the control group (P > .05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and resting energy expenditure significantly increased in the active group (P < .05). Finally, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity was reduced by exercise relative to the control group (P = .03). There were no differences in any other study parameters during the 6-week study. In conclusion, short-term intervention with a pedometer increased physical activity and positively affected plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity in previously inactive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The use of a pedometer may prove to be an effective tool for promoting healthy lifestyle changes that include daily physical activity and self-monitoring of therapeutic goals."

Recent technological advances have created opportunities for the real-time measurement of these behaviors. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and easy to use, and thus have the capacity to collect data from large numbers of people. The present study tested the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of an electronic ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol using electronic surveys administered on the display screen of mobile phones to assess children's physical activity and sedentary behaviors. A total of 121 children (ages 9-13, 51% male, 38% at risk for overweight/overweight) participated in EMA monitoring from Friday afternoon to Monday evening during children's nonschool time, with 3-7 surveys/day. Items assessed current activity (e.g., watching TV/movies, playing video games, active play/sports/exercising). Children simultaneously wore an Actigraph GT2M accelerometer. EMA survey responses were time-matched to total step counts and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurring in the 30 min before each EMA survey prompt. No significant differences between answered and unanswered EMA surveys were found for total steps or MVPA. Step counts and the likelihood of 5+ min of MVPA were significantly higher during EMA-reported physical activity (active play/sports/exercising) vs. sedentary behaviors (reading/computer/homework, watching TV/movies, playing video games, riding in a car) (P < 0.001).

We aimed to evaluate a tailored prescription of affordable digital devices in addition to usual care for people with mobility limitations admitted to aged care and neurological rehabilitation.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nWe conducted a pragmatic, outcome-assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial in 3 Australian hospitals in Sydney and Adelaide recruiting adults 18 to 101 years old with mobility limitations undertaking aged care and neurological inpatient rehabilitation. Both the intervention and control groups received usual multidisciplinary inpatient and post-hospital rehabilitation care as determined by the treating rehabilitation clinicians. In addition to usual care, the intervention group used devices to target mobility and physical activity problems, individually prescribed by a physiotherapist according to an intervention protocol, including virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices for 6 months in hospital and at home. Co-primary outcomes were mobility (performance-based Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]; continuous version; range 0 to 3; higher score indicates better mobility) and upright time as a proxy measure of physical activity (proportion of the day upright measured with activPAL) at 6 months. The dataset was analysed using intention-to-treat principles. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000936628). Between 22 September 2014 and 10 November 2016, 300 patients (mean age 74 years, SD 14; 50% female; 54% neurological condition causing activity limitation) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 149) or control (n = 151) using a secure online database (REDCap) to achieve allocation concealment. Six-month assessments were completed by 258 participants (129 intervention, 129 control). Intervention participants received on average 12 (SD 11) supervised inpatient sessions using 4 (SD 1) different devices and 15 (SD 5) physiotherapy contacts supporting device use after hospital discharge. Changes in mobility scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group from baseline (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 1.5 [0.7]; control group, 1.5 [0.8]) to 6 months (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 2.3 [0.6]; control group, 2.1 [0.8]; mean between-group difference 0.2 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3; p = 0.006).

Scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group across most secondary mobility outcomes, but there was no evidence of a difference between groups for most other secondary outcomes including self-reported balance confidence and quality of life. No adverse events were reported in the intervention group. Thirteen participants died while in the trial (intervention group: 9; control group: 4) due to unrelated causes, and there was no evidence of a difference between groups in fall rates (unadjusted incidence rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.83; p = 0.43).

            "abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the associations of objectively assessed habitual physical activity and physical performance with brain plasticity outcomes and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in cognitively healthy older adults. Physical performance was analyzed based on cardiopulmonary exercise-testing data and accelerometer-based physical activity was analyzed as total activity counts, sedentary time, light physical activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Brain plasticity outcomes included magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based markers, quantitative imaging-based hippocampal volume and BDNF serum levels. The association between physical performance and hippocampal volume was strongly influenced by participants' education, sex, age and BMI. Confounder-controlled correlation revealed significant associations of brain plasticity outcomes with physical activity but not with performance. MRS-based adenosine triphosphate to phosphocreatine and glycerophosphocholine to phosphocreatine ratios were significantly associated with accelerometer total activity counts. BDNF was detrimentally associated with sedentary time but beneficially related to accelerometer total activity counts and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Exceeding the current moderate to vigorous physical activity recommendations led to significantly higher BDNF levels. Our results indicate that regular physical activity might be beneficial for preserving brain plasticity in higher age. In this study these associations were not mediated significantly by physical performance. Overall physical activity and exceeding current moderate to vigorous physical activity recommendations were positively associated with BDNF. Sedentary behavior, however, seems to be negatively related to neurotrophic factor bioavailability in the elderly."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive and yet parsimonious model of daily mobility activity in patients with neurological gait disorders. Patients (N = 240) with early-stage neurological (peripheral vestibular, cerebellar, hypokinetic, vascular or functional) gait disorders and healthy controls (N = 35) were clinically assessed with standardized scores related to functional mobility, balance confidence, quality of life, cognitive function, and fall history. Subsequently, daily mobility was recorded for 14 days by means of a body-worn inertial sensor (ActivPAL®). Fourteen mobility measures derived from ActivPAL recordings were submitted to principle component analysis (PCA). Group differences within each factor obtained from PCA were analyzed and hierarchical regression analysis was performed to identify predictive characteristics from clinical assessment for each factor. PCA yielded five significant orthogonal factors (i.e., mobility domains) accounting for 92.3% of the total variance from inertial-sensor-recordings: ambulatory volume (38.7%), ambulatory pattern (22.3%), postural transitions (13.3%), sedentary volume (10.8%), and sedentary pattern (7.2%). Patients' mobility performance only exhibited reduced scores in the ambulatory volume domain but near-to-normal scores in all remaining domains. Demographic characteristics, clinical scores, and fall history were differentially associated with each domain explaining 19.2-10.2% of their total variance. This study supports a low-dimensional five-domain model for daily mobility behavior in patients with neurological gait disorders that may facilitate monitoring the course of disease or therapeutic intervention effects in ecologically valid and clinically relevant contexts. Further studies are required to explore the determinants that may explain performance differences of patients within each of these domains and to examine the consequences of altered mobility behavior with respect to patients' risk of falling and quality of life."

Demographics, anthropometrics, lung function and clinical data were assessed. Daily physical activity measures and hourly patterns were analysed based on data from a multisensor armband. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were applied to physical activity measures to identify clusters. Age, body mass index (BMI), dyspnoea grade and ADO index (including age, dyspnoea and airflow obstruction) were associated with physical activity measures and hourly patterns. Five clusters were identified based on three PCA components, which accounted for 60% of variance of the data. Importantly, couch potatoes (i.e. the most inactive cluster) were characterised by higher BMI, lower FEV1, worse dyspnoea and higher ADO index compared to other clusters ( p < 0.05 for all). Daily physical activity measures and hourly patterns are heterogeneous in COPD. Clusters of patients were identified solely based on physical activity data.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the most important PA determinants in type 2 diabetes patients in order to develop efficacious interventions to increase PA participation. The main aim of this study was to investigate the associations of physical environmental factors with objectively assessed and self-reported PA in type 2 diabetes patients. A total of 133 type 2 diabetes patients participated in this cross-sectional study (response rate: 43.3%). All participants completed the long International PA Questionnaire and two validated questionnaires to measure physical environmental perceptions and psychosocial factors. They also wore an accelerometer and a pedometer to measure PA objectively. Selection criteria were age 35-80, BMI 25-35 kg m(-²), treated for type 2 diabetes and no PA limitations. Data were collected in 2007. Physical environmental factors contributed significantly to the explained variance of all objective and self-reported PA measures (explained variance from 4% to 18%) after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Home PA equipment, walkability, aesthetics and convenience of PA facilities were the most consistent environmental correlates. The contribution of physical environmental factors remained significant for most PA measures after taking into account the variance explained by psychosocial factors (explained variance from 4% to 10%), except for step counts and recreational walking. Physical environmental factors could be important correlates of PA in type 2 diabetes patients, even beyond the contribution of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, but additional research is needed. Nevertheless, sociodemographic and psychosocial factors remain very important and when developing future interventions, all these multidimensional correlates should be kept in mind."

Any study was included which reported clinical assessments in parallel with accelerometry in a free-living hospital or home setting. Study quality is reflected by participant numbers, methodological approach, technical details of the equipment used, blinding of clinical measures, whether safety and compliance data was collected. First author screened articles for inclusion and inclusion of full text articles and data extraction was confirmed by the third author. Out of 1375 initial abstracts, 8 articles were included. All participants were stroke patients. Accelerometers were worn for either 24 hours or 3 days. Data were collected as summed acceleration counts over a specified time or as the duration of active/inactive periods. Activity in both arms was reported by all studies and the ratio of impaired to unimpaired arm activity was calculated in six studies. The correlation between clinical assessments and accelerometry was tested in five studies and significant correlations were found. The efficacy of a rehabilitation intervention was assessed using accelerometry by three studies: in two studies both accelerometry and clinical test scores detected a post-treatment difference but in one study accelerometry data did not change despite clinical test scores showing motor and functional improvements. Further research is needed to understand the additional value of accelerometry as a measure of upper limb use and function in a clinical context.

The following previously-validated surveys were obtained on study day 1: (1) Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI); (2) Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE); (3) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), short form version 1.0 Physical Function 10a (PROMIS-PF); and (4) PROMIS Global Health, short form version 1.1 (PROMIS-GH). In addition, clinical physical performance measurements of frailty (10 foot Get up and Go, 4 Meter walk, and Figure-of-8 Walk [F8W]) were also obtained.

In functionally intact individuals, the above mobile phone metrics assessed aspects of functional status independent (Bland-Altman and correlation analysis) of both survey- and/or performance battery-based functional measures. In contrast, in frail individuals, the above mobile phone metrics correlated with submeasures of both SAFFE and PROMIS-GH.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Continuous mobile phone-based measures of participant community activity and mobility strongly differentiate between persons with intact functional status and persons with a frailty phenotype. These measures assess dimensions of functional status independent of those measured using current validated questionnaires and physical performance assessments to identify functional compromise. Mobile phone-based gait measures may provide a more readily accessible and less-time consuming measure of gait, while further providing clinicians with longitudinal gait measures that are currently difficult to obtain."

Correlations between PEC outcomes and PA ranged from very weak (0.025) to moderate (0.663). Moderate correlations (as therefore assumed to be relevant) were only found for outcomes of both the TT and 6-minute walk test and the locomotion components of PA. For instance, functional claudication distance (measured by TT) and number of steps per day correlated reasonably well (Spearman correlation ρ = 0.663; P < .01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Exercise capacity and PA correlate minimally in patients with IC.

Individual objective measures of physical activity using accelerometry, body mass index and bioelectrical impedance (per cent of fat mass) were obtained, as were perceptions of change in crime and quality of the built environment. We examined changes in levels of physical activity and adiposity using multilevel models adjusting for sex, age group, ethnic group, housing sector (fixed effects) and baseline household (random effect), comparing the change in those who moved to East Village (intervention group) with the change in those who did not move to East Village (control group). Effects of housing sector (i.e. social, intermediate/affordable, market-rent) as an effect modifier were also examined. Qualitative work was carried out to provide contextual information about the perceived effects of moving to East Village.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 877 adults (69%) were followed up after 2 years (mean 24 months, range 19–34 months, postponed from 1 year owing to the delayed opening of East Village), of whom 50% had moved to East Village; insufficient numbers of children moved to East Village to be considered further. In adults, moving to East Village was associated with only a small, non-significant, increase in mean daily steps (154 steps, 95% confidence interval –231 to 539 steps), more so in the intermediate sector (433 steps, 95% confidence interval –175 to 1042 steps) than in the social and market-rent sectors (although differences between housing sectors were not statistically significant), despite sizeable improvements in walkability, access to public transport and neighbourhood perceptions of crime and quality of the built environment. There were no appreciable effects on time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity or sedentary time, body mass index or percentage fat mass, either overall or by housing sector. Qualitative findings indicated that, although participants enjoyed their new homes, certain design features might actually serve to reduce levels of activity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite strong evidence of large positive changes in neighbourhood perceptions and walkability, there was only weak evidence that moving to East Village was associated with increased physical activity. There was no evidence of an effect on markers of adiposity.

The aim of this study was to determine daily step count and levels of PA in adolescents and adults with CP living in urban South Africa, compared to TD peers, and to determine associations with sex, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, body mass index and socio-economic status. Materials and Methods: This case-control study included 26 adolescents and 22 adults with CP (GMFCS Level I-V) and matched TD peers (25 and 30, respectively). Participants wore an ActiGraph GT3X for 7 consecutive days to determine step count and time (minutes per hour) spent in PA levels, including sedentary (SED), low physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: The daily step count and PA levels for ambulant adolescents with CP (GMFCS level I-III) were similar to TD peers, while this was less for adolescents classified in GMFCS level IV-V. Daily step count, SED and MVPA were similar for adults classified in GMFCS level I-II compared to TD adults, while all parameters were lower for adults using assistive devices (GMFCS level III) and non-ambulant adults (GMFCS level IV-V) compared to TD peers. Daily step count and PA levels were inversely associated with GMFCS, while no other associations were found. Conclusion: People with CP who were more mobile dependent (higher GMFCS level) were less active. However, adolescents and adults with CP classified as GMFCS levels I-II living in urban South Africa recorded similar step count and PA levels as their TD peers. This was also the case for adolescents using assistive devices, though not for those in the adult group (GMFCS level III). Furthermore, it was apparent that even the ambulant individuals with CP and TD cohorts were relatively inactive. Intervention programs for CP and TD adolescents should be aimed at finding strategies to keep adolescents physically active well into adulthood, in order to promote physical health, social and emotional well-being and independence."

Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for prolonged periods despite recommendations of only short-term usage. Melatonin, a naturally occurring nocturnal hormone, has the potential to stabilize disrupted circadian rhythmicity. Our aim was to investigate how prolonged-release melatonin affects rest-activity patterns in medicated patients with severe mental illness and if benzodiazepine dose reduction is associated with changes in circadian rhythm parameters.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Data were derived from a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial with 24 weeks follow-up. Participants were randomized to add-on treatment with prolonged-release melatonin (2 mg) or matching placebo, and usual benzodiazepine dosage was gradually tapered. Here we report the results of 72 h of actigraphic assessment of activity-rest cycles performed pre and post tapering. Changes in rest-activity rhythm parameters between the melatonin and placebo group were analyzed using the univariate general linear model. Change in activity counts per 6 h, from baseline to follow-up, in the whole sample was analyzed using paired samples t-test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A subsample of 48 patients participated in the actigraphic assessment: 20 in the melatonin group and 28 in the placebo group.

Melatonin significantly increased the interdaily stability and at a trend level decreased the intradaily variability compared with placebo. Benzodiazepine dose reduction was not associated with these circadian rhythm parameters. Activity counts were generally higher after benzodiazepine dose reduction compared with pre tapering, but differences did not reach statistical significance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest melatonin as an aid during benzodiazepine withdrawal for patients distressed by disrupted circadian rest-activity cycles.

            "abstract": "While the detrimental effects of a chronic positive energy balance due to a sedentary lifestyle have been well established, the impacts of a short period of abruptly reduced physical activity and overeating arising from strict confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic will soon start to emerge. To reasonably anticipate major consequences according to the available evidence, we hereby review the literature for studies that have explored the health impacts of several weeks of a reduction in physical activity and daily step-count combined with modified eating habits. These studies identify as main metabolic consequences increases in insulin resistance, total body fat, abdominal fat and inflammatory cytokines. All these factors have been strongly associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, which in turn increases the risk of multiple chronic diseases. A plausible mechanism involved in these impacts could be a positive energy balance promoted by maintaining usual dietary intake while reducing energy expenditure. This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences. Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, adequate control of metabolic disorders could be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19."

Self-monitoring proved difficult for some, particularly reading the daily step count recorded on the pedometer and writing it in the diary. Carers also played an important role in facilitating and preventing behaviour change in adults with intellectual disabilities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Additional barriers prevent many adults with intellectual disabilities from participating in PA.

            "abstract": "This study compared the effects of a resistance training protocol and a moderate-impact aerobic training protocol on bone mineral density (BMD), physical ability, serum osteoprotegerin (OPG), and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) levels. Seventy-one older women were randomly assigned to resistance exercise (RE), aerobic exercise (AE) or a control group (CON). Both interventions were conducted 3 times per week for 8 months. Outcome measures included proximal femur BMD, muscle strength, balance, body composition, serum OPG, and RANKL levels. Potential confounding variables included dietary intake, accelerometer-based physical activity (PA), and molecularly defined lactase nonpersistence. After 8 months, only RE group exhibited increases in BMD at the trochanter (2.9%) and total hip (1.5%), and improved body composition. Both RE and AE groups improved balance. No significant changes were observed in OPG and RANKL levels, and OPG/RANKL ratio. Lactase nonpersistence was not associated with BMD changes. No group differences were observed in baseline values or change in dietary intakes and daily PA. Data suggest that 8 months of RE may be more effective than AE for inducing favourable changes in BMD and muscle strength, whilst both interventions demonstrate to protect against the functional balance control that is strongly related to fall risk."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Physical activity (PA) has been associated with telomere shortening. The association of PA intensity or volume with telomere length (TL) is nonetheless unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the associations of exercise intensity and volume with TL in elderly adults from Northern Finland (65° latitude North). Methods: Seven hundred elderly subjects born in 1945 in the Oulu region were investigated. PA was measured during a 2-week period with a wrist-worn accelerometer. In addition, a questionnaire was used to assess sedentary time and to achieve a longitudinal PA history and intensity. Relative telomere lengths (RTL) were determined from frozen whole blood samples using a qPCR-based method. Results: Relative telomere lengths were significantly longer in women than men and negatively correlated with age in both genders (men r = -0.210, p = 0.000, women r = -0.174, and p = 0.000). During the 2-week study period, women took more steps than men (p = 0.001), but the association between steps and RTL was only seen in men (p = 0.05). Total steps taken (r = 0.202 and p = 0.04) and sedentary time (r = -0.247 and p = 0.007) significantly correlated with RTLs in 70-year old subjects. Moderate PA was associated with RTL in subjects with the highest quartile of moderate PA compared to the three lower quartiles (p-values: 0.023 between 4th and 1st, 0.04 between 4th and 2nd, and 0.027 between 4th and 3rd) in the 70-year old subjects. Conclusion: Women had longer RTL and a higher step count compared to men. However, exercise volume and RTL correlated positively only in men. Surprisingly, age correlated negatively with RTL already within an age difference of 2 years. This suggests that telomere attrition rate may accelerate in older age. Moderate physical activity at the time of study was associated with RTL."

This observational analysis used general linear models to compare step counts before and after T2DM diagnosis in the 2816 participants with the requisite data. Participants were relatively inactive at baseline, taking a median (interquartile range) of 5488 (3258-8361) steps/day, which decreased after T2DM diagnosis by a mean (s.e.) of 258 (64) steps/day (p < 0.0001); however, after adjusting for background trend for activity, step count after T2DM diagnosis was unchanged [mean (s.e.) of 103 (87) fewer steps/day; p = 0.23].

The aim of this study was to determine if feedback from a commercial activity monitor improves activity levels over the first 6 weeks after total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n## METHODS\nOne hundred sixty-three consecutive subjects undergoing primary TKA or THA were randomized into 2 groups. Subjects received an activity tracker with the step display obscured 2 weeks before surgery and completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). On day 1 after surgery, participants were randomized to either the \"feedback (FB) group\" or the \"no feedback (NFB) group.\" The FB group was able to view their daily step count and was given a daily step goal. Participants in the NFB group wore the device with the display obscured for 2 weeks after surgery, after which time they were also able to see their daily step count but did not receive a formal step goal. The mean daily steps at 1, 2, 6 weeks, and 6 months were monitored. At 6 months after surgery, subjects repeated PROMs and daily step count collection.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 163 subjects, 95 underwent THA and 68 underwent TKA. FB subjects had a significantly higher (P < .03) mean daily step count by 43% in week 1, 33% in week 2, 21% in week 6, and 17% at 6 months, compared with NFB. The FB subjects were 1.7 times more likely to achieve a mean 7000 steps per day than the NFB subjects at 6 weeks after surgery (P = .02). There was no significant difference between the groups in PROMs at 6 months. Ninety percent of FB and 83% of NFB participants reported that they were satisfied with the results of the surgery (P = .08). At 6 months after surgery, 70% of subjects had a greater mean daily step count compared with their preoperative level.\n## CONCLUSION\nSubjects who received feedback from a commercial activity tracker with a daily step goal had significantly higher activity levels after hip and knee arthroplasty over 6 weeks and 6 months, compared with subjects who did not receive feedback in a randomized controlled trial. Commercial activity trackers may be a useful and effective adjunct after arthroplasty.\n"

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although exercise and daily physical activity (PA) have long been known to benefit patients with chronic disorders, knowledge is limited regarding asthma. OBJECTIVE: In a Danish setting, our aim was to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and physical capacity among patients with asthma. We hypothesized that people with severe asthma would be less active and more sedentary than their mild-moderate counterparts. METHODS: Adults with asthma were recruited through respiratory outpatient clinics and subsequently examined twice, 4 weeks apart. At each visit, participants underwent a series of lung function tests, questionnaires, and maximum oxygen uptake testing (VO2max). Between the visits, participants wore an accelerometer continuously for 4 weeks, measuring sedentary time and daily steps. Sixty patients, 27 with mild-moderate asthma (GINA 1-3) and 33 with severe asthma (GINA 4-5), completed both visits and had valid accelerometer measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences between the two groups were found in sedentary time, number of steps or VO2max. VO2max was significantly correlated with FeNO (r = -0.30, p < 0.05), Short Form-12 Mental Health (r = 0.37, p < 0.05), Asthma Control Questionnaire (r = -0.35, p < 0.05), and Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (r = 0.36, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: No differences were observed between patients with mild-moderate and severe asthma regarding sedentary behavior, daily steps or level of cardiopulmonary fitness.

Participants then underwent stress reactivity testing, where beat-to-beat cardiovascular (e.g., blood pressure, total peripheral resistance), inflammatory (plasma interleukin-6, leukocytes) and salivary cortisol measurements were taken in response to an 8-minute socially evaluative Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Higher volumes of daily sedentary behaviour were associated with larger stress responses for diastolic blood pressure (Β=1.264, 95%CI=0.537-1.990, p = .005), total peripheral resistance (Β=40.563, 95%CI=19.310-61.812, p < .001), interleukin-6 (Β=0.219, 95%CI=0.109-0.329, p < .001) and cortisol (Β=1.844, 95%CI=1.139-2.549, p < .001). These findings emerged independent of a priori determined covariates, including daily levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and adiposity.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Exaggerated stress reactivity is characteristic of high sedentary behaviour and could be a novel mechanism linking sedentary behaviour with CVD. Future work should examine the impact of reducing sedentary behaviour on measures of stress reactivity, as this may have clinical relevance for preventing CVD."

Altogether 787 individuals (mean age 72.9 years), of whom 404 were female, used a hip-worn triaxial accelerometer for at least 4 days and answered a question on perceived fitness. First, individual differences were studied between four fitness categories.

Better self-reported fitness was associated with more steps taken on average (8,558 daily steps [very good fitness] vs 2,797 steps [poor fitness], p < .001) and with a higher amount of moderate-to-vigorous activity (61 min vs 12 min p < .001, respectively) in the adjusted multivariable model. Among 156 twin pairs discordant for self-reported fitness, co-twins with better fitness took more steps, did more moderate-to-vigorous activity, and had less sedentary behavior (all, p < .05) compared to their less fit co-twins; however, difference was smaller among monozygotic than dizygotic pairs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      One simple question on self-reported fitness is associated with daily activity profile among community-dwelling older people.

            "abstract": "Excessive sedentary time is related to poor mental health. However, much of the current literature uses cross-sectional data and/or self-reported sedentary time, and does not assess factors such as sedentary bout length. To address these limitations, the influence of objectively measured sedentary time including sedentary bout length (i.e. <30 min, ≥30 min) on mood, stress, and sleep, was assessed in 271 healthy adults (49% women; age 27.8 ± 3.7) across a 1-year period between 2011 and 2013 in Columbia, SC. Participants completed the Profile of Mood States and the Perceived Stress Scale, and wore a Sensewear Armband to assess sedentary time, physical activity, and sleep for ten days at baseline and one year. A series of fixed-effects regressions was used to determine the influence of both baseline levels and changes in daily sedentary time (total and in bouts) and physical activity on changes in mood, stress, and sleep over one year. Results showed that across the year, decreases in total sedentary time, and time in both short and long bouts, were associated with improvements in mood, stress and sleep (p < 0.05). Increases in physical activity were only significantly predictive of increases in sleep duration (p < 0.05). Thus, reductions in sedentary time, regardless of bout length, positively influenced mental wellbeing. Specifically, these results suggest that decreasing daily sedentary time by 60 min may significantly attenuate the negative effects of high levels of pre-existing sedentary time on mental wellbeing. Interventions manipulating sedentary behavior are needed to determine a causal link with wellbeing and further inform recommendations."

Can resistance training with and without blood flow restriction improve redox balance and positively impact the autonomic cardiac modulation in chronic kidney disease patients? What is the main finding and its importance? Resistance training with and without blood flow restriction improved antioxidant defence (paraoxonase 1), decreased the pro-oxidative myeloperoxidase, improved cardiac autonomic function and slowed the decrease in renal function. We draw attention to the important clinical implications for the management of redox balance and autonomic cardiac function in chronic kidney disease patients.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are prone to cardiovascular diseases secondary to abnormalities in both autonomic cardiac function and redox balance [myeloperoxidase (MPO) to paraoxonase 1 (PON1) ratio]. Although aerobic training improves both autonomic balance and redox balance in patients with CKD, the cardioprotective effects of resistance training (RT), with and without blood flow restriction (BFR), remain unknown. We aimed to compare the effects of RT and RT+BFR on antioxidant defence (PON1), pro-oxidative status (MPO), cardiac autonomic function (quantified by heart rate variability analysis) and renal function. Conservative CKD (stages 1 to 5 who do not need hemodialysis) patients (n = 105, 33 female) of both sexes were randomized into three groups: control (CTL; 57.6 ± 5.2 years; body mass index, 33.23 ± 1.62 kg/m2 ), RT (58.09 ± 6.26 years; body mass index 33.63 ± 2.05 kg/m2 ) and RT+BFR (58.06 ± 6.47 years; body mass index, 33.32 ± 1.87 kg/m2 ). Patients completed 6 months of RT or RT+BFR on three non-consecutive days per week under the supervision of strength and conditioning professionals. Training loads were adjusted every 2 months. Heart rate variability was recorded with a Polar-RS800 and data were analysed for time and frequency domains using Kubios software. The redox balance markers were PON1 and MPO, which were analysed in plasma samples. Renal function was estimated as estimated glomerular filtration rate. The RT and RT+BFR decreased pro-oxidative MPO (RT, ∼34 ng/ml and RT+BFR, ∼27 ng/ml), improved both antioxidant defence (PON1: RT, ∼23 U/L and RT+BFR, ∼31 U/L) and cardiac autonomic function (R-R interval: RT, ∼120.4 ms and RT+BFR, ∼117.7 ms), and slowed the deterioration of renal function (P < 0.0001). Redox balance markers were inversely correlated with heart rate variability time-domain indices. Our data indicated that both training models were effective as non-pharmacological tools to increase the antioxidant defences, decrease oxidative stress and improve the cardiac autonomic function of CKD patients."

            "abstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders such as knee osteoarthritis (OA) are the primary cause of chronic pain in older adults. Recommended self-management strategies for knee OA include staying physically active in the face of pain, but many patients avoid activities they are capable of doing. The overall purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which daily pain catastrophizing, a maladaptive coping strategy, could influence OA patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior. The current study used data from 143 older knee OA patients who completed electronic daily diaries for 22 days and wore an accelerometer to capture physical activity and sedentary behavior. At the beginning of each day, patients reported their pain catastrophizing regarding the day ahead. Results from multilevel models demonstrated that on mornings when patients catastrophized more than usual about their pain in the day ahead, they spent more time in sedentary behavior and engaged in fewer minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity that day. Cross-day lagged analyses further showed that the effect of morning pain catastrophizing on subsequent sedentary behavior extended to the next day. More time spent in sedentary behavior, in turn, contributed to greater pain catastrophizing the next morning. These findings support the mechanistic role of daily pain catastrophizing in the avoidance of physical activity for older OA patients, and suggest that effective interventions for pain catastrophizing may also reduce sedentary behavior and enhance physical activity, with longer-term benefits for pain management, physical function, and overall health."

Actigraphy monitoring was employed to assess compliance with time in bed condition. Results: Negative affect ratings and positivity ratios in the morning were more improved among participants assigned to the 6 h TIB condition compared to the 8 h TIB group. Participants whose bedtime was delayed by 2-h nightly demonstrated the most significant improvement in negative affect and positivity ratio during the first 2 weeks of fluoxetine therapy. Moreover, the trajectory of morning negative affect ratings in the first 2 weeks was predictive of remission after 4 weeks of fluoxetine therapy.

Compliance with PA monitoring was collected. Two focus groups were conducted to obtain patients' perspectives on the use of activity monitors and on the feedback given. Differences in PA data were also assessed. Sixteen patients (65.63 ± 10.57 years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 70.31 ± 22.74% predicted) completed the study. From those, only eleven participants used the activity monitors during all monitoring days. Participants identified several problems regarding the use of activity monitors and monitoring duration. Daily steps (p = 0.026) and standing time (p = 0.030) were improved from week 1 to week 7; however, the former declined from week 7 to week 12. Findings suggest that using feedback to improve PA during PR is feasible and results in improved daily steps and standing time on week 7. The subsequent decline suggests that additional strategies may be needed to stimulate/maintain PA improvements. Further research with more robust designs is needed to investigate the impact of feedback on patients' daily PA."

            "abstract": "Mobility is a good indicator of health status and thus objective mobility data could be used to assess the health status of elderly patients. Accelerometry has emerged as an effective means for long-term physical activity monitoring in the elderly. However, the output of an accelerometer varies at different positions on a subject's body, even for the same activity, resulting in high within-class variance. Existing accelerometer-based activity recognition systems thus require firm attachment of the sensor to a subject's body. This requirement makes them impractical for long-term activity monitoring during unsupervised free-living as it forces subjects into a fixed life pattern and impede their daily activities. Therefore, we introduce a novel single-triaxial-accelerometer-based activity recognition system that reduces the high within-class variance significantly and allows subjects to carry the sensor freely in any pocket without its firm attachment. We validated our system using seven activities: resting (lying/sitting/standing), walking, walking-upstairs, walking-downstairs, running, cycling, and vacuuming, recorded from five positions: chest pocket, front left trousers pocket, front right trousers pocket, rear trousers pocket, and inner jacket pocket. Its simplicity, ability to perform activities unimpeded, and an average recognition accuracy of 94% make our system a practical solution for continuous long-term activity monitoring in the elderly."

After adjustment for covariates, no significant associations between accelerometer-measured SB, PA and step counts and ASD-related deficiencies were found (p > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Accelerometer-measured SB, PA and step counts showed no associations with ASD-related deficiencies. On this basis, we further found that the emotional symptoms were inversely associated with VPA and MVPA. These results emphasize the importance of VPA and MVPA in children with ASD. The longitudinally investigations on the directionality of these associations between emotional symptoms with VPA and MVPA are needed in the future."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      With increasing numbers of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and hypertension patients, there is a pressing need for effective, time-efficient and sustainable strategies to help physicians support their patients to achieve higher physical activity levels. SMARTER will determine whether physician-delivered step count prescriptions reduce arterial stiffness over a one-year period, compared with usual care, in sedentary overweight/obese adults with DM2/hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Randomized, allocation-concealed, assessor-blind, multisite clinical trial. The primary outcome is change in arterial stiffness over one year. The secondary outcomes include changes in physical activity, individual vascular risk factors, medication use, and anthropometric parameters. Assessments are at baseline and one year.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants are sedentary/low active adults with 25 ≤ BMI < 40 kg/m2 followed for DM2/hypertension by a collaborating physician. The active arm uses pedometers to track daily step counts and review logs with their physicians at 3 to 4-month intervals. A written step count prescription is provided at each visit, aiming to increase counts by ≥3,000 steps/day over one year, with an individualized rate increase. The control arm visits physicians at the same frequency and receives advice to engage in physical activity 30-60 minutes/day. SMARTER will enroll 364 individuals to detect a 10 ± 5% difference in arterial stiffness change between arms. Arterial stiffness is assessed noninvasively with carotid femoral pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The importance of SMARTER lies not simply in the use of pedometer-based monitoring but also on its integration into a prescription-based intervention delivered by the treating physician. Equally important is the measurement of impact of this approach on a summative indicator of arterial health, arterial stiffness. If effectiveness is demonstrated, this strategy has strong potential for widespread uptake and implementation, given that it is well-aligned with the structure of current clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01475201)."

            "abstract": "Pain and physical activity are tightly intertwined. Although their relationship has been explored in chronic pain conditions, we know little about the pattern of recovery in activity and its short- and long-term relationship with pain after surgery. We recruited 103 women undergoing elective cesarean delivery and acquired daily pain assessments and hourly steps in 98 of them for 2 months after surgery. Compliance was good, with 78% of subjects missing less than 7 days of activity. Study personnel required daily checking for compliance and 20 minutes per subject per week in study. Activity increased over the first 2 postoperative months in a log(time) manner. The slope of each modeled individual curve for activity was inversely correlated (r = -0.54; P < 0.0001) with worst daily pain. After removing these 2-month trends, pain and activity within an individual day were negatively associated with each point increase in pain being inversely associated with -119 steps (95% confidence interval [CI] = -214 to -25; P = 0.013). A patient's previous experience of pain was not associated with current activity as well as current activity was not associated with future pain scores. These data, although limited by the study of a single operation in a unique social circumstance with low risk of chronic postsurgical pain, demonstrate feasibility of measuring hourly activity for 2 months after surgery. Recovery from pain and inactivity are tightly correlated, and the negative relationship between within-day pain and activity without interday carryover relationships is in stark contrast to findings in chronic pain conditions."

Immediately after the baseline visit, participants wore an Actical accelerometer for 1 wk. This study explored correlates of accelerometer participation and adherence, defined as wearing it for at least three of a possible six days for ≥10 h·d. Accelerometer performance was assessed by exploring the number of different values of accelerometer counts per minute for each participant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 92.3% (n = 15,153) had at least 1 d with accelerometer data and 77.7% (n = 12,750) were adherent. Both accelerometer participation and adherence were higher among participants who were married or partnered, reported a higher household income, were first-generation immigrants, or reported lower sitting time. Participation was also higher among those with no stair limitations. Adherence was higher among participants who were male, older, employed or retired, not US born, preferred Spanish over English, reported higher work activity or lower recreational activity, and with a lower body mass index. Among the sample that met the adherence definition, the maximum recorded count per minute was 12,000, and there were a total of 5846 different counts per minute. On average, participants had 112.5 different counts per minute over 6 d (median, 106; interquartile range, 91-122). The number of different counts per minute was higher among men, younger ages, normal weight, and those with higher accelerometer-assessed physical activity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Several correlates differed between accelerometer participation and adherence. These characteristics could be targeted in future studies to improve accelerometer wear. The performance of the accelerometer provided insight into creating a more accurate nonwear algorithm."

Research question: To examine the criterion validity of the ActiGraph and activPAL activity monitors in repeatedly measuring a variety of different postures and motion in the office setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty office workers from the University of Zurich wore an ActiGraph and activPAL during two identical laboratory experiments lasting approximately 60 minutes each, within a maximum of 7 days. The experimental setting consisted of a standard computer office workstation with an electrically powered height-adjustable desk, a swivel chair without arm rests, a standard chair, a footrest, and a bookcase. The protocol consisted of 24 pre-defined tasks mimicking sitting, standing, stepping, and postural transitions around the workplace. All tasks were supervised and observed by the same experimenter.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In repeated measurements (40 individual experiments), the percentages of correctly classified tasks for the ActiGraph and activPAL were, respectively, 100% vs. 85% for sitting, 87% vs. 100% for standing, and 100% vs. 73% for postural transitions. Both monitors correctly identified all stepping tasks. The activPAL misclassified sitting with legs outstretched, and sitting with both feet placed beneath the chair, as standing ~25-70% and 45% of the time, respectively. The ActiGraph misclassified standing with the right foot on a footrest as sitting in 65% of events.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The ActiGraph appears to be slightly more sensitive than the activPAL with respect to the measurement of sitting and postural transitions of short duration, whereas the activPAL seems to be slightly more accurate in capturing standing postures.

This cross-sectional study compared subjectively and objectively measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) patterns between older adults with and without a healthy diet. We recruited 127 community-dwelling older Taiwanese adults (69.9 ± 5.0 years); data were collected during April and September 2018. Objectively measured total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, light PA, step count, total sedentary time, duration of sedentary bouts, number of sedentary bouts, and number of sedentary breaks were assessed using activity monitors. Subjectively measured PA and SB were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire for Older Adults. Chi-square tests and independent sample t-tests were performed. For subjective measures, older adults without a healthy diet spent significantly less total leisure time on PA and more leisure sitting time than those with a healthy diet. For objective measures, older adults without a healthy diet spent less time on light PA and had a higher total sedentary time, duration of sedentary bouts, times of sedentary bouts, and times of sedentary breaks than those with a healthy diet. Regardless of the use of objective or subjective measurements, older adults without a healthy diet engaged in a more inactive and sedentary lifestyle. These findings have implications for health promotion practitioners in designing tailored interventions."

            "abstract": "Rationale: Patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have complex organ support needs that necessitate prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), likely to result in a high incidence of neuromuscular weakness and loss of well-being. Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations.Objectives: To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation, and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19.Methods: Adults admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for >24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score to identify the time taken to first mobilize (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge.Results: A total of n = 177 patients were identified, of whom n = 110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. While on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19 ± 10 d), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The mean ± standard deviation time to first mobilize was 14 ± 7 days, with a median Manchester Mobility Score at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4-6), which represents participants able to stand and step around to a chair with or without assistance. Time to mobilize was significantly longer in those with higher body mass index (P < 0.001), and older patients (P = 0.012) and those with more comorbidities (P = 0.017) were more likely to require further rehabilitation after discharge.Conclusions: The early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom resembles the experience in other countries, with high acuity of illness and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation required for those patients admitted to the ICU. Although the time to commence rehabilitation was delayed owing to this severity of illness, rehabilitation was possible within the ICU and led to increased levels of mobility from waking before ICU discharge.Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04396197)."

There was a substantial degree of interindividual variability in the relationship of stress with sedentary behavior. Both the level and sources of stress were associated with increased sedentariness for some, decreased sedentariness for others, and had no effect for many (within-person variance p < .001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that the influence of stress on sedentary behavior varies by source of stress and from person to person.

Poor H control ability during locomotion has been found in people with an increased risk of falling, such as post-stroke patients and amputees. In contrast, little is known about the control of H during locomotion in the elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how aging influences three-dimensional H control during initiation of stepping.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-two healthy old and 22 healthy young individuals were instructed to perform a series of initiation of stepping with their dominant leg and at their self-selected preferred pace.

These results were explained by decreased net external moments in both planes in the older participants. Conversely, during the step execution phase, older adults had higher peak-to-peak ranges of H in the frontal and sagittal planes compared to the younger adults. These higher ranges of H were associated with a longer duration of the step execution phase. Furthermore, in the sagittal plane, a higher external moment also contributed to increasing peak-to-peak ranges of H in older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The current study revealed that older and younger adults exhibit different control strategies of H during initiation of stepping.

The aim of the present study was to determine the closeness of agreement between a self-reported and an objective measure of physical activity in low back pain patients and healthy controls. Beyond, influencing factors on overestimation were identified. Methods. 27 low back pain patients and 53 healthy controls wore an accelerometer (objective measure) for seven consecutive days and answered a questionnaire on physical activity (self-report) over the same period of time. Differences between self-reported and objective data were tested by Wilcoxon test. Bland-Altman analysis was conducted for describing the closeness of agreement. Linear regression models were calculated to identify the influence of age, sex, and body mass index on the overestimation by self-report. Results. Participants overestimated self-reported moderate activity in average by 42 min/day (p = 0.003) and vigorous activity by 39 min/day (p < 0.001). Self-reported sedentary time was underestimated by 122 min/day (p < 0.001). No individual-related variables influenced the overestimation of physical activity. Low back pain patients were more likely to underestimate sedentary time compared to healthy controls. Discussion. In rehabilitation and health promotion, the application-oriented measurement of physical activity remains a challenge.

Associations between compliance and health indicators were examined for all definitions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Compliance varied from 5.3% (DM) to 29.9% (AM). Associations between compliance and health indicators were similar for AM, AM5, and AM15. For example, compliance with AM, AM5, and AM15 was associated with a lower BMI z-score (statistics are coefficient [95% CI]): AM (-0.28 [-0.33 to -0.23]), AM5 (-0.28 [-0.33 to -0.23], and AM15 (-0.30 [-0.35 to -0.25]). Associations between compliance and health indicators for DM were similar/weaker, possibly reflecting fewer DM-compliant participants with health data and lower variability in exposure/outcome data.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Youth completing 60 min of MVPA every day do not experience superior health benefits to youth completing an average of 60 min of MVPA per day. Guidelines should encourage youth to achieve an average of 60 min of MVPA per day. Different guideline definitions affect inactivity prevalence estimates; this must be considered when analyzing data and comparing studies."

Two issues, however, create a situation whereby substantial variation in estimated prevalence rates of (in)active preschoolers are reported. First, NASPE guidelines have been interpreted in multiple ways. Second, objective monitoring via accelerometry is the most widely accepted measure of preschoolers' physical activity, yet multiple cut points provide vastly different estimates of physical activity. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of preschoolers meeting NASPE guidelines and illustrate the differences among rates, given guideline interpretations, and cut points.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Three- to 5-year-old children (n = 397) wore ActiGraph accelerometers for an average of 5.9 days.

            "abstract": "Objective: Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lifestyle factors such as prolonged sedentary behavior (SB) and reduced physical activity (PA) may heighten the risk of CVD. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of SB and PA as predictors for long-term CVD risk in RA patients.Methods: A subsample of 273 people diagnosed with RA was extracted from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and included in this cross-sectional study. Valid accelerometry data were categorized into sedentary behavior, very light, light, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Functional limitations were assessed using a physical function questionnaire. The Framingham risk score (FRS) was used to calculate 10-year CVD risk. Regression models were used to examine the relationships between SB, PA, and 10-year CVD risk while controlling for potential confounders.Results: Participants spent an average of 9 h/day sedentary, 4 h in very light PA, 1 h in light PA, and 0.4 h in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Greater sedentary time was associated with higher 10-year CVD risk (p= 0.019). Increased daily PA, at all intensities, was inversely associated with 10-year CVD risk (p< 0.01). In the fully adjusted regression model, associations between 10-year CVD risk and SB (β = 0.31, R2 = 0.27, p< 0.01), very light PA (β = -0.19, R2 = 0.26, p< 0.01), light PA (β = -0.16, R2 = 0.25, p< 0.01), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (β = -0.15, R2 = 0.25, p< 0.01) remained significant.Conclusions: Strategies for decreasing SB and increasing PA should be explored with individuals with RA in order to decrease long-term CVD risk."

Physical activity (PA) has been shown to increase after a centre-based programme, yet it is not clear if a home-based programme can offer the same benefit. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of home-based PR compared with the centre-based PR on the PA levels post 7 weeks of PR and 6 months follow-up. Method: In this study, 51 participants with COPD, of them, 36 (71%) men completed physical activity monitoring with a SenseWear Armband, at three time points (baseline, 7 weeks, and 6 months). The participants were randomly assigned to either centre-based supervised PR (n = 25; 69 ± 6 years; FEV1 55 ± 20% predicted) or home-based PR (n = 26; 68 ± 7 years; FEV1 42 ± 19% predicted) programmes lasting 7 weeks. The home-based programme includes one hospital visit, a self-management manual, and two telephone calls. The PA was measured as step count, time in moderate PA (3-6 metabolic equivalent of tasks [METs]) in bouts of more than 10 min and sedentary time (<2 METs). Results: Home-based PR increased step count significantly more than the centre-based PR after 7 weeks (mean difference 1,463 steps: 95% CI 280-2,645, p = 0.02). There was no difference in time spent in moderate PA was observed (mean difference 62 min: 95% CI -56 to 248, p = 0.24). Sedentary behaviour was also significantly different between the centre and home-based groups. The home group spent 52 min less time sedentary compared with the centre-based (CI -106 to 2, p = 0.039). However, after 6 months, the step count and time spent in moderate PA returned to baseline in both the groups. Conclusion: This study provides an important insight into the role of home-based PR which has the potential to be offered as an alternative to the centre-based PR. Understanding who may best respond from the centre or home-based PR warrants further exploration and how to maintain these initial benefits for the long-term.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between PA and HRQoL (general and dimensions) among high-risk women in the early post-pregnancy years when T2D risk is highest and to estimate whether current obesity or prior gestational diabetes (GDM) modified these associations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This cross-sectional study of high-risk women [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and/or prior GDM)]4-6 years after delivery measured sleep, sedentary time, daily steps, and light (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA), and vigorous PA (VPA) with the SenseWear ArmbandTM accelerometer for seven days and HRQoL with the 15D instrument.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The analyses included 204 women with a median (IQR) age of 39 (6.0) years and a median BMI of 31.1 kg/m2 (10.9). 54% were currently obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), and 70% had prior gestational diabetes (GDM+). Women with obesity had lower PA levels than women with normal weight or overweight (p < 0.001) but there was no difference between the GDM+ or GDM- women. Women with both current obesity and GDM+ had highest sedentary time and lowest PA levels. The whole sample's median 15D score was 0.934 (IQR 0.092), lower among women with obesity compared to the others (p < 0.001), but not different between GDM+ or GDM-. There was a positive correlation between VPA (adjusted rs = 0.262 p = 0.001) and the 15D score. After grouping according to BMI (< and ≥ 30 kg/m2), the associations remained significant only in women without obesity. Among them, sleep, total steps, MVPA, and VPA were positively associated with 15D.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Higher PA levels are associated with better HRQoL among high-risk women with normal weight and overweight but no differences were found among women affected by obesity in the early years after pregnancy.

They were compared with nine healthy men matched for height, age and lean body mass. Daily energy expenditure and its components (sleeping, basal and absorptive metabolic rates) were analyzed for 24 h in calorimetric chambers and for 4 days in free living conditions using calibrated accelerometry. Other variables known to influence energy expenditure were assessed: body composition, physical activity, 4-day food intake, drug consumption, serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, thyroid and parathyroid hormones, and epinephrine. Transplant recipients who gained more than 5% body weight after transplantation (n = 11, +11.0 ± 1.5 kg) were compared with those who did not (n = 8) and with the controls.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Weight gain compared with non-weight gain patients and controls exhibited higher fat mass without change in lean body mass.

KDM6A, a histone demethylase, can activate gene transcription and has not been reported in GISTs. SPARCL1 may serve as a metastasis marker in GIST, but the molecular mechanism remains to be further explored. This study aimed to explore the biological function and molecular mechanism of KDM6A and SPARCL1 in GIST.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CCK-8, live cell count, colony formation, wound-healing and Transwell migration and invasion assays were employed to detect the cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

Mechanistically, KDM6A promotes the transcription of SPARCL1 by demethylating histone H3 lysine trimethylation and consequently leads to the inactivation of p65. SPARCL1 affected the metastasis of GIST cells in a mesenchymal-epithelial transition- and matrix-metalloproteinase-dependent manner. SPARCL1 knockdown promoted angiogenesis, M2 polarisation and macrophage recruitment by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p65. Moreover, KDM6A and SPARCL1 inhibited hepatic metastasis and macrophage infiltration in vivo.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings establish the critical role of the KDM6A-SPARCL1-p65 axis in restraining the malignancy of GIST."

Several pharmacological and alternative interventions have been tried, but are usually faced by limited efficacy. Hence, exploring other methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), might be of interest.

Using multivariable linear regression models, we compared the PA levels between participants with HF and without HF, focusing on both the average daily PA levels and the intensity of PAs throughout the day.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PA levels were significantly lower in participants with HF using both self-report (excess metabolic equivalent of task hours per week of 26.5 (95% CI 24.7 to 28.4) vs 34.7 (95% CI 34.5 to 34.9), respectively (p<0.001)) and accelerometer measures (mean accelerations of 23.7 milligravity (95% CI 23.1 to 24.4) vs 28.1 milligravity (95% CI 28.0 to 28.1), respectively (p<0.001)). Findings were consistent across different PA intensities. Hour-by-hour comparisons showed that accelerometer-derived PA levels of patients with HF were reduced throughout the day.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Perceived and objectively recorded PA levels of patients with chronic HF are significantly lower than those of individuals without HF. This difference is continuous throughout the different hours of the day, with individuals with HF being on average 16% less active than individuals without HF. In patients with HF, increases in everyday activity may be a potential alternative to structured exercise programmes."

            "title": "Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in knee osteoarthritis patients - beyond daily steps and total sedentary time.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Knee osteoarthritis patients may become physically inactive due to pain and functional limitations. Whether physical activity exerts a protective or harmful effect depends on the frequency, intensity, time and type (F.I.T.T.). The F.I.T.T. dimensions should therefore be assessed during daily life, which so far has hardly been feasible. Furthermore, physical activity should be assessed within subgroups of patients, as they might experience different activity limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to objectively describe physical activity, by assessing the F.I.T.T. dimensions, and sedentary behaviour of knee osteoarthritis patients during daily life. An additional goal was to determine whether activity events, based on different types and durations of physical activity, were able to discriminate between subgroups of KOA patients based on risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Clinically diagnosed knee osteoarthritis patients (according to American College of Rheumatology criteria) were monitored for 1 week with a tri-axial accelerometer. Furthermore, they performed three functional tests and completed the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Physical activity levels were described for knee osteoarthritis patients and compared between subgroups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-one patients performed 7303 mean level steps, 319 ascending and 312 descending steps and 601 bicycle crank revolutions per day. Most waking hours were spent sedentary (61%), with 4.6 bouts of long duration (> 30 min). Specific events, particularly ascending and descending stairs/slopes, brief walking and sedentary bouts and prolonged walking bouts, varied between subgroups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      From this sample of KOA patients, the most common form of activity was level walking, although cycling and stair climbing activities occurred frequently, highlighting the relevance of distinguishing between these types of PA. The total active time encompassed a small portion of their waking hours, as they spent most of their time sedentary, which was exacerbated by frequently occurring prolonged bouts. In this study, event-based parameters, such as stair climbing or short bouts of walking or sedentary time, were found more capable of discriminating between subgroups of KOA patients compared to overall levels of PA and sedentary time. Thereby, subtle limitations in physical behaviour of KOA-subgroups were revealed, which might ultimately be targeted in rehabilitation programs.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      German Clinical Trials Registry under ' DRKS00008735 ' at 02.12.2015."

Baseline measurements included a wrist actigraphy, a 6 min walk test (6MWT), an international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ), and a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) as well as serial post-HCT assessments of 6MWT, IPAQ, and FACT-BMT. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for functionality assessments, with a median follow-up of 54.5 months for surviving recipients. No patients demonstrated vigorous or very vigorous activity at any time during monitoring by wrist actigraphy; patients spent a median of 6 h daily sedentary. Self-reported activity via the IPAQ showed 36%, 43%, and 21% of subjects reporting light, moderate, and vigorous activity prior to HCT, respectively. Post-HCT 6MWTs on day +30 demonstrated the greatest association with subsequent survival and non-relapse mortality. A decline in 6MWT distance over time also demonstrated worsened overall survival. This study shows the feasibility of fitness assessments and the ability to risk stratify for subsequent mortality, particularly using the 6MWT on the day +30 single time point assessment and change scores from baseline to day +30 post HCT.

In this extension of the Supporting Physical Activity in the Childcare Environment (SPACE) cluster randomized controlled trial, we explored the impact of four 30-min daily outdoor unstructured play periods on preschoolers' moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Experimental childcare centres (n = 6) implemented four 30-min daily outdoor playtimes for 8 weeks, while control centres (n = 6) maintained their two 60-min outdoor sessions. Actical™ accelerometers were used to measure preschoolers' physical activity pre- and post-intervention for 5 days during childcare hours. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine the impact of the intervention on preschoolers' MVPA.

No significant differences in MVPA were observed between groups over time (p = 0.36). Preschoolers' MVPA did not improve after the introduction of shorter outdoor play periods. The loss of data due to wear time noncompliance and participant attrition may have influenced these findings. Trial registration: ISRCTN70604107 (October 8, 2014)."

Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy. The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that did not.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear Mini and activPAL) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy.

Light (P = 0.05), vigorous (P = 0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P = 0.02), decreased with a trend in increased SB (P = 0.07). Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did not significantly change. Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7-9 hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively. Forty-six percent (n = 21) and 28% (n = 13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimester, respectively. At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was significantly greater for women who met guidelines. At week 35, women that met PA guidelines had significantly less SB (P < 0.005) than women who did not.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of their day in SB. Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB. Based on the lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB. Future interventions should target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional exercise."

The relationships between QOL and different markers of HF severity remain unclear, particularly as they relate to functional capacity and directly measured activity levels. We hypothesized that QOL would demonstrate a stronger relationship with measures of exercise capacity and adiposity compared to other disease measures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      This is a secondary analysis of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored RELAX, NEAT-HFpEF and INDIE-HFpEF trials to determine the relationships between QOL (assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and different domains reflecting HF severity, including maximal aerobic capacity (peak oxygen consumption), submaximal exercise capacity (6-min walk distance), volume of daily activity (accelerometry), physician-estimated functional class, resting echocardiography, and plasma natriuretic peptide levels. A total of 408 unique patients with chronic HFpEF were split into tertiles of QOL scores defined as QOLworst, QOLintermediate , QOLbest . The QOLworst HFpEF group was youngest, with a higher body mass index, greater prevalence of class II obesity and diabetes, and the lowest N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. After adjustment for age, sex and body mass index, poorer QOL was associated with worse physical capacity and activity levels, assessed by peak oxygen consumption, 6-min walk distance and actigraphy, but was not associated with NT-proBNP or indices from resting echocardiography. QOL was similarly reduced in patients with and without prior HF hospitalization.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Quality of life in HFpEF is poorest in patients who are young, obese and have diabetes, and is more robustly tied to measures reflecting functional capacity and daily activity levels rather than elevations in NT-proBNP or prior HF hospitalization.

Implications for rehabilitation Objectively measured physical activity among community-dwelling survivors of stroke in Cape Town, South Africa was low in volume, and the majority did not meet the recommendations of 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity. The majority of stroke survivors in South Africa spent most of their time sedentary, which could further increase the risk of cardiovascular impairments. Outpatient rehabilitation should be provided to all patients after stroke since it appears to reduce sedentary time."

We aimed to examine the associations between objectively measured breaks in sedentary time with ADL impairments and physical independence. Cross-sectional assessments were carried out in 371 participants (131 male) aged 65-103 years from the Portuguese surveillance system of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) were assessed with accelerometry, and ADL impairments and physical independence with the self-reported 12-item composite physical function scale. Using ROC analyses a cut-off of 7 hourly breaks in sedentary time was identified which maximized the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing physical dependence. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, independently of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), participants performing ≤ 7 hourly breaks in sedentary time had 2 to 7 fold increased odds for impairment in 10 of the 12 ADL. When stratifying ADL into basic, instrumental and advanced ADL we verified that less than 7 hourly breaks in sedentary time was associated with a 2 to 5 fold increased odds for impairments and physical dependence, independent of MVPA. No associations were observed between meeting PA guidelines and basic, instrumental, and advanced ADL impairment although time in MVPA was lower in participants showing impairments. In conclusion, the frequency of breaks in sedentary time in older ages is independently associated with lower risk for ADL impairments and physical dependence. Our findings support interventions to encourage older adults to increase overall PA by interrupting sedentary time."

The aim of this study was to quantify daily PA level and energy expenditure of newly diagnosed patients with IC and healthy controls. PA outcomes are compared with contemporary public health physical activity guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Before initiating treatment, 94 patients with newly diagnosed IC and 36 healthy controls were instructed to wear a tri-axial seismic accelerometer for 1 week. Daily PA levels (in metabolic equivalents, METs) were compared with the ACSM/AHA public health PA minimum recommendations (≥64 METs·min·day, in bouts of ≥10 minutes). A subgroup analysis assessed the effect of functional impairment on daily PA levels.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 56 IC patients and 27 healthy controls were available for analysis. Patients with IC demonstrated significantly lower mean daily PA levels (±SD) than controls (387 ± 198 METs·min vs. 500 ± 156 METs·min, p = .02). This difference was solely attributable to a subgroup of IC patients with the largest functional impairment (WIQ-score < 0.4). Only 45% of IC patients met the public health physical activity guidelines compared with 74% of the healthy controls (p = .01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      More than half of patients with IC do not meet recommended standards of PA.

            "abstract": "Objectives The sit to stand (STS) movement is key to independence and commonly affected by stroke. Repetitive practice is likely to improve STS ability during rehabilitation, however current practice levels are unknown. The objective of this study was simply to count the number of STS movements performed during the rehabilitation period of stroke patients using a physical activity monitor (PAM) and test whether being observed altered outcome. Methods Participants were medically stable patients referred for rehabilitation following stroke. Participants were randomly allocated to either wear or not wear the PAM for 14 days. STS ability and general mobility were recorded before and after. Results Sixty-one patients was recruited; aged 68.4 ± 13.15 years, weight 77.12 ± 22.73 Kg, Height 1.67 ± 0.1 m, within 9 ± 9 days of their stroke and an NIHSS score of 6.4 ± 3.3. The monitored group (n = 38) performed 25.00 ± 17.24 daily STS movements. Those requiring assistance achieved 14.29 ± 16.10 per day while those independent in the movement achieved 34.10 ± 12.44. There was an overall improvement in mobility (p = 0.002) but not STS performance (p = 0.053) neither outcome was affected by group allocation (p = 0.158). Cognition and mobility at baseline explained around 50% of daily STS variability. Discussion Low levels of STS activity were recorded during the rehabilitation period of stroke patient. The mean daily STS activity was lower than reports for frail older people receiving rehabilitation, and substantially below levels recorded by community living older adults. STS repetitions may represent general physical activity and these low levels support previous reports of sedentary behavior during rehabilitation."

The study included 468 children (246 boys, 222 girls) aged 6.7 + or - 0.4 years, recruited from a population-based cohort. Peak oxygen uptake was measured by indirect calorimetry during a maximal treadmill exercise test. Physical activity was assessed by accelerometers over a 4-day period. Minutes of sedentary, light, moderate, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous activity per day were calculated. Mean counts per minute were considered to reflect total physical activity. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a weak relationship between daily physical activity variables and VO(2peak) in boys (r = 0.15-0.28, P < 0.05), with the exception of time in sedentary and light activity, which was not related to VO(2peak). None of the daily physical activity variables were related to VO(2peak) in girls, with the exception of a very weak relationship for moderate activity (r = 0.14, P < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses indicated that the various physical activity variables explained between 2 and 8% of the variance in VO(2peak) in boys. In this population-based cohort, most daily activity variables were positively related to aerobic fitness in boys, whereas less clear relationships were observed in girls. Our finding that physical activity was only uniformly related to aerobic fitness in boys partly contradicts previous studies in older children and adolescents."

The activPAL, a highly valid posture classification device, served as reference criterion. Both sensors were worn by 38 office workers over a median duration of 9 days. An automated feature selection extracted the relevant signal information for a minute-based posture classification. The machine learning algorithm with optimal feature number to predict the time in prolonged sitting bouts (≥5 and ≥10 minutes) was searched and compared to the activPAL using Bland-Altman statistics. The comparison included optimized and frequently used cut-points (100 and 150 counts per minute (cpm), with and without low-frequency-extension (LFE) filtering). The new algorithm predicted the time in prolonged sitting bouts most accurate (bias ≤ 7 minutes/d). Of all proprietary ActiGraph methods, only 150 cpm without LFE predicted the time in prolonged sitting bouts non-significantly different from the activPAL (bias ≤ 18 minutes/d). However, the frequently used 100 cpm with LFE accurately predicted total sitting time (bias ≤ 7 minutes/d). To study the health effects of ActiGraph measured prolonged sitting, we recommend using the new algorithm. In case a cut-point is used, we recommend 150 cpm without LFE to measure prolonged sitting and 100 cpm with LFE to measure total sitting time. However, both cpm cut-points are not recommended for a detailed bout analysis."

An accelerometer worn on the waist has been used to evaluate physical activity in people with chronic conditions. It is useful for evaluating moderate to vigorous activity, although it tends to underestimate light or mild activities such as housework or family duties. An accelerometer worn on the wrist (i.e., actigraph) has recently been used to capture daily physical activity in inactive individuals. The purposes of this study were to investigate physical activity measured by an actigraph in patients with RA and in healthy individuals and to investigate the association between actigraphic data and self-reported physical function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The subjects were 20 RA patients and 20 healthy individuals. All participants wore an actigraph on their wrist for 6-7 consecutive days. They also completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). We extracted three parameters from the actigraphic data: mean activity count (MAC), peak activity count (PAC), and low activity ratio (LAR). These three parameters were compared between the RA patients and healthy individuals and with the self-reported questionnaires.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The MAC was significantly lower and the LAR was significantly higher in RA patients than in healthy individuals. The PAC was not different between the two groups. The LAR was negatively correlated with the MAC for the RA patients and for the healthy individuals. The decrease ratio of the LAR with the increase of the MAC for the RA patients was twice that of the healthy participants. In the RA patients, the LAR was significantly and moderately correlated with the HAQ-DI score and two dimensions of the SF-36 (i.e., \"physical functioning\" and \"bodily pain\").\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Investigation of the proportion of low activity count using an actigraph may be useful to identify characteristics of the physical function in RA patients."

Unlike traditional models, compositional models found the differences in estimated adiposity (1) were not necessarily symmetrical when an activity was being displaced, or displacing another (2) were not linearly related to the durations of time reallocated, and (3) varied depending on the starting composition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The compositional isotemporal model caters for the constrained and therefore relative nature of activity behaviour data and enables all daily behaviours to be included in a single statistical model. The traditional model treats data as real variables, thus the constrained nature of time is not accounted for, nor reflected in the findings. Findings from compositional isotemporal substitution support the importance of MVPA to children's health, and suggest that while interventions to increase MVPA may be of benefit, attention should be directed towards strategies to avoid decline in MVPA levels, particularly among already inactive children. Future applications of the compositional model can extend from pair-wise reallocations to other configurations of time-reallocation, for example, increasing MVPA at the expense of multiple other behaviours."

Eleven thousand fifteen randomly selected patients aged 45-75 y without PA contraindications were invited. Five hundred forty-eight self-reporting achieving PA guidelines were excluded. One thousand twenty-three people from 922 households were randomised between 2012-2013 to one of the following groups: usual care (n = 338); postal pedometer intervention (n = 339); and nurse-supported pedometer intervention (n = 346). Of these, 956 participants (93%) provided outcome data (usual care n = 323, postal n = 312, nurse-supported n = 321). Both intervention groups received pedometers, 12-wk walking programmes, and PA diaries. The nurse group was offered three PA consultations. Primary and main secondary outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 mo in average daily step-counts and time in MVPA (in ≥10-min bouts), respectively, measured objectively by accelerometry. Only statisticians were masked to group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Average baseline daily step-count was 7,479 (standard deviation [s.d.] 2,671), and average time in MVPA bouts was 94 (s.d. 102) min/wk.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise-based program prescribed after cardiac events associated with improved physical, mental, and social functioning; however, many patients return to a sedentary lifestyle leading to deteriorating functional capacity after discharge from CR. Physical activity (PA) is critical to avoid recurrence of cardiac events and mortality and maintain functional capacity. Leveraging mobile health (mHealth) strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach. Based on the social cognitive theory, we sought to determine whether mHealth strategies (Movn mobile app for self-monitoring, supportive push-through messages, and wearable activity tracker) would improve PA and functional capacity over 2 months.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to examine preliminary effects of an mHealth intervention on group differences in PA and functional capacity and group differences in depression and self-efficacy to maintain exercise after CR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      During the final week of outpatient CR, patients were randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or usual care. The intervention group downloaded the Movn mobile app, received supportive push-through messages on motivation and educational messages related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) management 3 times per week, and wore a Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc) activity tracker to track step counts. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites at a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 68.0 (SD 9.3) years, and 23% (14/60) were female; retention rate was 85% (51/60). Our results from 51 patients who completed follow-up showed the intervention group had a statistically significant higher mean daily step count compared with the control (8860 vs 6633; P=.02). There was no difference between groups for the 6MWT, depression, or self-efficacy to maintain exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to examine the potential for mobile health strategies to promote PA in patients with CVD.

Motivation to conserve resources and sedentary time were most frequently predicted by goal striving and perceived demand. Self-regulatory fatigue and pain intensity both predicted motivation to conserve resources in two participants and sedentary time in one participant.

Increased walking practice during \"down time\" in rehabilitation could improve walking function for individuals with stroke.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effect of providing physiotherapists with accelerometer-based feedback on patient activity and walking-related goals during inpatient stroke rehabilitation.\n## METHODS\nParticipants with stroke wore accelerometers around both ankles every weekday during inpatient rehabilitation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily feedback about walking activity via their physiotherapists (n = 29) or to receive no feedback (n = 28). Changes in measures of daily walking (walking time, number of steps, average cadence, longest bout duration, and number of \"long\" walking bouts) and changes in gait control and function assessed in-laboratory were compared between groups.\n## RESULTS\nThere was no significant increase in walking time, number of steps, longest bout duration, or number of long walking bouts for the feedback group compared with the control group (P values > .20). However, individuals who received feedback significantly increased cadence of daily walking more than the control group (P = .013). From the in-laboratory gait assessment, individuals who received feedback had a greater increase in walking speed and decrease in step time variability than the control group (P values < .030).\n## CONCLUSION\nFeedback did not increase the amount of walking completed by individuals with stroke. However, there was a significant increase in cadence, indicating that intensity of daily walking was greater for those who received feedback than the control group. Additionally, more intense daily walking activity appeared to translate to greater improvements in walking speed.\n"

We explored whether ambulatory accelerometry can be used as an objective method to quantify the behavioral aspects of migraine-related disability. Four body mounted uni-axial piezo-resistive accelerometers were used to quantify the time spent in different body postures (lying, sitting, standing), physical activities (walking, cycling) and a general index of body motility during eight migraine attacks and subsequent recovery periods of six patients in their habitual environment. The migraine attacks and recovery periods could be monitored after about 1 h, which was the time required for the investigator to travel to the patient and for the sensors to be attached. In order to quantify the influence of a migraine episode on daily activities, we also performed measurements during a headache-free baseline period of the same patients. Overall, the procedures functioned well, indicating that ambulatory accelerometry measurements before, during and after a migraine attack are feasible to perform. Furthermore, our quantitative data revealed that migraine always influenced behavior by reducing overall body motility and that, dependent upon the severity of the attack, the effectiveness of acute treatment and the time of day, the time spent in various body positions, dynamic activities, and the number of postural transitions were affected. This feasibility study showed that ambulatory accelerometry can provide the objective behavioral effect parameters for the evaluation of migraine and its treatment on daily functioning in the habitual environment of migraine patients."

The Moblees is a Canadian childrens' show that explicitly promotes physical activity. Two studies were conducted to (1) examine whether children were more physically active when watching a Moblees episode, and (2) explore parental perceptions of the show. Methods: Study 1 was an experimental study with 21 families randomized to watch an episode of The Moblees vs. a control condition. Movement was assessed through accelerometry and observation. A Chi-square test was used to compare the direct observation proportions of children sitting between intervention and control conditions.

There was a significant difference in counts between the two conditions, t(13, 61) = 2.29, p < 0.05. Children randomized to the experimental group (i.e., Moblees) moved more compared to control. In study 2 the majority (76%) of parents reported that their child engaged in some physical activity during viewing. Parent encouragement during viewing was the strongest predictor of child physical activity while viewing (β = 0.30, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Television content that includes messaging about physical activity and sedentary behavior, and positive portrayals of physical activity may influence the physical activity of young children. Although the benefits of such modest movement are not clear without further evidence of accumulation over time and/or transfer to other settings, television programming might provide a far reaching medium for knowledge translation."

One type of a non-pharmacological intervention that appears to have a beneficial effect on cognition in older persons without dementia and older persons at risk for dementia is exercise. In view of their younger age early-onset dementia patients may be well able to participate in an exercise program. The main aim of the EXERCISE-ON study is to assess whether exercise slows down the progressive course of the symptoms of dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and fifty patients with early-onset dementia are recruited. After completion of the baseline measurements, participants living within a 50 kilometre radius to one of the rehabilitation centres are randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise program in a rehabilitation centre or a flexibility and relaxation program in a rehabilitation centre. Both programs are applied three times a week during 3 months. Participants living outside the 50 kilometre radius are included in a feasibility study where participants join in a daily physical activity program set at home making use of pedometers. Measurements take place at baseline (entry of the study), after three months (end of the exercise program) and after six months (follow-up). Primary outcomes are cognitive functioning; psychomotor speed and executive functioning; (instrumental) activities of daily living, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include physical, neuropsychological, and rest-activity rhythm measures.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The EXERCISE-ON study is the first study to offer exercise programs to patients with early-onset dementia.

However, early and intense mobilization within the first 24 h post stroke may cause an unfavorable outcome. Recently, objective measurements using body-worn sensors have been applied, enabling continuous monitoring of physical activity in the hospital setting. This study aimed to use body-worn sensors to quantify the amount of physical activity and how activity levels changed over time during hospitalization in patients with acute stroke. We also wanted to investigate which factors were associated with upright and sitting activity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a prospective study including patients admitted to hospital within seven days after onset of stroke. Physical activity was measured by two sensors (ActivPALs from PAL Technologies Ltd., Glasgow, UK), one attached on sternum and one on the thigh of the unaffected side, monitoring continuously from inclusion until discharge. Data were processed in Matlab R 2015B and provided information about daily time in lying, sitting, and upright positions, and daily average duration of sitting and upright bouts. A linear mixed model was used to analyze changes over time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      58 patients were included (31 women, mean (SD) age; 75.1 (12.0)).

The Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBMS) was used for clinical assessment of the participants&rsquo; functional balance and mobility performance pre- and post- intervention. Accelerometers worn on the low back were used to register PA of one week before and in the third week of the intervention. Changes in conventional univariate PA metrics (percentage of walking and sedentary time, step counts, mean cadence) and complexity were compared to the change as measured by the CBMS. Statistical analyses (21 participants) showed significant rank correlation between the change as measured by complexity and CBMS (&rho; = 0.47, p = 0.03). Smoothing the activity output improved the correlation (&rho; = 0.58, p = 0.01). In contrast, change in univariate PA metrics did not show correlations.

Longitudinal analyses were inconsistent with these findings, possibly because of power limitations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Although PA (particularly MVPA) was generally associated with inflammatory and hemostatic biomarkers, we found no evidence that longer bouts were more important than shorter bouts."

Currently there is increasing interest in instruments for monitoring daily physical activity. The purpose of this pilot study was to appraise the qualitative and quantitative differences in physical activities and gait analysis parameters in control and obese subjects by means of an innovative tool for the monitoring of physical activity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six obese patients, 16 women and 10 men, aged 22 to 69 years with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30 and 51.4 kg/m2, were compared with 15 control subjects, 4 men and 11 women, aged 24 to 69 with BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m2 during daily physical activities. The IDEEA device (Minisun, Fresno, CA), based on a wearable system of biaxial accelerometers and able to continuously record the physical activities and energy expenditure of a subject in time was used. Time spent in different physical activities such as standing, sitting, walking, lying, reclining, stepping, energy expenditure and gait parameters (velocity, stance duration, etc) were measured during a 24-hours period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A trend toward a reduced number of steps was present, associated to reduced speed, reduced cadence and reduced rate of single and double limb support (SLS/DLS). Moreover, obese people spent significant less time stepping, less time lying and more time in a sitting or reclined position during the night. The energy expenditure during a 24-hours period was higher in the obese compared to controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study provided objective parameters to differentiate the daily motor activity of obese subjects with respect to controls, even a larger population is required to confirm these findings. The device used can be of support in programming educational activities for life style modification in obese people as well as for monitoring the results of various kinds of intervention in these patients concerning weight and physical performance."

            "abstract": "This study is part of the ToyBox-study, which is conducted in six European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Poland and Spain), aiming to develop a cost-effective kindergarten-based, family-involved intervention to prevent overweight and obesity in four- to six-year-old preschool children. In the current study, we aimed to examine and compare preschoolers' step count patterns, across the six European countries. A sample of 3578 preschoolers (mean age: 4.8 ± 0.4) was included. Multilevel analyses were performed to take clustering of measurements into account. Based on the average hourly steps, step count patterns for the six European countries were created for weekdays and weekend days. The step count patterns during weekdays were related to the daily kindergarten schedules. Step count patterns during weekdays showed several significant peaks and troughs (p < 0.01) and clearly reflected the kindergartens' daily schedules, except for Germany. For example, low numbers of steps were observed during afternoon naptimes and high numbers of steps during recess. In Germany, step count patterns did not show clear peaks and troughs, which can be explained by a less structured kindergarten schedule. On weekend days, differences in step count patterns were observed in the absolute number of steps in the afternoon trough and the period in which the evening peak occurred. Differences in step count patterns across the countries can be explained by differences in (school) policy, lifestyle habits, and culture. Therefore, it might be important to respond to these step count patterns and more specifically to tackle the inactive periods during interventions to promote physical activity in preschoolers."

The test-retest reliability was determined by intra-class correlation coefficient. The validity was evaluated by comparing accelerometeric data to behavior mappings using Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rho correlation coefficient (r) and Bland-Altman plots. Average wearing time for four accelerometers was 20.99 ± 3.28 hours per day. The 3-day accelerometer recording showed excellent test-retest reliability. For sedentary activities, wrist accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than ankle accelerometers. For light to moderate activities, ankle accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than wrist accelerometers.

The pedometer group had significantly greater improvements in: physical activity 3080±3254 steps·day(-1) versus 138.3±1950 steps·day(-1) (p<0.001); SGRQ -8.8±12.2 versus -3.8±10.9 (p=0.01); CAT score -3.5±5.5 versus -0.6±6.6 (p=0.001); and 6MWD 12.4±34.6 versus -0.7±24.4 m (p=0.02) than patients receiving activity encouragement only. A simple physical activity enhancement programme using pedometers can effectively improve physical activity level and quality of life in COPD patients."

            "abstract": "Wrist-worn accelerometers are often applied to measure arm use after stroke. They measure arm movements during all activities, including whole-body movements, such as walking. Whole-body movements may influence clinimetric properties of arm use measurements-however, this has not yet been examined. This study investigates to what extent arm use measurements with wrist-worn accelerometers are affected by whole-body movements. Assuming that arm movements during whole-body movements are non-functional, we quantify the effect of whole-body movements by comparing two methods: Arm use measured with wrist-worn accelerometers during all whole-body postures and movements (P&M method), and during sitting/standing only (sit/stand method). We have performed a longitudinal observational cohort study with measurements in 33 stroke patients during weeks 3, 12, and 26 poststroke. The P&M method shows higher daily paretic arm use outcomes than the sit/stand method (p < 0.001), the mean difference increased from 31% at week three to 41% at week 26 (p < 0.001). Differences in daily paretic arm use between methods are strongly related to daily walking time (r = 0.83-0.92). Changes in the difference between methods are strongly related to changes in daily walking time (r = 0.89). We show that not correcting arm use measurements for whole-body movements substantially increases arm use outcomes, thereby threatening the validity of arm use outcomes and measured arm use changes."

Daily step count was measured for 1 week using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Cases of diabetes were collected from the Swedish National Patient Register. The dose-response association was evaluated graphically using a flexible parametric model, and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regressions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During a mean follow-up of 2.6 years, diabetes was diagnosed in 81 participants.

From there, the risk decreased at a slower rate until it leveled off at around 8000 steps/day. A threshold of 4500 steps/day was found to best distinguish participants with the lowest risk of diabetes, where those taking ≥ 4500 steps/day, had 59% lower risk of diabetes, compared to those taking fewer steps (HR, 0.41, 95% CI, 0.25-0.66). Adjusting for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) attenuated the association (HR, 0.64, 95% CI, 0.38-1.06), which was marginally altered after further adjusting for sedentary time, education and other cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases (HR, 0.58, 95% CI, 0.32-1.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A higher daily step count is associated with lower risk of incident diabetes in community-dwelling 70-year-olds. The greatest benefits occur at the lower end of the activity range, and much earlier than 10,000 steps/day. With the limitation of being an observational study, these findings suggest that promoting even a modest increase in daily step count may help to reduce the risk of diabetes in older adults. Because VAT appears to partly mediate the association, lifestyle interventions targeting diabetes should apart from promoting physical activity also aim to prevent and reduce central obesity."

Workstream 2 – 22 (73.3%) out of 30 residents who wore a hip accelerometer had valid data (≥ 8 hours on ≥ 4 days of the week). Workstream 3 – practical mechanisms for increasing physical activity were developed, informed by an advisory group of stakeholders and outputs from workstreams 1 and 2, framed by the process of intervention mapping. Workstream 4 – action groups were convened in four care homes to refine the intervention, leading to further development of implementation strategies.

The wearable sensor consisted of an accelerometer and angular velocity sensor. The angular velocity and angle of pitch direction were used for TUG evaluation, and those in the pitch and yaw directions at the thigh were used for FSST. Using the threshold of the angular velocity signal, we classified the phase corresponding to each activity. We then observed the characteristics of each activity and recommended suitable training and management. The wearable sensor can be used for more detailed evaluation in fall risk management.

Adolescents who had more daily bouts of exercise lasting 60 min increased their CV fitness (r = 0.59, p = 0.04). A1c remained unchanged.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Encouraging 60 min of accumulated exercise bouts/d can improve fitness levels in adolescents with T1DM, minimizing future CV risks. Although physical activity increased in adolescents, family based strategies are required to promote current physical activity recommendations."

            "abstract": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers have shown widespread efficacy as antihypertensive medications. These agents bind selectively to angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, specifically blocking the renin-angiotensin system at the last step in its cascade. CS-866 is the most recently introduced drug in this class. This article presents integrated safety and efficacy data from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies in which once-daily CS-866 monotherapy was used in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure > or =100 mm Hg and < or =115 mm Hg). Data from a total of 2,145 CS-866-treated patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Safety data were available from 2,540 CS-866-treated patients, with a cumulative exposure of 5,888 patient-months. The antihypertensive efficacy of the drug was assessed using both cuff blood pressure measurements and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The data show that CS-866 is effective and safe for the treatment of hypertension. Dose-dependent reductions in both diastolic and systolic blood pressures occurred within 1 week of initiating treatment, and the response was almost maximal within 2 weeks. There was no difference in efficacy between younger (<65 years) and older (> or =65 years) groups of patients. Trough-to-peak ratios showed that CS-866 retains the majority of its peak effect 24 hours after treatment, and is therefore suitable for once-daily dosing. Dizziness was the only treatment-emergent adverse event with which CS-866 was associated."

We investigated the association between different force-velocity (F-V) profiles and impaired muscle power, physical and cognitive function, frailty, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older people.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Physical function (habitual gait speed, timed up-and-go test, sit-to-stand and stair-climbing ability), cognitive function, HRQoL and frailty were evaluated in 31 older subjects (70-85 years). The F-V relationship and maximal muscle power (Pmax) were assessed in the leg press exercise. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) and fat index, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time were obtained from DXA scans and accelerometry, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      While some subjects showed a force deficit (FDEF), others presented a velocity deficit (VDEF), both leading to an impaired muscle power [Effect size (ES) = 1.30-1.44], and to a likely-very likely moderate harmful effect in their physical and cognitive function, HRQoL and frailty levels (except the VDEF group for cognitive function) [ES = 0.76-1.05]. Leg muscle mass and specific force were similarly associated with force at Pmax, while MVPA but not sedentary time was related to fat index, force at Pmax, and power values (all p < 0.05). A trend was found for the negative association between fat index and relative Pmax (p = 0.075).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Older subjects exhibited different mechanisms (force vs. velocity deficits) leading to impaired muscle power. Both deficits were associated with a lower physical function and quality of life, and a higher frailty, whereas only a force deficit was associated with a lower cognitive function. Interventions aimed at reversing age- and/or disuse-related impairments of muscle power might evaluate the specific responsible mechanism and act accordingly."

            "abstract": "Wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used to measure the quantity of physical activities during daily living in healthy and people with movement disorders through activity classification. These sensors have the potential to provide valuable information to evaluate the quality of the movement during the activities of daily living (ADL), such as walking, sitting down, and standing up, which could help clinicians to monitor rehabilitation and pharmaceutical interventions. However, high accuracy in the detection and segmentation of these activities is necessary for proper evaluation of the quality of the performance within a given segment. This paper presents algorithms to process IMU data, to detect and segment unstructured ADL in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) in simulated free-living environment. The proposed method enabled the detection of 1610 events of ADL performed by nine community dwelling older adults with PD under simulated free-living environment with 90% accuracy (sensitivity = 90.8%, specificity = 97.8%) while segmenting these activities within 350 ms of the \"gold-standard\" manual segmentation. These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method to eventually be used to automatically detect and segment ADL in free-living environment in people with PD. This could potentially lead to a more expeditious evaluation of the quality of the movement and administration of proper corrective care for patients who are under physical rehabilitation and pharmaceutical intervention for movement disorders."

They completed the PAQ-C (≤11yrs, n = 28) or-A (≥12yrs, n = 56), and also wore a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+ or GT9X) over the right hip for 7 days (n = 59 met valid wear time criteria).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Median daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 46.9 minutes per day (IQR 31.6-61.8) and 25% met physical activity guidelines defined as ≥60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. Median PAQ-score was 2.6 (IQR 1.9-3.0). PAQ-Scores were significantly related to accelerometry-derived metrics of physical activity (rho = 0.44-0.55, all p<0.01) and sedentary behaviour (rho = -0.53, p<0.001). Internal consistency was high (α = 0.837), as was reliability (stability) of PAQ-Scores over a 4-months period (ICC = 0.73, 95%CI 0.55-0.84; p<0.001). We identified that a PAQ-Score cut-point of 2.87 discriminates between those meeting physical guidelines and those that do not in the combined PAQ-C and-A samples (area under the curve = 0.80 (95%CI 0.67-0.92).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Validity and reliability of the PAQ in children and adolescents with CHD was comparable to or stronger than previous studies in healthy children.

Outcome measures were step count and duration of time (percentage of wear time) spent in light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Participants were classified as normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.99 kg/m2; n = 82), overweight (BMI = 25.0-29.99 kg/m2; n = 182), or obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2; n = 95).

Disability measures for ASD rely heavily on ambulatory function; however, current metrics may fail to fully capture its contribution. We sought 1) to determine the utility of continuous remote step count monitoring and activity tracking in ASD using a consumer-friendly accelerometer, and 2) to investigate trends and patterns both before and after surgical intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Case description:\n        \n      \n      One patient with progressive ASD was enrolled. Daily step count (SC), distance traveled (DT), and levels of activity were measured using a wrist-mounted device for 17 months. Spinopelvic parameters were measured from standing radiographs. The patient underwent T4-ilium long-segment fusion for correction of progressive deformity (coronal cobb angle: 8°; sagittal vertical axis: 4 cm; coronal vertical axis: 2 cm); recovery was uneventful. The device was worn for 216 of 520 (41%) recorded days during waking hours, with an average SC of 5254 ± 2696 per day. SC (P < 0.001), DT (P < 0.001), and minutes of light activity (LA) (P < 0.001) declined over the 9-month preoperative course, whereas sedentary activity increased (P < 0.001). After surgery, SC, DT, and LA decreased in the early postoperative period, with a significant increase at 7-8 months compared with the preoperative period (P < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Wrist-mounted devices are a noninvasive and effective measure to track daily activity and ambulatory capacity of patients with spinal deformity.

            "abstract": "As a primary nonpharmacological tool, exercise training is neuroprotective after experimental ischemic stroke by relieving neuroinflammation. However, the specific mechanism of which and anti-inflammatory effect of exercise at different intensities require in-depth investigations. To explore the issue, middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO-r) in mice were utilized, with subsequent exercise training at different intensities (high-intensity interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training, i.e. HIIT vs. MICT) during an early phase post-modeling. The neurobehavioral assessment showed that MICT improved the performance of neurological deficit scores and rotarod test earlier, while HIIT appeared to be more efficacious to meliorate locomotor impairments and aerobic fitness at the end of intervention. Both exercise regimens inhibited the expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, and Cl.caspase-1) and pyroptosis-associated proteins (GSDMD, Cl.IL-1β, and Cl.IL-18) as indicated by western blot and immunofluorescence co-staining. Multiplex assay panel revealed that both exercise regimens reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine. Furthermore, an increased proportion of M2-like microglia and a diminished proportion of M1-like microglia in the peri-infarct zone were observed by colocalization analysis, which was jointly validated by western blot. Here, for the first time, our study demonstrated that HIIT elicited better improvements at functional and cardiovascular levels than MICT after ischemic stroke, and anti-inflammatory effect of exercise might result from suppression in inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis by shifting microglial polarization toward neuroprotective M2 phenotype."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although the health benefits of regular physical activity and exercise are well established and have been incorporated into national public health recommendations, there is a relative lack of understanding pertaining to the harmful effects of physical inactivity. Experimental paradigms including complete immobilization and bed rest are not physiologically representative of sedentary living. A useful 'real-world' approach to contextualize the physiology of societal downward shifts in physical activity patterns is that of short-term daily step reduction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Step-reduction studies have largely focused on musculoskeletal and metabolic health parameters, providing relevant disease models for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis. In untrained individuals, even a short-term reduction in physical activity has a significant impact on skeletal muscle protein and carbohydrate metabolism, causing anabolic resistance and peripheral insulin resistance, respectively. From a metabolic perspective, short-term inactivity-induced peripheral insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, with consequent liver triglyceride accumulation, leads to hepatic insulin resistance and a characteristic dyslipidaemia. Concomitantly, various inactivity-related factors contribute to a decline in function; a reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass and muscle strength.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Physical inactivity maybe particularly deleterious in certain patient populations, such as those at high risk of T2D or in the elderly, considering concomitant sarcopenia or osteoporosis. The effects of short-term physical inactivity (with step reduction) are reversible on resumption of habitual physical activity in younger people, but less so in older adults. Nutritional interventions and resistance training offer potential strategies to prevent these deleterious metabolic and musculoskeletal effects.\n    \n\n\n          Impact:\n        \n      \n      Individuals at high risk of/with cardiometabolic disease and older adults may be more prone to these acute periods of inactivity due to acute illness or hospitalization.

Ninety patients with COPD were classified according to the GOLD B-C-D and II-III-IV classifications. Functionality was assessed by different outcomes: 6-min walk test (6MWT), activities of daily living (ADL) (London Chest ADL Scale), and daily life activity/inactivity variables assessed by activity monitoring (SenseWear armband, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). The 6MWT was the only outcome significantly associated with both the GOLD classifications. Good functionality as assessed by the 6MWT was observed in 80%, 69%, and 43.5% (GOLD B, C, and D, respectively) and 81%, 59%, and 29% (GOLD II, III, and IV, respectively) of the patients. Association (V Cramer's) and correlation (Spearman) coefficients of 6MWT with GOLD B-C-D and II-III-IV were V = 0.30, r = -0.35, and V = 0.37, r = -0.25, respectively. Neither GOLD classification showed V or r ≥ 0.30 with any other functionality outcome. Both the GOLD B-C-D and II-III-IV classifications do not reflect well COPD patients' functionality. Despite low association and correlation coefficients in general, both GOLD classifications were better associated with functional exercise capacity (6MWT) than with subjectively assessed ADL and objectively assessed outcomes of physical activity/inactivity."

It is unclear for patients why mobilization is important, and exact progress of mobilization activities is not available. The aim of this study was to select and evaluate accelerometers for objective qualification of in-hospital mobilization after cardiac surgery. Six static and dynamic patient activities were defined to measure patient mobilization during the postoperative hospital stay. Device requirements were formulated, and the available devices reviewed. A triaxial accelerometer (AX3, Axivity) was selected for a clinical pilot in a heart surgery ward and placed on both the upper arm and upper leg. An artificial neural network algorithm was applied to classify lying in bed, sitting in a chair, standing, walking, cycling on an exercise bike, and walking the stairs. The primary endpoint was the daily amount of each activity performed between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. The secondary endpoints were length of intensive care unit stay and surgical ward stay. A subgroup analysis for male and female patients was planned. In total, 29 patients were classified after cardiac surgery with an intensive care unit stay of 1 (1 to 2) night and surgical ward stay of 5 (3 to 6) nights. Patients spent 41 (20 to 62) min less time in bed for each consecutive hospital day, as determined by a mixed-model analysis (p < 0.001). Standing, walking, and walking the stairs increased during the hospital stay. No differences between men (n = 22) and women (n = 7) were observed for all endpoints in this study. The approach presented in this study is applicable for measuring all six activities and for monitoring postoperative recovery of cardiac surgery patients.

ADL algorithm determines posture, activity and fall that activity is determined by AC component of accelerometer signal and posture is determined by DC component of accelerometer signal. Those activity and posture include standing, sitting, lying, walking, running, etc. By the experiment for 30 subjects, the performance of implemented algorithm was assessed, and detection rate for postures, motions and subjects was calculated. Lastly, using wireless sensor network in experimental space, subject's postures, motions and fall monitoring system was implemented. By the simulation experiment for 30 subjects, 4 kinds of activity, 3 times, fall detection rate was calculated. In conclusion, this system can be application to patients and elders for activity monitoring and fall detection and also sports athletes' exercise measurement and pattern analysis.

We measured these patients' step count (SC), active energy expenditure (AEE), and total energy expenditure simultaneously, using actigraphs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In our study population of 103 patients, most of whom were hypertensive, SC and AEE were associated with nighttime systolic BP in univariate (SC, r = -0.28, P < 0.01; AEE, r = -0.20, P = 0.046) and multivariate linear regression analyses (SC, coefficient beta = -5.37, P < 0.001; AEE, coefficient beta = -0.24, P < 0.01). Step count was associated with both systolic (r = 0.23, P = 0.018) and diastolic (r = 0.20, P = 0.045) BP dipping. Nighttime systolic BP decreased progressively across the categories of sedentary, moderately active, and active participants (125mm Hg, 116mm Hg, 112mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.002). The degree of BP dipping of BP increased progressively across the same three categories of activity (respectively 8.9%, 14.6%, and 18.6%, P = 0.002, for systolic BP and respectively 12.8%, 18.1%, and 22.2%, P = 0.006, for diastolic BP).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Step count is continuously associated with nighttime systolic BP and with the degree of BP dipping independently of 24-hour mean BP. The combined use of an actigraph for measuring indicators of physical activity and a device for 24-hour measurement of ambulatory BP may help identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events in whom increased physical activity toward higher target levels may be recommended."

            "abstract": "Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) increases risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Periodic CRF assessment can have an important preventive function. The objective of this study was to develop a protocol-free method to estimate CRF in daily life based on heart rate (HR) and body acceleration measurements. Acceleration and HR data were collected from 37 subjects (men = 49%) while they performed a standardized laboratory activity protocol (sitting, walking, running, cycling) and during a 5-day free-living monitoring period. CRF was determined by oxygen uptake (V̇o2max) during maximal exercise testing. A doubly labeled water-validated equation was used to predict total energy expenditure (TEE) from acceleration data. A fitness index was defined as the ratio between TEE and HR (TEE-pulse). Activity recognition techniques were used to process acceleration features and classify sedentary, ambulatory, and other activity types. Regression equations based on TEE-pulse data from each activity type were developed to predict V̇o2max. TEE-pulse measured within each activity type of the laboratory protocol was highly correlated with V̇o2max (r from 0.74-0.91). Averaging the outcome of each activity-type specific equation based on TEE-pulse from the laboratory data led to accurate estimates of V̇o2max [root mean square error (RMSE): 300 mL O2/min, or 10%]. The difference between laboratory and free-living determined TEE-pulse was 3.7 ± 11% (r = 0.85). The prediction method preserved the prediction accuracy when applied to free-living data (RMSE: 367 mL O2/min, or 12%). Measurements of body acceleration and HR can be used to predict V̇o2max in daily life. Activity-specific prediction equations are needed to achieve highly accurate estimates of CRF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is among the very few studies validating, in free-living conditions, a method to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness using heart rate and body acceleration data. A novel parameter called TEE-pulse, which was defined as the ratio between accelerometer-determined energy expenditure and heart rate, was highly correlated with maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o2max). Activity classification and the use of activity-selective prediction equations outperformed previously published methods for estimating V̇o2max from heart rate and acceleration data."

            "abstract": "Declines in strength and muscle function with age-sarcopenia-contribute to a variety of negative outcomes including an increased risk of: falls, fractures, hospitalization, and reduced mobility in older persons. Population-based estimates of the loss of muscle after age 60 show a loss of ~1% per year while strength loss is more rapid at ~3% per year. These rates are not, however, linear as periodic bouts of reduced physical activity and muscle disuse transiently accelerate loss of muscle and declines in muscle strength and power. Episodic complete muscle disuse can be due to sickness-related bed rest or local muscle disuse as a result of limb immobilization/surgery. Alternatively, relative muscle disuse occurs during inactivity due to illness and the associated convalescence resulting in marked reductions in daily steps, often referred to as step reduction (SR). While it is a \"milder\" form of disuse, it can have a similar adverse impact on skeletal muscle health. The physiological consequences of even short-term inactivity, modeled by SR, show losses in muscle mass and strength, as well as impaired insulin sensitivity and an increase in systemic inflammation. Though seemingly benign in comparison to bed rest, periodic inactivity likely occurs, we posit, more frequently with advancing age due to illness, declining mental health and declining mobility. Given that recovery from inactivity in older adults is slow or possibly incomplete we hypothesize that accumulated periods of inactivity contribute to sarcopenia. Periodic activity, even in small quantities, and protein supplementation may serve as effective strategies to offset the loss of muscle mass with aging, specifically during periods of inactivity. The aim of this review is to examine the recent literature encompassing SR, as a model of inactivity, and to explore the capacity of nutrition and exercise interventions to mitigate adverse physiological changes as a result of SR."

            "abstract": "We determined whether the degree of symptom-related functional disability was related to daily physical activity of the shoulder in subjects with stiff shoulders (SSs). Responsiveness and a clinically meaningful level of discrimination between improvement and non-improvement for shoulder physical activity (SPA) were determined. Twenty-six subjects with SSs participated. Shoulder physical activity was assessed by RT3 accelerometers fixed on the humerus during daily 14-h data collection periods twice a week for 2 weeks. A moderate correlation coefficient was found between SPA and functional disability (β = .47). Based on our cohort design and sample, we suggest that SPA (higher than 101.8 counts, hard-moderate or hard tasks) during daily activity are associated with (with at least 83% probability) non-improvement in an individual with SS. Compared to the non-improvement group, the improvement group had less duration of sedentary activity, less frequency and duration of hard tasks, and more frequency and duration of easy tasks (p < 0.01). Appropriate guidance on shoulder physical activities for subjects with SS is important to consider in rehabilitation strategies for these subjects. In our sample, a hard level of shoulder physical activity and sedentary activity should be cautious for these subjects. Further study is needed to validate therapeutic effect of physical activity on the course of patient improvement in subjects with SSs."

For children under age 3 years, wearable sensor-measured PA levels have begun to be investigated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using hip- vs. wrist-worn accelerometers, and to report accelerometer-derived PA metrics among toddlers. A convenience sample of 22 toddlers aged 13 to 35 months and their mothers were recruited for this study. ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers were attached to wrist bands and waist belts. The mothers were asked to affix a wrist band and a waist belt to their participating children during waking hours for four days. They also completed an acceptability survey. Of the 22 toddlers, 19 (86%) had ≥ 3 valid days of hip data, while only 14 (64%) did so for wrist data (p = 0.16). In terms of acceptability, 18 mothers (82%) responded that the 4-day hip wear was easy, while only 13 (59%) responded that the 4-day wrist wear was easy (p = 0.19). Daily light-intensity PA (LPA) was on average 161 min, and daily moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) was on average 47 min, as determined using published hip accelerometer cut-points. There were no significant differences in LPA or MVPA by age or by sex. In conclusion, this study suggests that hip placement of an ActiGraph accelerometer is more feasible than wrist placement among toddlers."

This also enabled us to more clearly define the relationships between mitochondrial energetics and muscle lipid content with clinically relevant assessments of muscle and physical function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-nine volunteers were recruited to the following study groups: young active (YA, n = 2 women/8 men, age = 31.2 ± 5.4 years), older active (OA, n = 2 women/8 men, age = 67.5 ± 2.7 years), and older sedentary (OS, n = 8 women/11 men, age = 70.7 ± 4.7 years). Participants completed a graded exercise test to determine fitness (VO2 peak), a submaximal exercise test to determine exercise efficiency, and daily physical activity was recorded using a tri-axial armband accelerometer. Mitochondrial energetics were determined by (i) 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and (ii) respirometry of fibre bundles from vastus lateralis biopsies. Quadriceps function was assessed by isokinetic dynamometry and physical function by the short physical performance battery and stair climb test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Daily physical activity energy expenditure was significantly lower in OS, compared with YA and OA groups. Despite fitness being higher in YA compared with OA and OS, mitochondrial respiration, maximum mitochondrial capacity, Maximal ATP production/Oxygen consumption (P/O) ratio, and exercise efficiency were similar in YA and OA groups and were significantly lower in OS. P/O ratio was correlated with exercise efficiency. Time to complete the stair climb and repeated chair stand tests were significantly greater for OS. Interestingly, maximum mitochondrial capacity was related to muscle contractile performance and physical function.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Older adults who maintain a high amount of physical activity have better mitochondrial capacity, similar to highly active younger adults, and this is related to their better muscle quality, exercise efficiency, and physical performance. This suggests that mitochondria could be an important therapeutic target for sedentary ageing associated conditions including sarcopenia, dynapenia, and loss of physical function."

            "title": "Rest-activity circadian rhythm and sleep quality in patients with binge eating disorder.",
            "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that altered rest-activity circadian rhythms (RARs) are associated with a compromised health status. RARs abnormalities have been observed also in several pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular, neurological, and cancer diseases. Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with a prevalence of 3.5% in women and 2% in men. BED and its associate obesity and motor inactivity could induce RARs disruption and have negative consequences on health-related quality of life. However, the circadian RARs and sleep behavior in patients with BED has been so far assessed only by questionnaires. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine RARs and sleep parameters by actigraphy in patients with BED compared to a body mass index-matched control group (Ctrl). Sixteen participants (eight obese women with and eight obese women without BED diagnosis) were recruited to undergo 5-day monitoring period by actigraphy (MotionWatch 8®, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) to evaluate RARs and sleep parameters. In order to determine the RARs, the actigraphic data were analyzed using the single cosinor method. The rhythmometric parameters of activity levels (MESOR, amplitude and acrophase) were then processed with the population mean cosinor. The Actiwatch Sleep Analysis Software (Cambridge Neurotecnology, Cambridge, UK) evaluated the sleep patterns. In each participant, we considered seven sleep parameters (sleep onset: S-on; sleep offset: S-off; sleep duration: SD; sleep latency: SL; movement and fragmentation index: MFI; immobility time: IT; sleep efficiency: SE) calculated over a period of five nights. The population mean cosinor applied to BED and Ctrl revealed the presence of a significant circadian rhythm in both groups (p < 0.001). The MESOR (170.0 vs 301.6 a.c., in BED and Ctrl, respectively; p < 0.01) and amplitude (157.66 vs 238.19 a.c., in BED and Ctrl, respectively p < 0.05) differed significantly between the two groups. Acrophase was not different between BED and Ctrl, as well as all sleep parameters. Both groups displayed a low level of sleep quality (SE 80.7% and 75.7% in BED and Ctrl, respectively). These data provided the first actigraphy-based evidence of RARs disruption and sleep behavior disorder in patients with BED. However, while sleep disorders could be reasonably ascribed to overweight/obesity and the related lower daily physical activity, RARs disruption in this pathology should be ascribed to factors other than reduced physical activity. The circadian timing approach can represent a novel potential tool in the treatment of patients with eating disorders. These data provide exploratory evidence of behavioral association in a small population of patients that, if confirmed in a wider number of subjects and across different populations, may lead to a revision and enhancement of interventions in BED patients."

While there is some evidence that anti-parkinsonian medication, levodopa, might not improve balance and gait control or reduce fall risk in the PIGD subtype, it is unclear whether the levodopa dosage intake affects gait stability. To address these issues, this study used accelerometry to compare gait stability: (i) during before and after levodopa intake between non-PIGD and PIGD subtypes; (ii) between individuals who took less or >750 mg of levodopa/day.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In 15 non-PIGD (Combination of 13 TD patients and 2 classified as indeterminate subtype) and 23 PIGD participants of similar mean (SD) age ((63.0 (7.6) versus 62.6 (10.0) years, respectively)) and disease-duration (8.9 (8.9) versus 11.3 (4.6) years, respectively), head and trunk stability during gait was examined using anteroposterior, vertical and mediolateral acceleration harmonic ratios (HRs).

Average acceleration and MVPA were lower in CD, but not PGD, relative to OW (-5.2 mg and -30.7 minutes, respectively, P < 0.001). Both PGD and CD had poorer intensity distributions than OW (P < 0.001). Application of a cut-point to the M30 showed 7%, 17% and 28%, of OW, PGD and CD, respectively, accumulated 30 minutes of brisk walking per day. Radar plots showed OW had higher overall activity than CD. The relatively poor intensity distribution of PGD, despite similar overall activity to OW, was due to accumulation of more light and less higher intensity activity. These data-driven methods identify aspects of activity that differ between groups, which may be missed by cut-point methods alone.

Daily physical activity was measured using the Actigraph GT9X accelerometer. The Dialysis Symptom Index questionnaire was also used. We found significant differences in anthropometric variables (weight, body mass index, overhydration, lean tissue index, and fat tissue index, all p < 0.05) and phase angle (p < 0.01) between HD patients reaching and patients not reaching physical activity guidelines for patients with chronic diseases. HD patients showed to be less active during dialysis days compared to non-dialysis days as indicated in sedentary time (-11.7%; p = 0.001), light (-47.3%; p = 0.003), moderate (-51.5%; p = 0.001), moderate to vigorous (-49.3%; p = 0.001), and vigorous (-34.3%; p = 0.067) physical activity.

Excessive workplace PA is an established risk factor for knee OA however, appropriate methods of measurement are unclear. There is a need to examine and assess the utility of new methods of measuring workplace PA and estimating knee load prior to application to large-scale, knee OA cohorts. Our aims, therefore, were to monitor workplace PA and estimate lower-limb loading across different occupations in health participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-four healthy adults, currently working full-time in a single occupation (≥ 35 h/week) and free of musculoskeletal disease, comorbidity and had no history of lower-limb injury/surgery (past 12-months) were recruited across New South Wales (Australia). A convenience sample was recruited with occupations assigned to levels of workload; sedentary, light manual and heavy manual. Metrics of workplace PA including tasks performed (i.e., sitting), step-count and lower-limb loading were monitored over 10 working days using a daily survey, smartwatch, and a smartphone.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants of light manual occupations had the greatest between-person variations in mean lower-limb load (from 2 to 59 kg*m/s3).

            "abstract": "Background: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a chronic childhood arthropathy with features of autoinflammation. Early inflammatory SJIA is associated with expansion and activation of neutrophils with a sepsis-like phenotype, but neutrophil phenotypes present in longstanding and clinically inactive disease (CID) are unknown. The objective of this study was to examine activated neutrophil subsets, S100 alarmin release, and gene expression signatures in children with a spectrum of SJIA disease activity. Methods: Highly-purified neutrophils were isolated using a two-step procedure of density-gradient centrifugation followed by magnetic-bead based negative selection prior to flow cytometry or cell culture to quantify S100 protein release. Whole transcriptome gene expression profiles were compared in neutrophils from children with both active SJIA and CID. Results: Patients with SJIA and active systemic features demonstrated a higher proportion of CD16+CD62Llo neutrophil population compared to controls. This neutrophil subset was not seen in patients with CID or patients with active arthritis not exhibiting systemic features. Using imaging flow cytometry, CD16+CD62Llo neutrophils from patients with active SJIA and features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) had increased nuclear hypersegmentation compared to CD16+CD62L+ neutrophils. Serum levels of S100A8/A9 and S100A12 were strongly correlated with peripheral blood neutrophil counts. Neutrophils from active SJIA patients did not show enhanced resting S100 protein release; however, regardless of disease activity, neutrophils from SJIA patients did show enhanced S100A8/A9 release upon PMA stimulation compared to control neutrophils. Furthermore, whole transcriptome analysis of highly purified neutrophils from children with active SJIA identified 214 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to neutrophils from healthy controls. The most significantly upregulated gene pathway was Immune System Process, including AIM2, IL18RAP, and NLRC4. Interestingly, this gene set showed intermediate levels of expression in neutrophils from patients with long-standing CID yet persistent serum IL-18 elevation. Indeed, all patient samples regardless of disease activity demonstrated elevated inflammatory gene expression, including inflammasome components and S100A8. Conclusion: We identify features of neutrophil activation in SJIA patients with both active disease and CID, including a proinflammatory gene expression signature, reflecting persistent innate immune activation. Taken together, these studies expand understanding of neutrophil function in chronic autoinflammatory disorders such as SJIA."

            "abstract": "African American breast cancer (AA BC) survivors are more likely to have cancer-related comorbidities compared with other women, ultimately putting them at higher risk for overall mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality. Survivorship care guidelines emphasize the importance of attention to obesity, weight management, and physical activity. Mobile technologies have been effective for improving health behaviors among cancer survivors, though few studies have focused on AA BC survivors. Creating Healthy Actions through Technology (CHAT) was a 4-week pilot intervention that employed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to improve survivors' physical activity and diet behaviors. We evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of a mHealth intervention for AA BC survivors. Participants (N = 22) were randomized to intervention (n = 13) or control (n = 9). All participants completed daily EMAs via smartphone for 4 weeks and wore accelerometers for seven consecutive days at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks. Intervention participants additionally received tailored health messages. Diet was measured using a self-reported questionnaire and physical activity with accelerometers. Participant engagement was high. Of 84 EMA assessments, the average response was 63 (SD 16.1). Participant accelerometer wear was at least 6 of the 7 days (SD 1.7) for each assessment. Eighty-five percent of participants reported the intervention helped change behaviors. Intervention participants reduced their sedentary time by 4.37 (SD = 7.14) hours/day versus controls (p = .05), reduced fast food intake by 1.5 servings (p = 0.008), and increased vigorous activity by 0.56 (SD = 28.10) minutes, which was non-significant (p = 0.959). Findings show feasibility and acceptability and potential of the intervention to positively impact physical activity among AA BC survivors."

All treatments produced significant improvement in diary-reported sleep in comparison with the control group. Effect sizes for sleep diary outcomes were medium to large. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up for diary and actigraph measured SOL, WASO, and SE. The MCI group had the largest proportion of treatment remitters.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For older adults with chronic primary insomnia, the findings provide initial evidence that SCT, SRT, and MCI are equally efficacious and produce sustainable treatment gains on diary, actigraphy, and clinical outcomes. From a clinical perspective, MCI may be a preferred treatment due to its higher remission rate.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical trial information:\n        \n      \n      Behavioral Intervention for Insomnia in Older Adults.

            "abstract": "A new daily living activity recording system has been developed for monitoring health conditions and living patterns, such as respiration, posture, activity/rest ratios and general activity level. The system employs a piezoelectric sensor, a dual axis accelerometer, two low-power active filters, a low-power 8-bit single chip microcomputer and a 128 MB compact flash memory. The piezoelectric sensor, whose electrical polarization voltage is produced by mechanical strain, detects body movements. Its high-frequency output components reflect body movements produced by walking and running activities, while the low frequency components are mainly respiratory. The dual axis accelerometer detects, from body X and Y tilt angles, whether the patient is standing, sitting or lying down (prone, supine, left side or right side). The detected respiratory, behavior and posture signals are stored by the compact flash memory. After recording, these data are downloaded to a desktop computer and analyzed."

The aim of the study was to compare device-based physical activity and sedentary behaviour, using a harmonised approach, following a PCI on-entry into centre-based cardiac rehabilitation in two countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was conducted at two outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centres in Australia and Sweden. Participants were adults following a PCI and commencing cardiac rehabilitation (Australia n = 50, Sweden n = 133). Prior to discharge from hospital, Australian participants received brief physical activity advice (< 5 mins), while Swedish participants received physical activity counselling for 30 min.

We recruited 41 participants and randomized them into an intervention group (IG) (n=20) and a control group (CG) (n = 21). The intervention consisted of five sessions within 12 weeks, a booster session after 22 weeks and a pedometer. Primary outcome was PA assessed by accelerometer (minutes per day) and pedometer (steps per day). Secondary outcomes were weight, body mass index, blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c and total cholesterol. After 12 weeks, the IG increased with more than 2000 steps day(-1) compared with the CG, whereas sedentary behaviour decreased more than 1 hour day(-1) in the IG and showed no change in the CG. There was no intervention effect on the accelerometer-based PA nor on health measurements. After 1 year, the increase in steps per day remained significant in the IG, but sedentary activity increased again to baseline levels. This pilot study showed that the combination of a 12-week cognitive-behavioural intervention and a pedometer has a significant short-term impact on daily steps and sedentary behaviour but that the effects on total PA and long-term effects were limited."

This study investigates, in older people, the predictors of habitual PM performance in a naturalistic setting. A group of 191 community-based, older adults (aged 65-89 years) wore an actigraph over two weeks. The habitual PM task involved pressing a button twice daily (Bed-time, Rise-time) on the actigraph. Accuracy of response was calculated for Bed-time and Rise-time, determined by light, movement, and diary data. The contribution of retrospective memory and executive function to PM performance was assessed. PM was more accurate at Bed-time compared to Rise-time (p < .01), and better in the first compared to the second week (p < .01). Retrospective memory contributed small but significant unique variance (β = .24) to PM accuracy. For older adults living in the community, both contextual factors (e.g., time of day) and retrospective memory are important for individuals' ability to remember to perform daily tasks. This is relevant when planning interventions for maintaining independent living in ageing."

Most of the currently available drugs for insomnia exert adverse effects. Hence, alternative herbal therapies could be effective in treating insomnia. Ashwagandha, a proven \"Rasayana\" from ancient Ayurveda is having the required potential to treat insomnia. Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of Ashwagandha root extract in patients with insomnia and anxiety. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at Prakruti Hospital, Kalwa, Maharashtra, India. A total of 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups: test (n = 40) and placebo (n = 20) in a randomization ratio of 2:1. Test product was a capsule containing highest concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract 300 mg, and the placebo was an identical capsule containing starch. Both treatments were given twice daily with milk or water for 10 weeks. Sleep actigraphy (Respironics Philips) was used for assessment of sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Other assessments were total time in bed (sleep log), mental alertness on rising, sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scales. Results Two patients, one from each group, did not complete study and the per-protocol dataset (n = 58) included 29 and 19 patients from test and placebo, respectively. The baseline parameters were similar in the two groups at baseline. The sleep onset latency was improved in both test and placebo at five and 10 weeks. However, the SOL was significantly shorter (p, 0.019) after 10 weeks with test [29.00 (7.14)] compared to placebo [33.94 (7.65)]. Also, significant improvement in SE scores was observed with Ashwagandha which was 75.63 (2.70) for test at the baseline and increased to 83.48 (2.83) after 10 weeks, whereas for placebo the SE scores changed from 75.14 (3.73) at baseline to 79.68 (3.59) after 10 weeks. Similarly, significant improvement in sleep quality was observed with test compared to placebo (p, 0.002). Significant improvement was observed in all other sleep parameters, i.e., SOL, SE, PSQI and anxiety (HAM-A scores) with Ashwagandha root extract treatment for 10 weeks. Conclusion Ashwagandha root extract is a natural compound with sleep-inducing potential, well tolerated and improves sleep quality and sleep onset latency in patients with insomnia at a dose of 300 mg extract twice daily. It could be of potential use to improve sleep parameters in patients with insomnia and anxiety, but need further large-scale studies."

Other end points included post-dose FRC, residual volume, and inspiratory capacity (IC) at rest and during exercise. After 4 weeks, trough FRC improved with AB/FF versus placebo but did not reach significance (125 mL; P=0.0690). However, post-dose FRC, residual volume, and IC at rest improved significantly with AB/FF at Week 4 versus placebo (all P<0.0001).

After exclusion of demented PD patients, older age and cognitive impairment no longer constrained HRQoL-ADL.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      For the first time, we showed the influence of objective, home-based measured physical activity among depression and cognition on HRQoL in PD. This suggests that a multifactorial treatment approach would be most successful to increase HRQoL in PD."

            "title": "Fitbit-Based Interventions for Healthy Lifestyle Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating, remain highly prevalent, posing formidable challenges in efforts to improve cardiovascular health. While traditional interventions to promote healthy lifestyles are both costly and effective, wearable trackers, especially Fitbit devices, can provide a low-cost alternative that may effectively help large numbers of individuals become more physically fit and thereby maintain a good health status.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of this meta-analysis are (1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate a Fitbit device for healthy lifestyle outcomes (eg, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and weight) and (2) to identify which additional intervention components or study characteristics are the most effective at improving healthy lifestyle outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review was conducted, searching the following databases from 2007 to 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL (Cochrane). Studies were included if (1) they were randomized controlled trials, (2) the intervention involved the use of a Fitbit device, and (3) the reported outcomes were related to healthy lifestyles. The main outcome measures were related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight. All the studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included a Fitbit device compared with a control group. We also conducted subgroup analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to further disentangle the effects of intervention components.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our final sample comprised 41 articles reporting the results of 37 studies. For Fitbit-based interventions, we found a statistically significant increase in daily step count (mean difference [MD] 950.54, 95% CI 475.89-1425.18; P<.001) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD 6.16, 95% CI 2.80-9.51; P<.001), a significant decrease in weight (MD -1.48, 95% CI -2.81 to -0.14; P=.03), and a nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behavior (MD -10.62, 95% CI -35.50 to 14.27; P=.40 and standardized MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.26; P=.56, respectively). In general, the included studies were at low risk for bias, except for performance bias. Subgroup analysis and fsQCA demonstrated that, in addition to the effects of the Fitbit devices, setting activity goals was the most important intervention component.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of Fitbit devices in interventions has the potential to promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight. Fitbit devices may be useful to health professionals for patient monitoring and support.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42019145450; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42019145450."

            "abstract": "This observational study aimed to adapt a computer-tailored step advice for the general population into a feasible advice for breast cancer survivors and to test its usability. First, several adaptations were made to the original design (adding cancer-related physical activity (PA) barriers and beliefs, and self-management strategies to improve survivors' personal control). Second, the adapted advice was evaluated in two phases: (1) a usability testing in healthy women (n = 3) and survivors (n = 6); and (2) a process evaluation during 3 weeks in breast cancer survivors (n = 8). Preliminary usability testing revealed no problems during logging-in; however, three survivors misinterpreted some questions. After refining the questionnaire and advice, survivors evaluated the advice as interesting, attractive to read, comprehensible and credible. Inactive survivors found the advice novel, but too long. The process evaluation indicated that the majority of the women (n = 5/8) reported increased steps. Monitoring step counts by using a pedometer was perceived as an important motivator to be more active. To conclude, this study provides initial support for the usability and acceptability of a computer-tailored pedometer-based PA advice for breast cancer survivors. After testing efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention, this tool can broaden the reach of PA promotion in breast cancer survivors."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the extent to which physical activity reduces the number of hospital bed-days for Australians over 55, using an objective measure of activity.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting and participants:\n        \n      \n      9784 Newcastle residents aged 55 years or more were invited to participate. 3253 responders were eligible and wore pedometers for one week during 2005-2007; their hospital data from recruitment to 31 March 2015 were analysed (mean follow-up time: 8.2 years). Complete data for 2110 people were available for analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcome measures:\n        \n      \n      Mean annual hospital bed-days, according to individual step count.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of hospital bed-days associated with higher step counts; the incidence rate ratio per extra 1000 steps per day at baseline was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94). The disease-specific reductions were significant for admissions for cancer and diabetes, but not for cardiovascular disease. The difference between 4500 and 8800 steps per day (the upper and lower quartile boundaries for step count) was 0.36 bed-days per person per year, after adjusting for age, sex, number of medications, number of comorbidities, smoking and alcohol status, and education. When analysis was restricted to hospital admissions after the first 2 years of follow-up, the difference was 0.29 bed-days per person per year.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      More active people require less hospital care, and an achievable extra 4300 steps per day would result in an average of one less day in hospital for each 3 years of life."
