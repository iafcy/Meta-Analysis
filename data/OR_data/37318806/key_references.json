            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nIn-hospital immobility of older adults is associated with hospital-associated functional decline (HAFD). This study examined the WALK-FOR program's effects on HAFD prevention.\n## METHODS\nA quasi-experimental pre-post two-group (intervention group [IG] n = 188, control group [CG] n = 189) design was applied in two hospital internal medical units. On admission, patients reported pre-hospitalization functional status, which was assessed again at discharge and 1-month follow-up. Primary outcome was decline in basic activities of daily living (BADL), using the Modified Barthel Index. Secondary outcomes were decline in instrumental ADL (Lawton's IADL scale) and community mobility (Yale Physical Activity Survey). All participants (75.1 \u00b1 7 years old) were cognitively intact and ambulatory at admission. The WALK-FOR included a unit-tailored mobility program utilizing patient-and-staff education with a specific mobility goal (900 steps per day), measured by accelerometer.\n## RESULTS\nDecline in BADL occurred among 33% of the CG versus 23% of the IG (p = .02) at discharge, and among 43% of the CG versus 30% in the IG (p = .01) at 1-month follow-up. Similarly, 26% of the CG versus 15% of the IG declined in community mobility at 1-month follow-up (p = .01). Adjusted for major covariates, the intervention reduced the odds of decline in BADL by 41% (p = .05) at discharge and by 49% at 1-month follow-up (p = .01), and in community mobility by 63% (p = .02). There was no significant effect of the intervention on IADL decline (p = .19).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe WALK-FOR intervention is effective in reducing HAFD.\n",

We aimed to evaluate a tailored prescription of affordable digital devices in addition to usual care for people with mobility limitations admitted to aged care and neurological rehabilitation.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nWe conducted a pragmatic, outcome-assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial in 3 Australian hospitals in Sydney and Adelaide recruiting adults 18 to 101 years old with mobility limitations undertaking aged care and neurological inpatient rehabilitation. Both the intervention and control groups received usual multidisciplinary inpatient and post-hospital rehabilitation care as determined by the treating rehabilitation clinicians. In addition to usual care, the intervention group used devices to target mobility and physical activity problems, individually prescribed by a physiotherapist according to an intervention protocol, including virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices for 6 months in hospital and at home. Co-primary outcomes were mobility (performance-based Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]; continuous version; range 0 to 3; higher score indicates better mobility) and upright time as a proxy measure of physical activity (proportion of the day upright measured with activPAL) at 6 months. The dataset was analysed using intention-to-treat principles. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000936628). Between 22 September 2014 and 10 November 2016, 300 patients (mean age 74 years, SD 14; 50% female; 54% neurological condition causing activity limitation) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 149) or control (n = 151) using a secure online database (REDCap) to achieve allocation concealment. Six-month assessments were completed by 258 participants (129 intervention, 129 control). Intervention participants received on average 12 (SD 11) supervised inpatient sessions using 4 (SD 1) different devices and 15 (SD 5) physiotherapy contacts supporting device use after hospital discharge. Changes in mobility scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group from baseline (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 1.5 [0.7]; control group, 1.5 [0.8]) to 6 months (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 2.3 [0.6]; control group, 2.1 [0.8]; mean between-group difference 0.2 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3; p = 0.006). However, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for upright time at 6 months (mean [SD] proportion of the day spent upright at 6 months: intervention group, 18.2 [9.8]; control group, 18.4 [10.2]; mean between-group difference -0.2, 95% CI -2.7 to 2.3; p = 0.87). Scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group across most secondary mobility outcomes, but there was no evidence of a difference between groups for most other secondary outcomes including self-reported balance confidence and quality of life. No adverse events were reported in the intervention group. Thirteen participants died while in the trial (intervention group: 9; control group: 4) due to unrelated causes, and there was no evidence of a difference between groups in fall rates (unadjusted incidence rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.83; p = 0.43). Study limitations include 15%-19% loss to follow-up at 6 months on the co-primary outcomes, as anticipated; the number of secondary outcome measures in our trial, which may increase the risk of a type I error; and potential low statistical power to demonstrate significant between-group differences on important secondary patient-reported outcomes.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, we observed improved mobility in people with a wide range of health conditions making use of digitally enabled rehabilitation, whereas time spent upright was not impacted.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register; ACTRN12614000936628.\n",

This study aimed to determine whether the use of an activity diary for goal setting during occupational therapy would reduce pain, and improve psychological and physical performance in patients after total knee arthroplasty.\n## METHODS\nA total of 41 total knee arthroplasty participants from two cohorts were recruited in the study and allocated by convenience to either the experimental group using an activity diary (n\u2009=\u200920) or the control group (n\u2009=\u200921). Occupational therapy intervention (1-2 weeks postoperatively) to promote goal achievement was performed in both groups, and self-monitoring was performed in the diary group by using the activity diary. The outcome indices were Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, pain (resting pain, walking pain), pain catastrophizing (rumination, helplessness, and magnification), anxiety, depression, pain self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Data were evaluated by using analysis of variance analyses with post hoc tests.\n## RESULTS\nA time-by-group interaction emerged for Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, walking pain, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and physical activity level (p\u2009<\u20090.05), both favouring the diary group.

The aim of this study was to determine if feedback from a commercial activity monitor improves activity levels over the first 6 weeks after total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n## METHODS\nOne hundred sixty-three consecutive subjects undergoing primary TKA or THA were randomized into 2 groups. Subjects received an activity tracker with the step display obscured 2 weeks before surgery and completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). On day 1 after surgery, participants were randomized to either the \"feedback (FB) group\" or the \"no feedback (NFB) group.\" The FB group was able to view their daily step count and was given a daily step goal. Participants in the NFB group wore the device with the display obscured for 2 weeks after surgery, after which time they were also able to see their daily step count but did not receive a formal step goal.

Participants were randomized to either receive feedback of their step counts using an activity tracker wristband or not. The primary study endpoint was the mean step count during the first 5 postoperative days (PODs).\n## RESULTS\nA total of 132 patients were randomized.

These results could not be confirmed in the open surgery arm. Possible reasons were a higher age and significantly more comorbidities in the open intervention group. Patients who achieved more than the median cumulative step count had a significantly shorter hospital stay and lower morbidity in both arms. The average step count also correlated with the length of hospital stay (R\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.341, P\u2009<\u20090.001).\n## CONCLUSION\nThis study is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the use and feasibility of activity tracking to monitor and enhance postoperative mobilization in abdominal surgery. Our results demonstrate that activity tracking can enhance perioperative mobilization after laparoscopic surgery.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02834338.\n",
