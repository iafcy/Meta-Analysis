**Abstract: Interventions via the Internet are promising regarding the promotion of healthy habits**
among youth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an adapted version of StayingFit
to promote healthy eating habits and the measurement adequacy of anthropometric markers among
adolescents. A web school-based 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial examining 7th to 9th
grade students was conducted in twelve schools in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The schools’ students were
randomly distributed into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group participated
in StayingFit, an online program designed to encourage and guide healthy eating habits and control
body weight. Data on food consumption, anthropometry, physical activity level, and sedentary
behavior were collected from all of the students at the beginning of and after the 12-month study.
Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected at baseline. The baseline data indicated high
rates of overweight (14.4% overweight and 8.5% obese), insufficiently active (87.6%), and sedentary
(63.7%). Furthermore, few adolescents regularly consumed fruits (18.8%) and vegetables/legumes
(16.4%). Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention.
At the end of the follow-up period, students in the intervention group had a 43% increased chance
of regularly consuming beans (OR = 1.43, 95% CIs = 1.10–1.86) and a 35% decreased chance of
regularly consuming soft drinks (OR = 0.65, 95% CIs = 0.50–0.84). No differences were found between

the groups studied with regard to the anthropometric parameters. Despite these modest results,
the implementation of a web intervention can be beneficial and help promote positive changes in
adolescent eating habits.

**Keywords: adolescents; school-based nutrition intervention; web-based platform**

**1. Introduction**

Interventions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors using non-digital means of communication are
strategies to promote health among adolescents [1–4]. Adolescence is a period of life of greater autonomy
in food choices and associated with reduced physical activity [5]. Although these interventions are
considered as important strategic actions, their effectiveness still presents limitations for this age
group [6,7].
By contrast, adolescents who use computer-based interventions (CBIs) and, in particular,
computer-tailored interventions (CTI) [8], respond better to personal motivational factors that influence
behaviour [9–11]. In addition, these intervention modalities can be performed in combination with
other actions and compose a set of comprehensive health education programs.
To align with the transformations that have occurred in contemporary society because of the
increased use of computer resources, and given the potential for the application of this technology as an
educational and preventive tool in the field of adolescent health, several researchers have recently been
focused on the development of computerized, innovative, and specific programs for this purpose [5,12].
Different studies have been conducted to investigate the evidence regarding the efficacy of
nutritional interventions to promote healthy eating habits and lifestyles using interactive media such
as the Internet [13]. Changes in anthropometric parameters (e.g., weight reduction and body mass
index [BMI]), increased consumption of fruits and vegetables [14–16], reduced fat consumption [17–19],
and increased dairy product consumption [16] have been observed in studies of adolescents (in the
intervention group) conducted by [20] and [21]. Despite these potential benefits, the results have been
heterogeneous [22–24].
Despite the increased access to the Internet and mobile phone services, digital interventions
to promote healthy eating and physical activity among this population have been used only
recently in Brazil, even though the need to implement such tools for this purpose is clear [25].
Thus, introducing computerized technology to promote healthy habits and assess their effects on
adolescent health and nutrition indicators (with the potential to reach large population segments at
a relatively low cost) is a necessary and promising field of action [26].
Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of an adapted version of StayingFit to promote
healthy eating habits and the measurement adequacy of anthropometric markers among adolescents.
The original program was developed by researchers at the School of Medicine at Stanford University,
California, USA [21,27] and was made available for adaptation and the evaluation of its effectiveness
in Brazil. Earlier research was effective in decreasing the BMI percentile; increasing fruit and vegetable
intake; increasing the level of physical activity; while providing a reduction in the soft drinks
consumption and in the adolescents’ screen time of intervention [21,27]. The indicators of satisfaction,
efficiency and effectiveness evaluated the usability test and the feedback from the pre-test and the
focus group demonstrated that the cultural adaptation of StayingFit may, in fact, be adequate for
the population for which it is intended (publication in progress). The adapted version resulted in
a CBI that is used via the Internet and uses general feedback to promote healthy eating habits and
healthy weight promotion. Thus, it was hypothesized that the StayingFit Brazil would produce healthy
nutrition and measurement adequacy of anthropometric markers, which would lead the intervention
group to a more favorable direction when compared to the no-intervention group.

**2. Materials and Methods**

_2.1. Design, Population, and Sample_

This 12-month community cluster trial was conducted from September 2016 to September 2017.
Male and female 7th to 9th graders who were enrolled in twelve mid-sized public schools of the public
comprehensive education system in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil participated in this research. The study
was registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials under the registration number RBR-7qgnbn.
The methodology was designed in accordance with the recommendations of CONSORT 2010 [28].
To calculate the priori sample size, the following parameters were used: a ratio between the
intervention and control participants equal to 1, a significance level of 95%, a statistical power of 0.80,
and an effect size (for BMI) of 0.20 [29]. This calculation resulted in an estimate of 600 individuals.
To adjust for an anticipated 20% attrition, the sample was increased to 720 students (360 in the control
group and 360 in the intervention group). These calculations were performed using G*Power version
3.1.3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).
Twelve schools were eligible for this study (computational structure). These schools were
randomly distributed into the intervention group (four schools) and the control group (eight schools).
Of the 1800 students eligible for this study, 895 provided a signed informed consent document and
agreed to participate in the study (Figure 1). The Ethics Committee of the School of Nutrition of the
Federal University of Bahia approved this study (n 893.944/14).

_2.2. Intervention Plan_

StayingFit is an online program organized to encourage and guide weight control and healthy
eating habits [21]. It is based on the tenants of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) [21,30]. It integrates
techniques and concepts from two main approaches: the cognitive therapy, with techniques destined
to the correction of beliefs and dysfunctional thoughts; and the behavioral therapy, used to modify
inappropriate behaviors. StayingFit Brazil adopted a generalist form of feedback and used messages
guided by the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population [31] and the recommendations of the World
Health Organization (WHO) concerning aspects related to the practice of physical activity [32].
After completing food frequency and physical activity questionnaires, automated feedback was
immediately displayed on the computer screen. StayingFit Brazil was made available to the participants
in the control group after it was implemented in the intervention schools.
The program also includes the participation of parents and teachers. Parents received printed
material with the content of the program sessions. Teachers also got involved with the “StayingFit
[Brazil FAQs” tool, which is available on the “StayingFit Brazil” site (http://stayingfitbrasil.ufba.br/)](http://stayingfitbrasil.ufba.br/)
and contains information on the program’s content.
Because StayingFit is an American program, Barrera et al. (2013) and Castro et al. (2015)
culturally adapted it to the cultural standards, meanings, and values of Brazil via a systematized
process that considered language, culture, and context [33,34]. The adapted version was made
available in the computer labs of each school in the intervention group, and a nutritionist and assistant
(i.e., nutrition student) supervised the implementation of the program.

_2.3. StayingFit Brazil Intervention Components_

This intervention program contains 16 independent sessions. The prerequisite for performing
the subsequent session was to complete the previous session. Participants were encouraged to read
through the content, complete the exercises, logs, and feedback from the sessions. The components
of StayingFit Brazil are summarized in Table 1. The topics/content of StayingFit Brazil are presented
in Table 2.
StayingFit Brazil was delivered through a virtual learning environment (AVA) [35]. To create this
[AVA, Moodle (https://moodle.org/) was chosen because it is free, multilingual, flexible, and customizable](https://moodle.org/)
software and because it is the official learning platform of the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).
Thus, each participant was given a username and password to log in and participate in the program.
The research team defined each user’s name and password based on their unique identification numbers
to ensure the individuality and confidentiality of participants’ information. The students were unaware
of their usernames and passwords to prevent the use of the program without the supervision of the
project team and ensure the privacy of their information. The activities of StayingFit Brazil were
developed in full-time schools, in the afternoon shift in order not to harm the progress of compulsory
activities. Students accessed the sessions once a week for 30 min in the computer room of each of the
schools in the intervention group and was supervised by a nutritionist and an assistant (nutrition
student) to help adolescents to use the program and overcome technical difficulties of access.

**Table 1. Components that structure the virtual learning environment of StayingFit Brazil.**

**Components** **Description**

Each session contains 10 to 15 pages of online content with texts aimed
Thematic Sessions at 7th and 8th grade reading level and that can be read in approximately
30 min.

At the end of each session, students answered questions about their
Learning questions learning on that week’s topic. The questions (multiple choice and
open-ended answers) evaluated the assimilated knowledge.


Session feedback

Food Log

Physical activity log

Hunger and satiety scale


These questions assess knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy
related to the specific skills taught during the session. To assess student
involvement and achievement, students evaluated the levels at which
the content was useful, interesting, and fun.

Program users completed an online food-intake questionnaire regarding
the last 7 days. After the adolescents had submitted their food frequency
data, the participants received automated (general) feedback aligned
with the recommendations of the Food Guide for the Brazilian
Population, 2014 [31].

The adolescents reported how often they had physical activity over the
last 7 days. They received automated (general) feedback on the
adequacy of their physical activity aligned with the recommendations of
the WHO [32].

A hunger/satiety scale ranging from 0 (hungry/voracious) to 10 (satiety)
was used to teach adolescents to attend more to their appetite.
Participants were encouraged to monitor their levels of hunger
throughout the day, to start eating when their internal signs of appetite
reached a hunger level of 3, and to stop eating when they reached
a level 7.


Adolescents were encouraged to record their goals regarding food

_2.4. Data Collection_

All students across the twelve schools received anthropometric measurements, and information
concerning sexual maturity, food consumption, physical activity, and level of sedentarism were
collected at the beginning of the study and after 12 months. Information about the socioeconomic
conditions of the students’ families was obtained at baseline.

2.4.1. Food Consumption

Food consumption over the last 7 days was measured based on the self-reported consumption
frequency of food using the following food groups or preparation categories: beans, at least one type
of vegetables, raw salad, cooked vegetables or legumes, fruits, milk, soft drinks, candies, cookies,
crackers, snacks, fried snacks, and ultraprocessed meats [36]. The first six items were considered as
healthy and adequate food markers, whereas the last seven were considered as markers of unhealthy
diets [37,38]. The consumption of these foods was expressed regular consumption (adolescents who
consumed them at least 5 of the 7 days before the study) or less frequent consumption (adolescents
who consumed them between 0 and 4 days of the 7 days prior to the study) [37].

2.4.2. Anthropometric Data

All measurements followed the procedures recommended by the Anthropometric Standardization
Reference Manual [39]. Body weight was obtained using a Marte[®] portable scale (Marte Balanças
e Aparelhos de Precisão, São Paulo, Brazil). Height was measured using a Seca Leicester Height
Measure[®] stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). BMI or the Quetelet Index (P/E2) was calculated
using the relationship between weight (kg) and height squared (m[2]). The cut-off points were expressed


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1674_ 7 of 18

as percentiles for BMI, according to sex and age, which is recommended by the WHO (2007) [40]
to classify the nutritional status of adolescents. Individuals with BMI-for-age lower than the 3rd
percentile were classified as malnourished; those with a value greater than or equal to the 3rd percentile
but below the 85th percentile were classified as eutrophic; and those with a value equal to or greater
than the 85th percentile were classified as overweight (where greater than 85th percentile but less
than 97th percentile was classified as overweight, and greater than or equal to 97th percentile was
classified as obese). Waist circumference (WC) was measured using a Seca[®] fibreglass inelastic tape
(Seca, Hamburg, Germany). with a centimeter scale applied at the midpoint between the last rib
and the upper iliac crest of the adolescent. The waist-height ratio (WHR) was obtained by dividing
WC (cm) by height (cm) [41]. Hip circumference (HC) was measured at the level of the maximum
posterior extension of the buttocks. Arm circumference (AC) and tricipital skinfold (TSF) thickness
were measured at the midpoint between the acromion and the olecranon of the left or non-dominant
arm. Subscapular skinfold (SSSF) thickness was measured at the inferior angle of the scapula. A Lange[®]

scientific body fat caliper with a precision of 0.1 mm was used to obtain TSF and SSSF (Lange Skinfold
Caliper, Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc., Cambridge, MD, USA).
The researchers were instructed to perform a third measurement when the first two measurements
were inconsistent. Nevertheless, two measurements were recorded for each variable, and the mean
between the measurements was taken as the final value.

2.4.3. Level of Physical Activity and Sedentarism

The overall physical activity indicator was used to assess the physical activity level of
adolescents [36]. Those who accumulated 300 mins or more of weekly physical activity were
considered as active, whereas those who accumulated between 1 and 299 min of weekly physical
activity were considered as insufficiently active [32]. Sedentary habit was evaluated based on the
time spent in sedentary activities, which was considered as the number of hours per day in which the
adolescents watching television, using the computer, playing videogames and doing other activities.
In this case, the question was, “On an ordinary weekday, how long do you spend sitting, watching TV,
using the computer, playing videogames, talking with friends, or doing other activities? (not including
Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and time sitting at school)”. Participants who reported habitually
spending 2 or more hours of screen time per day were considered as showing sedentary behavior [42].
Although not validated, the questionnaires were widely used in the studies of the National Adolescent
School-Based Health Survey (PeNSE). The PeNSE is a school-based national epidemiological survey,
conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in collaboration with the
Ministry of Health (MS) to monitor the health conditions of Brazilian adolescents [36].

2.4.4. Sexual Maturity Data

The onset of pubescence among females is classified based on stage II breast development, and the
end (post-pubescence) of the growth spurt is characterized based on age at menarche. For males,
the onset of the growth spurt (pubescence) is indicated as Tanner stage III, and final (post-pubescence)
development is indicated by stage IV genitalia development [43].
The identification of these stages was made by the students’ self-description with the aid of
portraits provided by the interviewers. Schematics that reproduced the different stages of puberty were
used to self-evaluate the characteristics of the breasts, the onset age of menarche, and pubic hair growth
among girls; schematics were also used to evaluate genitalia and pubic hair growth among boys [44,45].
As such, students were classified into three categories: pre-pubertal, pubertal, and post-pubertal.

2.4.5. Demographic and Socioeconomic Data

In addition to gender and age, socioeconomic data such as mother’s and/or head of household’s
education (Illiterate or incomplete primary education/completed primary education or incomplete
secondary education/completed secondary education or incomplete higher education/completed


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1674_ 8 of 18

higher education) and assets were collected. A household assets score was constructed based on
having a bathroom, a salaried maid, an automobile, a microcomputer, a dishwasher, a refrigerator,
a freezer, a washing machine, a DVD player, a microwave, a motorcycle, and a dryer according to the
questionnaire of the Brazilian Association of Research Companies-Associação Brasileira de Empresas
de Pesquisa: ABEP (2013). Although it is not a validated questionnaire, it is widely used in Brazilian
studies to evaluate the interviewees’ economic status. Each item received a weight equivalent to
the inverse of the frequency of its possession or presence in the sample studied. A score for each
adolescent was obtained by adding the weights of the respective items. The distribution of the score
was categorized into tertiles with respect to the distribution observed in the sample according to
a previously described method [37].

2.4.6. Data Entry

EpiData version 3.0 (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) was used to process and construct
the database. After reviewing the questionnaires and correcting errors that resulted from the coding
initially performed in the field, the data were re-entered. The simple frequencies of the variables were
verified, and the consistency between questions and answers were examined via instruments used to
clean the data.

2.4.7. Statistical Analyses

Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize the sample. Proportions were used to
describe the categorical data, and means (standard deviations) were used to describe the continuous
variables. Chi-square and Student’s t-tests were used to identify the possible differences between
the intervention and control groups at baseline. The response variables were the changes in the
anthropometric indicators and the frequency of food consumption. In addition, the main independent
variable was use of the intervention (yes/no). Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to
evaluate the influence of the intervention program on the changes in anthropometric profile and food
intake. GEE is a technique appropriately used for repeated measures because it reflects the relationship
between a continuous or binary response variable and its corresponding predictor variables; moreover,
it considers the correlation between the measures at each moment in time [46]. The regression
parameters (β and OR) were estimated using the pseudo-likelihood method with the robust option to
correct the standard error in situations involving repeated observations.
Possible confounds were explored using the theoretical framework available in the
literature [1,47,48] and the dataset of this study. The analyses adjusted for the following
variables: sex, age, economic condition, caregiver education, physical activity level, and pubertal
development [2,15,49]. Two-tailed tests and a significance level of 5% were used. The analyses were
performed using Stata 14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

**3. Results**

The initial sample (baseline) was composed of 895 students (428 in the intervention group; 467 in
the control group; Figure 1), which is a larger number than the sample size calculated, but these
participants were maintained in the analysis for ethical reasons. Regarding the demographic and
pubertal development characteristics of the sample, the mean age of the adolescents was 14.5 years
(1.42), 51.6% were male, and the majority were in the post-pubertal stage (85.7%). In addition, 27.0% of
the adolescents belonged to families whose guardians had low education levels (illiterate/incomplete
elementary education). Regarding nutritional status, 5.9% of the participants were malnourished,
71.2% were eutrophic, and 22.9% were overweight (14.4% overweight and 8.5% obese). Regarding the
levels of physical activity and sedentarism, 87.6% were considered as insufficiently active, and 63.7%
were sedentary (68.8%, intervention and 59.0%, control; p = 0.002). Additional information is shown in
Table 3. The two groups significantly differed with regard to the following anthropometric characteristics

To evaluate the effect of the intervention, 285 (66.6%) and 314 (67.2%) of the participants in the
intervention and control groups, respectively, had anthropometric parameters, and 288 (67.3%) and
316 (68.5%) of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, provided food
consumption data (see Figure 1). The characteristics of the participants were similar to those of the
dropouts with the exception of age (14.25 (1.22) years vs. 14.99 (1.66) years, respectively; p < 0.001),
weight (54.48 (13.61) kg vs. 56.44 (13.15) kg, respectively; p = 0.044), AC (24.47 (4.02) cm vs. 25.08

_p = 0.029; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Losses due to follow-up were expected and occurred_
primarily because of school dropout and refusal to participate in the second stage of the study.

There was an increase in the anthropometric parameters in both groups studied throughout
the follow-up, except for arm circumference and waist-to-height ratio in the intervention group;
Moreover, there was no difference at the end of the study between both groups. In both groups,
there was a reduction in the regular consumption of soft drink, but with greater expressiveness in the
intervention group. In the intervention group, there was a reduction in the regular consumption of
crackers, cookies, candies and milk (p < 0.05). Besides that, there was a difference at the end of the study
between both groups for regular consumption of cooked vegetables or legumes, milk, crackers and
soft drinks (Table 4). However, some differences were not maintained in more robust analyzes.
Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to explore the effect of the intervention. At the
end of the follow-up, the chance of consuming beans increased by 43% (OR = 1.43, 95% CIs = 1.10–1.86),
and the chance of regularly consuming soft drinks reduced by 35% (OR = 0.65, 95% CIs = 0.50–0.84)
among adolescents who underwent the intervention. No significant differences were found with regard
to the anthropometric parameters studied. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, level of physical
activity, household assets score, caregiver education and pubertal development (Tables 5 and 6).

**4. Discussion**

The goal of this study was to evaluate an adapted version of StayingFit, a CBI promoting healthy
eating and weight control among adolescents. The baseline data indicated high rates of overweight
individuals (14.4% overweight and 8.5% obese), insufficiently active (87.6%), and sedentary lifestyles
(63.7%) Furthermore, fewer adolescents regularly consumed fruits (18.8%) and vegetables/legumes
(16.4%). This scenario, similar to that of the Brazilian youth and adolescents from other countries in
the last decades [50–52], indicates an urgent need to motivate adolescents to adopt healthy eating
and lifestyle habits, such as physical activity, as a strategy for reducing risk factors and chronic
non-communicable diseases already at this stage of life [5–7].
Some limitations of non-digital intervention programs, such as low motivation of the participants,
lack of time for the intervention, high costs, among others, can be minimized in interventions
that use digital technology, placing them as an alternative to face-to-face interventions [21].
Hence, we hypothesized that the StayingFit Brazil leads to positive outcomes in healthy nutrition and
measurement adequacy of anthropometric markers. In line with the hypothesis, positive effects found
after 1 year of intervention appears to be modest.
Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to explore the effect of the StayingFit Brazil.
Compared with the control, the intervention was associated with reduced consumption of soft drinks
(OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.84) and greater consumption of beans (OR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.10–1.86).
These results suggest that eating habits characteristic of this age group may be modified with this type
of intervention. In turn, no differences in the observed anthropometric parameters were observed,
after adjustment of the estimates by confounding factors. These results are consistent other universal
prevention programs interventions which have also failed to find changes in BMI and other adiposity
measurements in adolescents [15,16].
Although our intervention did not seem to have strong enough effects on the target behaviors to
affect anthropometric parameters, the increased odds of regular consumption of beans (43% increase)
associated with the intervention is noteworthy. This is a leguminous traditionally found in the diet of


-----

the Brazilian population, and its consumption is strongly associated with protection against several
diseases [53,54]. This leguminous is an important source of fibre, protein, folate, zinc, and other
nutrients, and beans combined with rice is a meal with adequate nutritional value. Studies point
to a reduction in the frequency of beans consumption among adolescents over the last 10 years.
For instance, results from the National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE) performed
in 2009 and 2015 show a reduction by a little over 10% in the proportion of students that regularly
consume beans [36,55]. Adopting strategies that encourage beans consumption is necessary on account
of the benefits presented by this leguminous. The intervention was also associated with lower odds
of regular consumption of soft drinks (reduction of 35%). This is an important result in light of the
effect of sugary drinks on obesity [56,57]. The consumption of sugary drinks (including soft drinks)
has been considered an obesity-promoting factor and reducing their consumption has been identified
as an important measure for controlling weight gain and, consequently, the development of chronic
non-communicable diseases in children and adolescents [58].
Even if studies in this field have similar goals (i.e., evaluating the effects of computerized
interventions to promote healthy eating and anthropometric parameters among adolescents),
differences exist regarding the intervention methodologies used (e.g., the study design, intervention type
(CBI or CTI)), duration of intervention and follow-up, number and/or frequency of educational sessions
held), which compromises the comparison of the results.
Although they are modest, our findings corroborate the positive effect of similar web-based
strategies on reducing the consumption of sugary drinks [15]. Ezendam and colleagues (2012)
showed that the FATaintPHAT intervention conducted with Dutch adolescents was associated with
a lower likelihood (OR = 0.54, 95% CIs = 0.34 to 0.88) of consuming more than 400 mL of sugary
drinks per day during the first 4 months of follow-up. They also showed a higher consumption
of vegetables (in grams/day; β = 19.34, 95% CIs = 7.54 to 31.21) compared with their control [15].
The meta-analysis conducted by Vargas Garcia et al. (2017) showed that participants who receive
intervention (via randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and non-RCTs) consume 66 mL less
sugary (sugar-sweetened or diet) soft drinks (95% CIs = −130 to −2.0 p = 0.04) [59]. Previous intervention
studies have not evaluated the consumption of legumes via the web, which highlights the novelty of
the current study.
By contrast, previous interventions have shown the positive effects of web-based on fruit, vegetable,
and fat consumption [14,16,18,20,60] as well as anthropometric markers [20]. Mauriello et al. (2010)
evaluated of the Health in Motion CTI performed among American adolescents and observed a greater
consumption of fruit and vegetables 2 months (3.86 vs. 3.0), 6 months (3.55 vs. 2.73), and 12 months
(3.67 vs. 2.97) after the intervention (p < 0.001) [14]. Chamberland et al. (2017) [16] demonstrated
a higher consumption of daily servings of fruits and vegetables in the intervention group via the Team
Nutriathlon CTI for Canadian adolescents compared with a control group (p ≤ 0.05). Haerens et al.
(2006) developed a CTI using a self-explanatory CD-ROM and indicated a significantly higher reduction
in fat intake in the intervention group (−20 g/day) compared with the control group (−10 g/day, p < 0.05).
Likewise, the percentage of energy from fat was significantly reduced by 9% in the intervention group
and by 5% in the control group (p < 0.001); however, this favorable outcome was observed for girls
only [17]. The same results were reiterated in later publications [18,19]. Haerens et al. (2006) found
significantly lower increases in BMI (F = 12.52, p < 0.05) and the BMI z-score (F = 8.61, p < 0.05) in the
intervention group, and a positive result was found only among girls [20]. Because the few existing
studies focus only on the transfer of nutritional knowledge via the web, a strong need exists for studies
to investigate whether computer-based nutrition education tools are beneficial in supporting students’
abilities to translate their acquired nutritional knowledge into nutritional behavior.
A possible explanation for the modest findings of this study includes the adopted education format
(computer-based intervention (CBI)), which is a modality little explored in nutrition education [10].
There is a consensus among health communication scholars that personalized information is more
effective for motivating the adoption of health protection behaviors than is general communication,


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1674_ 14 of 18

which uses undifferentiated messages. However, all communication provided by StayingFit was
based on messages focusing on the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in adolescents (rather than
treatment mode).
Another explanation may be related to the number of evaluated outcomes. Results of
a systematic review to evaluate the effect of digital nutritional interventions failed when focused on
multiple outcomes [23]. The complexity of the intervention in question should also be considered.
Corroborating this hypothesis, a review on the prevention of risk factors for cardiovascular disease
concluded that programs addressing multiple health behaviors were not effective at reducing obesity
among children [61].
In addition, the participation of parents was modest: a systematic review of digital interventions
for the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity among adolescents showed that the
interventions produced a greater effect when they included the active participation of parents [24].
Considering the changes assessment was done based on the application of self-filled questionnaires
pre- and post-intervention, instead of direct observation of such behaviors, one cannot discard the
possibility that in the post-intervention, the students could have answered according to what they
learned during the activities developed in the program and not according to what they actually did.
It is important to highlight the possibility that the control group’s school had developed its own
initiatives to promote health; for ethical reasons, no attempt was made to prevent it.

_Strengths and Limitations of the Study_

This study has as merit in its novelty: It is the first to evaluate the effect of a CBI to promote
healthy habits and nutrition indicators among adolescents in Brazil. The following methodological
aspects of this study ensure that the results are robust: (i) the randomized clinical trial design reduced
the interference of possible confounds; (ii) StayingFit was designed to encourage adolescents to use the
technology in a smart and effective manner, promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyles in a way that
they would not be harmed by increasing the time that they spend in front of the screen; (iii) instead,
the program was implemented during school hours and did not contribute to an increase in sedentary
behavior; (iv) In addition, the StayingFit had a high participation rate, 85% of the adolescents completed
the 16 sessions of the program.
In turn, some limitations of the study should be considered. Despite the efforts to locate the
children in the school, there was a significant number of losses during follow-up—approximately 30%.
Results were similar to those of Mauriello et al. (2010) and Maes et al. (2011), with 27% and 48% of
losses during the follow-up, respectively [14,57]. However, they were higher than the results found in
the original StayingFit, with 15% of losses during follow-up [20]. Such losses were mainly due to school
dropout and refusal to participate in the second phase of the project. According to the school census,
the percentage of school dropouts in Salvador in 2014 and 2015 was 5.9%, and this percentage was 6.1%
for students from public schools [62]. Among the factors that contribute to this problem are distance
from school in association with lack of school transportation; precarious socioeconomic situation,
which leads students to start working before they even finish school; violence in schools; lack of interest;
diseases/learning difficulties of the students; and lack of school structure [63]. In turn, the study design,
the balance of losses between the intervention and control groups, and the homogeneity of the study
population contribute to the mitigation of eventual biases. Considering that the assessment of changes
in habits was based on self-report questionnaires completed during the pre- and post-intervention
periods instead of direct observation of these behaviors, one cannot ignore the possibility that the
students provided answers that were consistent with what they had learned in the program activities
but not with what they were actually doing.

**5. Conclusions**

The results of the present study suggest a positive effect of the adapted version of StayingFit with
regard to an increase in the frequency of beans consumption and a decrease in the frequency of soft

drink consumption among elementary school students. It appears that implementing a web-based
intervention would be beneficial and could be used to promote changes in eating habits and health
among adolescents. Even though StayingFit is not a multi-level intervention, it can be integrated into
a school environment that has implemented a nutritional education program in the curriculum or
increased the healthy food availability in its environment. Certainly, the challenge is to assure the
maintenance of these results over time. Thus, the development of strategies to promote the maintenance
of these results is clearly a relevant aspect of the research agenda of this field of knowledge. It has been
shown that chronic non-communicable diseases represent the greatest burden of disease in the country,
and actions to promote health in the child and adolescent are of the utmost importance so that healthy
habits in childhood and adolescence are maintained throughout life.
