Abstract

Background: Internet access has grown markedly in Latinos during the past decade. However, there have been no
Internet-based physical activity interventions designed for Latinos, despite large disparities in lifestyle-related
conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, particularly in Latina women. The current study tested the efficacy of a
6-month culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based physical activity intervention.

Methods: Inactive Latinas (N = 205) were randomly assigned to the Tailored Physical Activity Internet Intervention
or the Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Participants in both groups received emails on a tapered schedule
over 6 months to alert them to new content on the website. The primary outcome was minutes/week of moderate
to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at 6 months as measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall; activity was also
measured by accelerometers. Data were collected between 2011 and 2014 and analyzed in 2015 at the University
of California, San Diego.

Results: Increases in minutes/week of MVPA were significantly greater in the Intervention Group compared to the
Control Group (mean difference = 50.00, SE = 9.5, p < 0.01). Increases in objectively measured MVPA were also
significantly larger in the Intervention Group (mean differences = 31.0, SE = 10.7, p < .01). The Intervention Group was also
significantly more likely to meet national physical activity guidelines at 6 months (OR = 3.12, 95 % CI 1.46–6.66, p < .05).
Conclusion: Findings from the current study suggest that this Internet-delivered individually tailored intervention
successfully increased MVPA in Latinas compared to a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group.

cite limited transportation and childcare duties as key
barriers to physical activity [11–13]. Such approaches
may also be limited in their potential for widespread dissemination. Home-based PA interventions delivered
through mediated channels have great potential for
broader dissemination for the Latina population. Accordingly, a recent study showed that a PA intervention using printed, mail-delivered materials that were
individually tailored based on theoretical constructs
(Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical
Model [14, 15]) was successful at increasing PA in inactive Latinas [16, 17].

While this study showed the intervention to be effective
at increasing PA, the print-based, mail delivered format
may not be the most efficient or cost-effective media
channel for widespread dissemination. Recent data show
that Internet access has grown markedly in Latinos during
the past decade, with 83 % of Latinos reporting using the
Internet regularly in 2014 (vs. 64 % in 2009) [18, 19]. Additionally, the largest gains were seen in foreign-born and
Spanish-language dominant Latinos, who also tend to report the lowest rates of PA [9, 10, 20].

Given the potential of the web for broad dissemination,
we recently adapted our effective Spanish language printbased PA intervention for the web. We conducted a series
of focus groups with Latinas regarding their Internet use
behaviors (i.e. why, when and how often they use the web,
and the types of sites they visit), and used this information
to build a web-based version of our intervention. We subsequently conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the intervention relative to a Spanishlanguage Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. We
hypothesized that Latinas randomized to the Tailored Physical Activity Internet Intervention Group would report significantly greater increases in minutes per week of
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from baseline to 6 months (post-treatment) than those in the Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Findings from this
study are described in this paper.

Methods
Design
The Pasos Hacia La Salud study (N = 205) was a randomized controlled trial of a 6-month Spanish-language,
culturally and linguistically adapted, individually tailored,
Internet-based Physical Activity Intervention, compared
to a Spanish-language Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. The intervention was based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Social Cognitive Theory
(SCT) [14, 15] and emphasized behavioral strategies for
increasing activity levels, including goal-setting, selfmonitoring, problem-solving barriers, increasing social
support, and rewarding oneself for meeting physical activity goals. Data were collected between 2011 and 2014


and analyzed in 2015. The primary outcome was minutes per week of MVPA as measured by the 7-Day
Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR). This measure was
used in preliminary studies, and thus was used to determine statistical power for the current study. The level of
power was set at 80 % a priori and was used to determine the number of participants needed given estimated
effect sizes from our previous studies. Minutes of MVPA
were also measured objectively using accelerometers,
and this served as an additional primary outcome.

Setting and sample
The study was conducted at the University of California,
San Diego, and human subjects approval was obtained
from the Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria
included the following: self-identified as Hispanic or
Latino (or of a group defined as Hispanic/Latino by the
Census Bureau); self-reported insufficient physical activity (defined as participating in MVPA less than 60 minutes per week); 18–65 years of age; verified BMI
<45 kg/m[2]; regular access to an Internet-connected computer through home, work, or their community (e.g.,
public library, community center, neighbor’s house); and
willingness to be randomly assigned to either of the two
study conditions.

Exclusion criteria included the following: unable to
read or speak Spanish fluently; history of coronary heart
disease (history of myocardial infarction or symptoms of
angina), diabetes, stroke, orthopedic conditions which
limit mobility, or any other serious medical condition
that would make unsupervised physical activity unsafe
(as determined by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire); [21] current pregnancy or plan to conceive in
the next year; planning to move from the area within the
next year; hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder in
the past 3 years; taking medication that may impair
physical activity tolerance or performance; and/or scoring less than 17 (i.e. inadequate functional health literacy) on the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in
Adults (STOFHLA) [22].

Sample size calculation was based on the assumption
that we would have 80 % power for testing the null hypothesis that the intention to treat effect is zero, versus
the two-sided alternative that the effect is different for
those randomized to the Intervention Group versus
those randomized to the Control Group. These estimates were based on the reported change in MVPA over
6 months amongst a subset of Latina participants who
reported having Internet access in our previous
individually-tailored, print-based study [16, 17].

Protocol
A detailed description of study protocols can be found
elsewhere [23]. Briefly, the primary modes of recruitment


-----

included paid ads on Craigslist.org, participant referrals,
and advertising in local Spanish language newspapers, and
at local churches, stores, and health-focused events. After
potential participants were screened over the phone for
eligibility, they attended an orientation session and completed the informed consent process. Participants returned
for a second visit during which the following baseline
measures were completed: height and weight, waist and
hip circumference, blood pressure, and percent body fat.
At this visit, participants also received an ActiGraph
GT3X+ accelerometer, with instructions to wear the accelerometer during waking hours for 7 consecutive days.
One week following the measurement visit, participants
returned with the accelerometer and completed a 10-min
treadmill walk intended as a demonstration of moderate
physical activity. Additionally, they completed baseline
self-report physical activity measures, including the 7 day
physical activity recall interview, and were randomly
assigned to one of two Spanish-language Internet-based
conditions: Tailored Physical Activity Internet Intervention or Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Group
assignment was determined using a permuted block
randomization procedure, with small random sized blocks.
Randomization was stratified by TTM stage of change to
ensure an equal distribution of treatment assigned across
levels of motivational readiness for physical activity.

Tailored physical activity internet intervention
(Intervention Group)
Participants randomized to the Intervention Group received access to a study website including the following
features: 1) self-monitoring of minutes of activity and
steps; 2) goal setting with graphs to compare goals to recorded minutes; 3) message board to foster social support
between participants; 4) “ask the expert” where participants could anonymously ask questions to a PhD level researcher; 5) online resources such as maps to create
walking routes and free exercise videos. In addition, participants completed monthly questionnaires that generated automated tailored physical activity reports. These
reports included information regarding: 1) current stage
of motivational readiness for physical activity; 2) current
self-efficacy; 3) cognitive and behavioral strategies associated with physical activity (processes of change); 4) how
the participant compares to individuals who are physically
active and meeting national guidelines of 150 min per
week of MVPA [2] (normative feedback); 5) how the participant compares to her prior responses (progress
feedback-provided after the first month); and 6) useful
facts about physical activity, such as health benefits,
stretching, and heart rate monitoring. The reports draw
from a bank of more than 300 messages addressing different levels of these psychosocial and environmental factors
affecting physical activity. In addition, they received an


online manual that was matched to their motivational
readiness for physical activity. The manual emphasized
strategies for increasing PA, such as goal-setting, selfmonitoring, problem-solving barriers, methods for increasing social support, and rewarding oneself for meeting
physical activity goals.

Staff also reviewed physical activity informational pages
on the website with the participant at baseline. This includes several ways to determine if they were exercising at
moderate intensity: target heart rate; rating of perceived
exertion; mile pace (15–20 min mile); and reference to the
10-min treadmill walk participants completed. Participants also received information on exercising safely and
how to report an injury to the study. Lastly, the website
provided links to several online and community resources.

The Intervention Group received email prompts to access the intervention website weekly during month 1, biweekly during months 2 and 3, and monthly during
months 4–6, with new physical activity information tip
sheets made available on this schedule. Participants
received monetary incentives to complete the study requirements, including $10 each month for completing
the online monthly questionnaires, $25 for attending the
6 and 12 month assessment visits, and a $50 bonus for
attending both visits.

Wellness contact control internet group (Control Group)
The Wellness Contact Control Internet Group received
access to a Spanish language website with information on
health topics other than physical activity. The web-based
content focused on diet and other factors associated with
cardiovascular disease risk and included information from
a series on heart health developed for Latinos by the
National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Topics included:
Cut Down On Salt and Sodium, Cut Down on Fat and
Not on Taste, Learn Your Cholesterol Number, Stress
Management, Kick the Smoking Habit, Protect Your
Heart-Lower Your Cholesterol, and Prevent High Blood
Pressure [24]. Participants in the Control Group received
the same monetary incentives and the same number of
email contacts on the same schedule as the Intervention
Group. Control Group participants also logged into a
website (separate from the intervention website) to
complete monthly surveys on the previously described
wellness topics.

Measures
Demographics were assessed at baseline with a brief questionnaire assessing age, education, income, occupation,
race, ethnicity, history of residence in the U.S., marital status, and acculturation [25]. The STOFHLA [22] was also
administered at baseline to evaluate adult literacy in the
health care setting.


-----

The 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR) was
used to calculate the needed sample size for the study
based on 80 % power using effect sizes from previous
studies, and so served as the primary outcome measure

[26, 27]. The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer-administered
instrument that provides details about the types of activities engaged in and an estimate of weekly minutes of
physical activity; it uses multiple strategies for increasing
accuracy of recall, such as breaking down the week into
daily segments (i.e., morning, afternoon, and evening)
and asking about many types of activities, including time
spent sleeping and engaging in moderate, hard, and very
hard activity. All domains of activity are included, such
as leisure, transportation, and occupational activity. To
further enhance the accuracy of self-reporting, participants
walked on a treadmill for 10 min at a moderate intensity
pace (3–4 miles per hour) just prior to completing the 7Day PAR at baseline and again at follow-up. The 7-Day
PAR has been used across many studies on physical activity
and has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity with objective
measures of activity [28–32]. Past research indicates that
the 7-Day PAR is sensitive to changes in MVPA over time

[29, 30] and has good test-retest reliability among Latino
participants [33].

Accelerometer-measured physical activity (ActiGraph
3X+) served as an additional primary outcome measure.
Accelerometers measure both movement and intensity of
activity and have been validated with heart rate telemetry

[34] and total energy expenditure [35]. Accelerometer data
was processed using the ActiLife software, with a cut point
of 1952 to establish the minimum threshold for moderate
intensity activity [36]. Participants were asked to wear the
accelerometer on their left hip for 7 days. Valid wear time
was classified as 5 days of at least 600 min of wear time
each day or at least 3000 min of wear time over 4 days. To
be counted in the total minutes/week of activity, activity
had to occur in ≥10-min bouts.

Psychosocial measures related to depression, social support, stress, and physical activity enjoyment and environment were also completed. The Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 10-question measure
of depressive symptoms [37] that has been translated and
validated across different ethnic groups, with internal
consistencies of .87 and above in both English and Spanish

[38, 39] and 0.83 in our sample, Social support for physical
activity was examined in terms of support from friends and
family members for physical activity. The 13-question
measure has three sub-scales with acceptable internal consistencies (alphas range from 0.61 to 0.91, 0.87–0.88 in this
sample) and good criterion validity [40]. The Perceived
Stress Scale (PSS) [41, 42] examines the degree to which
specific situations are deemed as stressful in the past week.
The PSS is validated and has been used in many studies


examining the association between stress and health and
has an internal consistency of 0.86 in this sample [43]. The
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) [44] assesses
the level of personal satisfaction derived from physical activity participation. The measure has 18 items with high internal consistency (alpha = 0.96 and 0.94 in this sample)
and criterion validity [44]. Neighborhood Environment
Walkability Scale, Abbreviated (NEWSA) includes 54 items

[45, 46] assessing various aspects of the built environment
related to walking, neighborhood aesthetics, and traffic.
Several studies have supported the test–retest reliability of
the NEWS [47, 48] as well as its construct validity by
reporting significant differences on some NEWS sub-scales
between neighborhoods selected to differ on walkability

[46, 47] and modest correlations between NEWS sub-scales
and accelerometer and self-reported estimates of physical
activity [49].

Three measures - stage of change, self-efficacy for physical activity, and the processes of change - were administered at baseline and on a monthly basis via the website,
and used to help generate the tailored expert system
feedback reports for the Intervention Group. The 4-item
stage of change measure has demonstrated reliability
(Kappa = 0.78; intra-class correlation r = 0.84) as well as
shown acceptable concurrent validity with measures of selfefficacy and current activity levels [50]. The 40-item
processes measure contains 10 sub-scales that address a
variety of processes of activity behavior change. Internal
consistency of the subscales ranged from .62 to .96 [51] in
past studies, and .61–89 in the current study. Self-efficacy,
or confidence in one’s ability to persist with exercising in
various situations, such as when feeling fatigued or
encountering inclement weather, was measured with a 5item instrument [52] developed by Marcus and colleagues
(alpha = .82 with alpha = 0.72 in this sample).

Data analysis
Using a single linear mixed effects regression model,
mean minutes/week of MVPA (as obtained from the 7Day PAR and separately for accelerometers) at follow-up
was regressed on time, treatment, and time x treatment,
in order to assess between group differences in minutes/
week of MVPA at 6 months (primary study outcome).
As baseline characteristics were balanced between
groups, no additional covariates were included in the
model. The model specified included a random, subjectspecific intercept, to account for repeated, correlated
measures of the outcome within participant. Non-linear
trends were assessed by including quadratic effects (for
example) but ultimately not presented, as the linear
model was superior in fit. All analyses were conducted
on the intent to treat sample, with all randomized participants included in the analysis.


-----

Since a likelihood-based approach was used for estimation of regression parameters, estimated effects made
use of all available data without directly imputing missing outcomes. A similar modeling strategy was used for
the second primary physical activity outcome, objectively
measured MVPA obtained via accelerometer. Models of
objectively measured MVPA were additionally adjusted
for wear time (as a covariate) in this case. As a way of
corroborating self-reported MVPA, spearman rank correlations were calculated at baseline and follow up (7Day PAR vs. accelerometer).

We also assessed whether there were differences between
groups in the percentage of participants meeting national
guidelines for physical activity, defined as reporting at least
150 min/week of MVPA. Using a logistic regression model
implemented with generalized estimating equations with
robust standard errors, we assessed treatment effects on
the odds of meeting guidelines at follow-up.

Using a similar modeling approach to that described for
our primary outcome, we assessed effects of treatment on
changes in psychosocial constructs over time, including all
variables targeted by the intervention (self-efficacy, processes, social support, enjoyment). Unadjusted descriptives
over time as well as adjusted mean changes from baseline
(and standard errors) are presented.

All analyses were carried out in SAS 9.3 with significance level set a priori at α = 0.05.

Results
The sample included 205 eligible women who were randomly assigned to the Intervention (N = 104) and Control (N = 101) groups, as 13 participants were deemed
ineligible post-randomization. Reasons for not being randomized into one of the two conditions after signing a
consent form included: medical condition that rendered
the participant ineligible at time of assessment (e.g., high
blood pressure), too much physical activity, inability to
complete a treadmill demonstration, failure to attend
scheduled visits, and no longer interested in the study.
In addition, reasons for ineligibility post-randomization
included unreliable computer access, moving away from
San Diego, and medical issues that rendered participants
ineligible (e.g., pregnancy, surgical procedures). Refer to
Fig. 1. for the CONSORT diagram.

A comparison of between group differences in baseline
demographics, activity level, psychosocial constructs and
baseline measurements are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Participants were 39.2 (10.5) years of age on average. The
majority identified themselves as Mexican American
(84.4 %), White (51.7 %) and first-generation in the U.S.
(81.9 %). On average, participant BMI (28.8 +/− 5.2) was in
the overweight range. Most participants had some college
education (61 %) and had an annual household income
lower than $30,000 (66.4 %). Participants reported low


levels of physical activity at baseline, with mean selfreported min/week of MVPA of 9.2 (SD = 19.9) and objectively measured MVPA of 32.3 (SD = 60.0). There were no
between-group differences in baseline characteristics, suggesting a successful randomization procedure.

The primary study outcome was self-reported MVPA at
6 month follow-up (adjusting for baseline values). On average, participants in the Intervention Group increased their
min/week of MVPA from 8.0 (SD = 15.0), Median = 0 at
baseline to 112.8 (SD = 97.1), Median = 100 min/week at 6
months compared to Control who reported 10.44(23.98)
Median = 0 at baseline and 63.5 min/week (SD = 88.7), Median = 25 at follow-up. There was one statistical outlier at
baseline (200 min/week of MVPA), which was removed
from analysis. Adjusted model results showed a significant
effect of Intervention vs. Control on min/week of MVPA,
such that those randomized to the Intervention Group
reported 50.0 more min/week of MVPA at 6 months
compared to Control Group (adjusting for baseline), SE =
9.5, p < .01. See Table 3 for full regression model.

Unadjusted objectively measured MVPA over time is
summarized in Fig. 2. Regression results indicate significant
between-group differences in mean min/week of MVPA at
6 months, with significantly more minutes in the Intervention Group after controlling for baseline (mean differences
= 31.0, SE = 10.7,p < .01). Results also show significant correlations between accelerometers and self-reported MVPA
at baseline and 6 months (rho = 0.27, p < .01 at baseline and
rho = 0.52, p < .01 at 6 months), Table 3.

Overall, 21.6 % of participants met national guidelines
for PA at 6 months based on the 7-Day PAR: 31.4 % of the
Intervention Group vs. 12.6 % of the Control Group. This
corresponds to a statistically significant between group
difference, OR = 3.12, 95 % CI: 1.46–6.66 (Table 4).

Unadjusted mean changes in targeted psychosocial constructs are presented separately by group in Table 5. Overall, adjusted results of changes from baseline to 6 months
suggest Intervention participants showed greater increases
in self-efficacy (.42 (1.03) vs. -0.13(0.92), p < .001), cognitive processes (0.64(0.95) vs. 0.05(0.79), p < .001), behavioral processes (0.92(1.00) vs 0.25(0.75), p < .001), and a
trend for enjoyment (13.37(23.81) vs. 7.09(21.39),p = 0.08)
from baseline to 6 months. There were no significant differences between Intervention and Control with respect
to changes in social support (friends), social support
(family), social support (rewards and punishments), perceived stress, or depression (p’s > .05).

Discussion
Results from the current study support the efficacy of a
Spanish-language individually-tailored Internet-based
physical activity intervention for Latinas. The Intervention
Group reported significantly greater increases in MVPA
and several related psychosocial variables compared to the


-----

Control Group. A separate upcoming analysis of the
maintenance effects is forthcoming. In the current study,
the self-report physical activity data were validated with
objective measures, which were significantly correlated
with the 7-Day PAR and also showed a significant Intervention effect. The Control Group also reported increased
physical activity at 6 months, which may have been due to
repeat assessments of that variable. In addition, while the
wellness materials focused on diet and other health behaviors aside from physical activity, it may have nonetheless
inspired Control participants to engage in similar lifestyle
changes. Social desirability response bias is another potential reason for increased MVPA in the Control Group.

These results are comparable to those found in a similar
Internet-based physical activity study with mostly NonHispanic White participants, in which physical activity increased from a median of 0 min/week at baseline to
120 min/week at 6 months (vs. 0 median minutes/week at
baseline to 100 min/week at 6 months in the current
study) [52]. Also 44 % of the mostly Non-Hispanic White
Intervention participants reported reaching the national
physical activity guidelines (150 min/week) by 6 months,
compared to 30.6 % in the current study with Latinas [53].

Findings from the current Internet-based study among
Latinas were slightly more modest than those found in a
similar study with mostly Non-Hispanic samples; however, increases in physical activity produced by the interactive web-based format used in the current study were
greater than those found in a recent study in which


similar content was provided to Latinas via maildelivered self-help print materials [16, 17]. Specifically,
self-reported physical activity increased from an average
of 1.87 min/week (SD = 6.86) at baseline to 73.36 min/
week (SD = 89.73) at 6 months among Intervention participants in the previous study, and only 11.36 % of the
Intervention Group reported meeting national physical
activity guidelines at 6 months in that study. Interestingly, while delivery channel seemed very important in
the Latina samples, it was perhaps less critical to the
mostly Non-Latino White participants, who reported
similar physical activity levels at 6 months regardless of
whether they received individually tailored interventions
via Internet (median of 120 min/week) or print
(112.5 min/week) [54]. Those findings were published in
2007, but more recent Health Information Trends Survey (HINTs) data also indicated that Latinos were more
likely to use the Internet for help with diet, weight and
physical activity than non-Latino whites [55]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Internet is a particularly appealing delivery channel in this at-risk target
population at this time.

Despite this, a 2013 Cochrane review reported a paucity of web-based physical activity intervention studies
that include participants from varying socioeconomic or
ethnic groups [56] and we were unable to locate such
other studies in a recent literature review. Thus this
likely constitutes the first application of interactive webbased technology for physical activity promotion among

Latinas. Other strengths to the current study include the
use of a randomized controlled trial research design, and
balanced randomization across baseline characteristics.

As for limitations, this study was conducted with
mostly healthy Mexican American women with some
degree of health literacy and advanced education, and


thus may not be generalizable to other Latina subgroups,
Latino men, or other ethnic groups. Future studies should
include formative research to determine how to modify the
intervention for men and/or other ethnic groups. In
addition, future could appeal to lower literate audiences by
lowering the literacy level of the print portions of the

accelerometry as an additional primary outcome, the study
was powered using a self-report measure.

Increases in MVPA in the current study could be seen
as modest, with approximately one-third of the Intervention Group reaching the physical activity levels recommended for health benefits at 6 months. However, given
the extremely low levels of MVPA at baseline, these
gains in MVPA are encouraging, especially because getting completely inactive individuals to do some activity
may be the most difficult and important change (compared to encouraging underactive individuals to meet

to go from sedentary to meeting guidelines within a 6month period, thus future studies should focus on

In addition, significant group differences were also

participants compared to control participants. These
psychosocial constructs have been shown to predict increases in PA in our prior studies with Latina women

[16, 17]. To increase physical activity gains in future
studies, we may need to influence relevant psychosocial
variables such as social support and perceived stress that
did not change in response to the current program. Social support in particular has been reported to be an important component in physical activity behavior change
in past studies with Latinas [11, 57]. Further formative
research could explore how websites can effectively improve social support for physical activity among Latinas
and help more participants reach the national PA
guidelines.

Conclusions
Findings from the current study suggest that the
Internet-delivered individually tailored intervention
achieved even larger increases in physical activity than
the print-based version used in our past studies with Latinas. This is an important finding given that the Latino
population in the U.S. is rapidly growing and reports
high rates of inactivity and related conditions (obesity,
diabetes) [58]. To address these health disparities, this
community needs appealing, effective physical activity
interventions that can reach a large number of people in
a cost-efficient manner. Unlike print-based interventions, web-based approaches can be offered to more
people without substantially increasing the incremental
cost of the intervention. Future researchers in this area
are encouraged to focus on developing mobile friendly
web sites as Latinas are frequently accessing the Internet
via smartphones [20]. Other aspects of smart phone technology (applications, text messaging) have been used to
promote health behavior change in other groups [59–62]
and should also be explored in this at risk target population. Such features could help drive participants to the
website and improve utilization, resulting in even greater
behavior change.
