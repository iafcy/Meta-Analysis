### Abstract

**Background:** Filipino Americans have a high prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease compared
with other Asian American subgroups and non-Hispanic whites. Mobile health (mHealth) weight loss interventions can reduce
chronic disease risks, but these are untested in Filipino Americans with T2D.
**Objective:** The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and potential efficacy of a pilot, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of a culturally adapted mHealth weight loss lifestyle intervention (Pilipino Americans Go4Health [PilAm Go4Health])
for overweight Filipino Americans with T2D.
**Methods:** This was a 2-arm pilot RCT of the 3-month PilAm Go4Health intervention (phase 1) with an active waitlist control
and 3-month follow-up (phase 2). The waitlist control received the PilAm Go4Health in phase 2, whereas the intervention group
transitioned to the 3-month follow-up. PilAm Go4Health incorporated a Fitbit accelerometer, mobile app with diary for health
behavior tracking (steps, food/calories, and weight), and social media (Facebook) for virtual social support, including 7 in-person
monthly meetings. Filipino American adults ≥18 years with T2D were recruited from Northern California. Feasibility was measured
by rates of recruitment, engagement, and retention. Multilevel regression analyses assessed within and between group differences
for the secondary outcome of percent weight change and other outcomes of weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and steps.
**Results:** A total of 45 Filipino American adults were enrolled and randomized. Mean age was 58 (SD 10) years, 62% (28/45)
were women, and mean BMI was 30.1 (SD 4.6). Participant retention and study completion were 100%, with both the intervention
and waitlist group achieving near-perfect attendance at all 7 intervention office visits. Groups receiving the PilAm Go4Health in
phase 1 (intervention group) and phase 2 (waitlist group) had significantly greater weight loss, −2.6% (−3.9 to −1.4) and −3.3%
(−1.8 to −4.8), respectively, compared with the nonintervention group, resulting in a moderate to small effect sizes (d=0.53 and
0.37, respectively). In phase 1, 18% (4/22) of the intervention group achieved a 5% weight loss, whereas 82% (18/22) maintained
or lost 2% to 5% of their weight and continued to maintain this weight loss in the 3-month follow-up. Other health outcomes,
including waist circumference, BMI, and step counts, improved when each arm received the PilAm Go4Health, but the fasting
glucose and HbA1c outcomes were mixed.

**Conclusions:** The PilAm Go4Health was feasible and demonstrated potential efficacy in reducing diabetes risks in overweight
Filipino Americans with T2D. This study supports the use of mHealth and other promising intervention strategies to reduce
obesity and diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Further testing in a full-scale RCT is warranted. These findings may support
intervention translation to reduce diabetes risks in other at-risk diverse populations.

### Introduction

##### Background

As the fastest growing US racial/ethnic group, Asian Americans
represent 6.4% (approximately 21 million) of the US population

[1] and are at a high risk for early development of type 2
diabetes (T2D) at lower body mass index (BMI) than
non-Hispanic whites [2]. Filipino Americans (FA) are the third
largest US Asian subgroup (2,717,844) and the largest California
Asian population (1,474,707) [3]. Filipino Americans have the
highest burden and prevalence of obesity and T2D among Asian
American subgroups and non-Hispanic whites, and have early
cardiovascular-metabolic disease risk, with higher mortality
rates [4]. Yet, there is limited and incipient preventive health
research focused on the Filipino American health disparity [5,6].
Thus, it is imperative to identify effective interventions to reduce
these critical health disparities.

Weight loss lifestyle interventions promoting increased physical
activity (PA) and a healthy diet (with as little as 5%-7% weight
loss) have been shown to reduce obesity and related T2D risks
by 58% [7]. The American Heart Association and Healthy
People 2020 recommends such interventions, particularly for
high-risk racial/ethnic minority populations [8-10]. However,
intensive lifestyle interventions, such as the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP) requiring 16 sessions, may be burdensome for
participants and labor intensive to deliver [7]. Alternatively,
education, coaching, and social support can be delivered
virtually via the Internet, providing real-time feedback
promoting adherence to healthy behaviors. Combining mobile
health (mHealth) technologies, including commercially available
apps and PA trackers (eg, pedometers), offers optional
intervention delivery mechanisms that can be scalable and
cost-effective [11].

US demographics support the delivery of lifestyle intervention
programs via mHealth technology. Approximately 95% of US
adults own a mobile phone (77% smartphones) and 76% access
Facebook daily [12]. A recent study found that Filipino
AmericansA (81.7%) ranked highest for mobile technology
ownership and usage compared with whites (69.9%) [13]. A
systematic review found mHealth interventions to be beneficial
for increasing PA and weight loss [14] and effective for T2D
self-management [15]. A meta-analysis found that mHealth
weight loss interventions had a medium effect size of 0.43,
supporting its continued development and use with lifestyle
interventions [16].


##### Objective

Therefore, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT) called the Pilipino (ie, Filipino) Americans Go4Health
(PilAm Go4Health). PilAm Go4Health was an mHealth
culturally adapted weight loss lifestyle intervention promoting
PA and healthy eating for Filipino Americans with obesity and
T2D to reduce subsequent cardiovascular risks. The purpose of
this paper is to report the feasibility of PilAm Go4Health
(measured by recruitment, engagement, and retention) and
potential efficacy (measured by percent weight and weight [kg]
change). Positive findings will support a follow-on full-scale
RCT to test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted mHealth
weight loss lifestyle intervention for Filipino Americans with
T2D. Qualitative assessments from participants’ responses of
the PilAm Go4Health’s acceptability and cultural relevance
(measured by process evaluations and postprogram interviews)
were previously reported [17].

### Methods

##### Design

This was a pilot RCT of the PilAm Go4Health, a 3-month
culturally adapted mHealth weight loss lifestyle intervention
for Filipino Americans with obesity and T2D, followed by a
3-month follow-up maintenance period. This 2-arm trial
consisted of an intervention group and an active waitlist control
(waitlist) group. Institutional approval from the Committee on
Human Research was obtained before the implementation of
the study. Before enrollment, all participants provided written
informed consent.

PilAm Go4Health consisted of a weight loss lifestyle
intervention based on the DPP [7] that was modified to
incorporate mobile technologies (Fitbit accelerometer plus app
with diary) and private Facebook group for healthy behaviors
tracking, real-time feedback, coaching, and virtual social
support. The overall PilAm Go4Health weight loss goal was a
5% weight reduction from baseline by 3 months.

##### Participants

Participants were recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area
from December 2014 to December 2015. Recruitment was
primarily through word of mouth, community events, and
snowball methods.

Online recruitment strategies included the following: San
Francisco Bay Area Craigslist (a San Francisco company
providing websites for local classified ads of sale items and


-----

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


services), a dedicated study Facebook website, and an
institutional website. Complete recruitment details are published
elsewhere [18]. Those who met the screening and eligibility
criteria (N=45) were enrolled and randomized into the study
(Figure 1).

##### Inclusion Criteria

Eligibility was based on the DPP criteria and American Heart
Association metabolic syndrome risks [7,19]. Key inclusion
criteria were self-identified Filipino; ≥18 years; BMI >23 kg/m[2]

for Asians; physician diagnosis of T2D (non-insulin dependent);
own a smartphone, tablet, or laptop with Internet access; and
English language proficient.

##### Exclusion Criteria

Exclusions included disabilities precluding walking for 20 min;
on a special exercise program; participation in a weight loss
program in the past year; uncontrolled T2D (fasting plasma


glucose >200 mg/dL); endocrine or glucose metabolism
associated disease (eg, Cushing syndrome or polycystic ovary
syndrome); and uncontrolled hypertension. A detailed list of
screening and eligibility criteria are reported in a previous
publication [18].

##### Theoretical Framework

Social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model for health
behavior change helped to guide the study design [20,21].
According to the social cognitive theory, role models along with
sociocultural and environmental feedback (positive or negative)
can influence engagement and adherence to healthy lifestyle
behaviors, including healthy eating and PA. Social support may
also enhance self-efficacy for healthy weight loss behaviors.
To enhance social support, PilAm Go4Health incorporated a
private Facebook group and welcomed family members to
in-person research office visits.

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


The transtheoretical model posits that health behavior change
involves progress through 6 stages of change: precontemplation,
contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination

[21]. Applied research has demonstrated dramatic improvements
in recruitment, retention, and engagement using stage-matched
interventions and proactive recruitment procedures. To confirm
that potentially eligible participants were stage-matched (ie,
preparation for change stage) with the PilAm Go4Health, we
incorporated a 2-week run-in period to assess readiness for
change to help facilitate assessment of both feasibility and
potential efficacy of this intervention program.

##### Cultural Adaptation

Before the study, the PilAm Go4Health was culturally tailored
for Filipino Americans according to recommended published
cultural adaptation guidelines [22] that include the following 5
components: (1) peripheral, (2) evidential, (3) constituent
involving, (4) sociocultural, and (5) linguistics. Examples of
each are provided in Table 1. A comprehensive description of
the adaptation strategies used in the study is provided in a
previous publication [18].

##### Screening Baseline Visit and Run-In Period

Eligible participants who passed the telephone screening were
invited for a screening baseline visit that included a physical
exam (weight, height, BMI, waist and hip circumference, and
blood pressure), fasting blood draw (eg, fasting plasma glucose
and hemoglobin A1c), and questionnaires. Those who passed
the screening baseline visit and fasting blood draw received a
Fitbit Zip accelerometer and Fitbit app with diary with training
and were then enrolled in a 14-day run-in period.

A study run-in period was incorporated to assess whether
participants were in the transtheoretical model’s readiness or
_preparation for change stage [21]. The run-in period was_
designed to screen out potential noncompliant participants.
Although this may minimize the sample size, it increases the
statistical power [24] to reduce the possibility of erroneously
rejecting the PilAm Go4Health as a potentially efficacious
weight loss intervention. This helps to determine whether the
intervention was feasible (acceptable and practical) and
potentially efficacious (able to generate beneficial results under
ideal circumstances) [25].


Participants in the run-in period were asked to wear the Fitbit
Zip daily for at least 10 hours/day and send photos of all food
and drinks consumed for 3 consecutive days. Those who
complied at least 70% of the time with the run-in requirements
demonstrated readiness for behaviors change and were enrolled
and randomized into the study. Further details on the run-in
protocol were previously published [18].

##### Randomization

A total of 45 participants were enrolled and randomized in a
1:1 ratio (computer-generated random allocation sequence) and
then stratified by gender in permuted randomly selected block
sizes of 2 and 4 to an intervention group (n=22) or an active
waitlist group (n=23; see Figure 1). Due to the nature of a
lifestyle intervention, only the lab technicians and statistician
were blinded, but research investigators, staff, and participants
were not.

##### Intervention Group

Trained research staff implemented the PilAm Go4Health
intervention. In phase 1 (baseline to 3 months) immediately
after randomization, intervention participants were trained on
using the Fitbit accelerometer to self-monitor real-time PA steps
and associated app with diary to self-report daily food/calorie
intake and weekly weight. They joined the study’s private
Facebook group for virtual social support, coaching, and weekly
education topics posted by research staff. Participants were
encouraged to join the Facebook discussions at least once a
week. At this training visit, they were given tailored short- and
long-term weight loss goals based on the participant’s baseline
weight, PA, and diet information. Depending on their progress
with tailored goals, research staff provided each participant
tailored feedback, coaching, and support during research office
visits at 1, 2, and 3 months. Table 2 outlines the PilAm
Go4Health components delivered at each visit and weekly
Facebook discussion topics posted by research staff.

In phase 2 at the 3-month office visit, intervention participants
transitioned to a 3-month follow-up and were removed from
the private Facebook group. Participants were asked to continue
using their Fitbit and app with diary to track health behaviors
and maintain their weight loss goals. Follow-up office visits
were scheduled at 4 and 6 months. Intervention participants
completed the study at 6 months. Further PilAm Go4Health
intervention details are reported elsewhere [18].

participants received only the Fitbit accelerometer and training


for daily wear. They returned for 1- and 3-month office visits
when they received hepatitis B and C education, respectively.

In phase 2 at the 3-month office visit, waitlist participants
transitioned to receive the PilAm Go4Health intervention and


-----

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


returned for 3 office visits at 4, 5, and 6 months (Table 2).
Waitlist participants completed the study at 6 months.

##### Data Collection

All participants’ anthropometric measures—weight (kg), height,
BMI (kg/m[2]), waist circumference (cm), blood pressure, serum
labs (eg, plasma glucose and HbA1c)—were collected at
baseline, 3 months, and 6 months during research office visits
and stored in secure study data servers. All Fitbit steps and
self-reported app and diary data (calorie/food and weight) were
wirelessly uploaded and transmitted in real time directly to
secure Fitbit data servers. Each participant’s secure Fitbit
account was also linked to a secondary Fitabase account
(Fitabase, a San Diego based corporation) where data were
uploaded and stored on secure confidential Fitabase data servers

[26]. Facebook group data were wirelessly uploaded to secure
Facebook data servers. All participant data were subsequently
uploaded to secure institutional study data servers. Only
approved research staff and investigators had access to study
data. For further details on data collection protocol, see previous
publication [18].

##### Outcome Measures

 Primary Outcome

Feasibility was based upon three criteria: recruitment,
engagement, and retention. Recruitment goal was to have 45
eligible participants recruited, enrolled, and randomized for this
study. Engagement goal was to have participants attend 5 out
of 7 intervention office visits (receipt of 9 of the 16 DPP
sessions) as a measure for completing the program. This
threshold was based on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC) required number of DPP sessions
considered for program completion [27]. Retention goal was to
have at least 80% of randomized participants complete the study,
as defined by attending 5 of 7 office visits and complete all
required study assessments (physical exams, labs, and surveys)
at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits.

We monitored adherence to tracking target health behaviors
using the Fitbit Zip and Fitbit app with diary. These additional
engagement measures described the uptake and acceptance of
the PilAm Go4Health program by participants. The criteria for
mobile technology tracking by participants were as follows: (1)
logging weight at least once/week, (2) logging daily
food/calories at least once/week, and (3) wearing Fitbit Zip at
least 5 days/week. However, currently there are no standard
thresholds for frequency of mHealth app use to evaluate
feasibility of an intervention. Any such thresholds would be
arbitrary. Therefore, we chose not to use adherence as a measure
of engagement to evaluate feasibility.

##### Secondary Outcome

Percent weight change was used to assess potential efficacy
during phase 1 and 2 for each arm. In phase 1, the intervention
group received the PilAm Go4Health from baseline to 3 months,
whereas the waitlist group only used the Fitbit Zip without
coaching. In phase 2, the waitlist group received the PilAm
Go4Health from 3 to 6 months, whereas the intervention group
transitioned to the follow-up maintenance phase.


##### Other Outcomes

For each arm, change in weight (kg) was measured weekly for
6 months, and change in BMI, waist circumference, fasting
plasma glucose, and HbA1c were measured at baseline, 3
months, and 6 months, whereas daily step counts were measured
in real time via the Fitbit Zip.

##### Statistical Analysis

Descriptive analyses for demographic, clinical, and outcome
measures were computed using IBM SPSS for Windows version
24. Descriptive statistics were obtained by using _t test,_
Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or chi-square
test for continuous, nonparametric, or categorical variables as
appropriate. Between-group differences in percent weight
change categories over time were analyzed using a bootstrap
chi-square test, including the Mantel-Haenszel test of trend.

The feasibility outcome for recruitment was based upon
achieving the target sample size. We reported the simple
proportion (%) of participants within each randomized group
who met the various target behavior threshold criteria for
engagement and retention during the 3-month PilAm Go4Health.

The question for each secondary outcome was whether the
change during both study phases was greater for the group
receiving the PilAm Go4Health than the nonintervention group.
Multilevel regression (aka linear mixed models or hierarchical
linear models) was employed to test differences between the 2
arms in their change trajectories. This effect is also called the
cross-level interaction between time and group [28,29]. In
addition to the primary test of between-group change, the simple
slopes were also tested to determine whether the change was
significant within each group.

For these analyses, there were no missing data for the 2 groups.
Therefore, a multilevel regression models approach was used
over more traditional repeated measures analysis of variance
(since missing data were not an issue) [28,29]. The use of
multilevel regression allowed for the use of bootstrapping when
the assumption of normality was not tenable. Bootstrapped full
information maximum likelihood models were estimated to
obtain nonparametric, bias-corrected bootstrapped CIs (BC CI)
for estimation and inference regarding hypotheses [30-32].
These analyses were carried out with Stata/SE version 14

[33,34]. Primary analysis included intention to treat. Significance
was evaluated using a 2-sided alpha of .05.

### Results

##### Sociodemographic Results

A total of 113 potential participants were screened; 45 were
eligible, enrolled, and randomized (see Figure 1). Mean age
was 57.6 (SD 9.8), with 62% (28/45) female. The majority were
immigrants (38/45; 84%). Overall, participants were categorized
as obese with mean BMI 30.1 (SD 4.6) (Table 3). The only
sociodemographic variable with a difference between the 2
groups was “Years lived in the United States” (often used as a
proxy for acculturation). Although a majority of participants
were immigrants, they were highly acculturated (Marin
Acculturation Scale [35], mean score=3.5). As there were no


-----

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


between-group differences in acculturation scores, the outcome
analyses were not adjusted for years lived in the United States.

##### Primary Outcomes

Results of all primary outcomes indicated that the PilAm
Go4Health intervention program was feasible. For the study,
45 eligible participants were recruited, passed the run-in period,
and enrolled and randomized over a 1-year period (Figure 1).
Word of mouth was the dominate recruitment strategy that
yielded the highest number of potential participants, followed
by in-person invitation to join the study at local Lion’s Club
faith-based weekly health fairs. Feasibility engagement was
measured by attendance at intervention office visits. Both the


intervention and waitlist group achieved near-perfect attendance
at all 7 intervention office visits (95% [21/22] and 100% [23/23],
respectively), well above the standard CDC threshold for DPP
completion. Finally, all 45 participants (100%) completed the
study at 6 months, meeting the retention rate goal (Table 4).

Adherence to additional mHealth engagement measures,
including logging weight and food/calories and wearing the
Fitbit, was similar between the intervention and waitlist groups.
With the exception of logging weight at least once/week, both
groups demonstrated relatively high adherence to tracking
weekly health behaviors in excess of 80% of the time when they
received the 3-month intervention (Table 4).

##### Secondary Outcomes

The results of the analysis for the main secondary outcome
(percent weight change) are compelling, as are the results of
the other secondary outcomes (Table 5). _All statistically_
_significant (indicated by no zero in 95% BC CI) simple slopes_
_and cross-level interactions are highlighted in italicized type._
The estimated simple slopes in Table 5 represent within-group
changes, and cross-level interactions represent the
_between-group differences._

All the cross-level interactions for phase 1 were significant and
in the expected direction (Table 5). For example, in the column
for the cross-level interaction, the point estimate for weight
shows that the decrease was 2 kg greater for the intervention
group than for the waitlist group. The BC CI for the 2 kg
decrease shows that the population difference might be as great
as 3 kg or as small as 1.1 kg, but it is not 0. This weight change
had a moderate effect size of 0.53 (Cohen d). Close examination
of the simple slope for the intervention group was significant
but not that of the waitlist group—just what we would expect.
The intervention group’s weight loss was equivalent to a
significant 2.9% loss in their baseline weight (BC CI: −3.9 to
−2.0). This is in contrast in to the waitlist group’s insignificant
0.3% loss in their baseline weight (Figure 2).

As one might expect in phase 2, when the intervention group
transitioned to the follow-up and the waitlist group received the
PilAm Go4Health intervention program, the results were
inverted. Waitlist group’s mean weight decreased 2.5 kg more
than the intervention group (BC CI: 1.4 to 3.5). This is between
a weak and medium effect (Cohen d=0.37). The intervention
group’s simple slope showed a trivial 0.28 kg increase in weight
(BC CI: −.24 to .83), whereas waitlist group’s phase 2 simple
slope decreased 2.2 kg (BC CI: −3.1 to −1.3). In phase 2, the
cross-level interaction showed a 3.3% greater decrease for the
waitlist group (BC CI: −1.8 to −4.8), and the simple slope for
the waitlist group’s 3.0% decrease in weight loss was significant
(BC CI: −4.2 to −1.7), but the intervention group’s increase of
0.35% in the simple slope was not (BC CI: −.37 to 1.1).

##### Intervention Group—Percent Weight Loss Goals Achieved

The overall PilAm Go4Health weight loss goal was a 5% weight
reduction. In phase 1, about 18% (4/22) of the intervention
group achieved a 5% weight loss, whereas 82% (18/22) of the
group’s remaining participants maintained or lost 2% to 5% of


their weight. During maintenance in phase 2, over 90% (20/22)
of the intervention group continued to maintain or lose 2% to
5% more weight (Table 6).

##### Waitlist Group—Percent Weight Loss Goals Achieved

In phase 1, over 83% (19/23) of the waitlist group maintained
or gained 2% to 5% more weight (see Table 6). This pattern
was reversed in phase 2 with 70% (16/23) of the waitlist
participants receiving PilAm Go4Health having maintained or
lost between 2% and 5% of their weight. Most notably, 30%
(7/23) of waitlist participants achieved the 5% weight loss goal,
almost twice that of the phase 1 intervention group.

##### Other Outcomes

A similar pattern of weight effects was also observed for other
outcomes, waist circumference, BMI, and step counts, with
mixed improvements in fasting glucose and HbA1c (Table 5).
Significant cross-level interactions were detected for fasting
glucose in both phases for the PilAm Go4Health activated
groups. The simple slope (within group) for the intervention
group was significant, indicating that the fasting glucose value
had _increased significantly during follow-up (10.7 mg/dL_

[3.4-18.5]). However, the simple slope for the waitlist group
was not significant in phase 2, although it was in the expected
direction (−8.9 mg/dL [−21.0 to 1.7]).

Opposing and mixed patterns were displayed in the HbA1c’s
outcomes. In phase 1, the intervention group’s cross-level
interaction was not significant, although the group’s simple
slope was significant and in the expected direction (−.49% [BC
CI: −.80 to −.21]). In contrast, the waitlist group’s HbA1c’s
cross-level interaction in phase 2 was significant and in the
expected direction, but not the simple slope, although it was in
the expected direction.

Overall step counts significantly increased for each study arm
that received the PilAm Go4Health in phase 1 and phase 2
compared with the nonintervention group. The greater number
of assessments (14 weeks in phase 1; 13 weeks in phase 2)
allowed for a more sensitive examination of the linear and
quadratic components of change for the 2 groups and
phase-related changes in trajectories. The cross-level interactions
and simple slopes for both linear and quadratic slopes were
significant for the PilAm Go4Health intervention group for
phase 1 and the PilAm Go4Health waitlist group during phase
2 with expected significant large effect sizes.

### Discussion

##### Key Findings

The PilAm Go4Health was feasible as measured by achieving
the recruitment, engagement, and retention threshold goals.
Results demonstrated potential efficacy of the PilAm Go4Health
in reducing weight in Filipino Americans with overweight and
T2D. Each group receiving the PilAm Go4Health program
(intervention group in phase 1 and waitlist group in phase 2)
demonstrated significant weight loss, underscoring the PilAm
Go4Health potential efficacy. In phase 1, over half of the
intervention participants lost weight. Although only 18% (4/22)
achieved the overall 5% weight loss goal by 3 months, the
weight loss trajectory matched that of the typically longer
DPP-based interventions [36]. More importantly, in the phase
2 follow-up, most of the intervention participants continued to
maintain or lose weight.

##### Primary Outcome

Full participant recruitment was achieved within 1 year for this
difficult-to-reach population. Acceptance criteria presented an
interesting conundrum, in that the inclusion and exclusion


criteria were stringent and at odds with one another. Participants
had to be overweight/obese non-insulin–dependent T2D, with
controlled hypertension, yet still capable of walking 30 min per
day and willing to deal with a time-consuming protocol and
inconvenient blood tests and office visits. Potential participants
were approached using various indirect and in-person
recruitment strategies, resulting in 185 referrals, yielding only
45 qualified and willing to participate. Yet, despite these
recruitment obstacles, the study was feasible.

Recruitment was successful, engagement (office visit attendance)
was close to 100%, and a 100% retention rate was achieved,
possible due to the culturally adapted intervention and use of a
community health worker model to successfully recruit and
administer the study. Although cultural adaptation strategies
were not quantitatively measured for adherence and feasibility,
qualitative process evaluations through semistructured
interviews were conducted at the 3-month and 6-month visits
to assess cultural acceptability and relevance of the intervention
for Filipino Americans. As detailed in a previous publication

[17], over half (58%; 26/45) stated that “the culturally tailored
support (eg, Filipino research staff) enhanced their engagement”
in the study. Furthermore, a majority of participants (64%;


-----

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


29/45) reported that the intervention helped boost their
self-confidence in managing their health. Thus, Filipino
American participants deemed the culturally adapted PilAm
Go4Health intervention acceptable and relevant.

Adherence to using mobile technology was excellent for wearing
the Fitbit to track PA and logging foods to monitor calorie
intake. However, adherence for self-monitoring weight was
markedly lower. This could be due to the negative feedback
that can occur with self-weighing, particularly among those
with overweight/obesity. There is debate about self-weighing
because in some overweight/obese individuals, it appears to
generate negative psychological conditions, such as depression,
anxiety, and stress [37,38]. Future studies should assess barriers
and facilitators for tracking weight to improve intervention
strategies promoting weight loss.

Due to the small sample size of our study, we were unable to
assess the relative contribution of the mobile app use to weight
loss outcomes. Such analyses may be feasible in future studies
with a larger sample size. Nevertheless, the PilAm Go4Health
adherence data add to the body of knowledge that mobile apps
are useful for tracking health behaviors in weight loss
interventions.

More importantly, our participants’ mean age was 57.6 years,
which demonstrated that older adults can successfully learn and
use mobile technology to self-monitor health. In our previous
publication, overall, participants highly endorsed and adopted
the Fitbit as a means for tracking PA and reported that the
mobile technology helped improve accountability for monitoring
target health behaviors [17]. Previous studies have shown that
a majority of older adults go online and own a smartphone, but
few engage in using mobile technology [39,40]. Future mHealth
lifestyle intervention studies should evaluate whether older
adults will continue to engage in the use of mobile technology
after receiving an mHealth-based intervention.

##### Secondary Outcomes

Evidence indicates that weight loss of 5% to 7% by 6 months
is associated with preventing or reducing T2D and
cardiovascular risks [10,40-42]. Even a modest weight loss of
5% in patients with T2D is associated with significant clinical
improvements (eg, systolic blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c,
and triglycerides). Due to the short 3-month intervention
duration, PilAm Go4Health study participants may not have
had sufficient time to achieve the 5% weight loss goal set forth
in other 6-month weight loss lifestyle interventions [36].

Overall, 24% (11/45) of intervention group and waitlist group
participants achieved the study’s primary 5% weight loss goal
after completing PilAm Go4Health, and 31% (14/45) achieved
a 2% to 5 % weight loss (Table 6). However, considering the
reduced number of office visits and educational meetings
condensed into 3 months, the trajectory for PilAm Go4Health
participant weight loss rates was similar to those of longer
DPP-based studies [36]. Increasing the PilAm Go4Health
duration to 6 months may be necessary to achieve the 5% to
7% weight reduction for optimum health benefits.

Notably, compared with phase 1 when only 18% (4/22) of
intervention participants achieved the 5% weight loss goal,


nearly twice the number of waitlist participants, 30% (7/23),
achieved their 5% weight loss goal in phase 2. When waitlist
participants received PilAm Go4Health, they had already been
self-monitoring PA steps for the prior 3 months. During phase
1, the waitlist group was asked to only self-monitor PA steps
using the Fitbit app. This prior PA tracking behavior may have
contributed to the greater number of waitlist participants
achieving the 5% weight loss goal in phase 2 compared with
the intervention group.

##### Other Outcomes

Our study results highlight the important relationship between
weight management and diabetes control. Not surprising, the
other outcomes of weight (kg), waist circumference, and BMI
mirrored the results of the secondary outcome for reduced
percent weight over 3 months when both study arms received
the PilAm Go4Health. Similarly, the PilAm Go4Health had a
large effect on PA measured by increased steps over time.
Furthermore, improvements in fasting glucose and HbA1c give
promise to the efficacy of the PilAm Go4Health mHealth
intervention to enhance diabetes self-management. There were
clear improvements in diabetes self-management and control
as reflected in the significant cross-level interactions (with the
exception of phase 1 for HbA1c); however, long-term studies
are needed to detect whether serum levels for diabetes control
can be improved and sustained.

##### Strengths

PilAm Go4Health intervention program has several noteworthy
strengths. This is one of the first rigorous lifestyle intervention
studies focused on Filipinos with obesity and T2D to reduce
further cardiovascular-metabolic complications. The efficacy
of the PilAm Go4Health program was evident in the (1) 100%
(45/45) participant study completion rate, demonstrating the
excellent participant recruitment and engagement of this
hard-to-reach Filipino population; (2) ability to promote weight
loss among Filipino Americans with overweight and T2D (in
both study arms receiving the intervention) in only 3 months;
and (3) sustained intervention group weight loss in the
subsequent 3 months.

There are multiple intervention factors (eg, intensity, Facebook,
self-monitoring behaviors, cultural adaptation) that may have
contributed to the PilAm Go4Health potential efficacy. Although
relative contributions of each factor are unknown, previous
studies indicate that each may have had a positive impact on
the outcomes. First, intensive interventions with multiple
components have shown that participants are able to lose 5%
of their baseline weight over short durations [36,43,44]. PilAm
Go4Health findings are consistent with these studies.

Second, evidence indicates that self-monitoring lifestyle
behaviors improve weight loss and health outcomes [7,45].
Furthermore, higher adherence to activity tracking was
associated with greater weight loss and increased PA [46,47].
Our findings support these 2 premises in that the waitlist group’s
self-monitoring (tracking) of PA alone in phase 1 was not
sufficient to achieve a significant weight reduction by 3 months.
However, in phase 2, when the waitlist group received the PilAm
Go4Health intervention, tracking PA in combination with


-----

JMIR DIABETES Bender et al


tracking food calories and weight resulted in significant weight
reductions or weight stabilization in 3 months.

A third intervention factor was cultural relevance, an integral
element of the PilAm Go4Health design. Culturally relevant
interventions have been shown to improve health outcomes,
especially in diverse immigrant populations [48,49]. Cultural
tailoring is an important strategy to improve recruitment,
engagement, and retention in a hard-to-reach vulnerable
population [18,22]. Cultural adaptation strategies used in the
study design reflected Filipino family and community
preferences by welcoming family members at research office
visits for in-person social support and incorporating a private
Facebook group for virtual social support with peers. Therefore,
these culturally adaptations may have influenced the weight
loss achieved by a primarily immigrant population.

Incorporating mobile technology was a fourth factor in the
PilAm Go4Health study design. Including a mobile phone app
to supplement standard lifestyle counseling had positive impact
on PA and diet, even over short 3-month intervention periods
such as that of the PilAm Go4Health [43,50]. Furthermore, our
findings are consistent with other studies that show
technology-based interventions are feasible, acceptable, and
efficacious among older adults [16,51]. On the basis of FA’s
prolific use of mobile technology and social media [13], PilAm
Go4Health incorporated this technology to promote participant
engagement and motivate self-monitoring of lifestyle behaviors
to achieve weight loss goals. The addition of virtual social
networking via Facebook in our study may have contributed to
adherence for tracking health behaviors. Virtual social media
has also been shown to improve health outcomes. For example,
Facebook has also been used in weight loss interventions, with
positive results among overweight/obese adults and college
students [52,53].

Our study supports evidence that older individuals can
successfully use mobile technology to improve diabetes
self-management. The Pew Research Center reported that older
adults with higher education more easily adopt mobile
technology compared with less-educated older adults [51]. On
the basis of our study’s previously reported qualitative outcome

[17], our highly educated older Filipino American adults seemed
to readily adopt the mobile technology to track health behaviors
for diabetes management. The mobile technology used in our
study may have influenced adherence to healthy behaviors,
contributing to weight reduction and improvements in other
health outcomes. Further research is needed to evaluate the
relative influence of the mHealth components used in the PilAm
Go4Health program.

##### Limitations

There are several limitations of note. The duration of this pilot
RCT 3-month lifestyle intervention with a 3-month follow-up
was shorter than a typical DPP-based 6-month weight loss
program. This may have influenced participants’ ability to


achieve the overall study’s 5% weight loss goal. The small
sample size consisted of a highly educated immigrant Filipino
population from a geographic area of Northern California,
limiting the internal validity and generalizability. The study was
also limited to those who were English literate and owned
smartphones with Internet access. This may have resulted in a
biased sample excluding non-English speakers and those less
likely to afford mobile devices requiring Internet service. The
sample size also limited statistical analyses of this multifactorial
intervention program, restricting the ability to determine the
relative contribution of each factor influencing weight loss and
other outcomes. Nevertheless, many secondary/other outcomes
(eg, percent weight, weight [kg], and fasting glucose change)
were statistically significant, indicating that power (and therefore
the sample size) was sufficient to support the potential efficacy
of the PilAm Go4Health [54,55].

The run-in period to assess participant eligibility may have
biased retention levels and study outcomes as it may have
excluded noncompliant potential participants. However, out of
52 potential PilAm Go4Health participants completing the
run-in, only 4% (2/52) were categorized as noncompliant (see
Figure 1). Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of interventions
in which weight loss was the primary outcome showed studies
did not differ significantly in weight loss with or without a run-in
period [56] and thus did not compromise generalizability.

##### Implications

These study findings have practical clinical implications for
health care providers. As the obesity epidemic grows, health
care providers should routinely address the issues of obesity
and inactivity that are associated with poor health outcomes.
Our results will help inform clinicians about commercially
available mHealth tools and social media for patients’ use to
improve health outcomes. Clinicians can tailor patient weight
loss goals using these tools to promote engagement and
adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors. In our study, real-time
feedback from the Fitbit accelerometers along with the
associated mHealth app with diary for tracking weight and
food/calories may have been an important motivational factor.
Utilizing Facebook capabilities for virtual social support among
peers in tandem with health education postings may have also
influenced improvements in health behavior change [34].

##### Conclusions

PilAm Go4Health demonstrated that a mobile technology–based
culturally adapted lifestyle intervention was feasible and
potentially efficacious in weight reduction among older
understudied Filipino Americans with obesity and T2D. Results
are promising for targeted, culturally tailored lifestyle
interventions in achieving short-term weight loss. Therefore, a
larger RCT is warranted to test effectiveness of the PilAm
Go4Health in maintaining long-term weight loss to reduce T2D
and cardiovascular-metabolic risks in this vulnerable population.
