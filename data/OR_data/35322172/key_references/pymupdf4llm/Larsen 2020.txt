### Abstract

**Introduction: Latino men experience disproportionately high rates of diseases related to low**
physical activity, yet are poorly represented in physical activity intervention trials. Efforts to
promote physical activity in Latina women show promising results, yet such interventions have yet
to be extended to Latino men. This study tested a computer expert system-tailored, text
messaging–supported physical activity intervention for underactive Spanish-speaking Latino men
compared with a control group matched for contact time. Potential predictors of intervention
success were also explored.

**Study design: Randomized trial. Participants were randomized to receive a Tailored Physical**
Activity Intervention (Intervention) or a Wellness Control Group (Control). Data were collected in
2015–2017 and analyzed 2018–2019.


**Setting/participants: Insufficiently active Latino men (N=46).**


**Intervention: Intervention participants received a baseline counseling session, then received**
individually tailored print materials and text messages on a tapered schedule for 6 months.
Controls received printed wellness materials and text messages on the same schedule.

**Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was change in weekly moderate-to-vigorous**
physical activity from baseline to 6 months measured by accelerometers. Self-reported moderateto-vigorous physical activity measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview was a
secondary outcome.

**Results: For Intervention participants, median accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous**
physical activity increased from 10.0 minutes/week at baseline to 57.5 minutes/week at 6 months,
while Control participants increased from 21.0 minutes/week at baseline to 23.0 minutes/week at 6
months (p<0.05). Similar results were found for self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity. At 6 months, 47% of Intervention participants met national guidelines of 150 minutes/
week versus 25% of Controls (p=0.15, not significant).


**Conclusions: Findings suggest that an individually tailored intervention can successfully**
increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in underactive Latino men. Such technologysupported interventions have potential for broad dissemination.

### INTRODUCTION

Latinos experience marked disparities in numerous conditions related to inactivity, including
type 2 diabetes and obesity.[1,2] Concordantly, interventions to increase physical activity (PA)
have increasingly been designed and tested with Latinos in recent years. Some of these have
shown significant increases in PA among Latina women,[3,4] suggesting that interventions
could change PA behaviors shown protect against diabetes, obesity, and other lifestylerelated conditions in this high-risk population. Latino men, however, have largely been
absent from PA interventions. In a recent systematic review examining interventions to
promote PA among diverse men, only one published study provided data for Latino men and
there were no studies for which Latino men were exclusively the population of interest.[5]


This is not due to a lack of need, as Latino men also report markedly high rates of
inactivity[6-8] and related diseases. Compared with 26% of non-Latino white men, 40% of
Latino men report never engaging in any leisure time PA[9] and fewer Latinos meet PA
guidelines (15.4% vs 22% for non-Latino whites).[10] This disparity is not purely
socioeconomic: Latino men are less physically active at every level of income, education,
and employment status,[9] and across U.S. regions.[11] Diabetes prevalence in Latino men is
approximately 50% higher than in non-Latino white men,[12] and it is estimated that nearly
80% of Latino men are overweight or obese, the highest of any major demographic group.[13]

Although the majority of Latino men endorse the health benefits of PA,[14] they have cited
lack of programs in Spanish and work-related time constraints as barriers to participating in
PA intervention programs.[15,16] Additionally, many PA interventions for Latinos may not
have appealed to Latino men as they featured walking groups, aerobic dance, and other
activities that may be more appealing to Latina women.[16,17] Limited formative research with
Latino men suggests they may be interested in participating in PA interventions that are
tailored to them.[15] To prevent disease and reduce disparities among Latino men, effective,
gender- and linguistically-appropriate interventions are needed to increase PA in this highrisk, underserved population.

-----

Efficacy of a print-based Spanish language intervention to increase PA was recently shown
in Latina women.[18] To address the large gap in behavioral interventions for Latino men, the
previous intervention was modified and tested in a small one-arm pilot trial. After 12 weeks,
participants significantly increased objectively measured and self-reported PA, and retention
and participant satisfaction were high.[17] In follow-up interviews, intervention participants
recommended program improvements including greater accountability, more contact with
staff and other participants, shorter and more frequent tips, and more updates on PA
opportunities.

Adopting technologies such as text messaging could be a low-cost way to improve real-time
accountability and communication, and may be particularly appropriate for this population.
Cell phone ownership is nearly universal in Latino adults (97%),[19] and Latinos are more
likely than non-Latino whites to use mobile phones for text messaging (85% vs 79%,
respectively).[20] Text messaging can be an effective tool for changing behaviors such as
PA[21]; however, it is more likely to be effective when combined with more intensive
educational components.[22] Combining text messaging with the theory-driven, print-based
intervention could therefore be an appropriate approach to increasing PA in Latino men.


The aim of the current study was to explore the potential efficacy of a multi-channel (print
and text-based), theory-based, individually tailored Spanish language intervention to
increase PA in Latino men through a pilot RCT. The hypothesis was that those randomly
selected to receive the intervention would show significantly greater increases in objectively
measured PA than those in the contact-matched control group. Changes in self-reported PA
and predictors of intervention efficacy were also explored.


### METHODS

The Activo study was an RCT of a 6-month mail- and text-delivered individually tailored
Spanish language PA intervention, compared with a Spanish-language wellness contact
control condition. The primary outcome of interest was minutes/week of moderate-tovigorous PA (MVPA) measured by accelerometers. Self-reported MVPA was a secondary
outcome. Data were collected in 2015–2017, and analyzed in 2018–2019.


**Study Population**

Inclusion criteria included: self-identified as male, self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, selfreported insufficient MVPA (defined as participating in MVPA <90 minutes/week), age 18–
65 years, ability to receive weekly PA-related text messages sent by the study, and
willingness to be randomly assigned to either of the two study conditions.


Exclusion criteria included: unable to read or speak Spanish fluently, any medical conditions
that would make unsupervised exercise unsafe as determined by the PA Readiness
Questionnaire,[23] verified BMI ≤45 kg/m[2], hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder in the
past 3 years, and taking medication that may impair MVPA tolerance or performance (e.g.,
beta blockers).

Men were recruited during an 18-month period through health fairs, community
organizations, and staff organizations at the university, and through media outlets including
newspapers, Craigslist, Facebook, and flyers. Recruitment initially focused on the San Diego
area; however, recruitment within San Diego was slower than anticipated, and a number of
individuals outside the area expressed interest in the study. As broad dissemination is the
ultimate goal of technology-mediated interventions, recruitment was eventually expanded to
include participants outside the local geographic area to explore the potential of delivering
the trial remotely through mediated channels.

Eligible men in the San Diego area attended an in-person orientation session. Interested
individuals signed an informed consent document approved by the UC San Diego IRB.
During this visit, participants filled out baseline questionnaires (described in Measures
section), and height and weight were measured. Participants were also given an
accelerometer, with instructions to wear it for 7 days.


Participants living outside the San Diego area (remote participants) completed the
orientation session via telephone, then returned the informed consent forms through the
mail. Participants were then sent baseline questionnaires and an accelerometer with detailed
instructions to wear it for 7 days, then return it in a postage paid envelope. Anthropometric
measures were not conducted among these participants.

After wearing the accelerometer for 7 days, local participants (n=31) returned to the study
site and completed the 7-day PA Recall (7-day PAR) interview. After completing all baseline
assessments, they were randomized to one of two study arms: (1) Tailored PA Intervention
or (2) Wellness Control. Group assignment was determined using a block-permuted
randomization procedure designed by the study statistician that was stratified by
participants’ Transtheoretical Model Stage of Change, or level of motivational readiness, for
PA. Remote participants (n=17) completed the 7-Day PAR over the phone after mailing back
baseline questionnaires and accelerometers. Using the same block-permuted randomization
procedure, remote participants were randomized over the phone to Tailored PA Intervention
(n=7) or Wellness Control (n=10).


The PA intervention was based on the Social Cognitive Theory and Transtheoretical Model
and emphasized behavioral strategies for increasing PA (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring,
problem-solving barriers, increasing social support). The intervention was adapted by
bilingual (English/Spanish) and bicultural (Mexican American and Puerto Rican) study staff
for Latino men from the team’s existing PA interventions for Latina women through a
formative research process. First, interviews were conducted with underactive Spanishspeaking Latino men (n=10) on their PA needs and preferences. Based on these findings, the
intervention was adapted and piloted in a 12-week single-arm demonstration trial with
Latino men (n=10)[17] followed by qualitative follow-up interviews. To confirm themes from
these interviews, interviews (n=16) were conducted with a new sample of Spanish-speaking
Latino men including questions about their use of cell phones and text messaging. Themes
included a desire for more accountability, more information on including family members
and children in PA, more information on environmental resources, and an intervention that
would accommodate their busy work schedules and odd hours. Findings from the formative

research process were used to inform the development of text messages and integration of
themes into text and print intervention materials.

The baseline session was conducted by a PhD-level interventionist trained in motivational
interviewing techniques. Participants set short-term goals, anticipated and problem solved
potential barriers and were encouraged to gradually increase their activity to 150 minutes/
week. Participants were given a pedometer and asked to track their number of steps, as
previous studies show this can increase PA.[24] Participants also received recommendations
for walking/jogging routes, gyms, parks, and other places to be active near their work or
home. Remote participants received all information in the mail prior to their scheduled
phone call and completed goal setting via telephone.


Throughout the 6-month intervention, participants received tailored PA information in the
mail weekly during Month 1, biweekly in Months 2 and 3, and monthly during Months 4–6.
These mailings consisted of: (1) manuals matched to the participant’s current level of
motivational readiness to change, based on the Transtheoretical Model; (2) individually
tailored computerized expert system feedback reports based on the participant’s answers to
monthly questionnaires (described in Measures section) that compared participants with
their prior responses and with individuals who are physically active on self-efficacy for PA
and cognitive and behavioral strategies associated with PA behavior change (processes of
change); and (3) PA tip sheets addressing barriers to being active (such as work and family
obligations). Participants also received two text messages weekly throughout the
intervention: The first provided a useful/motivational tip, and the second prompted the
participant to report their minutes of MVPA the previous week.

Participants in the intervention arm received regularly scheduled phone calls from a Spanishspeaking Latino interventionists during the initial 3 months of the study: after 1 week (to
ensure proper pedometer use and receipt of text messages), after 1 month (20 to 30–minute
call to review progress and set new goals), and after 2 and 3 months (addressing text
messaging engagement).


**Measures**


Participants in the Wellness Control Group received publicly available Spanish-language
print materials from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute on promotion of hearthealthy behaviors for Latinos via mail and SMS text messaging. Print-based materials
included booklets on health topics other than PA (e.g., cholesterol) and health tip sheets
(e.g., insomnia, stress management, and nutrition) mailed to participants on the same
schedule as the PA intervention arm. Participants also received two text messages weekly
throughout the study containing health and wellness tips unrelated to PA, and received phone
calls on the same schedule verifying receipt of text messages and answering any questions.

Questionnaires were administered at baseline to measure demographic information,
acculturation (Brief Acculturation Scale), and adult health literacy (Short Test of Functional
Health Literacy in Adults).[25]

MVPA at baseline and 6 months was measured by accelerometer (ActiGraph 3X+).
Accelerometers measure movement and intensity of PA and have been validated with heart
rate telemetry26 and total energy expenditure.27 Participants wore the accelerometer on
their left hip for 7 days. Consistent with previous studies, valid wear time was classified as 5
days of ≥600 minutes of wear time each day or ≥3,000 minutes of wear time over 4 days.28
Accelerometer data were processed using the ActiLife software using a cut point of 1,952
and ≥10 minutes/bout to establish the minimum threshold for MVPA.

Activity was also measured via self-report using the 7-Day PAR interview.[29-34] The 7-Day
PAR is an interviewer-administered instrument that provides an estimate of weekly minutes
and intensity of PA. Strategies for increasing accuracy of recall are incorporated, and all
domains of PA (e.g., leisure, transportation, and occupational) are evaluated. To help
participants distinguish between PA intensities in their recollection of PA, San Diego–based
participants walked on a treadmill for 10 minutes at a moderate intensity pace
(approximately 3–4 miles per hour, determined by rating of perceived exertion) immediately
before completing the 7-Day PAR at baseline and again at follow-up. Owing to logistical
limitations, this was not done for the remote participants. The 7-Day PAR has been widely
used and consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and
concurrent validity with objective measures of activity.[29-33] The 7-Day PAR is valid to
deliver by phone, sensitive to changes in MVPA over time,[30,31] and has good test–retest
reliability among Latino participants.[34] To avoid bias, study staff conducting the 7-Day PAR,
and all other measures, were blinded to study condition.


Three measures specific to PA behavior change were administered at baseline and then on a
monthly basis throughout the study to help generate the tailored expert system feedback
reports for the PA intervention group participants. These included the 4-item Stages of
Change measure, the 40-item Processes of Change measure, and PA self-efficacy. Each of
these have shown good reliability and validity.[35-37]


**Statistical Analysis**

As a preliminary step, between-group differences in baseline variables, including
sociodemographics, acculturation, and baseline minutes/week of MVPA were examined
using t-tests (for continuous variables), chi-square tests (for categorical variables), and nonparametric tests as appropriate. Using correlation analysis, potential confounders were
identified (e.g., demographic characteristics). A variable was considered a confounder if it
was correlated with both the outcome and predictor (group assignment) at a modest p<0.10
level. Confounders were included as covariates in subsequent models.


Unadjusted weekly minutes of MVPA at baseline and follow-up were presented by arm for
both subjectively reported MVPA and objectively measured outcomes. As MVPA data were
skewed and attempts to transform toward normality were unsuccessful (e.g., skewness still
significant), medians and interquartile ranges are presented as measures of central tendency
and spread. Finally, Spearman rank correlations were used to examine associations between
self-reported and objectively measured minutes/week of MVPA at baseline and follow-up.
Spearman correlations are less subject to potential outlying values. Assuming moderate
effect sizes, N=60 was determined adequate to detect significant between-group differences.

To examine potential intervention effects on the primary outcome (weekly minutes of
MVPA at 6 months), a series of quantile regression models were used, which estimate
effects on median outcomes (as opposed to mean outcomes), and are thus ideal in pilot
studies where the outcomes are subject to a high degree of variability and skewness. Models
regressed outcome at 6 months (self-reported and objectively measured minutes/week of
MVPA in separate models) on treatment assigned, baseline value of the outcome, as well as
confounders identified a priori. Models of objectively measured MVPA additionally
controlled for ActiGraph wear time. Model estimates were based on a likelihood/quasilikelihood approach to estimation and thus made use of all available data without directly
imputing missing outcomes.

As a subsequent step, the proportion of participants who reported meeting national
guidelines for MVPA[38] (defined as ≥150 minutes/week of MVPA measured by the 7-Day
PAR) was examined. Both unadjusted and adjusted differences between groups were
examined (using chi-square analyses for the former and logistic regression for the latter).


Using a series of quantile regression models, potential baseline predictors of success were
explored, including sociodemographic variables and nativity among those randomized to the
intervention condition. Interest was in exploring predictors of PA adoption for those
receiving the intervention condition. Correlation analysis was used as a preliminary step to
reduce the risk of multicollinearity (namely, no two variables with correlations >0.75 were
included in the multivariate model. Should this case arise, the decision was made to include
the stronger correlate of study outcome). The goal was to identify potential characteristics of
participants who reported greater minutes/week of MVPA at end of treatment controlling for
baseline. Given the limitations of sample size, this was exploratory and estimates of effect
(with CIs) were of interest (as opposed to statistical hypothesis testing).

All analyses were carried out in Stata/SE, version 15.1 and α set a priori at 0.05. Analyses
were conducted on the intention-to-treat sample. Estimates were based on likelihood
approaches and thus made use of all available data without directly imputing missing
outcomes.


### RESULTS


Study participants were 46 men randomized to Intervention (n=22) and Control (n=24)
groups (CONSORT diagram, Figure 1). Participants were recruited in 2015–2016, with
follow-up visits extending into 2017. Two participants never started and thus were removed
from subsequent analyses. Participants were aged 43.04 (SD=10.67) years, and 87%
identified as Mexican or Mexican American. The majority had at least some college
education (57%), were employed at least part time (87%), were first-generation Americans
(85%), and spoke more Spanish than English in the home (70%). There were no significant
between-group differences in demographic characteristics or baseline PA (p>0.05 for all).
All participants had valid objectively measured MVPA at baseline, and 30 (65%) had valid
data at 6 months. In addition, all participants had valid self-reported PA at baseline and 85%
had valid data at follow-up. A full description of the sample is presented in Table 1.

For ActiGraph-measured MVPA, the median increased from 10.00 minutes/week (IQR=0–
42.50) to 57.50 minutes/week (IQR=18.50–104.50) among Intervention participants and
from 21.00 minutes/week (IQR=0–59) to 23.00 minutes/week (IQR=0–76.25) among
Controls. At baseline, median wear time was 13.9 hours/day at baseline and 13.5 hours/day
at follow-up with no significant difference between conditions (p>0.05). Quantile regression
indicated a significant between-group difference in median objectively measured MVPA at 6
months (b=37.52 [18.01], p=0.04), suggesting a difference in median minutes/week of
MVPA at 6 months between Intervention and Control to be 38 minutes. Correlations
between self-reported and objectively measured MVPA were borderline significant at
baseline (rho=0.28, p=0.07) and significant at 6 months (rho=0.49, p=0.01).

Intervention dose was assessed by evaluating the number of questionnaires returned (zero to
six), intervention calls completed (zero to three), and percentage of materials participants
reported reading. Adjusting for baseline MVPA, there was a trend toward greater
accelerometer-measured MVPA in those returning more questionnaires (b=20.60 [19.66]),
for those completing more intervention calls (b=13.38 [18.99]), and for those who reported
reading more of the mailed materials (b=12.37 [66.70]).


At baseline, median self-reported MVPA was 10.00 minutes/week for Intervention
participants (IQR=0–45) and 5.00 minutes/week for controls (IQR=0–43.75). At 6-month
follow-up, these increased to 95.00 minutes/week (IQR=15–180) among Intervention
participants and 52.50 minutes/week among Controls (IQR=16.25–298.50). These data are
presented in Figure 2. Although not significant, there was a trend favoring Intervention
participants in minutes/week of MVPA at 6 months controlling for baseline, with a
difference in median minutes/week of 42.36 between Intervention and Control (p=0.10).
There were no significant differences at baseline or 6 months between face-to-face and
remote participants in MVPA measured by accelerometers or self-report (p>0.19 for all).

Fourteen participants (36%) of the aggregate sample met national guidelines for selfreported PA at 6 months (47% of Intervention participants vs 25% of Controls, χ[2]=2.12,
p=0.15). Logistic regression models showed an OR of 2.70 (95% CI=0.70, 10.47) for
meeting national guidelines in intervention versus control participants.


Models of ActiGraph-measured MVPA at 6 months suggested that, among patients in the
intervention group, a greater increased was observed for first-generation participants than
second-generation participants (b=113.15, 95% CI=7.96, 234.26). This generation effect was
also found for self-reported MVPA at 6 months, controlling for baseline (b=176.19, 95%
CI=12.38, 340.01).

Furthermore, those who were married or living with their partner had lower accelerometermeasured MVPA at 6 months compared with those who were single (b= −83.88, 95% CI=
−146.72, −21.03). Point estimates did not suggest effects of age, health literacy, BMI,
employment or reading language preference on success in the Intervention.

### DISCUSSION

Findings from the current study support the preliminary efficacy of Spanish language PA
interventions delivered via individually tailored self-help materials and text messages for
Latino men. Participants in the intervention group achieved significantly greater increases in
MVPA than the control group over a 6-month period. This was seen for both objectively
measured and self-reported MVPA (38 and 42 minutes more than controls, respectively), and
appeared to increase with intervention dose received. Although the sample size was smaller
than planned, the effect size was larger than anticipated, thus findings were still statistically
significant. Such increases are similar to those found in prior print- and Internet-based
interventions for Latina women (mean differences of 41 and 50 minutes/week at 6 months
with similar controls, p<0.01, respectively).[4,18] Significant correlations between self-report
and accelerometer-recorded MVPA were also found in both studies.


**Limitations**


As for predictors of treatment effect, first generation immigrants and single men seemed to
benefit more from the intervention than their more acculturated or partnered counterparts.
The hypothesis is that individuals who read more in Spanish may have fewer appropriate PA
resources/programs and thus found this Spanish language program particularly helpful and
relevant to their needs, compared to those who read more in English and thus already had
plenty of PA information options available. Single individuals may have had fewer
competing demands for their time and thus could participate more fully in the program.
Similar results have been found in weight loss studies.[39] Thus, future studies may need to
take relationship status into consideration when intervening on health behaviors. Recent
findings for Latino men have highlighted the importance of family dynamics, social support
(spouse, children), and their relationship to accountability for the initiation and maintenance
of PA.[16]

Study limitations include the short length (6 months) of the intervention and small sample
size (N=46), which limited the feasibility of subanalyses. The study sample comprised
primarily first-generation, educated (57% at least some college) Latino men, and thus
findings may not generalize to the larger population. Moreover, the study focused on MVPA
and may not fully capture physically active work, which may be more prominent in Latino
men. For remote participants, anthropometric measures were not collected and PA recall
interviews occurred by phone. However, this allowed the authors to determine that the
intervention could be disseminated to a larger audience without requiring face-to-face visits.
Additional strengths of the study include the understudied, high-risk population, RCT
design, both objective and self-report measures of MVPA, and high retention rate (93.5%).
The high retention rate in this study may be due to a number of strategies, including offering
flexible times for study visits (early morning, evening, weekends), visits and check-in calls
were made by the same bilingual, bicultural staff who built rapport with participants, and
staff used multiple modes of communication (text, letter, phone) to contact participants who
missed study appointments.


Latino men are often not well represented in clinical trials, despite recent NIH program
announcements focused on minority men. Past researchers have faced challenges to

recruiting Latino men and this study was no different.[40] Based on previous experience
recruiting Latina women, initial recruitment efforts for this study used diverse approaches,
such as community events, partnering with local leaders and churches, and posting
advertisements on Latino newspapers and Craigslist. However, among this population of
Latino men, non-face-to-face recruitment strategies were more effective and yielded the
majority of participants. However, though recruitment was difficult, Latino men had higher
retention rates and satisfaction compared to previous studies with Latina women.[3,4] Future
research should continue to identify strategies to recruit and engage Latino men. Although
some flexibility may be required to facilitate Latino male research participation, their voices
will be critical to developing effective interventions and addressing existing health
disparities.

It is hypothesized that intervention components contributed to differences in PA between the
Intervention Group and Controls by addressing participant calls for accountability (via
phone calls, texting), more information on including family members and children in PA and
environmental resources (in self-help print materials), and accommodation of busy work
schedules and odd hours (in all three distance-based approaches). However, the multiple
component nature of this intervention makes it difficult to determine the individual
influences of the various features. Multiphase optimization strategies could help tease out
added benefits of text messaging and further streamline the intervention for cost
effectiveness prior to large-scale dissemination and implementation.


Finally, given national data supporting smartphone access in Latino men[8] and their apparent
willingness to receive/interact with phone-based PA intervention strategies in the current
study, future steps will involve transferring the program to smartphone application for
increased convenience and ease of use.


### CONCLUSIONS

The poor chronic disease profile for U.S. Latino men, coupled with few Spanish PA
interventions, necessitates research that can produce practice-relevant evidence leading to
effective PA programs for this population. These results show feasibility and good potential
efficacy of an expert system tailored print intervention paired with text messaging, including
delivering the intervention remotely via non-face-to-face mediated channels, and objective
measurement. The ongoing challenge is to establish maintenance that will contribute to a
sustained healthy lifestyle and reduced health disparities.
