Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) 
and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our 
objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to 
Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American 
Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. 
Methods: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including 
questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or 
treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were 
followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. 
Results: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having 
an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per 
week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk 
of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no diﬀerence 
between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up 
included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per 
week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired 
functionality. 
Conclusions: Participation in assessment alone may have been suﬃcient to encourage behavioral 
change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in 
a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other 
women’s drinking and one’s own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.

developmental disabilities and learning disabilities. In the 
most severe form of FASD, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 
fetal development is so aﬀected as to result in neurobehavior- 
al dysfunction, growth restriction, microcephaly, and charac- 
teristic facial features (Jones et al., 1973). FASD result in 
persistent deﬁcits in cognitive and motor functions including 
learning and memory, complex thought, attention, and 
motor control, as well as psychosocial behavior (Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, 2000; Streissguth et al., 1978). 
Less severe forms of FASD are more diﬃcult to identify but 
thought to be more prevalent. Speciﬁcally, current estimates 
are that FASD aﬀects 2 to 5% of young elementary school 
children in the United States and that FAS may aﬀect 0.2 to 
0.7% (May et al., 2009). Signiﬁcant variation in FASD prev- 
alence among populations is associated with diﬀerences in 
magnitude and prevailing patterns of alcohol consumption 
as well as variability in how prevalence is measured. In addi- 
tion, there may be modiﬁcation of risk by nutritional status, 
maternal age, and genetics (May et al., 2011). 



There is no known safe level of alcohol consumption dur- 
ing pregnancy. A recent study evaluating prenatal alcohol 
exposure and a number of outcomes including growth 
parameters, facial dysmorphology characteristic of prenatal 
alcohol exposure, and minor structural malformations found 
a linear relationship and no evidence of a threshold (Sawada 
Feldman et al., 2012). A review of well-controlled studies 
including 6 published studies examining the eﬀect of low to 
moderate alcohol consumption on the cognitive, social, and 
emotional development of children found that 4 of the 6 
showed an association between prenatal alcohol exposure 
and negative outcome (hyperactivity, behavioral problems, 
emotional problems, peer relationship problems, and atten- 
tion deﬁcit disorder) in children from 3 to 16 years (Holm- 
gren, 2009). Despite current controversy (Kesmodel et al., 
2012), there is at best inconclusive evidence of a threshold 
and the preponderance of data supports that there is no safe 
dose of prenatal alcohol exposure. One reason for the con- 
troversy is the diﬃculty involved in teasing out neurobehav- 
ioral eﬀects of a particular exposure given the myriad 
potential confounders (nutrition, genetics, etc.; Coriale et al., 
2014; May and Gossage, 2011). In 2005, the Surgeon Gen- 
eral of the United States issued an advisory for all women 
who are pregnant or might become pregnant to not consume 
alcohol (Services, 2005). 
However, the pattern of prenatal alcohol consumption 
associated with the greatest risk of FASD is heavy episodic 
drinking or binge drinking (Paintner et al., 2012). Binge 
drinking results in higher blood alcohol concentrations 
which are associated with greater injury to the fetus. Drink- 
ing a greater number of drinks per week or month also 
increases the risk of harm (Maier and West, 2001). 
Timing of alcohol consumption during pregnancy inﬂu- 
ences the type of injury to the fetus; the particular injury is 
related to the developmental phase of the fetus at the time of 
exposure. A particularly sensitive time for the development 
of the brain and some of the characteristic dysmorphology 
associated with FAS occurs early in the ﬁrst trimester (Rous- 
sotte et al., 2012). This is relevant as more than half of all 
pregnancies in the United States are unplanned (Finer and 
Zolna, 2011), and many women are unaware they are preg- 
nant 4 to 6 weeks postconception (Floyd et al., 1999). To 
prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP), it is therefore 
important to include all women of childbearing age who may 
consume alcohol in prevention/intervention. 
While most women reduce or stop drinking alcohol upon 
becoming aware that they are pregnant, some groups of 
women appear to be at greater risk of continued drinking: 
women who are unmarried, unemployed, depressed, risky 
drinkers, exposed to violence, or simply confused by health 
warning messages and the amount of alcohol their drinks 
contain (Havens et al., 2009; Kaskutas, 2000; Skagerstr(cid:1)om 
et al., 2011). Drinking during pregnancy is heavily inﬂuenced 
by social norms and therefore varies widely among popula- 
tions. For example, the percent of women who report drink- 
ing alcohol during pregnancy is 0% in Saudi Arabia, 6% in 
Sweden (Nilsen et al., 2008), 7.4% in the United States 
(Marchetta, 2012), and 34% in New Zealand (Mallard et al., 
2013). Similarly, among the limited populations studied, 
drinking during pregnancy among the heterogeneous Ameri- 
can Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) populations of the United 
States diﬀers signiﬁcantly. May and colleagues (2004) pub- 
lished data from a prenatal clinic among Northern Plains 
Indians indicating 16.2% of pregnant women consumed 
alcohol. Other AIAN studies have reported 36% of urban 
and 14% of reservation residing pregnant women consuming 
alcohol (Warren et al., 1990) and 53.4% at 1 prenatal clinic 
in the Northern Plains (Bad Heart Bull et al., 1999). Risky 
prepregnancy drinking is a strong predictor of drinking dur- 
ing pregnancy (Ethen et al., 2009). Further exacerbating risk 
are associations of binge drinking with increased risk of 
unintended pregnancies (Naimi et al., 2003). Within the pop- 
ulation addressed in this study, approximately a third of 
women between the ages of 18 and 45 years are estimated to 
be at risk of having an AEP (Montag et al., unpublished 
data). 
Eﬀectiveness of FASD prevention strategies implemented 
among various AIAN populations was recently reviewed 
(Montag et al., 2012). Available evidence suggests that an 
eﬀective intervention should strive to include local commu- 
nity members in all aspects of the program, create a relevant 
and understandable intervention recognizing speciﬁc risk 
and protective factors within the community, and address 
logistic barriers to participation. 
Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment 
(SBIRT) is a prevention and early intervention approach 
that uses wide screening, education and feedback speciﬁc to 
the participant, and professional treatment for those identi- 
ﬁed by the screening as positive for alcohol abuse problems 
(Babor et al., 2007). The latter component, the incorporation 
of specialized treatment as warranted, sets the approach 
apart from those oﬀering only brief interventions which have 
demonstrated largely positive but mixed results (Whitlock 
et al., 2004). Some reasons for lack of proven beneﬁt may be 
that assessment alone may have a mitigating eﬀect on risky 
drinking (although this has been controlled for in some stud- 
ies) or that extreme risky drinking may decrease over time 
due to “regression toward the mean.” Valuable lessons 
learned from Brief Intervention studies include that proto- 
cols with multiple contacts are more likely to alter behavior 
than single contact protocols (Longabaugh et al., 2001) and 
that eﬀectiveness may be related to the severity of the under- 
lying condition (Bernstein and Bernstein, 2008). SBIRT has 
been used to motivate a reduction in alcohol consumption in 
a number of populations including emergency room and 
other healthcare setting patients (Madras et al., 2009), col- 
lege freshmen (Bezilla, 2010), and WIC participants (Delra- 
him-Howlett et al., 2011). 
Within the Native American Research Centers for Health 
(NARCH) framework, this intervention sought to develop 
and test an SBIRT adaptation for reducing risky drinking 
in Southern 
in AIAN women of childbearing potential 


California. NARCH is an initiative funded through a 
partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
and the Indian Health Service. As a NARCH project, the 
overarching goals go beyond the speciﬁc aims of any single 
study to address tribally identiﬁed health priorities, reduce 
distrust of research by the community, and develop future 
competitive AIAN researchers. 


The population sample consisted of AIAN women from 18 to 
45 years of age, of childbearing potential, recruited from 1 of 3 
AIAN health clinics located in Southern California between April 
2011 and September 2012. The sample used for each analysis will 
vary and is described in association with the particular analysis. 

This protocol was approved by University of California, San 
Diego, San Diego State University, and Southern California Tribal 
Health Clinic Institutional Review Boards. A Certiﬁcate of Conﬁ- 
dentiality was obtained from the NIH to further protect the conﬁ- 
dentiality of participants’ data. All research staﬀ complete human 
research subject protections training. 

Potential participants were approached in waiting areas of health 
clinics and screened for eligibility (see Fig. 1 for study ﬂowchart). 
Interested and eligible participants were brought to a private room 
where, following the consenting procedure, they were assigned a 
unique identiﬁcation number, completed a paper-based self-admin- 
istered baseline survey, and were randomized into the intervention 
or control group. Randomization was accomplished by the research 
assistant, in blinded fashion, pulling a label preprinted with either 
“intervention” or “control” from a single-study randomizing con- 
tainer containing equal numbers of each label. Participants random- 
ized into the intervention group completed a web-based survey 
which provided personalized feedback including analysis of risk, 
advice, and helpful hints that could be printed out in a conﬁdential 
manner. Participants randomized into the control group received 

“treatment as usual” which consisted of access to displayed educa- 
tional brochures about health in the various waiting areas but did 
not include speciﬁc FASD information. All participants had the 
opportunity to request referral for treatment to a professional sub- 
stance abuse counselor. At 1, 3, and 6 months following baseline 
assessment, participants were contacted by telephone to complete 
follow-up surveys. At each follow-up, participants were again 
oﬀered referrals to treatment. Participants were provided incentives 
in the form of a $10 gift card and the choice of a fan or T-shirt 
emblazoned with the project logo at enrollment and a $15 gift card 
following completion of the ﬁnal follow-up questionnaire. Addi- 
tional retention incentives were added during the study to improve 
follow-up completion rates. Participants received 1 raﬄe ticket rep- 
resenting a chance to win a $100 prize for each completed follow-up 
interview. 

Data were collected on 3 separate occasions during the study: at 
recruitment, all participants completed the baseline questionnaire 
which is referred to as “assessment,” during the web-based interven- 
tion participants randomized into the intervention arm of the study 
responded to the web-based questionnaire, and during each follow- 
up all participants able to be contacted for follow-up answered 
questions in the follow-up questionnaire. A few questions appeared 
in both the baseline and web-based questionnaires. 
Baseline Questionnaire. The self-administered questionnaire 
included questions regarding current relationship situation, employ- 
ment, religiosity, income, gravidity, parity, birth control use, current 
use of prescription and nonprescription medications, smoking, ille- 
gal drug use, depression and functionality, awareness of FASD, 
knowledge regarding the risks of alcohol consumption to women 
and to pregnancy, and alcohol consumption including number of 
drinks consumed per week and per occasion, and number of binge 
episodes in the past 2 weeks (binge deﬁned as consuming ≥3 drinks 
per occasion). 
Web-Based Questionnaire. Participants randomized into the 
intervention arm of the study self-reported information by com- 
puter regarding alcohol consumption over the past 2 weeks, current 
use of prescription or nonprescription medications, pregnancy sta- 
tus, the age they began drinking alcohol, and contraceptive use. 
Illustrations of various alcoholic beverage containers were used to 
prompt recall. They were asked to complete a series of true or 
false knowledge questions about risks associated with alcohol 
consumption. 

In the follow-up telephone question- 
naire, research assistants asked questions regarding current relation- 
ship status, pregnancy status, birth control use, and alcohol 
consumption, including binge drinking, over the past 2 weeks. 

eCHECKUP TO GO, a web-based brief assessment and inter- 
vention tool based on the e-CHUG web tool developed for college 
students by Drs. Van Sickle and Moyer at San Diego State Univer- 
sity, was tailored to the population participating in this study 
(Gorman et al., 2013; Venner et al., 2007). Participants answered 
questions in a conﬁdential manner at their own pace and received 
individualized web-based feedback at the end of the session regard- 
ing their risk for an AEP, the impact of alcohol exposure to the 
fetus, the physical and ﬁnancial cost of their alcohol consumption, 
and how their drinking compared with that of other Native women. 
A resource page at the end of the web session provided information 
on resources for additional information or assistance and could be

complete. 

The “Vulnerability to Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy” variable was 
deﬁned in 2 categories: not at high risk and at high risk. Being “at 
high risk” for an AEP was deﬁned as (i) currently drinking 3 or 
more standard drinks per occasion and/or 8 or more standard 
drinks per week and (ii) using a less than a highly eﬀective contra- 
ceptive method. We deﬁned “binge” or “risky” drinking as 3 or

more standard drinks per occasion and/or 8 or more drinks per 
week as, despite being a nonstandard deﬁnition, this level of con- 
sumption has been deﬁned as either risky for women or predictive 
of risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in other studies (May et al., 
2013). We deﬁned standard drinks as shown in Fig. 2. 
Participants were asked to indicate which form(s) of contracep- 
tion they used from a list. Responses were categorized by eﬀective- 
ness. Contraceptive eﬀectiveness was deﬁned as: High (<1 
pregnancy per 100 women per year), Medium High (2 to 9 pregnan- 
cies per 100 women per year), Medium Low (15 to 24 pregnancies 
per 100 women per year), and Low (≥25 pregnancies per 100 women 
per year) (WHO, 2011). 
The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to 
measure depression and functionality (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002). 
Depression variables derived from this measure included treatment 
recommendation for depression (treatment recommended or not 
recommended), minor depression (yes/no), major depression (yes/ 
no), and functionality (impaired or not impaired). 
As only the intervention group responded to the web-based ques- 
tions, questions from the paper-based baseline questionnaire were 
used in the analysis where possible. However, where a question in 
the intervention group was left blank in the paper questionnaire, the 
web-based answer was used. Primary outcome variables included 
the number of drinks consumed per week, the number of binge 
episodes over the past 2 weeks, and vulnerability to AEP. 
subjects available at all follow-ups and (ii) multiple imputation 
methods. Linear regression was used to test reduction of some 
drinking parameters from baseline. Repeated ANOVA or mixed- 
model methods were used to estimate individual change over time 
and compare trajectories. Change was assessed in 2 ways: (i) using a 
dichotomous scale where participants were improved or not and (ii) 
using a 3 category system where participants were categorized as 
improved, remaining not at risk, and remaining at risk or at 
increased risk. Regression was used to test for predictors of positive 
change. First, each predictor was tested to determine whether there 
were signiﬁcant independent associations with that 1 factor and 
change. Then, multiple regression analysis was used examine all 
variables previously found to be signiﬁcant. All 2-way interactions 
among signiﬁcant variables were tested. 
Additional analyses explored the eﬀect of the intervention on 
high-risk drinkers alone, the eﬀect of missing (or completing) a fol- 
low-up session on ﬁnal outcome, diﬀerences between participants 
lost to follow-up and remaining participants, and the eﬀect of con- 
trolling for baseline drinking or risk status on ﬁnal outcome. 
Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as 2-sided, p-value of <0.05. 
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (PASW 18; SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL). 


Comparisons were conducted using t-tests (continuous), chi- 
square (dichotomous), Fisher’s exact test (dichotomous with small 
cell sizes), and nonparametric analyses (for data not normally dis- 
tributed and not transformed). Normality in continuous variables 
was investigated through skewness and kurtosis. Analysis of var- 
iance (ANOVA) was used to examine associations among popula- 
tion characteristics. The vulnerability to AEP outcome variable was 
tested as dichotomous (“at high risk” vs. “not at high risk”). Change 
over time analyses were conducted in 2 ways: (i) using only the 
A total of 263 women were recruited into the study; of

ity was impaired), thinking other women drink more, and 
experiencing more binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, were 
associated with reduced alcohol consumption. Table 5 shows 
predictors of change when model is adjusted for baseline 
alcohol consumption. In this study, depression and function- 
ality variables often functioned similarly in analyses. Many 
women in our study expressed surprise regarding both other 
women’s drinking (that half do not drink) and their own 
(that they were engaging in binge drinking). 

In this randomized controlled study, risky drinking behav- 
ior and vulnerability to AEP were reduced in both the inter- 
vention and control groups. For each primary outcome 
variable (number drinks per week, number binge episodes 
per 2 weeks, vulnerability to AEP), there was evidence of a 
time eﬀect but no statistically signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect. 
Eﬀects were sustained over the 6-month follow-up period. 
Assessment reactivity (particularly in participants already 
considering change), regression to the mean, and eﬀects 
related to our mixed mode design may have contributed to 
the reduction in alcohol consumption in the control group. 
Our ﬁndings emphasize the need to include control groups in 
similar studies. In controlled studies, similar eﬀects are not 
uncommon observations (Bernstein et al., 2010). The ﬁnding 
that assessment, in and of itself, is associated with a positive 
change in behavior has important implications for future 
interventions in this population. An assessment strategy may 
prove appropriate in situations where more time-intensive 
approaches are impractical. 
American Indian/Alaska Native tribes vary signiﬁcantly 
in alcohol consumption (May and Gossage, 2001a; Spic- 
er et al., 2003). Our ﬁndings regarding the pattern of 
drinking among our participants supports previous work 
by May and Gossage (2001b), among others, where binge 
drinking is the primary pattern of drinking among a 



number of AIAN populations. Overestimation of other 
to 
women’s 
increased drinking (Dunnagan et al., 2007) and increased 
perception of risks associated with drinking may reduce 
consumption (Testa and Reifman, 1996). Social norms 
that tolerate risky drinking may prevent women from rec- 
ognizing and addressing problems. According to the 2007 
National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the vast major- 
ity of people needing treatment for alcohol abuse were 
unaware that they needed it (Substance Abuse and Men- 
tal Health Services Administration, 2008). Nonetheless, 
attempts to shift social norms relating to alcohol con- 
sumption have been used in interventions among non- 
AIAN populations with mixed results (Clapp et al., 2003; 
Lewis and Neighbors, 2006). The present results indicate 
that, among AIAN women in our source group, interven- 
tions addressing social norms may prove eﬀective. Find- 
ings support narrow social norms among variables such 
as drinks per occasion among drinkers, drinks needed to 
feel tipsy, and age at ﬁrst drink. These variables were not 
diﬀerent among groups with diﬀerent vulnerability to 
AEP. The perception of how much other women drink 
was an important predictor of reduced drinking during 
follow-up. 
In addition to perceiving social norms of higher alcohol 
consumption, the present study revealed 2 other predictors 
of reduction in alcohol use: testing positive for depression 
or impaired functionality and a greater number of binge 
drinking episodes over a 2-week period. Treatment for 
depression was recommended for a third of the women in 
our sample (36%). This proportion is striking when com- 
pared to the prevalence of depression among U.S. women 
(14% in 2006) (Farr et al., 2010) and among 2,289 adult 
Alaska Native women (20%) (Dillard et al., 2012) mea- 
sured using the same PHQ-9 instrument. In women, as 
opposed to men, depression appears to predate alcohol 
problems 
(Helzer and Pryzbeck, 1988). Screening for 
depression may facilitate identiﬁcation of women vulnera- 
ble to AEP. Furthermore, addressing depression in this 
population may be a helpful independent approach to pre- 
venting FASD. 
The ﬁnding that a greater magnitude of change was pre- 
dicted by higher number of binge episodes at baseline is 
somewhat unexpected in that the strategy of SBIRT is geared 
toward a broader population of relatively lower risk. How- 
ever, recognition of the extent of one’s binge drinking may 
be sobering (and motivating) for women who are more likely 
to frequently binge drink. 
Controlling for baseline alcohol consumption only served 
to improve the predictive power of our model (adjusted R2 
increased to 78.9%). In addition, binge drinking, perception 
of social norms, and depression/functionality were consis- 
tently predictive of primary variable change at each follow- 
up time point. Variables that were, perhaps unexpectedly, 
not signiﬁcantly predictive of change were age, smoking, 
income, illegal drug use, and religiosity.

Previous research has found that the eﬀect of an interven- 
tion may be intensiﬁed or extended by multiple contacts 
(Longabaugh et al., 2001). In the present study, whether or 
not the 1-month follow-up contact was completed did not 
aﬀect the 3- or 6-month follow-up results (data not shown). 
Similarly, missing the 3-month follow-up did not aﬀect ﬁnd- 
ings in the 6-month follow-up. 
The present intervention did not include a contraceptive 
intervention component beyond assessment. Contraceptive 
use was not diﬀerent among treatment groups or follow-up 
time points. As vulnerability to AEP may be decreased by 
preventing pregnancy as well as preventing risky drinking, 
this would be a valuable addition to future interventions. 
such interventions are project 
Relevant 
CHOICES (Floyd et al., 2007) and EARLY (Ingersoll et al., 
2013). It is of note that exposure to the EARLY intervention 
was associated with a greater change in contraceptive use 
than in alcohol consumption (Ingersoll et al., 2013). 


Participants in this study were self-selected volunteers so 
that it is unknown to what extent they represent the entire 
population of women of reproductive potential in these set- 
tings. However, we recruited potential subjects at various 
locations and publicized the study broadly. Our randomiza- 
tion procedure was ﬂawed in that the number of binary 
choices that could be pulled by the research assistants was 
larger than the number of participants ultimately recruited. 
This may have contributed to the greater number of partici- 
pants in the control group (n = 142) compared to the Inter- 
vention group (n = 121). Another limitation was that data 
were self-reported and therefore not feasible to validate. 
“Social presence” may have played a role as the self-admin- 
istered paper-based and web-based questionnaires were 
completed with a researcher in the same room. Therefore, it 
is possible that participants may have under- or over 
reported sensitive behaviors due to social acceptability/ 
desirability. 
In addition, a mixed mode design for data collection was 
used where baseline data was collected using a paper- and 
pencil-based format and follow-up data were obtained by 
telephone interview. Participants randomized to the interven- 
tion, completed an additional web-based survey where a sub- 
set of questions were repeated from the baseline survey. We 
compared responses on questions that occurred in both the 
paper-based and web-based modes and found no signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences. 
We sought to minimize these potential biases by assuring 
participants of conﬁdentiality, using well-trained interview- 
ers who were community members, establishing private envi- 
ronments for all data collection modes, using equivalent 
questions across modes, and ensuring that participants could 
ask questions or request clariﬁcation of questions in all 
modes. 
Not all participants completed all follow-up interviews. 
Missing follow-up data may introduce bias but, whether data 
were analyzed using only complete data sets, all available 
data, or using multiple imputation methods, the results did 
not diﬀer. 
Alcohol consumption data were collected in increments of 
2 weeks; a relatively short time period selected for obtaining 
the most precise data on daily drinking habits. As the num- 
ber of drinks consumed per occasion (or drinking day) 
remained relatively consistent and reductions in risky drink- 
ing were largely due to changes in the frequency of drinking 
days, the brief assessment period may have introduced bias. 
This threat to validity could be lessened in future studies by 
expanding the assessment time periods. 
As mentioned above with regard to the control group, 
regression to the mean may be a possible explanation for our 
ﬁndings. Possible distortion of results due to the Hawthorne 
eﬀect could not be ruled out as participants were informed 
by the consent form that there would be follow-up calls 
within a 6-month period. 
Initial and continuing eﬀorts to gain the support of the 
community and to ensure conﬁdentiality increased participa- 
tion and retention. All recruitment and data collection were 


carried out by trusted community members trained as 
research assistants. Approval and support of the Tribal IRB 
was obtained. Eﬀorts were made to adapt the SBIRT inter- 
vention to make it as relevant and understandable to this 
particular community as possible.

Our ﬁnding that assessment alone, even without interven- 
tion, may be suﬃcient to decrease risky drinking and vulner- 
ability to AEP indicate a value to providing assessment even 
if time constraints prevent an accompanying intervention. 
Furthermore, the study supports targeted interventions for 
AIAN women who currently drink alcohol that incorporate 
eﬀorts to shift cultural norms, recognition of depression, and 
assessment of alcohol consumption and vulnerability to 
AEP.
