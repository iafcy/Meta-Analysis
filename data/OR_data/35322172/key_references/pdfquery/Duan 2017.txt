Background: Ample evidence demonstrates that university students are at high risk for sedentary behaviors and inadequate 
fruit and vegetable intake (FVI). Internet-based interventions for multiple health behavior appear to be promising in changing 
such unhealthy habits. Limited randomized controlled trials have tested this assumption among Chinese university students. 
Objective: Our objective was to test the efficacy of an 8-week Web-based intervention compared with a control group condition 
to improve physical activity (PA) and FVI in Chinese university students. The intervention content was based on the health action 
process approach, and developed on the basis of previous evidence from the Western hemisphere. We evaluated self-reported 
data including PA and FVI, stages of change for PA and FVI, and motivational (risk perception, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy), 
volitional (action planning, coping planning, social support), and distal (intention, habit) indicators for PA and FVI, as well as 
perceived mental health outcomes (quality of life, depression). 
Methods: 
In a randomized controlled trial, we recruited 566 university students from one university in the central region of 
China during their general physical education class. After random allocation and exclusion of unsuitable participants, we assigned 
493 students to 1 of 2 groups: (1) intervention group: first 4 weeks on PA and subsequent 4 weeks on FVI, (2) control group. We 
conducted 3 Web-based assessments: at the beginning of the intervention (T1, n=493), at the end of the 8-week intervention (T2, 
n=337), and at a 1-month follow-up after the intervention (T3, n=142). The entire study was conducted throughout the fall semester 
of 2015. 
Results: Significant time group interactions revealed superior intervention effects on FVI; motivational, volitional, and distal 
indicators of FVI; and PA behavior changes, with an effect size (η2) ranging from .08 to .20. In addition, the overall intervention 
effects were significant for stage progression to the action group from T1 to T2 in PA (χ2 
1=11.75, P=.001) and FVI (χ2 
1=15.64, 
P=.03). Furthermore, the intervention effect was seen in the improvement of quality of life (F3,492=1.23, η2=.03, P=.02). 
Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the efficacy of a Web-based multiple health behavior intervention among Chinese 
university students tested with different outcome variables. Future research should address the high dropout rate and optimize 
the most effective components of this intervention.

Web-based intervention; physical activity; fruit and vegetable intake; university students; motivational indicators; volitional 
indicators 

Being physically active and eating healthily are known to reduce 
the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases such as 
cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes [1]. 
Few young people, however, reach the recommendations of 
health behavior for the prevention of noncommunicable diseases. 
Considerable evidence indicates that more than half of university 
students do not achieve at least 150 accumulated minutes of 
moderate physical activity (PA) per week [2,3]. Additionally, 
some studies show that university students and young adults 
aged 18-24 years consume fewer than the recommended 5 daily 
servings of fruits and vegetables [4,5]. 
University students are in the transition stage from late 
adolescence to adulthood. Unhealthy lifestyle habits, which are 
reinforced during this phase, often persist into later life and lead 
to long-term negative health outcomes [6]. Strategies to foster 
a healthy lifestyle in university students are therefore essential. 
Some evidence 
that multiple behavior health 
interventions can promote both exercise and healthy diets in 
university students [1,7,8]. Thus, behavioral interventions for 
university students are required to support long-lasting behavior 
changes beyond late adulthood. Most of these studies, however, 
have been conducted only in Western societies. 

Using Internet technology to promote health behavior change 
has several advantages [9]. In particular, an Internet intervention 
can (1) be delivered to large numbers of people at a low cost, 
(2) ensure that the intervention is accessible at any time and 
any location, and (3) provide follow-ups and feedback with 
personalized and tailored methods. In addition, the use of 
Internet technology is particularly relevant to young adults, who 
are the major users of such technology [10]. Moreover, tailored 
Web-based health behavior interventions that try to address 
specific characteristics of participants by providing information 
and feedback based on previously provided information (eg, 
assessed via questionnaire) harness the potential to provide a 
more user-specific experience with higher relevance for each 
participant [11,12]. A meta-analysis by Lustria et al [12] 
concluded that tailored Web-based interventions could lead to 
significant improvement in health outcomes at posttesting 
(d=.14) and follow-up (d=.16). Such tailored Web-based 
behavioral interventions, however, have very rarely been 
systematically evaluated in China. To the best of our knowledge, 
this study is the first test of a Web-based multiple behavior 
health intervention delivered to Chinese university students. 
The Health Action Process Approach 
The theoretical backdrop of this study is the health action 
process approach (HAPA; [13]), which divides the health 

XSL•FO

behavior change process into 2 phases. First is the motivational 
phase, in which people who do not intend to change their 
behavior (nonintenders) are motivated to develop their 
intentions. Afterward, they enter the second, or volitional, phase, 
in which people initiate and perform the behavior. Within the 
volitional phase, a distinction can be made between people who 
have the intention to perform a specific behavior but do not act 
(intenders) and people who already perform the behavior 
(actors). These distinctions allow for the interventions to address 
those variables that are relevant to specific processes in the 
sequential order. For example, before people can change 
unhealthy habits, they must become motivated to do so. Thus, 
such individuals may benefit most from interventions that 
increase risk perception, self-efficacy, and the promotion of 
positive outcome expectancies [13,14]. The idea is to lead the 
individual toward an explicit intention, by increasing their 
awareness of potential risks, highlighting the positive effects 
of a healthy lifestyle and addressing incorrect beliefs about 
negative effects. Upon forming the intention, people enter the 
volitional process. Individuals here benefit most from action 
and coping planning interventions [15], as such interventions 
help them translate their plans into behavior. Once people start 
to perform a healthy behavior, self-regulatory skills are most 
relevant for their maintenance progress. The behavior is mainly 
directed by self-efficacy, which regulates how effort is invested 
and how persistence is managed if barriers and setbacks occur. 
In addition, promoting perceived social support from the 
individuals’ social environment is equally important in 
preventing relapse [13]. 
Study Objective 
On the basis of this theory, previous interventions have been 
developed and conducted with people interested in reducing 
their cardiovascular risk in the Western hemisphere, where the 
intervention effects have been well supported [16,17]. This 
study aimed at testing the effectiveness of such an intervention 
for Chinese students. Our objective was to test the efficacy of 
an 8-week Web-based intervention (first 4 weeks on PA, and 
subsequent 4 weeks on fruit and vegetable intake [FVI]) 
compared with a control group condition to improve PA and 
FVI in Chinese university students. We examined the effects 
on behaviors, stages of change movement for PA and FVI, 
social-cognitive indicators for PA and FVI (motivational, 
volitional, and distal), and perceived mental health outcomes 
(quality of life and depression level). 
We hypothesized that the main intervention effects would be 
(1) more behavioral change in PA and FVI (hypothesis 1a) and 
more stage progression to the action stage for PA and FVI 
(hypothesis 1b), (2) more improvements in motivational (risk 
perception, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy), volitional

(page number not for citation purposes) 


(action planning, coping planning, social support), and distal 
(intention, habit) indicators of behavior change (hypothesis 2), 
and (3) an increase in positive mental health outcomes, including 
higher quality of life and lower depression levels (hypothesis 
3). 

Participants and Procedure 
Study participants were undergraduate students from one 
university in the central region of China. We contacted a total 
of 566 students in their first general physical education classes 
with the assistance of physical education lecturers during the 
fall semester of 2015. Of these, we excluded 73 (12.9%) after 
random allocation, including those who were collegiate athletes, 
had restrictions in terms of PA or FVI, or because they declined 
to participate. Subsequently, 493 (87.1%) students completed 
the online registration and provided personal information within 
1 week, including 270 students in the intervention group (54.8%) 
and 223 students in the control group (45.2%). During the week 
after registration, we invited students in both groups to answer 
the first onscreen questionnaires (T1). Students in the 
intervention group were encouraged to participate in a 
Web-based program once a week during the following 8 weeks, 
while students in the control group did not receive any support. 


Upon completion of the 8-week intervention, students in both 
groups were invited to fill in the second onscreen questionnaire 
(T2), 
third onscreen questionnaire 
administration 1 month (T3) after the intervention. By the end 
of the 8-week intervention, 337 (68.4%) students were still 
participating, with 199 (59.1%) in the intervention group and 
138 (41.0%) in the control group. The final longitudinal sample 
consisted of 142 students (28.8%), including 88 (62.0%) in the 
intervention group and 54 (38.0%) in the control condition 
(Figure 1). All website links for the questionnaire surveys at 
T1, T2, and T3, as well as for the weekly intervention program, 
were delivered via email. To boost the engagement of students, 
we sent text message reminders and physical education lecturers 
verbally reminded participants during class during the weekly 
intervention process and 3 measurement points. Moreover, 
students were offered an additional 5 marks to their final 
physical education examination score as an incentive in 
exchange for their participation at all 3 data collection waves. 
All students were informed about the purpose of the study with 
an informed consent form. The study procedure was approved 
by the Committee for the Use of Human & Animal Subjects in 
Teaching & Research of Hong Kong Baptist University, as well 
as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie in Germany 
(EK-A-SL022013), and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01909349; Multimedia Appendix 1 [18]).

Intervention 
The intervention comprised an 8-week Web-based intervention 
targeting social-cognitive indicators for health behavior change 
for PA and FVI, based on the HAPA model [13]. The 
intervention applied behavior change techniques such as 
providing information about behavioral risks and the benefits 
of behavior change, motivating the formation of intentions, 
prompting identification of barriers, prompting setting of 
specific goals, reviewing behavioral goals, providing feedback 
on performance, prompting practice and presenting follow-up 
prompts, motivating the planning of social support, and 
prompting relapse prevention [19]. Weeks 1-4 aimed at PA and 
weeks 5-8 aimed at FVI, as PA might act as a gateway behavior 
[20,21] and PA modules are the most favored ones in tailored 
eHealth lifestyle promotion [22]. Participants received 1 session 
per week, which lasted about 20 minutes. 
The first session for each behavior targeted risk perception, 
outcome expectancies, and goal setting, and the second session 
targeted the development of action plans. The third session 
targeted the revision and adjustment of previously developed 
action plans, as well as the development of coping plans, while 
the fourth session targeted the revision and adjustment of 
previously developed coping plans and social support (Table 
1).

The intervention was not tailored based on the motivational and 
volitional stage of the HAPA. Instead, participants received 
tailored individualized feedback on their behavior improvement 
or decline at the beginning of each session, based on their prior 
self-report questionnaire. Moreover, during each session, 
participants received tailored normative feedback in the form 
of bar charts to compare their current behavioral performance 
and progress with population recommendations. Figure 2 
illustrates a screenshot example (translated from Chinese) of 
the feedback information the participants received for PA over 
an accumulated amount of time (in the previous 4, 3, and 2 
weeks, and the first week), as well as the PA recommendation 
criteria. A tailored comment was also presented, such as 
You have spent an accumulated 440 minutes in PA 
last week. Great! This performance is better than two 
weeks ago and you have achieved the recommended 
amount of PA for good health. Congratulations! Keep 
going! 
In addition, we provided optional examples featuring role 
models throughout the intervention to support participants (eg, 
for setting goals or developing plans). We adopted a positive 
tone throughout the intervention. 
The intervention in this study was based on previous research 
conducted in Germany and the Netherlands [23]. Prior to 
conducting the main study among Chinese university students, 
we completed preparation work on the intervention program in 
a prestudy, including the development and validation of adapted 
Chinese intervention materials, setting up intervention website 
modules, and optimizing website functioning by implementing 
Web-based tests with a small sample size.

Demographic Information 
Items addressed demographic characteristics, such as sex, age, 
and relationship status (single or in a relationship). We also 
collected self-reported body height (in centimeters) and body 
weight (in kilograms). 
Health Behaviors 
We assessed PA using the Chinese short version of the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C) [24,25]. 
The IPAQ-C asked participants to estimate the number of days 
and amount of time spent on vigorous, moderate, and walking 
activities during the past 7 days. An individual total PA score 
(in minutes/week) was obtained when all questions were 
summed [25]. 
FVI during the past 7 days was assessed with 4 items: raw 
vegetables, fruits, fruit or vegetable juice, and cooked or steamed 
vegetables [26]. For each item, participants were asked to count 
the number of portions or glasses of liquid fruit and vegetables 
they consumed on average during a typical day. Each item had 
11 options about the number of portions, such as 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 2.5...5 or above. The total consumed portion was the sum of 
each item. 
Stages of behavioral change were assessed for PA and FVI, 
each with 1 item on a 5-point scale asking “Did you engage in 
physical activity at least 5 days a week for 30 minutes or more 
(or 2.5 hours during the week)?” and “Please think about what 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
you have typically consumed during the last weeks: did you eat 
5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day?” (1=no, and I do not 
intend to start; 2=no, but I am considering it; 3=no, but I 
seriously intend to start; 4=yes, but only for a brief period of 
time; 5=yes, and for a long period of time) [27]. People who 
selected point 1 were nonintenders in stage 1, those who selected 
point 2 or point 3 were intenders in stage 2, while those who 
selected point 4 or point 5 were actors in stage 3. 
Motivational Indicators of Behavior Change 
We adapted the risk perception scale from Perloff and Fetzer 
[28]. Items started with the stem “How likely is it that you will 
have at some time in your life...,” followed by 5 items: “a high 
cholesterol level?,” “a heart attack?,” “high blood pressure?,” 
“a stroke?,” and “a cardiovascular disease?” Response used a 
7-point scale ranging from 1=very unlikely to 7=very likely 
(Cronbach alpha=.84). 
We assessed positive and negative outcome expectancies for 
PA with 2 items, each on a 5-point scale (1=don’t agree at all; 
5=totally agree), such as “If I am physically active 5 days a 
week for 30 minutes or more, then...” “I feel better afterward,” 
or “it will cost me a lot of time” (positive: ρ=.78; negative: 
ρ=.57) [29]. We assessed positive and negative outcome 
expectancies for FVI, each with 2 items, such as “If I eat at least 
5 portions of fruit and vegetables, then...” “this is good for my 
health,” or “this will be a financial burden” (positive: ρ=.88; 
negative: ρ=.74) [29]. 
We assessed self-efficacy for PA with 5 items on a 5-point scale 
(1=don’t agree at all; 5=totally agree), such as “I am certain 
J Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 4 | e106 | p. 6 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


that I can permanently be physically active for at least 5 days 
a week for 30 minutes each day” (Cronbach alpha=.88) [30]. 
We assessed self-efficacy for FVI by 5 items on the basis of the 
PA scale, such as “I am certain that I can eat 5 portions of fruit 
and vegetables a day even if it is sometimes difficult” (Cronbach 
alpha=.92) [30]. 
Volitional Indicators of Behavior Change 
We distinguished planning as action planning and coping 
planning. We assessed action planning by the stem “For the 
next month I have carefully planned...” followed by 3 items for 
PA, such as “which PA I will pursue,” or followed by 3 items 
for FVI, such as “what I will eat” (Cronbach alpha for PA=.86; 
Cronbach alpha for FVI=.91). We assessed coping planning by 
the stem “For the next month I have carefully planned...” 
followed by 3 items for PA, such as “what I can do in difficult 
situations to stick to my intentions,” or followed by 3 items for 
FVI, such as “how I can eat healthy, even if something 
happened” (Cronbach alpha for PA=.87; Cronbach alpha for 
FVI=.93). Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from 
1=totally disagree to 5=totally agree [15]. 
We assessed social support with 3 items for PA (Cronbach 
alpha=.72) [31] and with 3 items for FVI (Cronbach alpha=.69) 
[31], such as “My partner helps me/my family helps me/my 
classmates and friends help me to stay physically active,” or 
“My partner helps me/my family helps me/my classmates and 
friends help me to eat healthy.” Answers were measured with 
a 5-point scale (1=not at all true; 5=exactly true). 
Distal Indicators of Behavior Change 
Regarding intention, for PA, we assessed 3 independent items 
with a 4-point scale (1=not true; 4=exactly true), representing 
different intensity levels of PA. “On 5 days a week for 30 
minutes (or a minimum of 2.5 hours per week), I have the 
intention to perform...” “strenuous physical activity,” “moderate 
physical activity,” or “mild physical activity” (Cronbach 
alpha=.34) [27]. We assessed intention regarding FVI using 3 
items: “I seriously intend to...” “eat at least five portions of fruit 
and vegetables daily,” “eat fruit and vegetables at every meal,” 
and “drink at least one fruit or vegetable juice every day” 
(Cronbach alpha=.73) [27]. 
We assessed the habit scale with the stem “Being physically 
active for at least 30 minutes on 5 days a week is something 
that...” and “Eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day 
is something that...” followed by 2 items, such as “has become 
a confirmed habit” and “I do without thinking about it” 
(Cronbach alpha for PA=.95; Cronbach alpha for FVI=.87). 
Answers were indicated on a 5-point scale ranging from 
1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree [32]. 
Mental Health Outcomes 
We assessed quality of life using the Hong Kong version of the 
World Health Organization’s Quality of Life-BREF 
questionnaire [33]. We measured general quality of life with 
the question “How would you rate your quality of life?” with 
a 5-point scale (1=very poor; 5=very good). We also used the 
physical health subdomain with 7 items (Cronbach alpha=.71), 
such as “How satisfied are you with your ability to perform 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
your daily living activities?” (1=very dissatisfied; 5=very 
satisfied). 
We assessed depression using the Chinese version of the Center 
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, a 
self-report depression scale for research in the general 
population [34]. Participants were asked to indicate the 
frequency of symptoms on a 4-point scale (0=less than a day; 
1=1 to 2 days; 2=3 to 4 days; 3=5 to 7 days) within the last 
week. Positively formulated items were reversed. The total score 
consisted of the sum of all 20 items and ranges from 0 to 60 
(Cronbach alpha=.78). A CES-D score of 16 or greater indicated 
the likelihood of clinically significant depression. 
Among all of the questionnaires above, IPAQ-C, quality of life, 
and depression had been well developed and validated in 
Chinese versions in previous studies [25,33,34]. The English 
questionnaires addressing motivational, volitional, and distal 
indicators of behavior change were translated into Chinese by 
a bilingual researcher. The translation was then validated using 
the standard back-translation technique [35]. Analysis of the 
data from the pilot test showed that the scales’ reliability was 
acceptable. In addition, we conducted pilot tests to ensure the 
usability and technical functionality of the electronic versions 
of the questionnaires prior to the main study. 
Data Analysis 
We conducted all data analyses using IBM SPSS version 23 
(IBM Corporation). We used independent samples t tests and 
chi-square tests to analyze dropout and to compare baseline 
characteristics at T1. Statistical significance was set at the 5% 
level (2-tailed). 
We tested intervention effects on PA and FVI behavior 
(hypothesis 1a) with a repeated-measures multivariate analysis 
of variance after screening the variables successfully. To 
evaluate hypothesis 1b, we first presented descriptive 
information (count and percentage) on stage distribution across 
T1, T2, and T3 between the intervention group and the control 
group for PA and for FVI. We then performed chi-square tests. 
To increase the cell sizes of stage groups for statistical 
significance, we collapsed the nonintender and intender groups 
into an inactive group and contrasted it to the active group. We 
evaluated stage movements in terms of cross-tabulating stage 
at T1 with T2 or T3 separately for the intervention versus the 
control group to compare the 2 groups with each other. 
In addition, we tested the effects on combined motivational, 
volitional, and distal indicators of behavior change (hypothesis 
2), as well as on mental health outcomes (hypothesis 3), by 
conducting a series of repeated-measures analyses of covariance 
with baseline behavior as 
the covariate. For both 
repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance and 
repeated-measures analyses of covariance, we tested trends over 
time (T1, T2, and T3) as the within-participants factor, with 
treatment (intervention group vs control group) as the 
between-participants factor, adjusting for both baseline PA and 
FVI (as covariates). 
We report results based on those individuals who participated 
in all 3 measurement points. Missing data were imputed within

each measurement 
expectation-maximization method. 






Dropout Analysis 
Results indicated that 493 people participated fully in data 
collection at T1, 337 at T1 and T2, and 142 at T1, T2, and T3. 
The dropout rates of participants were 31.6% (156/493) from 
T1 to T2 and 57.9% (195/337) from T2 to T3. The 142 final 
student sample included more women (n=101, 71.1%) than 
men, with a mean age of 19.3 years (range 17-24, SD 1.07). 
Most (128/142, 90.1%) of the participants were single. The 
average body mass index (BMI) of participants was 20.13 (SD 
2.29) kg/m2. Participants at T1 and T2 (n=337) did not 
significantly differ from dropouts at T2 (n=156) with regard to 
relationship status (χ2 
1=0.06, P=.81), age (t491=–0.05, P=.96), 
BMI (t491=0.22, P=.96), amount of PA at baseline (t491=1.20, 
P=.23), and FVI at baseline (t491=–.87, P=.39). More women 
than men participated fully in data collection at T2 (χ2 
1=10.67, 
P=.001). In addition, those at T1, T2, and T3 (n=142) did not 
differ from dropouts at T2 and T3 (n=351) with regard to 
relationship status (χ2 
1=0.46, P=.49), age (t491=–1.46, P=.15), 
BMI (t491=1.12, P=.26), and FVI at baseline (t491=–0.74, P=.46). 
Those who participated in data collection at all 3 measurement 
points included more women than men (χ2 
1=22.60, P<.001) 
and engaged in less PA at baseline (t491=2.26, P=.02). 
Randomization Check 
There were no differences across the 2 groups at T1 regarding 
PA level, FVI, social-cognitive indicators (risk perception, 
outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, action plans, coping plans, 
social support, intention, and habit), relationship status, and 
BMI (all P values .23-.94). Sex and age did, however, differ 
between the 2 groups, with more women (χ2 
1=7.650, P=.01) 
and younger participants (t140=–3.96, P<.001) in the intervention 
group than in the control group. 
Evaluation of Time and Treatment on PA, FVI, and 
Motivational, Volitional, and Distal indicators of 
Behavior Change 
Table 2 presents the results, most of which were significant. 
Because the question of whether the intervention group and the 
control group developed differently over time is crucial, the 
interaction was of the highest interest. Out of 8 effects, 7 were 
statistically significant, with an effect size of η2 ranging from 
.08 to .20. Only PA behavior was not statistically significant 
(see Table 2). However, the mean values of PA at different 
intensities (see Figure 3) indicated that there were descriptive 
differences between the 2 groups, which were clearly in favor 
of the intervention group. This was matched by the effects on 
FVI (see Figure 4), however, with significant effects (η2=.13, 
P<.001).

Evaluation of Intervention Effects on Stage Progression 
to the Action Stage 
Table 3 and Table 4 present the stage distributions at T1, T2, 
and T3 for PA and FVI. Descriptively, the stage developments 
underline that the intervention group was more likely than the 
control group to move to the action stage. After we collapsed 
the nonintender and intender groups as a single inactive group, 
there were at least 5 individuals in each cell for statistical 
significance testing. The findings validated previous results: 
for PA, individuals who were inactive at T1 in the intervention 
group were more likely to move to the action stage at T2 
(χ2 
1=18.57, P<.001). Although descriptively this was also the 
case at T3, this intervention effect was not significant (χ2 
1=0.91, 
P=.34). While the overall intervention effect for individuals 
being inactive and active at T1 was also significant from T1 to 
T2 (χ2 
1=11.75, P=.001), no changes from T1 to T3 were 
statistically significant (all χ2 were <2 and P values ranged from 
.12 to .27).

Conducting the same tests for FVI, the findings revealed more 
positive results, with significant changes between 
the 
intervention and the control group, both at T2 for previously 
inactive (χ2 
1=4.28, 
P=.04), and for the overall effect (χ2 
1=15.64, P=.03). At T3, 
the effect was only significant in previously inactive individuals 
(χ2 
1=1.35, P=.21). The 
overall effect, however, was also significant (χ2 
1=10.52, 
P<.001), suggesting the intervention’s effectiveness. 

Evaluation of Time and Treatment Effects on Mental 
Health Outcomes 
Finally, we analyzed the intervention’s effect on quality of life 
and depression. As no significant differences between the stages 
emerged (tested for both behaviors), we left out the factor stage 
during the subsequent analysis. We found no significant 
differences for the group factor (F3,139=1.16, η2=.02, P=.31). 
The interaction of time and group was significant (F3,139=3.03, 
η2=.08, P=.02). The effects were, however, only due to quality 
of life (F3,492=1.23, η2=.03, P=.02). As for depression, the 
interaction was not significant (F3,492=0.17, η2<.01, P=.48). 
Figure 5 presents the mean values for quality of life and Figure 
6 presents those for depression levels at the 3 measurement 
points for both groups.

This study aimed to test the efficacy of an 8-week Web-based 
intervention compared with a control group condition to improve 
PA and FVI in Chinese university students. The majority of the 
study assumptions were supported. 
Intervention Effects on Primary Outcomes 
When testing the effects of time treatment on the 2 behavior 
test variables, 1 was found to be significant. In comparison with 
the control group, students in the intervention group reported 
more consumption of fruit and vegetables over time. In addition, 
descriptively, the amounts of average FVI for the intervention 
group were all greater than the recommended amounts (5 
portions per day) at the end of the 8-week intervention (6.3 
portions) and at the 1-month follow-up (5.8 portions). This 
positive result among Chinese university students is consistent 
with a previous study, which was conducted with German and 
Dutch adults who wanted to reduce their cardiovascular risk 
[16,17]. Since we used intervention materials and a study design 
similar to the previous one, the generalization of intervention 

XSL•FO 
RenderX

(page number not for citation purposes) 


effects on dietary behavior in this study can be warranted across 
Eastern and Western countries. 
In terms of PA behavior, however, there was no significant 
interaction effect, which is not in line with other studies 
[16,17,36,37]. Reasons for this discrepancy may include, first, 
that PA levels of university students were overall relatively high 
at the start of the intervention (T1). According to the IPAQ-C 
scoring protocol, more than half of the students in this study 
(268/493, 54.3%) were classified as “sufficiently active” at T1, 
which means that individuals already participated in 3 or more 
days of vigorous activity for at least 20 minutes per day [24]. 
Therefore, ceiling effects might have 
the 
intervention’s efficacy on PA change. Second, as young adults 
need long-term processes to establish PA behaviors as habits, 
the 4-week Web-based intervention dose might not have been 
sufficient to change their PA habits. The same issue can also 
be found in another Web-based PA intervention among 
university students [38]. Third, measuring PA after 8 weeks 
might have been a too-distal measurement point, as PA was 
addressed only throughout the first 4 weeks. Hence, PA levels 
could have dropped back by the time of the assessment. Taking 
these findings together, half of hypothesis 1a was supported. 

With respect to the intervention effects on stage progression for 
the two behaviors, the results were positive. In comparison with 
students in the control group, students who were inactive in the 
intervention group reported more stage movements to the action 
stage for PA from T1 to T2. In addition, the intervention effects 
on stage progression for FVI were found both from T1 to T2 
and from T1 to T3. It seems that the stage progression of 
multiple health behaviors was positively interrelated with each 
other in this study (T1-T2). A previous study revealed that PA 
and FVI appeared to facilitate rather than hinder each other [39]. 
There were cross-behavior associations between these two 
behaviors. This opinion was also supported by a study that found 
consistently significant correlations across stages between 
nutrition and PA (r range .16-.26, P<0.01) [40]. Future studies 
should address the evaluation of mechanisms that transfer 
intervention effects on stage movement from PA to FVI, or vice 
versa. Referring back to hypothesis 1b, the data supported most 
of the assumption of stage progression. 
Intervention Effects on Secondary Outcomes 
When evaluating the outcomes of social-cognitive indicators 
of behavior change, all 6 tests revealed significant treatment 
effects on motivational, volitional, and distal indicators of PA 
and FVI over time, with the effect size ranging from .08 to .20. 
The findings are in line with previous studies, in which 
motivational and volitional interventions were both used to 
change multiple health behaviors [8,16,17]. In sum, our results 
support hypothesis 2. 
The increase in positive mental health outcomes of quality of 
life and depression levels was evident in this study when 
combining the 2 measures together. This main effect, however, 
was due to the changes in quality of life only and not 
significantly to changes in depression. One possible reason for 
the lack of effect on depression might be that PA did not 
improve in this study, which cannot bring about mental health 
consequences. Another possible cause might be floor effects, 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
as university students reported low depression levels at the start 
of the study (mean 2.08, SD 0.61), which reflects the healthy 
mental status of participants in this study. To prevent depression 
in the long term, however, more components explicitly 
addressing mental health would need to be developed and tested 
in future interventions. Overall, half of hypothesis 3 was 
supported. 
Limitations 
Some limitations of this study need to be addressed. First, the 
dropout rate was high. Compared with male students, female 
students who performed less PA at baseline were more likely 
to comply with the instructions of the program and spent time 
completing data collection across the 3 time points. Thus, 
personal characteristics could be one explanation for the high 
dropout rate. Another reason might be related to the physical 
education lecturers’ verbal reminders in physical education 
class. In this study, data collection at T3 was scheduled during 
the week in which the last physical education class was offered. 
Students who attended the final physical education examination 
1 week before the last class were allowed to be absent for the 
last physical education class, which means the lecturers could 
not verbally encourage those absent students to complete the 
final data collection. This might explain why the dropout rate 
from T2 to T3 (57.8%) was higher than that from T1 to T2 
(31.6%). In addition, dropout and low engagement with 
questions could be caused by intervention features, such as the 
Web-based format and layout, length of the questionnaire, or 
browser difficulties on the intervention website [41-43]. Future 
studies should further address the characteristics of dropout and 
nonresponse to Web-based interventions, and find a solution to 
enlarge the sample size. This would also help provide more 
comprehensive subgroup analyses on the effectiveness of 
specific tailored components, as all participants would receive 
a unique intervention, but are treated equally when analyzing 
the data [44]. 
Second, the use of self-report questionnaires for behavioral 
outcome measures could have led to recall bias, overreporting 
or underreporting, and measurement errors. Thus, the inclusion 
of objective measures such as biomarkers, accelerometers, or 
pedometers is desirable in future studies. Third, the follow-up 
period was relatively short in this study. The longer-term impact 
of the intervention should be assessed in the future. Fourth, this 
study did not explore the mechanism of how the treatment 
facilitated multiple health behavior change (ie, the synthesis of 
PA and FVI). In other words, it is unclear which social-cognitive 
factors mediated the effect of the intervention on the 
improvements in health behavior. We advocate conducting an 
in-depth test in future studies. 
Conclusions 
This study provides evidence for the efficacy of a Web-based 
multiple health behavior intervention among Chinese university 
students. The majority of study hypotheses were supported. The 
initial findings suggest that the intervention was effective at 
increasing FVI and in enhancing perceived quality of life. In 
addition, all social-cognitive indicators of PA and FVI were 
improved in this study. The intervention did not, however, show 
the hypothesized effect on PA change. Future research is 
J Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 4 | e106 | p. 12 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


warranted to address some of the limitations noted above, 
especially reducing high dropout rates and exploring the most 
effective components of the intervention, which is imperative 
to facilitate health promotion among university students, not 
only in the Western but also in the Eastern hemisphere.
