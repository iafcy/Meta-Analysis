Background: Internet access has grown markedly in Latinos during the past decade. However, there have been no 
Internet-based physical activity interventions designed for Latinos, despite large disparities in lifestyle-related 
conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, particularly in Latina women. The current study tested the efficacy of a 
6-month culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based physical activity intervention. 
Methods: Inactive Latinas (N = 205) were randomly assigned to the Tailored Physical Activity Internet Intervention 
or the Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Participants in both groups received emails on a tapered schedule 
over 6 months to alert them to new content on the website. The primary outcome was minutes/week of moderate 
to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at 6 months as measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall; activity was also 
measured by accelerometers. Data were collected between 2011 and 2014 and analyzed in 2015 at the University 
of California, San Diego. 
Results: Increases in minutes/week of MVPA were significantly greater in the Intervention Group compared to the 
Control Group (mean difference = 50.00, SE = 9.5, p < 0.01). Increases in objectively measured MVPA were also 
significantly larger in the Intervention Group (mean differences = 31.0, SE = 10.7, p < .01). The Intervention Group was also 
significantly more likely to meet national physical activity guidelines at 6 months (OR = 3.12, 95 % CI 1.46–6.66, p < .05). 
Conclusion: Findings from the current study suggest that this Internet-delivered individually tailored intervention 
successfully increased MVPA in Latinas compared to a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. 
Trial registration: NCT01834287. 

Background 
Ample evidence demonstrates the health benefits of 
physical activity (PA) and its role in the prevention of 
obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, some cancers, 
and all-cause mortality [1]. However, PA levels for the 
large majority of Latinos are below U.S. national guide- 
lines [2–8] and lower compared to non-Latino whites 
[5–8]. Both being Latino and being female are associated 
with not meeting PA recommendations [8, 9], and La- 
tinas report the lowest levels of leisure PA of all major

marked disparities in obesity, diabetes, and other condi- 
tions related to inactivity [9, 10]. Therefore, effective in- 
terventions for Latinas, that have the potential for broad 
cost-effective dissemination, are needed. 
Despite the great need to promote PA among Latinas, 
few interventions have targeted this specific population; 
a 2014 systematic review found 16 such interventions in 
a period of 30 years [11]. The majority of these utilized 
face-to-face delivery channels, such as site visits, church/ 
community settings, or promotora-led walking groups. 
These approaches may be difficult for Latinas, who often

cite limited transportation and childcare duties as key 
barriers to physical activity [11–13]. Such approaches 
may also be limited in their potential for widespread dis- 
semination. Home-based PA interventions delivered 
through mediated channels have great potential 
for 
broader dissemination for the Latina population. Ac- 
cordingly, a recent study showed that a PA interven- 
tion using printed, mail-delivered materials that were 
individually tailored based on theoretical constructs 
(Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical 
Model [14, 15]) was successful at increasing PA in in- 
active Latinas [16, 17]. 
While this study showed the intervention to be effective 
at increasing PA, the print-based, mail delivered format 
may not be the most efficient or cost-effective media 
channel for widespread dissemination. Recent data show 
that Internet access has grown markedly in Latinos during 
the past decade, with 83 % of Latinos reporting using the 
Internet regularly in 2014 (vs. 64 % in 2009) [18, 19]. Add- 
itionally, the largest gains were seen in foreign-born and 
Spanish-language dominant Latinos, who also tend to re- 
port the lowest rates of PA [9, 10, 20]. 
Given the potential of the web for broad dissemination, 
we recently adapted our effective Spanish language print- 
based PA intervention for the web. We conducted a series 
of focus groups with Latinas regarding their Internet use 
behaviors (i.e. why, when and how often they use the web, 
and the types of sites they visit), and used this information 
to build a web-based version of our intervention. We sub- 
sequently conducted a randomized controlled trial to deter- 
mine the efficacy of the intervention relative to a Spanish- 
language Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. We 
hypothesized that Latinas randomized to the Tailored Phys- 
ical Activity Internet Intervention Group would report sig- 
nificantly greater 
in minutes per week of 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from base- 
line to 6 months (post-treatment) than those in the Well- 
ness Contact Control Internet Group. Findings from this 
study are described in this paper. 

Methods 
Design 
The Pasos Hacia La Salud study (N = 205) was a ran- 
domized controlled trial of a 6-month Spanish-language, 
culturally and linguistically adapted, individually tailored, 
Internet-based Physical Activity Intervention, compared 
to a Spanish-language Wellness Contact Control Inter- 
net Group. The intervention was based on the Trans- 
theoretical Model (TTM) and Social Cognitive Theory 
(SCT) [14, 15] and emphasized behavioral strategies for 
including goal-setting, self- 
increasing activity levels, 
monitoring, problem-solving barriers, 
increasing social 
support, and rewarding oneself for meeting physical ac- 
tivity goals. Data were collected between 2011 and 2014 
and analyzed in 2015. The primary outcome was mi- 
nutes per week of MVPA as measured by the 7-Day 
Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR). This measure was 
used in preliminary studies, and thus was used to deter- 
mine statistical power for the current study. The level of 
power was set at 80 % a priori and was used to deter- 
mine the number of participants needed given estimated 
effect sizes from our previous studies. Minutes of MVPA 
were also measured objectively using accelerometers, 
and this served as an additional primary outcome. 
Setting and sample 
The study was conducted at the University of California, 
San Diego, and human subjects approval was obtained 
from the Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria 
included the following: self-identified as Hispanic or 
Latino (or of a group defined as Hispanic/Latino by the 
Census Bureau); self-reported insufficient physical activ- 
ity (defined as participating in MVPA less than 60 mi- 
nutes per week); 18–65 years of age; verified BMI 
<45 kg/m2; regular access to an Internet-connected com- 
puter through home, work, or their community (e.g., 
public library, community center, neighbor’s house); and 
willingness to be randomly assigned to either of the two 
study conditions. 
Exclusion criteria included the following: unable to 
read or speak Spanish fluently; history of coronary heart 
disease (history of myocardial infarction or symptoms of 
angina), diabetes, stroke, orthopedic conditions which 
limit mobility, or any other serious medical condition 
that would make unsupervised physical activity unsafe 
(as determined by the Physical Activity Readiness Ques- 
tionnaire); [21] current pregnancy or plan to conceive in 
the next year; planning to move from the area within the 
next year; hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder in 
the past 3 years; taking medication that may impair 
physical activity tolerance or performance; and/or scor- 
ing less than 17 (i.e. inadequate functional health liter- 
acy) on the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in 
Adults (STOFHLA) [22]. 
Sample size calculation was based on the assumption 
that we would have 80 % power for testing the null hy- 
pothesis that the intention to treat effect is zero, versus 
the two-sided alternative that the effect is different for 
those randomized to the Intervention Group versus 
those randomized to the Control Group. These esti- 
mates were based on the reported change in MVPA over 
6 months amongst a subset of Latina participants who 
reported having 
in our previous 
Internet 
individually-tailored, print-based study [16, 17]. 

Protocol 
A detailed description of study protocols can be found 
elsewhere [23]. Briefly, the primary modes of recruitment 


included paid ads on Craigslist.org, participant referrals, 
and advertising in local Spanish language newspapers, and 
at local churches, stores, and health-focused events. After 
potential participants were screened over the phone for 
eligibility, they attended an orientation session and com- 
pleted the informed consent process. Participants returned 
for a second visit during which the following baseline 
measures were completed: height and weight, waist and 
hip circumference, blood pressure, and percent body fat. 
At this visit, participants also received an ActiGraph 
GT3X+ accelerometer, with instructions to wear the accel- 
erometer during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. 
One week following the measurement visit, participants 
returned with the accelerometer and completed a 10-min 
treadmill walk intended as a demonstration of moderate 
physical activity. Additionally, they completed baseline 
self-report physical activity measures, including the 7 day 
physical activity recall 
interview, and were randomly 
assigned to one of two Spanish-language Internet-based 
conditions: Tailored Physical Activity Internet Interven- 
tion or Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Group 
assignment was determined using a permuted block 
randomization procedure, with small random sized blocks. 
Randomization was stratified by TTM stage of change to 
ensure an equal distribution of treatment assigned across 
levels of motivational readiness for physical activity. 
Tailored physical activity internet intervention 
(Intervention Group) 
Participants randomized to the Intervention Group re- 
ceived access to a study website including the following 
features: 1) self-monitoring of minutes of activity and 
steps; 2) goal setting with graphs to compare goals to re- 
corded minutes; 3) message board to foster social support 
between participants; 4) “ask the expert” where partici- 
pants could anonymously ask questions to a PhD level re- 
searcher; 5) online resources such as maps to create 
walking routes and free exercise videos. In addition, par- 
ticipants completed monthly questionnaires that gener- 
ated automated tailored physical activity reports. These 
reports included information regarding: 1) current stage 
of motivational readiness for physical activity; 2) current 
self-efficacy; 3) cognitive and behavioral strategies associ- 
ated with physical activity (processes of change); 4) how 
the participant compares to individuals who are physically 
active and meeting national guidelines of 150 min per 
week of MVPA [2] (normative feedback); 5) how the par- 
ticipant compares 
(progress 
to her prior 
feedback-provided after the first month); and 6) useful 
facts about physical activity, such as health benefits, 
stretching, and heart rate monitoring. The reports draw 
from a bank of more than 300 messages addressing differ- 
ent levels of these psychosocial and environmental factors 
affecting physical activity. In addition, they received an 

online manual that was matched to their motivational 
readiness for physical activity. The manual emphasized 
strategies for increasing PA, such as goal-setting, self- 
monitoring, problem-solving barriers, methods for in- 
creasing social support, and rewarding oneself for meeting 
physical activity goals. 
Staff also reviewed physical activity informational pages 
on the website with the participant at baseline. This in- 
cludes several ways to determine if they were exercising at 
moderate intensity: target heart rate; rating of perceived 
exertion; mile pace (15–20 min mile); and reference to the 
10-min treadmill walk participants completed. Partici- 
pants also received information on exercising safely and 
how to report an injury to the study. Lastly, the website 
provided links to several online and community resources. 
The Intervention Group received email prompts to ac- 
cess the intervention website weekly during month 1, bi- 
weekly during months 2 and 3, and monthly during 
months 4–6, with new physical activity information tip 
sheets made available on this schedule. Participants 
received monetary incentives to complete the study re- 
quirements, including $10 each month for completing 
the online monthly questionnaires, $25 for attending the 
6 and 12 month assessment visits, and a $50 bonus for 
attending both visits. 
Wellness contact control internet group (Control Group) 
The Wellness Contact Control Internet Group received 
access to a Spanish language website with information on 
health topics other than physical activity. The web-based 
content focused on diet and other factors associated with 
cardiovascular disease risk and included information from 
a series on heart health developed for Latinos by the 
National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Topics included: 
Cut Down On Salt and Sodium, Cut Down on Fat and 
Not on Taste, Learn Your Cholesterol Number, Stress 
Management, Kick the Smoking Habit, Protect Your 
Heart-Lower Your Cholesterol, and Prevent High Blood 
Pressure [24]. Participants in the Control Group received 
the same monetary incentives and the same number of 
email contacts on the same schedule as the Intervention 
Group. Control Group participants also logged into a 
website (separate from the intervention website) 
to 
complete monthly surveys on the previously described 
wellness topics. 
Measures 
Demographics were assessed at baseline with a brief ques- 
income, occupation, 
tionnaire assessing age, education, 
race, ethnicity, history of residence in the U.S., marital sta- 
tus, and acculturation [25]. The STOFHLA [22] was also 
administered at baseline to evaluate adult literacy in the 
health care setting. 


The 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR) was 
used to calculate the needed sample size for the study 
based on 80 % power using effect sizes from previous 
studies, and so served as the primary outcome measure 
[26, 27]. The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer-administered 
instrument that provides details about the types of activ- 
ities engaged in and an estimate of weekly minutes of 
physical activity; it uses multiple strategies for increasing 
accuracy of recall, such as breaking down the week into 
daily segments (i.e., morning, afternoon, and evening) 
and asking about many types of activities, including time 
spent sleeping and engaging in moderate, hard, and very 
hard activity. All domains of activity are included, such 
as leisure, transportation, and occupational activity. To 
further enhance the accuracy of self-reporting, participants 
walked on a treadmill for 10 min at a moderate intensity 
pace (3–4 miles per hour) just prior to completing the 7- 
Day PAR at baseline and again at follow-up. The 7-Day 
PAR has been used across many studies on physical activity 
and has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, in- 
ternal consistency, and concurrent validity with objective 
measures of activity [28–32]. Past research indicates that 
the 7-Day PAR is sensitive to changes in MVPA over time 
[29, 30] and has good test-retest reliability among Latino 
participants [33]. 
Accelerometer-measured physical activity (ActiGraph 
3X+) served as an additional primary outcome measure. 
Accelerometers measure both movement and intensity of 
activity and have been validated with heart rate telemetry 
[34] and total energy expenditure [35]. Accelerometer data 
was processed using the ActiLife software, with a cut point 
of 1952 to establish the minimum threshold for moderate 
intensity activity [36]. Participants were asked to wear the 
accelerometer on their left hip for 7 days. Valid wear time 
was classified as 5 days of at least 600 min of wear time 
each day or at least 3000 min of wear time over 4 days. To 
be counted in the total minutes/week of activity, activity 
had to occur in ≥10-min bouts. 
Psychosocial measures related to depression, social sup- 
port, stress, and physical activity enjoyment and environ- 
ment were also completed. The Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 10-question measure 
of depressive symptoms [37] that has been translated and 
validated across different ethnic groups, with internal 
consistencies of .87 and above in both English and Spanish 
[38, 39] and 0.83 in our sample, Social support for physical 
activity was examined in terms of support from friends and 
family members for physical activity. The 13-question 
measure has three sub-scales with acceptable internal con- 
sistencies (alphas range from 0.61 to 0.91, 0.87–0.88 in this 
sample) and good criterion validity [40]. The Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS) [41, 42] examines the degree to which 
specific situations are deemed as stressful in the past week. 
The PSS is validated and has been used in many studies 
examining the association between stress and health and 
has an internal consistency of 0.86 in this sample [43]. The 
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) [44] assesses 
the level of personal satisfaction derived from physical ac- 
tivity participation. The measure has 18 items with high in- 
ternal consistency (alpha = 0.96 and 0.94 in this sample) 
and criterion validity [44]. Neighborhood Environment 
Walkability Scale, Abbreviated (NEWSA) includes 54 items 
[45, 46] assessing various aspects of the built environment 
related to walking, neighborhood aesthetics, and traffic. 
Several studies have supported the test–retest reliability of 
the NEWS [47, 48] as well as its construct validity by 
reporting significant differences on some NEWS sub-scales 
between neighborhoods selected to differ on walkability 
[46, 47] and modest correlations between NEWS sub-scales 
and accelerometer and self-reported estimates of physical 
activity [49]. 
Three measures - stage of change, self-efficacy for phys- 
ical activity, and the processes of change - were adminis- 
tered at baseline and on a monthly basis via the website, 
and used to help generate the tailored expert system 
feedback reports for the Intervention Group. The 4-item 
stage of change measure has demonstrated reliability 
intra-class correlation r = 0.84) as well as 
(Kappa = 0.78; 
shown acceptable concurrent validity with measures of self- 
efficacy and current activity levels [50]. The 40-item 
processes measure contains 10 sub-scales that address a 
variety of processes of activity behavior change. Internal 
consistency of the subscales ranged from .62 to .96 [51] in 
past studies, and .61–89 in the current study. Self-efficacy, 
or confidence in one’s ability to persist with exercising in 
various situations, such as when feeling fatigued or 
encountering inclement weather, was measured with a 5- 
item instrument [52] developed by Marcus and colleagues 
(alpha = .82 with alpha = 0.72 in this sample). 
Data analysis 
Using a single linear mixed effects regression model, 
mean minutes/week of MVPA (as obtained from the 7- 
Day PAR and separately for accelerometers) at follow-up 
was regressed on time, treatment, and time x treatment, 
in order to assess between group differences in minutes/ 
week of MVPA at 6 months (primary study outcome). 
As baseline 
characteristics were balanced between 
groups, no additional covariates were included in the 
model. The model specified included a random, subject- 
specific intercept, to account for repeated, correlated 
measures of the outcome within participant. Non-linear 
trends were assessed by including quadratic effects (for 
example) but ultimately not presented, as the linear 
model was superior in fit. All analyses were conducted 
on the intent to treat sample, with all randomized partic- 
ipants included in the analysis. 


Since a likelihood-based approach was used for esti- 
mation of regression parameters, estimated effects made 
use of all available data without directly imputing miss- 
ing outcomes. A similar modeling strategy was used for 
the second primary physical activity outcome, objectively 
measured MVPA obtained via accelerometer. Models of 
objectively measured MVPA were additionally adjusted 
for wear time (as a covariate) in this case. As a way of 
corroborating self-reported MVPA, spearman rank cor- 
relations were calculated at baseline and follow up (7- 
Day PAR vs. accelerometer). 
We also assessed whether there were differences between 
groups in the percentage of participants meeting national 
guidelines for physical activity, defined as reporting at least 
150 min/week of MVPA. Using a logistic regression model 
implemented with generalized estimating equations with 
robust standard errors, we assessed treatment effects on 
the odds of meeting guidelines at follow-up. 
Using a similar modeling approach to that described for 
our primary outcome, we assessed effects of treatment on 
changes in psychosocial constructs over time, including all 
variables targeted by the intervention (self-efficacy, pro- 
cesses, social support, enjoyment). Unadjusted descriptives 
over time as well as adjusted mean changes from baseline 
(and standard errors) are presented. 


Results 
The sample included 205 eligible women who were ran- 
domly assigned to the Intervention (N = 104) and Con- 
trol (N = 101) groups, as 13 participants were deemed 
ineligible post-randomization. Reasons for not being ran- 
domized into one of the two conditions after signing a 
consent form included: medical condition that rendered 
the participant ineligible at time of assessment (e.g., high 
blood pressure), too much physical activity, inability to 
complete a treadmill demonstration, failure to attend 
scheduled visits, and no longer interested in the study. 
In addition, reasons for ineligibility post-randomization 
included unreliable computer access, moving away from 
San Diego, and medical issues that rendered participants 
ineligible (e.g., pregnancy, surgical procedures). Refer to 
Fig. 1. for the CONSORT diagram. 
A comparison of between group differences in baseline 
demographics, activity level, psychosocial constructs and 
baseline measurements are presented in Tables 1 and 2. 
Participants were 39.2 (10.5) years of age on average. The 
majority identified themselves as Mexican American 
(84.4 %), White (51.7 %) and first-generation in the U.S. 
(81.9 %). On average, participant BMI (28.8 +/− 5.2) was in 
the overweight range. Most participants had some college 
education (61 %) and had an annual household income 
lower than $30,000 (66.4 %). Participants reported low 
levels of physical activity at baseline, with mean self- 
reported min/week of MVPA of 9.2 (SD = 19.9) and object- 
ively measured MVPA of 32.3 (SD = 60.0). There were no 
between-group differences in baseline characteristics, sug- 
gesting a successful randomization procedure. 
The primary study outcome was self-reported MVPA at 
6 month follow-up (adjusting for baseline values). On aver- 
age, participants in the Intervention Group increased their 
min/week of MVPA from 8.0 (SD = 15.0), Median = 0 at 
baseline to 112.8 (SD = 97.1), Median = 100 min/week at 6 
months compared to Control who reported 10.44(23.98) 
Median = 0 at baseline and 63.5 min/week (SD = 88.7), Me- 
dian = 25 at follow-up. There was one statistical outlier at 
baseline (200 min/week of MVPA), which was removed 
from analysis. Adjusted model results showed a significant 
effect of Intervention vs. Control on min/week of MVPA, 
such that those randomized to the Intervention Group 
reported 50.0 more min/week of MVPA at 6 months 
compared to Control Group (adjusting for baseline), SE = 
9.5, p < .01. See Table 3 for full regression model. 
Unadjusted objectively measured MVPA over time is 
summarized in Fig. 2. Regression results indicate significant 
between-group differences in mean min/week of MVPA at 
6 months, with significantly more minutes in the Interven- 
tion Group after controlling for baseline (mean differences 
= 31.0, SE = 10.7,p < .01). Results also show significant cor- 
relations between accelerometers and self-reported MVPA 
at baseline and 6 months (rho = 0.27, p < .01 at baseline and 
rho = 0.52, p < .01 at 6 months), Table 3. 
Overall, 21.6 % of participants met national guidelines 
for PA at 6 months based on the 7-Day PAR: 31.4 % of the 
Intervention Group vs. 12.6 % of the Control Group. This 
corresponds to a statistically significant between group 
difference, OR = 3.12, 95 % CI: 1.46–6.66 (Table 4). 
Unadjusted mean changes in targeted psychosocial con- 
structs are presented separately by group in Table 5. Over- 
all, adjusted results of changes from baseline to 6 months 
suggest Intervention participants showed greater increases 
in self-efficacy (.42 (1.03) vs. -0.13(0.92), p < .001), cogni- 
tive processes (0.64(0.95) vs. 0.05(0.79), p < .001), behav- 
ioral processes (0.92(1.00) vs 0.25(0.75), p < .001), and a 
trend for enjoyment (13.37(23.81) vs. 7.09(21.39),p = 0.08) 
from baseline to 6 months. There were no significant dif- 
ferences between Intervention and Control with respect 
to changes in social support (friends), social support 
(family), social support (rewards and punishments), per- 
ceived stress, or depression (p’s > .05). 
Discussion 
Results from the current study support the efficacy of a 
Spanish-language 
Internet-based 
physical activity intervention for Latinas. The Intervention 
Group reported significantly greater increases in MVPA 
and several related psychosocial variables compared to the 




Control Group. A separate upcoming analysis of the 
maintenance effects is forthcoming. In the current study, 
the self-report physical activity data were validated with 
objective measures, which were significantly correlated 
with the 7-Day PAR and also showed a significant Inter- 
vention effect. The Control Group also reported increased 
physical activity at 6 months, which may have been due to 
repeat assessments of that variable. In addition, while the 
wellness materials focused on diet and other health behav- 
iors aside from physical activity, it may have nonetheless 
inspired Control participants to engage in similar lifestyle 
changes. Social desirability response bias is another poten- 
tial reason for increased MVPA in the Control Group. 
These results are comparable to those found in a similar 
Internet-based physical activity study with mostly Non- 
Hispanic White participants, in which physical activity in- 
creased from a median of 0 min/week at baseline to 
120 min/week at 6 months (vs. 0 median minutes/week at 
baseline to 100 min/week at 6 months in the current 
study) [52]. Also 44 % of the mostly Non-Hispanic White 
Intervention participants reported reaching the national 
physical activity guidelines (150 min/week) by 6 months, 
compared to 30.6 % in the current study with Latinas [53]. 
Findings from the current Internet-based study among 
Latinas were slightly more modest than those found in a 
similar study with mostly Non-Hispanic samples; how- 
ever, increases in physical activity produced by the inter- 
active web-based format used in the current study were 
greater than those found in a recent study in which 
similar content was provided to Latinas via mail- 
delivered self-help print materials [16, 17]. Specifically, 
self-reported physical activity increased from an average 
of 1.87 min/week (SD = 6.86) at baseline to 73.36 min/ 
week (SD = 89.73) at 6 months among Intervention par- 
ticipants in the previous study, and only 11.36 % of the 
Intervention Group reported meeting national physical 
activity guidelines at 6 months in that study. Interest- 
ingly, while delivery channel seemed very important in 
the Latina samples, it was perhaps less critical to the 
mostly Non-Latino White participants, who reported 
similar physical activity levels at 6 months regardless of 
whether they received individually tailored interventions 
via 
(median of 120 min/week) or print 
(112.5 min/week) [54]. Those findings were published in 
2007, but more recent Health Information Trends Sur- 
vey (HINTs) data also indicated that Latinos were more 
likely to use the Internet for help with diet, weight and 
physical activity than non-Latino whites [55]. Taken to- 
gether, these findings suggest that the Internet is a par- 
ticularly appealing delivery channel in this at-risk target 
population at this time. 

Despite this, a 2013 Cochrane review reported a pau- 
city of web-based physical activity intervention studies

use of a randomized controlled trial research design, and 
balanced randomization across baseline characteristics. 

this study was conducted with 
mostly healthy Mexican American women with some 
degree of health literacy and advanced education, and 
thus may not be generalizable to other Latina subgroups, 
Latino men, or other ethnic groups. Future studies should 
include formative research to determine how to modify the 
intervention for men and/or other ethnic groups.

accelerometry as an additional primary outcome, the study 
was powered using a self-report measure. 
Increases in MVPA in the current study could be seen 
as modest, with approximately one-third of the Interven- 
tion Group reaching the physical activity levels recom- 
mended for health benefits at 6 months. However, given 
the extremely low levels of MVPA at baseline, these 
gains in MVPA are encouraging, especially because get-

to go from sedentary to meeting guidelines within a 6- 
month period, 
thus future studies should focus on 
longer-term effects. 
In addition, significant group differences were also 
found in the theoretic mediators directly targeted by the

participants compared to control participants. These 
psychosocial constructs have been shown to predict in- 
creases in PA in our prior studies with Latina women 
[16, 17]. To increase physical activity gains in future 
studies, we may need to influence relevant psychosocial 
variables such as social support and perceived stress that 
did not change in response to the current program. So- 
cial support in particular has been reported to be an im- 
portant component in physical activity behavior change 
in past studies with Latinas [11, 57]. Further formative 
research could explore how websites can effectively im- 
prove social support for physical activity among Latinas 
and help more participants reach the national PA 
guidelines.

Internet-delivered

achieved even larger increases in physical activity than 
the print-based version used in our past studies with La- 
tinas. This is an important finding given that the Latino 
population in the U.S. 
is rapidly growing and reports 
high rates of inactivity and related conditions (obesity, 
diabetes) [58]. To address these health disparities, this 
community needs appealing, effective physical activity 
interventions that can reach a large number of people in 
a cost-efficient manner. Unlike print-based interven- 
tions, web-based approaches can be offered to more 
people without substantially increasing the incremental 
cost of the intervention. Future researchers in this area 
are encouraged to focus on developing mobile friendly 
web sites as Latinas are frequently accessing the Internet 
via smartphones [20]. Other aspects of smart phone tech- 
nology (applications, text messaging) have been used to 
promote health behavior change in other groups [59–62] 
and should also be explored in this at risk target popula- 
tion. Such features could help drive participants to the 
website and improve utilization, resulting in even greater 
behavior change.
