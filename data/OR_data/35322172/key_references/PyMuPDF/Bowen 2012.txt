Abstract
Background: The rate of smoking commercial tobacco products among American Indian youth is double the rate for white
youth. Interventions are needed to reduce this disparity.
Objective: 
To test the feasibility of a Web-based intervention to influence attitudes toward and intentions about smoking
cigarettes among American Indian youth who attended a Native summer camp in the Northern Plains.
Methods: The study website, the SmokingZine, was originally developed and tested in Canadian youth, then adapted to be
appropriate for American Indian youth. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the influence of exposure to the adapted
SmokingZine website on smoking attitudes and behaviors among American Indian youth 12–18 years of age. Participants assigned
to the intervention group were given access to the website for 1 hour per day during their camp experience and asked to sign in
to the site and use it. Control group participants were not given access to the site.
Results: A total of 52% of intervention youth signed in to the website at least once. Among nonsmokers, intentions to try a
cigarette in the intervention group declined from 16% to 0%, and increased from 8% to 25% in the control group (P < .05).
Compared with the control group, youth in the intervention group were more likely to help others quit (21 percentage point change
in intervention versus no change in control; P < .05) and had less positive attitudes about the drug effects of smoking (–0.19
change in intervention versus 0.67 in control; P < .05).
Conclusion: These data indicate that SmokingZine needs more long-term, rigorous investigation as a way to keep American
Indian youth from becoming regular smokers. Because the intervention group could use computers only 1 hour per day, increasing
access might result in more visits and a greater effect of the website on smoking behaviors.

Introduction
Smoking tobacco is responsible for more premature morbidity
and mortality in the United States than any other behavioral
risk factor [1]. Nationally, rates of smoking, as well as other
forms of tobacco use, such as chewing tobacco, are substantially
higher among American Indians than white people [2,3] and
have not followed the downward trend observed over the past
decade in the general US population [4,5]. Of particular concern,
a recent report from the US Surgeon General on tobacco use
among racial and ethnic minority people in the United States
indicated that smoking rates among American Indian youth are

double that of their white counterparts [4] and remain high even
compared with their peers in other racial and ethnic minority
groups [4].
High rates of smoking among American Indian youth may be
due, in part, to the sovereign status of federally recognized
tribes. Because tribal lands are often not subject to state tobacco
control policies, American Indian youth have access to tobacco
products at a very early age. Early initiation often leads to
addiction and long-term abuse of tobacco [6,7], which in turn
contribute to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, the leading
causes of death in the American Indian population [6,7].
Although these worrisome data highlight the need to develop
or identify successful programs to both prevent and reduce
smoking among American Indian youth, a Medline search
conducted before initiating this project produced no adequately
evaluated programs that targeted Native youth.
Increasing attention has focused on using the Web for smoking
cessation support, including delivery of information, discussion
groups, cognitive behavioral treatment, and self-help materials
[8-14]. The SmokingZine website was originally developed
explicitly for testing in urban Canadian youth [15]. Since 1995,
the TeenNet project [14,16] at the University of Toronto has
pioneered a combination of website development, community
mobilization, and action research involving young people from
diverse backgrounds in all stages of program design,
development, and dissemination. In 2002, TeenNet began a
randomized controlled trial of SmokingZine involving more
than 1400 smoking and nonsmoking adolescents from
participating Toronto-area high schools [8]. SmokingZine was
both the largest randomized trial of an eHealth intervention for
behavior change and one of the largest studies on adolescent
smoking cessation [8,11]. In another clinical trial, the same
intervention was efficacious in reducing smoking among
middle-school youth in public schools [15].
Because of the success of the SmokingZine trial with youth
from diverse backgrounds, adapting and testing this program
for Native youth seemed promising. Because young people use
the Web for health information [10], we conducted a randomized
controlled study of this Web-based youth smoking prevention
and cessation resource, SmokingZine [8,11], among American
Indians 12–18 years of age attending summer camp in South
Dakota. The outcomes of interest to our study were short-term
smoking behaviors, attitudes about smoking, and usability of
the Web tool [12]. Our findings are intended to identify issues
for a full-scale efficacy study of the SmokingZine intervention
in a larger sample.
Methods
Overview
We conducted a small randomized feasibility trial in one
geographical site to test the 1-month effects of a Web-based
intervention on smoking behaviors among American Indian
youth 12–18 years of age. All participants completed a baseline
survey and were then randomly assigned to one of two
conditions: intervention (50%) or control. Intervention
participants were asked to sign in to the website and use it, and
were provided with regular access to the site during their camp
experience. Control participants were not given access to the
site. All participants completed a follow-up survey 1 month
after randomization. We assessed and compared smoking
behavior in both groups. In addition, we assessed attitudes and
social behaviors that could be expected to change as a result of
the intervention exposure. All control participants received
access to the intervention after completion of the study. This
study is reported in line with CONSORT requirements, and a
flow chart and checklist were included in the review of the
manuscript. We did not register this trial prospectively, as it
was a feasibility trial, not a fully powered randomized trial.
Setting and Participants
Each year more than 150 American Indian 6th to 12th graders
from across South Dakota are selected to participate in a 6-week
residential summer enrichment program in Rapid City, South
Dakota. All nine Indian reservations located in South Dakota
participate in the program, whose goal is to prepare students
for success in college. During the 6 weeks, students attend
classes in mathematics, science, English, computer use, and life
skills. All camp attendees were eligible for this study, with a
target sample size of 100 youth, based on a sample size
calculation with power of 80% and a moderate effect size in
intentions to smoke in the future.
Recruitment and Consent Procedures
Working closely with the director of the summer program, we
arranged to insert an informational sheet about the study into
all correspondence mailed to the 164 selected students before
the program started. During registration, our research staff set
up an informational booth in the lobby of the students’dormitory
to describe the program to students and their parents. For
students interested in participating, a consent form was read to
both parents and students. A total of 113 students provided
consent, completed the baseline assessment described below,
and were randomly assigned to the intervention or control arm.
Randomization was completed by assigning each consented
and assessed youth to a study identification number that had
been preassigned to either intervention or control status. Field
staff were unaware of the preassignment.
Intervention
Although it has a small cessation focus, the Web-based
SmokingZine is primarily a smoking prevention intervention.
It consists of a series of smoking educational modules that
include culturally relevant contexts (a summer powwow) and
images relevant to Native youth (eg, eagles, feathers, drums,
and outdoor scenes). Our methods for developing and culturally
adapting SmokingZine for use in this study have been previously
published [16]. Briefly, we conducted talking circles with Native
youth to ascertain their knowledge and attitudes about tobacco
use, their opinions of SmokingZine, and their recommendations
for changes. Talking circle participants provided useful
information on the differences between ceremonial and
commercial tobacco use, as well as their personal patterns and
motivations regarding tobacco use. They also offered guidance
on changes to the site that would make it more fun to use and
more culturally appropriate. Examples of suggestions are

replacing urban images with images of outdoor settings familiar
to diverse Native youth, and replacing images of a shopping
mall with images of a powwow. The research team made
changes based on participants’ suggestions.
After randomization, control group participants were told that
they would receive information about smoking at the end of the
6-week program. Intervention youth were given usernames and
passwords to access the SmokingZine site and were instructed
to use it as much as they wanted. Our intent was for the
intervention participants to visit the site multiple times, with
each visit lasting 10–20 minutes. The use of unique usernames
and passwords enabled the research team to broadly track usage
patterns of each participant over time. The research assistant
maintained a list that linked each username to an identification
number printed on the study questionnaire, enabling us to link
site usage to baseline and follow-up data.
Each day of the 6-week program, students had 1 hour of
computer time. Those in the intervention were encouraged to
visit the SmokingZine site during this time. On the initial visit,
the research assistant helped participants navigate to the site.
Once participants signed in to the site, they were asked about
their current smoking status. Then, based on their response,
they were guided to educational modules about smoking
prevention or cessation. The underlying message of these
modules reinforced the values of nonsmokers and created a set
of conditions to enhance smokers’motivation and commitment
to change. Toward the end of each session, modules helped
smokers identify goals for behavior change and explore barriers
to change, as well as providing advice and strategies where
appropriate. During subsequent sessions, participants received
additional information about smoking prevention or cessation.
Assessments
All intervention and control youth were asked to complete a
30-minute paper-and-pencil survey on current smoking habits,
intentions to smoke, and attitudes about smoking, both
immediately after randomization and again 1 month later. We
also approached youth who did not complete the entire survey
to provide us with smoking outcomes only, to maximize
response to a minimal outcome dataset.
The 87-item survey, called A Smoking Prevention Interactive
Experience 
(ASPIRE) 
instrument, 
consisted 
of
sociodemographic items, several scales, and individual items.
Many of the items were derived from existing instruments, and
others were created specifically for an interactive, multimedia
smoking prevention and cessation curriculum for culturally
diverse high-school students [9]. Attitudes were measured by
a series of questions asking for the opinions of youth on various
smoking-related issues. The primary outcome of this feasibility
study was short-term smoking behaviors; secondary outcomes
were attitudes about smoking and intentions to smoke.
At baseline, on the basis of questionnaire answers, students
were categorized as current smokers (smoke every other week,
smoke less than a pack a week, smoke a pack a week, smoke
more than a pack a week, smoke a pack a day, or smoke more
than a pack a day), former smokers (used to smoke regularly
but quit), or nonsmokers, including never-smokers (never
smoked even part of a cigarette) and experimenters (only
smoked part of a cigarette or smoked only a few times).
Analyses
We compared baseline demographic data between intervention
and control participants, using t tests for continuous variables
and chi-square tests for proportions to confirm that
randomization was accomplished. We also examined website
usage data for intervention participants to assess patterns and
frequency of use.
Next, we examined changes in survey responses from baseline
to 1-month follow-up in key smoking and related outcomes.
We focused these analyses on selected intermediate outcomes
of long-term smoking prevention, such as short-term smoking
behavior changes, intentions to smoke in the future, and social
actions that participants could take regarding smoking. We
compared each of these variables from baseline to follow-up
between intervention and control participants. Relatively few
participants were missing at follow-up and, therefore, we used
no imputation method.
We also performed a factor analysis on the attitude questions
in the ASPIRE instrument to determine whether we could
identify any groupings of questions for analysis. We identified
three clusters, based on factor loadings of greater than 0.5,
independent of loading on other factors. These were social issues
(3 items, eg, “Kids who smoke have more friends”), drug effects
(3 items, eg, “Smoking cigarettes relieves tension”), and
negative effects) (9 items, eg, “Cigarette smoking is addictive”).
We averaged the items in each cluster to form a score for each
area. We then compared responses to attitudinal scores between
intervention and control youth from baseline to follow-up.
Results
The study team invited 164 young people to participate, and
recruited and randomized 113 (68.9%). The mean age of
participants in the intervention and control arms did not differ
(mean of 14.8 vs 14.4 years). Of the 113 who completed the
baseline measures, we were able to collect smoking follow-up
data on 102 (90.3%). The intervention and control groups did
not differ in the proportion who provided follow-up data (n =
49, 92% versus n = 44, 90%). Likewise, baseline demographic
data and smoking behavior were similar between youth who
completed and those who did not complete the follow-up
assessment.
In terms of use, 10 (52%) intervention youth signed in to the
website at least once. Of these, 39 (80%) used the site only once,
and 5 (20%) used it 2 or more times. Overall, intervention users
rated the site positively on the survey: 16 (33%) rated it as very
useful and 27 (54%) rated it as somewhat useful. A large
proportion of intervention users indicated that use of the site
made them think very differently 22 (44%) or somewhat
differently 19 (38%) about smoking. Finally, most of the
intervention users indicated that use of the site would very much
(36, 74%) or somewhat (3, 11%) keep them from smoking in
the future.

Table 1 presents the characteristics of the 113 participants
randomly assigned in the study. Baseline demographic
characteristics did not differ across the intervention and control
groups. Most participants reported their ethnic status as Native
(95/113, 84%), with a preponderance of girls over boys (69,
61%), and a majority with at least one smoking parent (75,
66%).

Table 2 presents data on smoking status and intent for the
intervention and control groups at baseline and 1-month
follow-up. Differences including smokers and former smokers
were not tested statistically due to small sample sizes. Rates of
current smoking at baseline among all youth were relatively
low: almost 80% were never-smokers. The proportions of youth
in the never, current, and former categories of smoking did not
change from baseline to follow-up. The number of intervention
youth who reported helping someone quit smoking increased
over time. In contrast, the number in the control group did not
change(6 versus 0, P < .05). Likewise, among nonsmokers, the
number who intended to try a cigarette in the intervention group
declined from 7to 0 and increased from 3 to 8 in the control
group (P < .05). Finally, the other smoking-related variables
did not differ across the intervention and control groups.

Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to test several aspects of
the feasibility of the adapted Web-based SmokingZine
intervention for American Indian youth. The intervention was
feasible and acceptable for at least half of the participants, and
at least somewhat effective for American Indians 12–18 years
of age. The trial was successfully implemented with little
oversight or structure, among staff and youth generally
unfamiliar with research projects or randomized designs.
Moreover, most students (69%) in the summer camp participated
in the study, indicating that a larger randomized test of this, or
a similar, Web-based intervention is logistically possible. This
evidence of feasibility is critical, because concerns about the
adequacy of prior study designs have plagued the literature on
youth smoking prevention [13]. We also were pleased that a
substantial proportion of the intervention group found the
website interesting and useful.
Only 52% used the site, although a much smaller proportion
used it on more than one occasion. This is a common occurrence
among Web-based studies of youth, where actual use of the
website in randomized trials is often low [17]. In this study the
investigators identified some engagement strategies for youth
to increase their use of and engagement in the Web-based
activities, and this is a promising avenue for future research and
implementation. Future studies should consider strategies to
increase the proportion of randomly assigned participants who
visit the SmokingZine website more than once, for instance by
structuring or scheduling use, providing incentives for use, or
increasing access to computers. Qualitative work has identified
the multiple ways in which youth engage in using eHealth
technologies to gain information [18], and some of these ways
are relevant to the present application. For example, finding
personalized and tailored information was a need expressed by
youth in the focus groups, and the SmokingZine website could
be more tailored to individual users’ needs and data and
marketed as such.
In regard to marketing, in our study, the moderate amount of
website use might have resulted from the strict limitation on
computer access, suggesting that liberalizing the amount of
computer time might enhance the effect of the intervention. If
the program were implemented in schools, there would be
supervised and required time for sessions on the computer that
would likely promote the visiting of the website by youth during
school hours.
Given our experiences with this study, we propose that a group
design would be ideal, given the opportunity for sharing site
passwords as well as information and materials pertinent to the
intervention among youth in the same physical location. The
popularity among youth of social networking sites such as
Facebook also suggests that a group design would be appropriate
for a larger trial. As well, in a study with a longer follow-up
period, preexisting friendships and social networks would result
in youth using the site together. We did not observe joint use
in our study, but in settings where computers are publicly
available, such as schools and community centers, joint use
could occur. The use of group randomized trials, in which the
unit of intervention is the group, would help to minimize this
problem. Finally, biochemical validation could be used to verify
smoking outcomes in any future rigorous efficacy trials aimed
at American Indian youth.
In the short run, the intervention did not directly affect smoking
behavior, although it did alter intentions to use tobacco among
never-smokers. This finding is encouraging for future efficacy
trials, as the relatively high rates of smoking in later adolescence
occur in both early- and later-starting smokers. This type of
intervention may thus be best suited for young people who are
still irregular smokers or nonsmokers at the time of exposure.
The intervention did change social interactions involving
smoking, such as offering to help others quit. This may be the
most intriguing and important finding, as tobacco use is a
socially driven phenomenon [19] that could be prevented by
breaking down socially normative perspectives on tobacco.
Given our small sample size, the lack of effects on smokers
may simply indicate lack of power coupled with low baseline
rates of smoking. These low baseline rates, in turn, likely reflect
the biases related to being selected to attend a camp for
American Indian youth. For example, the students had to have
a high grade-point average and were highly recommended by
their school counselor and teachers. Smoking is more frequent
among Native youth with lower academic performance, who
perhaps were not widely represented at this camp [16]. In other
community settings, we would be more likely to encounter a
wider variety of Native youth, including more regular smokers.
This is a major limitation to the generalizability of the present
study data, in that less achievement-oriented Native youth might
not respond to this website. The structured nature of the summer
camp is also a limitation of the present study, as youth in the
camp are not near their regular and ongoing social influences,
and so the artificial structure of the camp interactions might
alter the effects of the intervention.
Besides the highly selected sample of American Indian youth
attending summer camp, other limitations of this feasibility
study include the short duration of the follow-up and the lack
of qualitative data to enhance our understanding of quantitative
survey findings. As well, a key limitation was the camp’s
rigorous control of access to the Web, allowing youth only 1
hour of computer use each day. We expect that participants
neither visited the site as much nor stayed as long as they might
have with longer or unlimited Web access, thus diluting the
potential impact of the intervention. There was always the
potential in this individually randomized design for
contamination to occur between intervention and comparison
youth, discussing smoking and even using the website together.
Finally, despite our best efforts, the randomization intended to
be evenly divided between intervention and comparison youth
was not, and so more rigorous randomization procedures will
need to be instituted for the next study. Even so, strengths
include the use of a previously tested intervention, a documented
adaptation process, and a rigorous feasibility design.
Future efforts should pay closer attention to cessation among
subsets of youth smokers, because American Indians who smoke
in youth are most likely to become regular adult smokers [20].

If cessation needs more emphasis, the intervention website will
need to be enhanced.
These findings partially support the potential of the
SmokingZine tool for future research. We believe this feasibility
study has set the stage for future intervention research into
tobacco use reduction among American Indian and Alaska
Native youth. Online tobacco control efforts have started to
emerge [21-24], but none to date have been designed for or
targeted at American Indians and Alaska Natives. In a similar
vein, some authors have called for more use of eHealth
technology to enhance the health of Native people, both inside
and outside the Indian Health Service [19].
