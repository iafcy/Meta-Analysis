Abstract: To examine the effects of short messaging service (SMS) frequency and timing on the efﬁcacy
of an SMS-intervention for Hong Kong Chinese adolescents, sixty nine students aged between 12 and
16 (mean age 13.75 ± 0.90) were recruited from ﬁve schools in Hong Kong. Participants were randomly
assigned into one of ﬁve groups: high-frequency + self-selected timing (HST), low-frequency +
self-selected timing (LST), high-frequency + assigned timing (HAT), low-frequency + assigned timing
(LAT) and the control group. The total duration of the intervention was four weeks. No signiﬁcant
intervention effects were detected in adolescent’s PA among the ﬁve groups (F = 1.14, p = 0.346).
No signiﬁcant differences were observed in the stage movement among the ﬁve groups (χ2 = 6.18,
p = 0.627). No signiﬁcant differences appeared in the exercise beneﬁts, barriers and beneﬁts/barriers
differential scores. However, a growth trend in the exercise beneﬁts score in the LST and HAT groups
was found in contrast to the downswing in the control group. The exercise barriers score in the HST
group showed the largest reduction after intervention. The beneﬁts/barriers differential score in all
the intervention groups increased, whereas it decreased in the control group. Although an increase
is demonstrated in the high dosage SMS frequency and timing, no signiﬁcant intervention effects
were found among the ﬁve groups in PA behavior, stage of change and exercise beneﬁts and barriers
among Hong Kong Chinese adolescents.

1. Introduction
1.1. Physical Activity and Obesity
Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with a reduced risk of obesity and type II diabetes
mellitus in adolescents, as well as a reduced risk of diseases that develop later in life, such as
breast cancer, hypertension, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis [1,2]. However, despite the
well-established and documented beneﬁts of PA, over half of the young population around the world
does not engage in sufﬁcient PA to achieve the potential signiﬁcant health beneﬁts [3]. The Boys’ and
Girls’ Clubs Association of Hong Kong (BGCA) (2018) [4], has revealed that 59.1% of 6 to 17-year-olds
in Hong Kong engaged in less than six hours of moderate to vigorous intensity activity weekly.
The recommended level for this age group is 60 min or more of moderate-to-vigorous intensity

PA on most days of the week. Another recent questionnaire survey revealed that less than 10%
of 7 to 19-year-old self-reported participation in at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) a day. [5]. Therefore, innovative approaches to promote PA to adolescents are of
paramount importance.
1.2. PA Intervention with Short Message Service (SMS)
Over the last decade, numerous physical activity (PA) interventions have been developed and
implemented. However, many are ineffective [6], and traditional PA interventions, which are typically
delivered face-to-face, may not be affordable for large-scale use. However, information communication
technology (ICT), more speciﬁcally, Short Message Services (SMS) via mobile phones, is considered a
promising intervention delivery method by which to inﬂuence and potentially increase behavioral
change [7,8]. SMS is a text messaging service component of most telephone, internet, and mobile-device
systems. It is a most widely used data application. The intervention effect of SMS on different health
behaviors including physical and mental health has been supported in previous studies in which age,
ethnicity and socio-economic status are considered [9,10]. Additionally, SMS is also fast, portable,
convenient and inexpensive, and has a wider reach than other forms of communication [9]. Because
the mHealth technologies are currently making considerable advances in PA behavioral change, SMS
could play a more important role within PA behavioral change interventions if the functions are further
explored and maximized.
The reminder effect through SMS to the participants is the most obvious function in achieving a
signiﬁcant intervention effect in previous studies [11,12]. Conversely, SMS symbols could develop a
closer relation, better outreach, and in-group culture when communicating with peers. Delivery of SMS
could also reduce the barriers (i.e., data tracking and analysis) associated with treatments or services
provided to the patients in medical settings [13]. SMS produced a more motivational, interactive
and social support effect on the participants [14–16]. SMS is also an inexpensive and automated
communication technology in which the message can be “pushed” to the receiver, and he/she would
not consider rejecting it. This automated communication reaction enhances the probability of success
of the intervention.
Currently, among adolescent mobile phone users, SMS is an integral part of daily activities,
enabling the maintenance of social networks and the expression of feelings [17–19]. More importantly,
from an adolescent perspective, SMS is considered among young people as a fashionable means of
reﬂecting individual identity and culture within peer groups, for example, through the increased use
of personalized languages and emotional symbols, i.e., emoji [18,19].
The use of mobile phone technology has been widely adopted in chronic disease management
programs such as diabetes [20], asthma [21,22], sexual health [23], smoking cessation [24,25],
alcoholism, drug abuse and weight loss [26] and has consistently demonstrated promising results
in acting as an adjunct to existing treatment, increasing awareness, and improving compliance with
medication and adherence to treatment programs.
The use of mobile technology for improved PA levels has primarily focused on adult
populations [27,28]. However, recently an increasing number of studies have implemented mobile
to promote PA behaviors among adolescents [29,30]. A review by Lau et al. [31] found support for
the use of SMS as a medium to improve PA among children and adolescents; however, six of the nine
studies included in the review demonstrated satisfactory methodological quality.
1.3. The Theoretical Framework of the Study
The trans-theoretical model (TTM) has been one of the major models for the stage of change in
past decades when investigating behavioral change among children and adults in the literature [32,33].
This stage-matched concept demonstrated signiﬁcant insights regarding both PA adoption and
maintenance when designing interventions for adolescents in an intervention study [33,34]. A major
value of the stage of change model is that it not only demonstrates the readiness of an individual’s

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 787
3 of 12
intention to change his or her PA behavior but also provides stage-based and stage-matched guidelines
to the PA researchers [35]. Because the TTM has demonstrated effects on the improvement of PA
in the student population, it would be interesting to observe whether SMS may be able to produce
a signiﬁcant impact on the adolescents in this study, particularly on the transition, if any, between
different stages of change in PA behavior [32].
1.4. Research Questions of the Study
Perceived exercise beneﬁts and barriers have been documented as signiﬁcant mediators in the
previous PA behavioral change studies [36,37]. Signiﬁcant relations were demonstrated between PA
beneﬁts, PA barriers and the current PA habits of the participants [38]. A better understanding of the
perceived beneﬁts and barriers to PA could enhance the intervention effectiveness and efﬁciency [37].
The Exercise Beneﬁts and Barriers Scale (EBBS) can help assess the changes in participant’s perceived
beneﬁts, barriers and any discrepancies. These scores would provide a better picture to understand
and interpret the intervention ﬁndings in this study. It is also important to know the dynamic relations
or priority between the beneﬁts and barriers in PA when addressing adolescents’ PA behavioral change
because these changes may be different when compared with different populations [39].
Because SMS-based interventions are increasing, it is essential to establish practical guidelines,
particularly with respect to content and frequency. Reviews of behavior change interventions delivered
by SMS [9,40] indicated that successful SMS-based health behavior change interventions were delivered
at high frequency (at least 5 SMS per week) with an individually tailored SMS timing. However, these
studies have all been conducted in European and American populations, and no such investigations
have been conducted in Chinese population or, more speciﬁcally, in Chinese adolescent population.
In Hong Kong, a preliminary investigation supported the efﬁcacy of promoting PA through SMS
and Internet-based programs [41]. However, the effect of tailored timing and frequency has not yet been
empirically examined. Existing behavior change theories have emphasized the “why” but relatively
less the “how” (i.e., procedures), and behavior change interventions have not met expectations in
terms of effectiveness [6]. This study’s objective was to address this issue by determining how best to
integrate SMS into adolescent PA behavior. These ﬁndings may offer practical guidelines to inform the
design of future SMS-based intervention for Chinese adolescent’s PA behavior. The speciﬁc purpose
of this study was to examine the effects of SMS frequency and timing on the efﬁcacy of a SMS-based
intervention for Hong Kong Chinese adolescent’s PA.
The research questions were:
(1)
What is the effect of the frequency and timing of the delivery of SMS impact on the quantity of
adolescent’s PA?
(2)
Would the stages of motivational readiness for PA be affected as a result of the SMS intervention?
(3)
Would adolescents perceive a difference in beneﬁts and barriers to PA as a result of the
SMS intervention?
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
Participants were randomly recruited from ﬁve of 469 government-subsidized schools in Hong
Kong, China. Sixty nine students aged between 12 and 16 (33 girls, 36 boys, age 13.75 ± 0.90) were
recruited by physical education (PE) teachers from the ﬁve schools in Hong Kong. Ethical approval
was granted by the Senate Committee on the Use of Human and Animal Subjects in Teaching and
Research, Hong Kong Baptist University (project identiﬁcation code: FRG2/10-11/046). Screening
occurred prior to the selection of participants, who were included if they: (1) were between 12–16 years
old; (2) owned a personal mobile phone and (3) had a parent able to provide written informed consent.

2.2. Procedures
A fact sheet inviting participation was sent to parents three months prior to the intervention.
Two weeks prior to the start of the intervention, all those who had provided written consent attended
a brieﬁng session and complete a baseline questionnaires which consisted of their socio-demographics,
stage of change, perceived beneﬁts and barriers of PA, and PA level. With this information, an algorithm
of stage of change was used to identify their stage and messages matched with their respective stage
of behavior were sent to them from the message bank which was developed in a pilot study [41]. Then,
the tailored messages and phone numbers of each participant of the intervention group were entered
to a commercial computerized texting system to set up a delivery schedule. The sender was set in the
system by using their respective PE teachers’ name to provide a more solid support and motivation
to the participants. All measures were assessed at baseline and 4-week (post intervention). The total
duration of the intervention was four weeks.
This study used a randomized controlled cluster design. Invitations to participate in the study
were sent to all government-subsidized secondary schools in Hong Kong. Among the 469 schools
invitations, 10 schools replied and ﬁve schools were selected based upon the district categorizations
(Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and New Territories) in Hong Kong. Each school was allocated through
a ballot in which the ﬁve group labels (HST, LST, HAT, LAT, C) were picked. Participants were school
students randomly assigned into one of the ﬁve groups (Figure 1):

2.3. Measures
Measures included: demographic information, self-reported PA, stage of behavior change and
perceived beneﬁts and barriers to PA. PA was measured with the Physical Activity Questionnaire for
Children (PAQ-C) [42]. The PAQ-C is a self-administered, 7-day recall questionnaire for children aged
8 to 14 years composed of ten items, nine of which are structured to discern moderate-to-vigorous PA
(MVPA) using a 5-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating higher PA levels. The summarized
PAQ-C score is the average of the nine items scores. The PAQ-C score was the total score calculated by
summing all nine items to indicate participant’s overall PA levels. The validation of Chinese version of
the PAQ-C has been documented [43].
The stage of behavior change was measured using the Stage of Motivational Readiness
Questionnaire [44], which was validated with the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall [45].
This questionnaire contains four yes/no option items to determine participants’ readiness for PA
and categorize them into different stages: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action,
and maintenance. The questionnaire was translated into Chinese using the translation-back translation
method and a pilot study was conducted. The Kappa index of reliability of 0.78 over a 2-week period
was reported. To compare the movement status of groups related to the stage of motivational readiness,
participants were divided into three categories (decreasing, stable and increasing). These category
scores were determined by subtracting the pre-test from post-test scores.
Perceived beneﬁts and barriers to PA were measured using the adolescent version of the Exercise
beneﬁts and barriers scale (EBBS) [44]. The term “exercise” in the original questionnaire is replaced by
“PA” in order to reﬂect the PA context of the adolescents for the present study. The revised questionnaire
was conducted to the participants and they showed no troubles to understand and respond to the
questions related to their beneﬁts and barriers to PA. This scale contained nine beneﬁt and ten barrier
items using a 5-point scale. The scale could also be separately transited into the beneﬁts subscale and
barriers subscale. The ﬁnal score were the PA beneﬁts and barriers scores, which were summed directly
based on the beneﬁts subscale and the barriers subscale and beneﬁts/barriers differential score, which
were calculated by subtracting the mean barriers score from the mean beneﬁts score. Higher scores
indicated greater perceived beneﬁts or barriers or a differential score. A Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84 was
reported for both beneﬁts and barriers subscale. The Kappa indexes of the two subscales were 0.72
and 0.76, respectively.
2.4. Intervention
The tailored SMS messages were developed in a published pilot study [41]. According to the pilot
study, four types of messages were created: (1) greeting (e.g., Hi I’m Jackie, what’s your name? Do you
do PA regularly?), (2) motivation (e.g., Congratulations! You met your target last week. Great! I need
to learn from you!), (3) exercise tips (e.g., Listen to the music and dance. It’s easy and nice for you.),
and (4) reminder (e.g., shopping in and walking in a mall is also an exercise, please do it).
The content, language and tone of the SMS motivators were all tailored and matched according to
the participant’s Stage of Motivational Readiness (SMR), PA beneﬁt and PA barriers, as measured at
the baseline assessment. The messages were written in colloquial language and a stage-appropriate
tone. For the pre-contemplator, enabling them to understand the pros and cons of PA is the goal of
this stage. The sample statement was “I can release stress and improve my health by doing simple
PA like walking.” For the contemplators, the goal was to increase their likelihood to take action.
A statement such as “Let’s try . . . . . . ” was used to stimulate the contemplators to think more and
encourage them to do PA. The sample statement for those who want to improve his/her outlook
(beneﬁt), was “Let’s try to do some PA and improve my body posture and outlook”. Finally, for the
participants in the preparation, action and maintenance stage, the goal was to increase their PA level to
the recommended level. A directive statement was used to help these participants develop a PA plan.
Therefore, “You can” was used in the sample statement for those who considered the distance of the
PA venue excessively far (barrier), “If the PA venue is too far, you can stay home and do some sit-ups,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 787
6 of 12
rope skipping, and/or stretching. It’s better than doing nothing” (The President’s council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, PCPFS, 2003) [44].
In addition, participants were told that messages would be sent by PE teachers. This was done to
enhance social support because PE teachers are a known motivational inﬂuence affecting adolescent’s
leisure time PA [46]. A commercial database (PCCW Mobile HK Limited, 2007) was used to record the
usage of the SMS (number of SMS sent by the researcher and replied to by the participants).
2.5. Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of the four intervention groups and the control group were compared
using chi-square tests for categorical variables and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous
variables. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to test the intervention effect on the
outcome controlling for age, gender, BMI and the baseline assessment of variable. To compare stage
movement among groups, participants were divided into three categories (stable, progression to a
higher stage, and regression to a lower stage), and these data were analyzed with chi-square tests.
The level of signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0.05; all tests were 2-tailed. All analyses were conducted
using SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL USA).
3. Results
3.1. Participants’ Characteristics
Participants’ baseline characteristics stratiﬁed by groups are presented in Table 1. Due to the small
sample size, there were signiﬁcant differences in gender (χ2 = 31.83, p < 0.001) and age (χ2 = 14.32,
p = 0.006) distribution among groups. No signiﬁcant differences were found in BMI among the
ﬁve groups.

3.2. Intervention Effect on PA
The PAQ-C score at baseline and post-test in ﬁve groups are shown in Table 2. No signiﬁcant
intervention effects were detected among the ﬁve groups (F = 1.21, p = 0.421). However, an increasing
trend was found in the HST and LAT groups. The PAQ-C score increased from 16.46 (SD: 6.54) at
baseline to 18.75 (SD: 10.57) at post-test in the HST group as well as from 19.69 (SD: 8.59) at baseline to
21.85 (SD: 8.68) in the LAT group. However, this score decreased in the other four groups.
After intervention, ﬁve (38.5%) students in the HST group progressed to a higher stage, seven
(53.8%) children remained at the same stage, and one (7.7%) child regressed to a lower stage. In the
control group, the number of children that regressed to a lower stage (ﬁve children, 31.3%) was higher
than those that progressed to a higher stage (three children, 18.8%) (Table 2). However, no signiﬁcant
differences were observed in the stage movement among the ﬁve groups (χ2 = 6.18, p = 0.627).

3.3. Intervention Effect on Exercise Beneﬁts and Barriers
The exercise beneﬁts, barriers and beneﬁts/barriers differential scores are shown in Table 3. There
were no signiﬁcant differences among all the comparable groups (p > 0.05). However, we found a
growth trend in the exercise beneﬁts score in the LST and HAT groups compared with a downswing
in the control group. The exercise barriers score in the HST group showed the largest reduction after
intervention. The beneﬁts/barriers differential score in all the intervention groups increased, whereas
it decreased in the control group.

4. Discussion
4.1. What Is the Effect of SMS Delivery Frequency and Timing on Chinese Adolescents’ PA?
When the SMS frequency and timing issues are treated separately, it is reasonable to assume that
the SMS frequency has a positive relation with adolescents’ PA (Table 4). Orr and colleagues [9] stated
that a higher frequency of SMS (multiple messages a day) had a better effect on the health behavior
change than a lower frequency. Rosenbaum et al. [47] suggested that the frequency of feedback could be
a vital key to learn and/or to change perceptual-motor skills and intellectual skills. In the speciﬁc area
of SMS dosage, optimal frequency information on SMS delivery in motivational and learning contexts
has been lacking. However, this study did not demonstrate that the HST group could signiﬁcantly
increase adolescents’ PA levels, even the results showed the possible trend and meaningful impact of
higher frequency and the self-selected timing of SMS on behavioral change. Due to the small sample
size in this study, a future study should further explore the higher frequency and self-selected timing
in the intervention design. This ﬁnding may offer initial support that ﬁve weekly, tailored SMS had
a greater impact on self-reported PA than three weekly SMS and the control group. This change
trend is consistent with the systematic review [40] on behavior change interventions delivered by
SMS. The researchers found that the frequency of SMS transmission reﬂected the frequency of the
target behavior for all except for two (twelve of fourteen) studies in the review. Newton et al. [29] also

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 787

indicated that the low frequency of SMS (one message per week) could be the reason that PA behavior
change intervention (12-week SMS and pedometer monitoring) did not produce any signiﬁcant increase
in step counts.

When considering the timing with the frequency, the self-selected (HST) and assigned timing
(HAT) groups did not demonstrate any statistically signiﬁcant change in PA levels (as represented by
the PAQ-C score). However, an improvement trend was shown in the self-chosen time group when
compared with the assigned time group and the control group. Crutzen, Cyr & de Vries [46] stated that,
if participants had more control over their internet-based intervention, this may provide a positive
effect to change their health behaviors. Tailored SMS are considered to be more effective in PA behavior
change than untailored or generic bulk messages [40]. Autonomy of SMS timing could be part of the
tailored SMS in which it could ﬁt well into the modern daily life pattern or pace in different cities.
4.2. Were the Stages of Motivational Readiness Affected As a Result of the SMS Intervention?
No signiﬁcant change occurred in the stage of motivational readiness over the course of the
intervention among the ﬁve groups. De Bourdeaudhuij and colleagues [35] suggested that stages of PA
behavior change are related to the frequency of encouragement from participants’ family and friends.
The researchers revealed that the adolescents in the pre-contemplation stage reported the least social
support from family and friends. This ﬁnding indicated that more social support and encouragement is
needed to advance these physically inactive adolescents to the contemplation, preparation and action
stages. In this case, SMS could be a desirable option to reach adolescents using a more convenient and
cost-saving approach.
Regarding the SMS delivery timing, this ﬁnding may imply that the participants did not observe
the relevance between the stage of behavior change and the SMS delivery time.
Alternatively,
certain pre-requisites might need to be met before the timing could be meaningful to the participants.
The ﬁnding could also relate to the different stages the participants were at. Because no previous
research attempted to investigate the impact of the timing of SMS delivery on adolescents’ PA behavior,
this question could be further examined in a future study.
4.3. Was There a Difference in Perceived Beneﬁts and Barriers As a Result of the SMS Intervention?
Despite insigniﬁcant results, the beneﬁts/barriers differential score in all the intervention groups
increased, although it decreased in the control group. This ﬁnding may suggest a potential value
of SMS to the adolescents’ PA when considering the exercise beneﬁts and barriers. Additionally,
much larger differences were found in HST for perceived barriers when compared with the small
decrease in the control group. More speciﬁcally, high frequency and self-selected timing had the largest
impact on exercise barriers.
Grubbs and Carter [48] found a signiﬁcant association between exercise beneﬁts and barriers to
individual’s exercise behavior and suggested that a deeper understanding of exercise beneﬁts and
barriers would contribute to the exercise behavior establishment. In the study by Blanchard et al. [49],

9 of 12
the researchers suggested that perceived barriers’ efﬁcacy may produce a more signiﬁcant impact
to explain PA behavior compared with task efﬁcacy. Therefore, the possible effect of high frequency
and self-selected timing of SMS on exercise barriers deserves further study to examine whether
it could produce signiﬁcant behavior change in a longer term intervention. O’Dea [50] suggested
providing more social support, education and information on environment restructuring, planning,
time management, motivation and varieties of PA for the school children to overcome the exercise
barriers. High frequency and self-selected timing of SMS may be the instruments to help achieve this
objective through mHealth technology.
5. Conclusions
To conclude, no signiﬁcant intervention effects were found among the ﬁve groups in PA behavior,
stage of change and exercise beneﬁts and barriers among Hong Kong Chinese adolescents.
According to a systematic review on the health behavioral change and mode of delivery by
e-intervention, Webb and his colleagues [51] suggested that greater use of supplementary modes,
such as SMS, email, telephone, CD-ROM, or videoconferencing, could produce a better intervention
effect. Another review was conducted to investigate the intervention effect of SMS in health behavioral
change studies [52]. The review demonstrated that 29 of 34 SMS studies (85%) found that SMS played
a more signiﬁcant role and produced a positive effect on the participants when combined with internet
and other strategies (e.g., telephone and computer program). The results suggested that the combined
usage of SMS with other behavioral change strategies would produce more signiﬁcant and positive
effects for future interventions. In this case, more combined usage of SMS and other e-intervention
modes of delivery, including computer programs, internet website, and emails, may produce a better
effect on PA behavioral change.
The ﬁndings of this study should be interpreted with caution.
First, this study used the
self-reported data (PAQ-C) from the adolescents, and these data could be overestimated based upon
the self-reported PA literature. Future studies should use the accelerometer to collect the objective
PA data of the adolescents; thus, the analysis and ﬁndings could be more accurate. Second, it was a
small-scaled study (n = 69); therefore, the generalizability of the ﬁndings is limited. Third, the relative
short (4 week) intervention duration of this study may not allow for full conclusions to be drawn
regarding the effects of the frequency and timing of SMS delivery on the adolescents’ PA behavioral
change. Therefore, this issue should be addressed in the future. With the changes of PAQ-C in the
HST and control groups after and before the intervention, power analysis result showed that the
current sample size (n = 13 in the HST group and n = 16 in the control group) only provided the
power of 0.71 at p set as 0.05. Due to the small sample size, this study was underpowered to detect a
signiﬁcant treatment effect. Further research should be conducted in a large representative sample in
more schools and covering all grades to conﬁrm our ﬁndings. Finally, future research may consider
qualitative investigations to elaborate on the relations between the stages of change, perceived beneﬁts
and barriers, and the different frequency and timing of SMS delivery.
