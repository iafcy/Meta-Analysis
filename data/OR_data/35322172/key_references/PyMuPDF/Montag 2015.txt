Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP)
and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our
objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to
Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American
Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California.
Methods: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including
questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or
treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were
followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention.
Results: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having
an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per
week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk
of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no diﬀerence
between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up
included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per
week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired
functionality.
Conclusions: Participation in assessment alone may have been suﬃcient to encourage behavioral
change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in
a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other
women’s drinking and one’s own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.

F
ETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM disorders (FASD), a
range of conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol
exposure, are the leading known cause of preventable
developmental disabilities and learning disabilities. In the
most severe form of FASD, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),
fetal development is so aﬀected as to result in neurobehavior-
al dysfunction, growth restriction, microcephaly, and charac-
teristic facial features (Jones et al., 1973). FASD result in
persistent deﬁcits in cognitive and motor functions including
learning and memory, complex thought, attention, and
motor control, as well as psychosocial behavior (Secretary of
Health and Human Services, 2000; Streissguth et al., 1978).
Less severe forms of FASD are more diﬃcult to identify but
thought to be more prevalent. Speciﬁcally, current estimates
are that FASD aﬀects 2 to 5% of young elementary school
children in the United States and that FAS may aﬀect 0.2 to
0.7% (May et al., 2009). Signiﬁcant variation in FASD prev-
alence among populations is associated with diﬀerences in
magnitude and prevailing patterns of alcohol consumption
as well as variability in how prevalence is measured. In addi-
tion, there may be modiﬁcation of risk by nutritional status,
maternal age, and genetics (May et al., 2011).

ALCOHOLISM: CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
Vol. 39, No. 1
January 2015

There is no known safe level of alcohol consumption dur-
ing pregnancy. A recent study evaluating prenatal alcohol
exposure and a number of outcomes including growth
parameters, facial dysmorphology characteristic of prenatal
alcohol exposure, and minor structural malformations found
a linear relationship and no evidence of a threshold (Sawada
Feldman et al., 2012). A review of well-controlled studies
including 6 published studies examining the eﬀect of low to
moderate alcohol consumption on the cognitive, social, and
emotional development of children found that 4 of the 6
showed an association between prenatal alcohol exposure
and negative outcome (hyperactivity, behavioral problems,
emotional problems, peer relationship problems, and atten-
tion deﬁcit disorder) in children from 3 to 16 years (Holm-
gren, 2009). Despite current controversy (Kesmodel et al.,
2012), there is at best inconclusive evidence of a threshold
and the preponderance of data supports that there is no safe
dose of prenatal alcohol exposure. One reason for the con-
troversy is the diﬃculty involved in teasing out neurobehav-
ioral eﬀects of a particular exposure given the myriad
potential confounders (nutrition, genetics, etc.; Coriale et al.,
2014; May and Gossage, 2011). In 2005, the Surgeon Gen-
eral of the United States issued an advisory for all women
who are pregnant or might become pregnant to not consume
alcohol (Services, 2005).
However, the pattern of prenatal alcohol consumption
associated with the greatest risk of FASD is heavy episodic
drinking or binge drinking (Paintner et al., 2012). Binge
drinking results in higher blood alcohol concentrations
which are associated with greater injury to the fetus. Drink-
ing a greater number of drinks per week or month also
increases the risk of harm (Maier and West, 2001).
Timing of alcohol consumption during pregnancy inﬂu-
ences the type of injury to the fetus; the particular injury is
related to the developmental phase of the fetus at the time of
exposure. A particularly sensitive time for the development
of the brain and some of the characteristic dysmorphology
associated with FAS occurs early in the ﬁrst trimester (Rous-
sotte et al., 2012). This is relevant as more than half of all
pregnancies in the United States are unplanned (Finer and
Zolna, 2011), and many women are unaware they are preg-
nant 4 to 6 weeks postconception (Floyd et al., 1999). To
prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP), it is therefore
important to include all women of childbearing age who may
consume alcohol in prevention/intervention.
While most women reduce or stop drinking alcohol upon
becoming aware that they are pregnant, some groups of
women appear to be at greater risk of continued drinking:
women who are unmarried, unemployed, depressed, risky
drinkers, exposed to violence, or simply confused by health
warning messages and the amount of alcohol their drinks
contain (Havens et al., 2009; Kaskutas, 2000; Skagerstrom
et al., 2011). Drinking during pregnancy is heavily inﬂuenced
by social norms and therefore varies widely among popula-
tions. For example, the percent of women who report drink-
ing alcohol during pregnancy is 0% in Saudi Arabia, 6% in
Sweden (Nilsen et al., 2008), 7.4% in the United States
(Marchetta, 2012), and 34% in New Zealand (Mallard et al.,
2013). Similarly, among the limited populations studied,
drinking during pregnancy among the heterogeneous Ameri-
can Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) populations of the United
States diﬀers signiﬁcantly. May and colleagues (2004) pub-
lished data from a prenatal clinic among Northern Plains
Indians indicating 16.2% of pregnant women consumed
alcohol. Other AIAN studies have reported 36% of urban
and 14% of reservation residing pregnant women consuming
alcohol (Warren et al., 1990) and 53.4% at 1 prenatal clinic
in the Northern Plains (Bad Heart Bull et al., 1999). Risky
prepregnancy drinking is a strong predictor of drinking dur-
ing pregnancy (Ethen et al., 2009). Further exacerbating risk
are associations of binge drinking with increased risk of
unintended pregnancies (Naimi et al., 2003). Within the pop-
ulation addressed in this study, approximately a third of
women between the ages of 18 and 45 years are estimated to
be at risk of having an AEP (Montag et al., unpublished
data).
Eﬀectiveness of FASD prevention strategies implemented
among various AIAN populations was recently reviewed
(Montag et al., 2012). Available evidence suggests that an
eﬀective intervention should strive to include local commu-
nity members in all aspects of the program, create a relevant
and understandable intervention recognizing speciﬁc risk
and protective factors within the community, and address
logistic barriers to participation.
Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
(SBIRT) is a prevention and early intervention approach
that uses wide screening, education and feedback speciﬁc to
the participant, and professional treatment for those identi-
ﬁed by the screening as positive for alcohol abuse problems
(Babor et al., 2007). The latter component, the incorporation
of specialized treatment as warranted, sets the approach
apart from those oﬀering only brief interventions which have
demonstrated largely positive but mixed results (Whitlock
et al., 2004). Some reasons for lack of proven beneﬁt may be
that assessment alone may have a mitigating eﬀect on risky
drinking (although this has been controlled for in some stud-
ies) or that extreme risky drinking may decrease over time
due to “regression toward the mean.” Valuable lessons
learned from Brief Intervention studies include that proto-
cols with multiple contacts are more likely to alter behavior
than single contact protocols (Longabaugh et al., 2001) and
that eﬀectiveness may be related to the severity of the under-
lying condition (Bernstein and Bernstein, 2008). SBIRT has
been used to motivate a reduction in alcohol consumption in
a number of populations including emergency room and
other healthcare setting patients (Madras et al., 2009), col-
lege freshmen (Bezilla, 2010), and WIC participants (Delra-
him-Howlett et al., 2011).
Within the Native American Research Centers for Health
(NARCH) framework, this intervention sought to develop
and test an SBIRT adaptation for reducing risky drinking
in AIAN women of childbearing potential in Southern

California. NARCH is an initiative funded through a
partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
and the Indian Health Service. As a NARCH project, the
overarching goals go beyond the speciﬁc aims of any single
study to address tribally identiﬁed health priorities, reduce
distrust of research by the community, and develop future
competitive AIAN researchers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample Source
The population sample consisted of AIAN women from 18 to
45 years of age, of childbearing potential, recruited from 1 of 3
AIAN health clinics located in Southern California between April
2011 and September 2012. The sample used for each analysis will
vary and is described in association with the particular analysis.
Ethics
This protocol was approved by University of California, San
Diego, San Diego State University, and Southern California Tribal
Health Clinic Institutional Review Boards. A Certiﬁcate of Conﬁ-
dentiality was obtained from the NIH to further protect the conﬁ-
dentiality of participants’ data. All research staﬀcomplete human
research subject protections training.
Recruitment and Study Protocol
Potential participants were approached in waiting areas of health
clinics and screened for eligibility (see Fig. 1 for study ﬂowchart).
Interested and eligible participants were brought to a private room
where, following the consenting procedure, they were assigned a
unique identiﬁcation number, completed a paper-based self-admin-
istered baseline survey, and were randomized into the intervention
or control group. Randomization was accomplished by the research
assistant, in blinded fashion, pulling a label preprinted with either
“intervention” or “control” from a single-study randomizing con-
tainer containing equal numbers of each label. Participants random-
ized into the intervention group completed a web-based survey
which provided personalized feedback including analysis of risk,
advice, and helpful hints that could be printed out in a conﬁdential
manner. Participants randomized into the control group received
“treatment as usual” which consisted of access to displayed educa-
tional brochures about health in the various waiting areas but did
not include speciﬁc FASD information. All participants had the
opportunity to request referral for treatment to a professional sub-
stance abuse counselor. At 1, 3, and 6 months following baseline
assessment, participants were contacted by telephone to complete
follow-up surveys. At each follow-up, participants were again
oﬀered referrals to treatment. Participants were provided incentives
in the form of a $10 gift card and the choice of a fan or T-shirt
emblazoned with the project logo at enrollment and a $15 gift card
following completion of the ﬁnal follow-up questionnaire. Addi-
tional retention incentives were added during the study to improve
follow-up completion rates. Participants received 1 raﬄe ticket rep-
resenting a chance to win a $100 prize for each completed follow-up
interview.
Data Collection
Data were collected on 3 separate occasions during the study: at
recruitment, all participants completed the baseline questionnaire
which is referred to as “assessment,” during the web-based interven-
tion participants randomized into the intervention arm of the study
responded to the web-based questionnaire, and during each follow-
up all participants able to be contacted for follow-up answered
questions in the follow-up questionnaire. A few questions appeared
in both the baseline and web-based questionnaires.
Baseline
Questionnaire.
The
self-administered
questionnaire
included questions regarding current relationship situation, employ-
ment, religiosity, income, gravidity, parity, birth control use, current
use of prescription and nonprescription medications, smoking, ille-
gal drug use, depression and functionality, awareness of FASD,
knowledge regarding the risks of alcohol consumption to women
and to pregnancy, and alcohol consumption including number of
drinks consumed per week and per occasion, and number of binge
episodes in the past 2 weeks (binge deﬁned as consuming ≥3 drinks
per occasion).
Web-Based Questionnaire.
Participants randomized into the
intervention arm of the study self-reported information by com-
puter regarding alcohol consumption over the past 2 weeks, current
use of prescription or nonprescription medications, pregnancy sta-
tus, the age they began drinking alcohol, and contraceptive use.
Illustrations of various alcoholic beverage containers were used to
prompt recall. They were asked to complete a series of true or
false knowledge questions about risks associated with alcohol
consumption.
Follow-Up Questionnaire.
In the follow-up telephone question-
naire, research assistants asked questions regarding current relation-
ship status, pregnancy status, birth control use, and alcohol
consumption, including binge drinking, over the past 2 weeks.
Intervention
eCHECKUP TO GO, a web-based brief assessment and inter-
vention tool based on the e-CHUG web tool developed for college
students by Drs. Van Sickle and Moyer at San Diego State Univer-
sity, was tailored to the population participating in this study
(Gorman et al., 2013; Venner et al., 2007). Participants answered
questions in a conﬁdential manner at their own pace and received
individualized web-based feedback at the end of the session regard-
ing their risk for an AEP, the impact of alcohol exposure to the
fetus, the physical and ﬁnancial cost of their alcohol consumption,
and how their drinking compared with that of other Native women.
A resource page at the end of the web session provided information
on resources for additional information or assistance and could be

Study Measures
The “Vulnerability to Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy” variable was
deﬁned in 2 categories: not at high risk and at high risk. Being “at
high risk” for an AEP was deﬁned as (i) currently drinking 3 or
more standard drinks per occasion and/or 8 or more standard
drinks per week and (ii) using a less than a highly eﬀective contra-
ceptive method. We deﬁned “binge” or “risky” drinking as 3 or

more standard drinks per occasion and/or 8 or more drinks per
week as, despite being a nonstandard deﬁnition, this level of con-
sumption has been deﬁned as either risky for women or predictive
of risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in other studies (May et al.,
2013). We deﬁned standard drinks as shown in Fig. 2.
Participants were asked to indicate which form(s) of contracep-
tion they used from a list. Responses were categorized by eﬀective-
ness.
Contraceptive
eﬀectiveness
was
deﬁned
as:
High
(<1
pregnancy per 100 women per year), Medium High (2 to 9 pregnan-
cies per 100 women per year), Medium Low (15 to 24 pregnancies
per 100 women per year), and Low (≥25 pregnancies per 100 women
per year) (WHO, 2011).
The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to
measure depression and functionality (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002).
Depression variables derived from this measure included treatment
recommendation for depression (treatment recommended or not
recommended), minor depression (yes/no), major depression (yes/
no), and functionality (impaired or not impaired).
As only the intervention group responded to the web-based ques-
tions, questions from the paper-based baseline questionnaire were
used in the analysis where possible. However, where a question in
the intervention group was left blank in the paper questionnaire, the
web-based answer was used. Primary outcome variables included
the number of drinks consumed per week, the number of binge
episodes over the past 2 weeks, and vulnerability to AEP.
Statistical Analyses
Comparisons were conducted using t-tests (continuous), chi-
square (dichotomous), Fisher’s exact test (dichotomous with small
cell sizes), and nonparametric analyses (for data not normally dis-
tributed and not transformed). Normality in continuous variables
was investigated through skewness and kurtosis. Analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) was used to examine associations among popula-
tion characteristics. The vulnerability to AEP outcome variable was
tested as dichotomous (“at high risk” vs. “not at high risk”). Change
over time analyses were conducted in 2 ways: (i) using only the
subjects available at all follow-ups and (ii) multiple imputation
methods. Linear regression was used to test reduction of some
drinking parameters from baseline. Repeated ANOVA or mixed-
model methods were used to estimate individual change over time
and compare trajectories. Change was assessed in 2 ways: (i) using a
dichotomous scale where participants were improved or not and (ii)
using a 3 category system where participants were categorized as
improved, remaining not at risk, and remaining at risk or at
increased risk. Regression was used to test for predictors of positive
change. First, each predictor was tested to determine whether there
were signiﬁcant independent associations with that 1 factor and
change. Then, multiple regression analysis was used examine all
variables previously found to be signiﬁcant. All 2-way interactions
among signiﬁcant variables were tested.
Additional analyses explored the eﬀect of the intervention on
high-risk drinkers alone, the eﬀect of missing (or completing) a fol-
low-up session on ﬁnal outcome, diﬀerences between participants
lost to follow-up and remaining participants, and the eﬀect of con-
trolling for baseline drinking or risk status on ﬁnal outcome.
Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as 2-sided, p-value of <0.05.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (PASW 18; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL).
RESULTS
A total of 263 women were recruited into the study; of
these, 16 (6.1%) were lost to follow-up. Figure 3 shows the
study recruitment diagram. Baseline characteristics of the
sample population are shown in Table 1 by randomized
group. Randomized groups were similar in all aspects with
the exception of a higher percent of women in the control
group having previously had a child.
Alcohol consumption and related variables were not dif-
ferent between randomized groups at baseline (Table 2) nor

was contraceptive use (Table 3) or vulnerability to AEP
(Table 4). Half of participants reported not currently drink-
ing any alcohol. Among those currently consuming alcohol,
there was a high proportion of binge drinkers (84%). The
social norm, that is, perception of other women’s drinking,
on average was reported as 4 drinks per drinking occasion.
Figure 3A-C show changes over time in various measure-
ments: (i) number drinks consumed per week, (ii) number
binge episodes in past 2 weeks, and (iii) at high risk for AEP.
Regardless of variable, all outcomes show a statistically sig-
niﬁcant time eﬀect but no intervention eﬀect. Full data for
primary outcome variables over time, mean (SE) or %, may
be accessed in Table S1.
Predictors of change (variables associated with a decrease
in alcohol consumption) are shown in Tables 4 and 5: need-
ing treatment for depression (or feeling that their functional-
ity was impaired), thinking other women drink more, and
experiencing more binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, were
associated with reduced alcohol consumption. Table 5 shows
predictors of change when model is adjusted for baseline
alcohol consumption. In this study, depression and function-
ality variables often functioned similarly in analyses. Many
women in our study expressed surprise regarding both other
women’s drinking (that half do not drink) and their own
(that they were engaging in binge drinking).
DISCUSSION
In this randomized controlled study, risky drinking behav-
ior and vulnerability to AEP were reduced in both the inter-
vention and control groups. For each primary outcome
variable (number drinks per week, number binge episodes
per 2 weeks, vulnerability to AEP), there was evidence of a
time eﬀect but no statistically signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect.
Eﬀects were sustained over the 6-month follow-up period.
Assessment reactivity (particularly in participants already
considering change), regression to the mean, and eﬀects
related to our mixed mode design may have contributed to
the reduction in alcohol consumption in the control group.
Our ﬁndings emphasize the need to include control groups in
similar studies. In controlled studies, similar eﬀects are not
uncommon observations (Bernstein et al., 2010). The ﬁnding
that assessment, in and of itself, is associated with a positive
change in behavior has important implications for future
interventions in this population. An assessment strategy may
prove appropriate in situations where more time-intensive
approaches are impractical.
American Indian/Alaska Native tribes vary signiﬁcantly
in alcohol consumption (May and Gossage, 2001a; Spic-
er et al., 2003). Our ﬁndings regarding the pattern of
drinking among our participants supports previous work
by May and Gossage (2001b), among others, where binge
drinking is the primary pattern of drinking among a

PREVENTING ALCOHOL-EXPOSED PREGNANCY

number of AIAN populations. Overestimation of other
women’s
alcohol
consumption
may
contribute
to
increased drinking (Dunnagan et al., 2007) and increased
perception of risks associated with drinking may reduce
consumption (Testa and Reifman, 1996). Social norms
that tolerate risky drinking may prevent women from rec-
ognizing and addressing problems. According to the 2007
National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the vast major-
ity of people needing treatment for alcohol abuse were
unaware that they needed it (Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration, 2008). Nonetheless,
attempts to shift social norms relating to alcohol con-
sumption have been used in interventions among non-
AIAN populations with mixed results (Clapp et al., 2003;
Lewis and Neighbors, 2006). The present results indicate
that, among AIAN women in our source group, interven-
tions addressing social norms may prove eﬀective. Find-
ings support narrow social norms among variables such
as drinks per occasion among drinkers, drinks needed to
feel tipsy, and age at ﬁrst drink. These variables were not
diﬀerent among groups with diﬀerent vulnerability to
AEP. The perception of how much other women drink
was an important predictor of reduced drinking during
follow-up.
In addition to perceiving social norms of higher alcohol
consumption, the present study revealed 2 other predictors
of reduction in alcohol use: testing positive for depression
or impaired functionality and a greater number of binge
drinking episodes over a 2-week period. Treatment for
depression was recommended for a third of the women in
our sample (36%). This proportion is striking when com-
pared to the prevalence of depression among U.S. women
(14% in 2006) (Farr et al., 2010) and among 2,289 adult
Alaska Native women (20%) (Dillard et al., 2012) mea-
sured using the same PHQ-9 instrument. In women, as
opposed to men, depression appears to predate alcohol
problems (Helzer and
Pryzbeck,
1988). Screening
for
depression may facilitate identiﬁcation of women vulnera-
ble to AEP. Furthermore, addressing depression in this
population may be a helpful independent approach to pre-
venting FASD.
The ﬁnding that a greater magnitude of change was pre-
dicted by higher number of binge episodes at baseline is
somewhat unexpected in that the strategy of SBIRT is geared
toward a broader population of relatively lower risk. How-
ever, recognition of the extent of one’s binge drinking may
be sobering (and motivating) for women who are more likely
to frequently binge drink.
Controlling for baseline alcohol consumption only served
to improve the predictive power of our model (adjusted R2
increased to 78.9%). In addition, binge drinking, perception
of social norms, and depression/functionality were consis-
tently predictive of primary variable change at each follow-
up time point. Variables that were, perhaps unexpectedly,
not signiﬁcantly predictive of change were age, smoking,
income, illegal drug use, and religiosity.

Previous research has found that the eﬀect of an interven-
tion may be intensiﬁed or extended by multiple contacts
(Longabaugh et al., 2001). In the present study, whether or
not the 1-month follow-up contact was completed did not
aﬀect the 3- or 6-month follow-up results (data not shown).
Similarly, missing the 3-month follow-up did not aﬀect ﬁnd-
ings in the 6-month follow-up.
The present intervention did not include a contraceptive
intervention component beyond assessment. Contraceptive
use was not diﬀerent among treatment groups or follow-up
time points. As vulnerability to AEP may be decreased by
preventing pregnancy as well as preventing risky drinking,
this would be a valuable addition to future interventions.
Relevant
examples
of
such
interventions
are
project
CHOICES (Floyd et al., 2007) and EARLY (Ingersoll et al.,
2013). It is of note that exposure to the EARLY intervention
was associated with a greater change in contraceptive use
than in alcohol consumption (Ingersoll et al., 2013).
Limitations and Strengths
Participants in this study were self-selected volunteers so
that it is unknown to what extent they represent the entire
population of women of reproductive potential in these set-
tings. However, we recruited potential subjects at various
locations and publicized the study broadly. Our randomiza-
tion procedure was ﬂawed in that the number of binary
choices that could be pulled by the research assistants was
larger than the number of participants ultimately recruited.
This may have contributed to the greater number of partici-
pants in the control group (n = 142) compared to the Inter-
vention group (n = 121). Another limitation was that data
were self-reported and therefore not feasible to validate.
“Social presence” may have played a role as the self-admin-
istered paper-based and web-based questionnaires were
completed with a researcher in the same room. Therefore, it
is possible that participants may have under- or over
reported sensitive behaviors due to social acceptability/
desirability.
In addition, a mixed mode design for data collection was
used where baseline data was collected using a paper- and
pencil-based format and follow-up data were obtained by
telephone interview. Participants randomized to the interven-
tion, completed an additional web-based survey where a sub-
set of questions were repeated from the baseline survey. We
compared responses on questions that occurred in both the
paper-based and web-based modes and found no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences.
We sought to minimize these potential biases by assuring
participants of conﬁdentiality, using well-trained interview-
ers who were community members, establishing private envi-
ronments for all data collection modes, using equivalent
questions across modes, and ensuring that participants could
ask questions or request clariﬁcation of questions in all
modes.
Not all participants completed all follow-up interviews.
Missing follow-up data may introduce bias but, whether data
were analyzed using only complete data sets, all available
data, or using multiple imputation methods, the results did
not diﬀer.
Alcohol consumption data were collected in increments of
2 weeks; a relatively short time period selected for obtaining
the most precise data on daily drinking habits. As the num-
ber of drinks consumed per occasion (or drinking day)
remained relatively consistent and reductions in risky drink-
ing were largely due to changes in the frequency of drinking
days, the brief assessment period may have introduced bias.
This threat to validity could be lessened in future studies by
expanding the assessment time periods.
As mentioned above with regard to the control group,
regression to the mean may be a possible explanation for our
ﬁndings. Possible distortion of results due to the Hawthorne
eﬀect could not be ruled out as participants were informed
by the consent form that there would be follow-up calls
within a 6-month period.
Initial and continuing eﬀorts to gain the support of the
community and to ensure conﬁdentiality increased participa-
tion and retention. All recruitment and data collection were

carried out by trusted community members trained as
research assistants. Approval and support of the Tribal IRB
was obtained. Eﬀorts were made to adapt the SBIRT inter-
vention to make it as relevant and understandable to this
particular community as possible.
Implications for Prevention
Our ﬁnding that assessment alone, even without interven-
tion, may be suﬃcient to decrease risky drinking and vulner-
ability to AEP indicate a value to providing assessment even
if time constraints prevent an accompanying intervention.
Furthermore, the study supports targeted interventions for
AIAN women who currently drink alcohol that incorporate
eﬀorts to shift cultural norms, recognition of depression, and
assessment of alcohol consumption and vulnerability to
AEP.
