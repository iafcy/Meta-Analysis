Dulce Digital: An mHealth SMS-
Based Intervention Improves
Glycemic Control in Hispanics
With Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care 2017;40:1349–1355 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-0230
OBJECTIVE
Type 2 diabetes is growing in epidemic proportions and disproportionately affects
lower-income, diverse communities. Text messaging may provide one of the most
rapid methods to overcome the “digital divide” to improve care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A randomized, nonblinded, parallel-groups clinical trial design allocated N = 126 low-
income, Hispanic participants with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes to receive the
Dulce Digital intervention or usual care (UC). Dulce Digital participants received up to
three motivational, educational, and/or call-to-action text messages per day over
6 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c; lipids, blood pressure, and BMI were
secondary outcomes. Satisfaction and acceptability were evaluated via focus groups
and self-report survey items.
RESULTS
The majority of patients were middle-aged (mean age 48.43 years, SD 9.80), female
(75%), born in Mexico (91%), and uninsured (75%) and reported less than a ninth-
grade education level (73%) and mean baseline HbA1c 9.5% (80 mmol/mol), SD 1.3,
and fasting plasmaglucose 187.17 mg/dL, SD 64.75. A statisticallysigniﬁcant time-by-
group interaction effect indicated thatthe Dulce Digitalgroup achieved a signiﬁcantly
greater reduction in HbA1c over time compared with UC (P = 0.03). No statistically
signiﬁcant effects were observed for secondary clinical indicators. The number of
blood glucose values texted in by participants was a statistically signiﬁcant predictor
of month 6 HbA1c (P < 0.05). Satisfaction and acceptability ratings for the Dulce
Digital intervention were high.
CONCLUSIONS
Use of a simple, low-cost text messaging program was found to be highly acceptable
in this sample of high-risk, Hispanic individuals with type 2 diabetes and resulted in
greater improvement in glycemic control compared with UC.
Type 2 diabetes is growing in epidemic proportions in the U.S. and worldwide. The
International Diabetes Federation estimates that by 2040 there will be 642 million
people living with diabetes worldwide, an increase of .50% compared with the pre-
sent day (1). The U.S. has the highest prevalence of diabetes among developed nations
(i.e., 11% of the population between 20 and 79 years of age) (1), and individuals of
ethnic/minority and low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected (2,3). A

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS

recent study (4) in the 26 states and Dis-
trict of Columbia that expanded Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act found that
diabetes diagnoses increased by 23% in
2014 compared with the previous year.
Hispanic individuals in the U.S. experience
higher rates of type 2 diabetes and, once
diagnosed, exhibit poorer glycemic control
than non-Hispanic white individuals (3,5).
Diabetes self-management education
(DSME)andsupportisaneffectivemethod
toimprove clinicaland cost outcomes(6,7)
and can be successfully tailored for ethni-
cally diverse populations (e.g., Philis-
Tsimikas et al. [8]). However, many at-risk
individuals are unable to access DSME
and support because of practical (e.g.,
work, transportation, caregiving) and
health care access barriers (9–12). In
fact, in 2012 only 4.7% of the 21 million
people with diagnosed diabetes accessed
any accredited DSME program (9). To im-
prove patient and practice performance
outcomes, alternative methods must efﬁ-
ciently and effectively extend the reach of
the care team to those in need of addi-
tional support to reach clinical targets.
The widespread adoption of mobile
phone technologies, including among
low-income and older adults (13), high-
lights the potential for mobile health
(mHealth) technology to circumvent the
practical barriers inherent to traditional
(e.g., face-to-face) visits.
Short messaging service (SMS), or text
messaging, is among the most frequently
used mobile communication methods and
has been adopted by an estimated three-
quarters of mobile users worldwide (14).
Text messaging is simple to implement
and may provide one of the most rapid
methods to overcome the recently impli-
catedlimitationofthe “digital divide” (15)
to improve care. In the U.S., texting among
adults in 2011 was higher among Hispanics
(83%) and African Americans (76%) than
among non-Hispanic whites (70%) (16).
Ninety-nine percent of received text mes-
sages are opened, and 90% are read within
3 min of receipt (17). Thus, text messaging
represents an opportunity to provide fre-
quent, daily, low-cost, and interactive
communication that could prove ben-
eﬁcial for population-level diabetes
interventions.
Recent research syntheses have shown
that mHealth interventions improve ad-
herence and clinical control in patients
with type 2 diabetes (18–20). However,
most studies were small and nonrandom-
ized and resulted in limited clinical improve-
ments (20–23). Further, few studies have
examined the implications of integrating
these mHealth technologies into care or
the feasibility and acceptability of such
approaches in underserved populations
(19,24). The current study addresses
these gaps by investigating the glycemic
beneﬁt and acceptability of a culturally
tailored, SMS-based DSME and support
intervention (Dulce Digital) among under-
served Hispanics with poor control in fed-
erally qualiﬁed health centers in Southern
California.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Sample and Setting
Between October 2012 and February
2014, 126 individuals consented and en-
rolled into the Dulce Digital study (Fig. 1).
The sample included Spanish-speaking
and English-speaking Hispanic men
and women, 18–75 years of age, who
were uninsured or underinsured (Medic-
aid) and had type 2 diabetes and poor
glycemic control (as indicated by an
HbA1c level of $7.5% [58 mmol/mol]).
Individuals with plans to move outside
the region and those with a severe phys-
ical or mental condition that would inter-
fere with participation were excluded.
Participants were recruited from clinic
sites within Neighborhood Healthcare, a
network of federally qualiﬁed health cen-
ters in San Diego and Riverside counties

individuals of an ethnic/racial minority.
All procedures were approved by the
Scripps Health Institutional ReviewBoard.
Study Design and Intervention
The intervention was tested using a
parallel-groups, nonblinded, randomized
design. Blocked random assignment with
equal allocation was used to assign par-
ticipantstoDulceDigitalorusualcare(UC),
using a randomly generated numbers
sequence. Participants were informed
of group assignment after the baseline
assessment.
At the baseline visit, all participants
viewed a 15-min diabetes educational
video developed by Scripps. All partici-
pants received a blood glucose meter
(OneTouchVerioMeter;LifeScan,Inc.,Mil-
pitas, CA), testing strips, and instructions
on use. A physical assessment with fasting
venous blood draw and study question-
naires were completed at baseline, month
3, and month 6. Assessments were per-
formed by trained, bilingual research assis-
tants at clinic sites in English and Spanish.
Participants received an incentive at each
assessmentandcontinuedtoreceiveUCat
the clinic for the study duration. UC ser-
vicesavailableto all patientsincluded visits
with a primary care physician, certiﬁed di-
abeteseducator,andgroupDSME,although
the use of the services was dependent on
physician and patient initiative.
After randomization, participants as-
signed to Dulce Digital (n = 63) were pro-
vided with instructions on how to receive
and send text messages. Participants who
did not have a cell phone with texting
capability were provided one (Kajeet,
Inc., McLean, VA) (n = 22) at no cost for
the duration of the study. Participants us-
ing their own phones had the costs of the
additional texts covered by the study
($12/month). Content for the text mes-
sages was primarily derived from our cul-
turally appropriate DSME curriculum
(Project Dulce), which has been shown
to improve clinical, behavioral, and cost
outcomes in this population and others
(8,25,26). In addition to the core educa-
tional messages derived from Project
Dulce (e.g., “Use small plates! Portions
will look larger and you may feel more sat-
isﬁed after eating.”), the Dulce Digital in-
tervention provided ongoing support via
motivational messages (e.g., “It takes a
team! Get the support you needdfamily,
friends and support groups can help you
to succeed.”),medicationreminders (e.g.,
“Tick, tock. Take your medication at the
same time every day!”), and blood glu-
cose monitoring prompts (e.g., “Time to
check your blood sugar. Please text back
your results.”). All content was converted
into 119 brief, #160 character, text mes-
sage–friendly format and sent out via a
contracted patient health management
technology platform (Rip Road LLC, New
York, NY). Two to three messages a day
were sent at study start, with frequency
tapering over 6 months. Message timing
was standardized across all participants
and correlated with traditional meal or
testing times. Blood glucose–monitoring
prompts encouraged participants to text
messageintheir nextobserved value; one
value $250or#70mg/dL orthree values
between 181 and 250 mg/dL prompted
a bilingual study coordinator to call the
participant to assess possible reasons
for hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia and to
encourage as-needed follow-up with
providers. The study coordinator also
contacted the participant if there was
no blood glucose value sent in for
1 week. Medical management was not
provided by the coordinator.
Demographic and Outcome Measures
Participants self-reported sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Information re-
garding prescribed medications was
extracted from electronic health records.
HbA1c and lipids (total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyc-
erides) were conducted by the laborato-
ries of Quest Diagnostics (West Hills, CA),
which adhere to guidelines set forth by
the College of American Pathologists. Sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure were
measured with a standardized protocol
according to guidelines using a standard
digital sphygmomanometer (HEM-907XL;
Omron). Body weight and height were
measured using a traditional balance
scale and stadiometer to the nearest 0.1
lb and 0.2 inch, respectively. Finally, Dulce
Digital participants (only) completed self-
report items at the month 6 assessment
visit to evaluate intervention feasibility
and acceptability. To obtain further detail
regarding participants’ perceptions of
Dulce Digital, two 90-min focus groups
were conducted witha randomly selected
20% of intervention group participants.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, version
23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and
Hierarchical Linear and Nonlinear Model-
ing software (HLM7; Scientiﬁc Software
International, Lincolnwood, IL) by A.L.F.
Descriptive statistics were obtained, and
distributions were examined for normal-
ity. The triglyceride variable was signiﬁ-
cantly skewed as was the natural log
transformed to normalize the distribu-
tion; however, because no appreciable
differences between analyses using trans-
formed versus untransformed variables
were observed, results are presented for
untransformed data only.
Mixed models were used to examine
whether the two groups evidenced differ-
ential rates of change over time for HbA1c
and secondary outcomes (i.e., time-by-
group interactions). To evaluate a possi-
ble dosage effect on the primary outcome
in Dulce Digital, the number of text mes-
sages and the number and duration of
studycoordinatorphone calls were exam-
ined as predictors of month 6 HbA1c level
while controlling for baseline HbA1c level.
All analyses controlled for age and sex.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
The majority of patients were middle-
aged, female, born in Mexico, and unin-
sured and reported less than aninth-grade
education (Table 1). At baseline, the over-
all sample (N = 126) exhibited poor glyce-
mic control (mean HbA1c 9.5% [80 mmol/
mol], SD 1.3; fasting plasma glucose
187.17 mg/dL, SD 64.75); mean lipid val-
ues were close to target, and blood pres-
sure averages were in the normal range.
No between-group differences were ob-
served in clinical outcomes at baseline
(P values .0.10).
Thirteen (10.3%) participants were lost
to follow-up (Fig. 1). At baseline, these
participants reported higher annual in-
comes (P = 0.002) and were less likely to
own a cell phone (P = 0.04) than those
who completed at least one follow-up
assessment; no other statistically signiﬁ-
cant differences were observed (P values
.0.05).
Clinical Control Outcomes
Using an intent-to-treat approach, all
N = 126 participants were included in
multilevel modeling analyses examining
differences in the rates of change over
time between the groups. Group means
for all indicators at baseline, month 3, and
month 6 are shown in Table 2. A statisti-
cally signiﬁcant time-by-group interaction

effect was observed for the primary out-
come, HbA1c (P = 0.03), indicating that
Dulce Digital exhibited greater improve-
ment in glycemic control across time
compared with UC (Fig. 2A). The Dulce
Digital group exhibited a signiﬁcantly
lower mean HbA1c level compared with
UC at both month 3 (8.5 6 1.2% [69.0 6
13.1 mmol/mol] vs. 9.3 6 1.9% [78.0 6
20.8 mmol/mol], P = 0.03) and month
6 (8.5 6 1.2% [69.0 6 13.1 mmol/mol]
vs. 9.4 6 2.0% [78.0 6 20.8 mmol/mol],
P = 0.03), after controlling for baseline
HbA1c. No signiﬁcant time-by-group inter-
action effects were observed for any
other clinical indicators. Because of signif-
icant group differences in the number of
individuals prescribed oral (P = 0.03) and
injectable (P = 0.02) antihyperglycemic
agents at baseline (Table 1), these vari-
ables were examined as covariates in
HbA1canalyses. Neithermedicationstatus
at baseline nor changes in medications
over the 6-month period altered the re-
sults. Further, the proportion of individu-
als who received medication changes
during the study did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly between Dulce Digital (n = 37;
51%) and UC (n = 32; 59%; P = 0.38).
Dosage-Effect Analyses
Participants in the Dulce Digital interven-
tion received an average of 354.17 text
messages (SD 44.94); variation is attribut-
able to a small number of participants
(n = 6) who chose to discontinue receiving
texts prior to the end of the study and to
receiving additional texts during the
1-month window for completing the ﬁnal
studyvisit.Participantstextedback3–352
blood glucose values (mean 57.77 blood
glucose values, SD 60.01). The number of
blood glucose values texted in by partici-
pants predicted month 6 HbA1c (P = 0.03);
with each additional blood glucose value
sent in, an additional 0.006 decrease in
HbA1c level was observed at month
6 (Fig. 2B). The number of text messages
sent out to participants was not a signif-
icant predictor of month 6 HbA1c levels
(P = 0.28). Nineteen of 63 (30%) partici-
pants in the Dulce Digital intervention
received phone calls from the study coor-
dinator in response to out-of-range blood
glucose values. For these n = 19 partici-
pants, the number of coordinator phone
contacts ranged from 3 to 13 calls/
participant (mean 7.63 calls, SD 2.81);
the modal call duration was 5 min. Nei-
ther the number nor the total duration of
coordinator phone calls per participant
predicted month 6 HbA1c levels (P values
.0.05).
Feasibility and Acceptability
In response to the subset of self-report
items administered in the Dulce Digital
group (only) at month 6, the vast majority
of participants indicated that the text
messages helped them to manage their
diabetes “a lot” (96%), that they would
continue receiving Dulce Digital text mes-
sages if given the choice (96%), and that
they would recommend Dulce Digital to a
friend or family member with diabetes
(97%). Consistent with these ﬁndings, fo-
cus group participants (n = 12) indicated
high acceptability; common themes that
emerged indicated that text messages
were sufﬁcient in frequency and easy to
understand. However, individuals who
were provided with a separate study
phone reported that it was inconvenient
to carry two phones.
CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst random-
ized controlled trial using a text message–
based DSME and support intervention to
demonstrate signiﬁcantly greater impro-
vements in glycemic control compared
with UC in a high-risk, underserved, His-
panic population. These ﬁndings suggest
that, if implemented on a wider scale,
simple, low-cost, text message–based
mHealth approaches such as Dulce Digital
have the potential to achieve a signiﬁcant
public health beneﬁt in diabetes, a
chronic health condition that is rapidly in-
creasing in the Hispanic and other under-
served populations.
In this study, all patients had an initial
HbA1c level $7.5%, with the majority
(61.9%) exhibiting an HbA1c level $9%,

Texting Intervention in Hispanics With Diabetes

thus placing them at high risk for diabetes
complications. The Dulce Digital group
mean did not reach the optimal level
of ,7.0–7.5%. However, during the
6-month intervention, 68% of Dulce Digi-
tal participants achieved reductions in
HbA1c levels, with individual decreases
ranging from 20.1% to 24.6%. Overall,
Dulce Digital achieved a mean 1% reduc-
tion in HbA1c, which exceeds the average
effect size reported in reviews of other
mHealth approaches (pooled HbA1cD =
20.5%) (18–20) and the average HbA1c
reduction reported in a recent synthesis
of 118 traditional DSME trials (average
HbA1cD = 0.74%) (27). Baseline HbA1c lev-
els in the reviewed studies ranged from
near normal (6.5%) to extremely elevated
(9.8%), which is similar to the results of
our study.Inone reviewfromGreenwood
et al. (28), it was noted, unsurprisingly,
that when study participants’ mean base-
line HbA1c level was at or close to goal, a
small intervention effect was seen. The
relationship of the baseline HbA1c level
to the intervention effect demonstrates
the importance of choosing the optimal
population for interventions. With the
current broad use of diabetes registries
and the ease of identifying higher-risk
individuals using population health man-
agement methods, it may be worthwhile
to focus initial efforts of technology inter-
ventions in our higher-risk patients. An
HbA1c reduction of the magnitude found
in the current study should not be under-
estimated and should be considered not
only statistically signiﬁcant but also
clinically relevant; it rivals the effects
of some glucose-lowering medications
(29–31) and has been associated with
decreased risk for retinopathy, nephrop-
athy, and neuropathy (32–34).
Notably, the number of blood glucose
values texted in by participants predicted
month 6 HbA1c values. Individuals who
sent in more blood glucose values may
have been more actively engaged with
the intervention (and were thus reading
more of the DSME messages) and/or
more active participants in their health.
Nonetheless, additional research is needed
to reach conclusions about the mechanism
underlying this relationship. Results did not
indicate a signiﬁcant “dosage” effect be-
tween text message frequency and HbA1c
level. However, further research is war-
ranted to determine the “optimal” fre-
quency of texts, acknowledging that
optimization will likely need to be individ-
ualized according to each patient’s
unique needs and preferences. Similarly,
the number of phone contacts with the
study coordinator (in response to blood
glucose values) did not predict month
6 HbA1c levels. This ﬁnding is not surpris-
ing given the brief, safety-focused nature
ofthese calls; thecoordinator did not pro-
vide health coaching or in-depth clinical
guidance but rather assessed for emer-
gent safety risks and recommended phy-
sician follow-up as appropriate.
No statistically signiﬁcant intervention
effects were observed for secondary clin-
ical indicators. However, this may be due
to the fact that, on average, blood pres-
sure and lipids were close to target levels
at baseline, leaving little room for im-
provement. Further, the Dulce Digital
content was not designed to address lipid
or blood pressure control.
The current results should be inter-
pretedinthecontextofseverallimitations.
First, although attrition was comparable to
that observed in prior studies (35), attri-
tion was higher in the intervention group
relative to the UC group. Thus, it is possi-
ble that participants who remained in the
study were more engaged. A worst-case
scenario sensitivity analysis is presented
in Supplement A. Second, it is unknown
how much of the intervention content was
received (i.e., read or comprehended) by
participants. Nonetheless, the number of
blood glucose values texted in may be con-
strued as an indirect indicator of interven-
tion engagement. Third, 44% of potentially
eligible individuals were enrolled, with the

majority reporting practical barriers that
arecommonlyexperiencedinunderserved
populations (e.g., no transportation, work
conﬂict, caregiving responsibilities, other
time conﬂict). Thus, it is expected that by
introducing the Dulce Digital program as
part of routine clinic care, program reach
could be expanded to individuals who
could not attend additional (research-
required) visits. Finally, this trial was not
designed to examine cost-effectiveness.
However, with respect to sustainability
and scalability of an intervention such as
Dulce Digital compared with other low-
resource settings, the promise of text mes-
sage–based programs is great. There is no
additional cost for the technical infra-
structure whether it is delivered to
400 or 4,000 individuals. The cost to the
patient/user is only related to the text
messages, and for Dulce Digital (in partic-
ular) a smartphone is not required. In
other research, a signiﬁcant population-
level cost savings was attributed to a text-
messaging program designed to facilitate
diabetes care coordination in a predomi-
nantly African American population (22).
This study included a care management
component facilitated by nurses or med-
ical assistants.
Dulce Digital offers a potential solution
to the burgeoning primary care demand-
capacity imbalance to better address the
complex needs of the growing number of
individuals with type 2 diabetes. Text-
messaging approaches are attractive as a
chronic disease public health intervention
for a number of reasons, including their
frequent use, enormous reach, low cost,
and relative simplicity. Mobile phone and
texting use is high among Hispanics (16), a
group that experiences disparate diabe-
tes prevalence and outcomes. Moreover,
the present investigation indicated that
the Dulce Digital approach was highly ac-
ceptable in this population. This model is
ﬂexible, lending itself to adaptation for
other chronic conditions (e.g., arthritis,
chronic pain) and for delivery by other
personnel to address the health needs
of underserved populations across the na-
tion. Future investigations should examine
the sustainability of the improvements
in glycemic control beyond 6 months;
expanding intervention content to target
additional populations at risk for diabetes
and other cardiometabolic indicators that
are central to diabetes control (e.g., blood
pressure, lipids); and individualizing text
message content and delivery timing and
frequency to each patient’s unique needs
and progress.

Figure 2—A: HbA1c means and 95% CIs for the DulceDigital and UC groups atbaseline, month3, and
month6. B: Association between the numberofblood glucose valuestexted in by participantswitha
change in HbA1c level from baseline to month 6 in the Dulce Digital group. Values adjacent to error
bars represent the mean number of texts for each quintile. Note: The texting variable was analyzed
as a continuous variable but was binned into quintiles for graphical presentation. Although HbA1c
change is represented on the y-axis for ease of interpretation, the month 6 HbA1c level was used as
the outcome variable (with control for baseline HbA1c level) in regression analyses. Because of the
curvilinear appearance of this relationship, the texting predictor was also examined using a qua-
dratic term; however, the quadratic variable was not statistically signiﬁcant.
