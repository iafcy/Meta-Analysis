Abstract
Objective: Text messaging interventions are effective. Despite high utilization of smartphones, 
few studies evaluate text messaging for cessation in middle-/lower-income countries. Initiating 
tobacco treatment in hospitals is an effective but underutilized approach for reaching smokers. We 
evaluated a hybrid phone counseling/text messaging intervention for supporting cessation among 
hospitalized smokers in Brazil.
Methods: We used an experimental design to assess the feasibility and potential effect size of the 
intervention. Participants (N = 66) were recruited from a university hospital and randomized in a 
2:1 ratio into TXT (one session of telephone counseling plus 2 weeks of text messaging; N = 44) 
or Standard Care control group (N = 22). Participants lost to follow-up were counted as smokers.
Results: Counselors sent 1186 texts, of which 924 (77.9%) were received by study participants. 
Participants rated the TXT content as “helpful” (80.4%) and the phone counseling length to be “just 
right” (95.1%). Although the study was not powered to evaluate abstinence rates, we did observe 
a higher prevalence of abstinence in the TXT compared to control group at both 1-month follow-up 
(25.0% vs. 9.1%) and 3-month follow-up (31.8% vs. 9.1%). Carbon monoxide-verified abstinence at 
month 3 was also higher in TXT (20.5% vs. 4.5%).
Conclusions: This hybrid telephone/text intervention should progress to full-scale effectiveness 
testing as it achieved favorable outcomes, was acceptable to participants, and was readily imple-
mented. This type of intervention has strong potential for expanding the reach of hospital-initiated 
tobacco treatment in middle-/lower-income countries.
Implications: This study extends research on hospital-initiated smoking cessation by establishing 
the feasibility of a novel text-messaging approach for post-discharge follow-up. Text messaging is 
a low-cost alternative to proactive telephone counseling that could help overcome resource barri-
ers in middle- and lower-income countries. This hybrid texting/counseling intervention identified 
smokers in hospitals, established rapport through a single telephone follow-up, and expanded 

acceptability and reach of later support by using text-messaging, which is free of charge in this and 
other low-income countries. The favorable cessation outcomes achieved by the hybrid intervention 
provide support for a fully powered effectiveness trial.
Introduction
Brazil is a world leader in comprehensive tobacco control and has 
achieved a dramatic decline in smoking rates from 34.8% in 1989 
to 15% in 2014.1 Regardless, Brazil still has 21.9 million tobacco 
users,2 and in 2015 was listed among the top 10 countries with the 
largest number of total smokers.1 Brazil’s public health system pro-
vides free medication and behavioral support for cessation3 and has 
guidelines for hospital-based tobacco treatment. To date, however, 
only one Brazilian study has evaluated a hospital-initiated tobacco 
intervention. It compared a 30-minute in-hospital intervention plus 
seven telephone post-discharge calls versus a single 15-minute in-
hospital session and found nonsignificant differences in self-reported 
quit rates (44.9% vs. 41.7%, respectively).4
Hospital-initiated cessation intervention must continue after dis-
charge in order to be effective.5 Telephone counseling is a common 
strategy to provide this support.6,7 Communication methods have 
advanced rapidly since publication of most definitive hospital inter-
vention trials. Recent studies have established text messaging as an 
effective way to deliver cessation support at a distance.8,9 Text mes-
saging has not yet, however, been evaluated as a way to provide 
post-discharge support among hospitalized smokers. A multicompo-
nent approach using text messaging in conjunction with phone coun-
seling has good potential for increasing smoking cessation rates.10,11
A hybrid texting/counseling approach is also an attractive option 
for lower-income countries. It could eliminate access barriers such 
as cost, time, travel, and scheduling.12 Texting is cost-effective and 
can tailor messages to user characteristics.9 An initial call can estab-
lish rapport and thereafter text messages can provide asynchronous 
communication with participants and ultimately may be used with 
large numbers of tobacco users. This approach may be uniquely well 
suited to hospitals, where tobacco users may be identified, contacted 
for one post-discharge transition call, and handed over to a tailored 
text program.
To date, no text messaging interventions have been tested in mid-
dle- or low-income countries.9 Most (84%) of Brazil’s 200 million 
citizens have at least one mobile phone,13 and there is no charge for 
receiving texts. Our experimental feasibility study14 tested this hy-
brid phone counseling/text messaging intervention among hospital-
ized smokers in Brazil.
Methods
Design
This study was a two-arm randomized trial of a post-discharge treat-
ment program among 66 hospitalized smokers (Figure 1). Participants 
were recruited during their hospitalization and contacted at 1 and 
3 months for follow-up. During hospitalization, all patients received 
standard care, including (1) screening, (2) brief counseling, and (3) 
access to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Post-discharge, eli-
gible patients were randomly assigned to one of two follow-up con-
ditions: phone counseling plus text message (TXT) versus standard 
care (control). The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics 
Committee Review Board/process number 1.460.247 and enrolled 
in the Clinical Trials Registry (NCT02571244).
Setting
Patients were recruited from a 140-bed public university hospital serving 
294 inpatients monthly. The hospital’s smoking prevalence is 16.2%.15 
The hospital serves mainly a low-income population. The hospital 
has an electronic medical record system and a tobacco-free campus. 
The Interdisciplinary Center of Research and Intervention in Tobacco 
(CIPIT) provides inpatient tobacco treatment that follows the Brazilian 
National Institute of Cancer (INCA) guidelines.3 These interventions 
are delivered by graduate students enrolled in a multi-professional resi-
dence program and overseen by a hospital pulmonologist (MD).
Participants, Screening, and Randomization
The study population consisted of patients aged ≥18 years admit-
ted to the hospital who had smoked cigarettes within the past 
30 days, had their own mobile phone, had received at least one text 
message in the past year and were able to provide informed consent. 
Participants were excluded if they were admitted to an intensive care 
unit, in isolation, physically or cognitively unable to participate, or 
currently incarcerated.
Study staff screened potential participants using electronic med-
ical record data, and then completed in-person screening and con-
sent at the bedside. Figure  1 describes recruitment and retention 
of study participants. To maximize data collected on intervention 
feasibility, we randomized eligible participants to groups in a 2:1 
intervention/control ratio.
Randomization occurred post-discharge to ensure that patients 
received the same care inside the hospital. Hospital counselors 
sent the names of potential participants and their eligibility screen-
ing results, but not baseline data, to the PI, who assigned patients 
to study arm using a random sequence list generated by the study 
biostatistician (Colugnati) using blockrand in R.  The PI assigned 
patients in the order in which they were received to the next avail-
able spot on the randomization list.
Interventions
Standard Care
This included educational materials, brief intervention (BI) and 
access to NRT (adhesive patch and gum) for eligible patients. In 
accordance with the Brazilian National Treatment Guideline,3 
patients with a Fagerstrom score ≥5 were eligible for free medication 
in the hospital and 1 month post-discharge. The brief intervention 
lasted 5–20 minutes, and followed the Five A’s.3 Counselors related 
the patients’ diagnosis to their smoking and discussed the import-
ance of quitting. Patients were encouraged to remain abstinent after 
discharge and given a brochure, information about local cessation 
resources, and NRT. The study PI, who completed tobacco treatment 
specialist (TTS) training in the United States, gave inpatient provid-
ers a 4-hour training, supervised counselor delivery of the interven-
tion until adherence to the protocol was met, and provided weekly 
refresher trainings and case discussion sessions.
Experimental Intervention
Patients randomized to TXT received a single telephone call from 
study staff during the first week following discharge, plus multiple

text messages post-discharge. Telephone counseling lasted approxi-
mately 15 to 30 minutes. All patients were asked during the call if 
they were ready to quit in the next 30 days. Smokers motivated to 
quit in this period were invited to complete a quit plan and those 
who were abstinent to complete a cessation maintenance plan. 
Smokers unwilling to set a quit date received counseling designed 
to increase motivation to quit. The counseling approach addressed 
behavioral and cognitive issues, including motivation, confidence, 
quitting history, environmental factors, trigger situations, coping 
strategies, medication use, relapse prevention, and setting a quit date. 
The protocol was adapted from US quitline protocols6 and other 
outpatient counseling studies.7
Text Message Content Development
Text message themes were adapted from Naughton’s matrices, 
which tailor messages to tobacco users’ progress in quitting 
(Supplementary Appendix A in Portuguese and Appendix B in 
English).16 A questionnaire administered by counselors during the 
post-discharge call identified participants’ specific concerns and rea-
sons for quitting, which guided development of participant-specific 
messages. Because confidence/ self-efficacy for quitting is a pre-
dictor of success,17 and in particular appears to mediate the effect 
of NRT,18,19 the research team used Bandura’s self-efficacy theory20 
to design the content of text messages. For instance, participants’ 
perceived benefits from quitting or strategies used in previous quit 
attempts were sent to that participant as text messages to build his/
her self-efficacy for quitting.
Message Scheduling and Quality Control
Each patient in TXT received up to 30 text messages for 8–15 days 
after discharge. The frequency and content of the messages varied 
depending on the participants’ motivation to quit. Patients abstinent 
or preparing to quit in the next 30 days received two messages/day 
over the course of 15 days. Patients not ready to quit received two

messages/day over the course of 8 days. Messages were sent using a 
mobile phone that registered the time the message was delivered and 
whether the message was received. The text message protocol used 
in this study was unidirectional—participants could not respond to 
texts. The choice for two daily texts was based on a meta-analy-
sis indicating that fixed-schedule messages performed better than 
decreasing or variable schedules.8 In this study, text messages were 
sent manually via a mobile phone which limited the extent of mes-
sage tailoring, length and frequency.
Measures
Baseline data were collected from the electronic medical record 
and in-person surveys, and follow-up data were collected 
by phone. Measures included demographic and tobacco use 
characteristics (Table  1). Feasibility focused on acceptability, 
implementation, and limited-effectiveness testing.14 To address 
acceptability, we assessed satisfaction with, and perceived use-
fulness of, the intervention. Implementation measures included 
adherence to medications, number of messages sent/received, 
counseling length, and cell phone status. We assessed whether 
participants used NRT since hospitalization (Yes/No) and the 
type of NRT used.
Limited-effectiveness measures included abstinence and other 
outcomes. The main outcome measure for the study was self-reported 
7-day point prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-randomization. 
Secondary outcomes included self-reported and biochemically veri-
fied abstinence at 3  months post-randomization. Exhaled carbon 
monoxide of ≤10 ppm was the cutoff for verification of abstinence.21 
Among continuing smokers we assessed the number of cigarettes 
smoked per day.
Analyses
The data were entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture). SPSS/version 15.0 was used for all analyses. Descriptive 
statistics (means and SDs for continuous variables and totals/per-
centages for categorical variables) were used to summarize demo-
graphic and feasibility measures by group. We used chi-square tests, 
Independent Samples t-tests, and the Mann–Whitney test for non-
parametric continuous variables, as appropriate. We used OpenEpi22 
to estimate the number needed for a definitive trial, based on the 
effects of the pilot study.
Missing data were minimal (29/2732 data points—1.06%). 
Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Follow-up data 
for number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days were imputed by 
calculating the average values of other participant responses in the 
same variable and group (control/intervention). Missing categori-
cal data points for cell phone status and text message reading were 
excluded from the analysis.

Results
Participants were recruited from February 2015 to March 2016 
(Figure 1). Randomization led to similar groups for all baseline char-
acteristics (Table 1). Participants were male (51.5%), with a mean 
age of 47.7% and 89.3% had a high school or lower education level.
Feasibility at 1-Month Follow-up
Counseling calls lasted 15 minutes on average. In total, 1186 mes-
sages were sent to 41 patients; of these, 924 (77.9%) were received 
by patients. Most (75.6%) participants described their cell phone 
status as “charged almost all the time” and 97.6% maintained the 
same phone number. Six patients (13.6%) in TXT used NRT com-
pared to one patient (4.5%) in the control group.
Acceptability
Most TXT participants (80.4%) reported that the text message con-
tent was “helpful.” Similarly, most (80.5%) reported that the number 
of text messages received was “enough.” Nearly all (95.1%) found 
calls to be “just the right length.”
Limited-Effectiveness Outcomes
Eleven patients (25%) self-reported abstinence in TXT at 1  month 
post-randomization and two (9.1%) in the control group (p = .13). At 
3 months post-randomization 14 patients (31.8%) quit in TXT and 
two (9.1%) reported abstinence in the control group (p = .04). Of those 
16 patients that self-reported abstinence at the 3-month assessment, 
10 had CO-verified smoking abstinence. The biochemically-verified 
quit rates for TXT was 20.5% and for the control group was 4.5% 
(p = .09). Among continuing smokers, the number of cigarettes smoked 
per day at 1-month follow-up was lower in TXT compared to the con-
trol group (mean/SD: 10.6 [6.6] vs. 12.6 [4.4], p = .25) and also at 
3-month follow-up (mean/SD: 12.9 [5.2] vs. 14.6 [5.5], p = .29). With 
an effect size of 25% versus 9.1%, a definitive study would require a 
sample size of 198 to detect differences with 80% power.
Discussion
This study suggests that, in Brazil, a hybrid phone counseling/text 
messaging approach is a feasible and acceptable intervention for 
post-discharge cessation support. Most participants had adequate 
mobile phone coverage to participate, and nearly 80% of interven-
tion group patients successfully received text messages. The interven-
tion frequency and length were highly acceptable and follow-up data 
collection yielded overall retention rates exceeding 90%. Although 
not significant, more participants were abstinent at follow-up in the 
TXT group, compared to the control group. The quit rate achieved 
by our intervention group was comparable to quit rates of studies 
employing more intensive follow-up,5 even though most prior stud-
ies included only patients motivated to quit.
The study has some limitations. Texts were sent manually using a 
mobile phone by study staff, which limited the extent of message tai-
loring, length, and frequency. Participants not ready to quit received 
fewer text messages than other intervention participants. Follow-up 
was limited to 3 months, and the study lacked power to definitively 
test the interventions.
A fully-powered trial to explore the effects of a hybrid phone 
counseling/text messaging intervention on cessation is warranted. In 
advanced economy countries, pragmatic studies could evaluate this 
approach in collaboration with existing telephone quitlines, as some 
quitlines provide parallel counseling and text messaging services.10 
Our participants were very satisfied with the duration and intensity 
of the text messaging intervention as it was designed, but we know 
from Public Health Service Guidelines23 and hospital trial meta-
analyses5 that more support would possibly be even more effective. 
Future studies could prompt participants to either opt in or opt out 
of more texts after 15  days, or include study arms that compare 
longer-duration versus shorter-duration text message conditions.
In Brazil and other lower-/middle-income countries, proactive, 
multi-call telephone counseling24 is often not freely available.25 The pilot 
procedures should readily scale up to a full trial as they were designed to 
fit within clinical practice, and Federal University hospitals are all man-
aged under the same authority. Our method of manually tailoring and 
sending messages seemed effective. Automating this process is feasible 
because many smokers share similar concerns (such as developing can-
cer) that could be included in a comprehensive message library.
