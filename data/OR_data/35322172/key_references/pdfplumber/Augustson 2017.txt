Abstract
Purpose—To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text message–based smoking
cessation intervention in China.
Design—Randomized control trial with a 6-month follow-up assessment of smoking status.
Setting—Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi provinces in China.
Subjects—8,000 adult smokers in China who use Nokia Life Tools and participated in Phase II
(smoking education via text message) of the study.
Intervention—High Frequency Text Contact (HFTC) group received one to three messages daily
containing smoking cessation advice, encouragement, and health education information. Low
Frequency Text Contact (LFTC) group received one weekly message with smoking health effects
information.
Measures—Our primary outcome was smoking status 0, 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention.
Secondary outcomes include participant perceptions of the HFTC intervention, and factors
associated with smoking cessation among HFTC participants.
Analysis—Descriptive and chi-square analyses were conducted to assess smoking status and
acceptability. Factors associated with quitting were assessed using multiple logistic regression
analyses.

Results—Quit rates were high in both HFTC and LFTC groups (HFTC: 0 month 27.9%, 1 month
30.5%, 3 months 26.7%, 6 months 27.7%; LFTC: 0 month 26.7%, 1 month 30.4%, 3 months
28.1%, 6 months 27.7), with no significant difference between the two groups in an intent-to-treat
analysis. Attitudes towards the HFTC intervention were largely positive.
Conclusion—Our findings suggest that a text message–based smoking cessation intervention
can be successfully delivered in China and is acceptable to Chinese smokers, but further research
is needed to assess the potential impact of this type of intervention.

Purpose
Cigarette smoking is a persistent health threat worldwide. With one-third of the world’s
adult smokers, China’s population of 301 million adult smokers is a significant global public
health concern, which must be urgently and comprehensively addressed.1, 2 Over half
(52.9%), of the male adult population and 2.4% of adult females reported that they were
smokers in 2010.3 Smoking is a major risk factor for many health problems such as cancers,
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease–related deaths.4, 5 An estimated 673,000
adult deaths were attributed to tobacco smoking in 2005,4 and more recent estimates are as
high as 1.2 million deaths.6 In 2008, in China, smoking-attributable health care costs
amounted to at least US$6.2 billion.7 Quitting smoking can effectively reduce smokers’ risk
of morbidity and mortality.5 Because of smoking’s impact on health and the economy,
widespread cessation efforts are extremely important.
Reported percentages of people who intend to quit smoking are low in China compared with
many other countries.8 In 2010, only 16.1% of adult smokers reported they intended to quit
smoking within the next 12 months,1 and an estimated 36.4% reported they had attempted to
quit in the previous 12 months.1 Lack of intent to quit smoking can be due to many factors
including a low overall awareness of the risks of smoking on health. Only 5.2% of current
smokers who responded to a 2006 International Tobacco Control (ITC) China Survey were
aware of all the following health effects of smoking—stained teeth, lung cancer in smokers
and non-smokers, emphysema, premature aging, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and
impotence.9 Participants in this same study who were more knowledgeable about the adverse
health effects were more likely to intend to quit smoking, which illustrates the relevance and
importance of increasing knowledge to motivate smoking cessation, as seen in other
countries.10 Because efforts to increase public knowledge about the dangers of smoking
have been limited and few smoking cessation resources are available in China, more
programs to support cessation are urgently needed.8 In China, recent smoking policy
changes, such as smoke-free public venues, may have increased motivation for smokers to
quit, but access to smoking cessation programs and use of existing programs, such as quit
lines and nicotine replacement therapy, are limited.8, 11

The feasibility and utility of using mobile phone text messaging to send health-related
messages are now under study.12 Mobile phone services are widely accessible around the
world. About 93% of the world’s population and 99% of China’s citizens have access to
cellular networks.13 Estimates from 2011 indicate that worldwide there are 85.5 mobile
phone subscriptions per 100 people, and in China there are 73.2 subscriptions per 100
people.13 Because of the widespread use of mobile phones, text messaging services could
reach large numbers of people at a lower cost for both the organization sending the message
and the people receiving it in comparison with the cost of other smoking cessation methods
such as quitlines, behavioral counseling, and nicotine replacement therapy. A mobile phone–
based intervention for smoking cessation could capitalize on the widespread use of mobile
phones and text messaging in China to deliver information, motivation, and support to quit
smoking in a low-cost manner, while reaching a large group of people at any time and in any
location.
Text messaging has been incorporated into smoking cessation with mixed results, depending
on the nature of the intervention and the size of the sample.14 A meta-analysis of 5 mobile
phone interventions involving over 9,000 participants found that the text message
intervention groups were 1.71 times more likely to be continuously abstinent at 6 months
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.47–1.99) compared to the control groups.14 To date, the
vast majority of text message intervention studies have been conducted in high-income
countries. Conducting such studies in low- and middle-income, resource-limited countries is
particularly important given the limited research in these countries and the great need for
economical treatment approaches. To our knowledge, only one text message smoking
cessation study has been conducted in China; this study suggested that a text message
intervention could reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by adolescents ages 16–19.15
The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of delivering a text message–based
smoking cessation program to a large number of Chinese smokers and assess the program’s
impact on smoking status between 0 and 6 months after the intervention. To our knowledge,
this is the first large randomized controlled study using text messages for smoking cessation
in China. In addition to evaluating feasibility, this study addressed the program’s
acceptability among a sub-sample of participants.
Methods
Design
The study design was a two-arm randomized control trial of a 6-week smoking cessation
intervention (described below) with a follow-up assessment of smoking status at the end of
the intervention, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the smoking cessation intervention (Figure).
The study was designed and implemented collaboratively by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC), China Centers for
Disease Control (China CDC), China Center for Health Education, and Nokia (a
multinational telecommunications corporation). Institutional Review Board approval was
obtained for this study from the China CDC prior to the study.

Text Message Library Development
Phase I of this project involved smoking cessation message testing and adaptation. The text
messages used in the study came from a text message library created for the U.S. population.
This text library was developed by smoking cessation experts at NCI, and was based on
well-established cognitive–behavioral cessation approaches. The library was translated into
Chinese, reviewed by Chinese health communication and tobacco cessation experts, and
adapted to the Chinese context. Eight focus group interviews were conducted with smokers
in rural and urban areas of three Chinese provinces to assess the acceptability of the
cessation text message library. Focus group interviewees, most of whom were male (152
males, 13 females), were evenly distributed between rural and urban areas (82 and 83
interviewees, respectively) and among the three provinces (49 interviewees in Zhejiang, 60
in Heilongjiang, and 56 in Shaanxi). The focus groups assessed the quality of the messages,
including whether the interviewees thought the messages were motivating, believable, and
appropriately translated for the Chinese context. The messages were then modified based on
focus group feedback to assure that they were culturally appropriate for a Chinese audience.
Sample and Recruitment
All individuals in this study subscribed to Nokia Life Tools, a service providing more than
100 million users in five countries (China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Kenya) with text
message–based information on a variety of topics of their choosing.16 Nokia Life Tools
software comes pre-installed on most Nokia phones and provides users with free basic
subscriptions and content, with additional subscriptions available to purchase.
For Phase II, in April 2013, Life Tools users in both urban and rural areas of China’s
Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi provinces received a text message inviting them to join
a free program to receive 1 week of text messages (nine messages total) about the health
effects of smoking. The study accepted the first 276,000 individuals who opted into the
program. Subject accrual for Phase II was completed in approximately 1 day, and 251,359
(91.1%) completed Phase II.
A text message was then sent to all 251,359 participants who completed Phase II to invite
those who self-identified as adult smokers interested in quitting to join the next phase of the
study and receive free smoking cessation messages. This recruitment text was sent the day
after the last Phase II educational text message was sent; the first Phase III cessation text
messages were sent 1 week after the Phase III recruitment text. There were no other
exclusions for participation in the last two phases of the study. The first 8,000 participants
who accepted this invitation were enrolled into Phases III and IV of the study. Subject
accrual was completed in less than 1 hour. The Institutional Review Board waived the
requirement for informed consent because it was determined that the intervention would be
of minimal risk to participants. In addition, the recruitment and treatment delivered via text
message made gathering informed consent or demographic information infeasible. Although
demographic data were not collected from participants, Nokia records provided province and
city residence of Phase III and IV participants: 2,768 participants in Zhejiang, 2,053
participants in Heilongjiang, and 3,179 participants in Shaanxi. Nokia consumer profiles
also suggested that the vast majority of our sample would be above the age of 19. We

selected a sample size that would give us sufficient power to detect modest differences
between the groups while accounting for (1) the high rates of lost to follow-up that occur in
mobile health research projects and (2) the wide range of quit rates seen in previous
cessation intervention studies in China.17 Even assuming a quit rate as high as 37% in the
control group at any time point, there would be a power of roughly 80% to detect a modest
difference between the two groups with a significance level of alpha = 0.05. In addition, the
trial’s large sample size will also inform potential efforts to further scale up the intervention
if it is successful.
Intervention
Participants who opted into the Phase III smoking cessation trial were randomly assigned to
the intervention or comparison group (n = 4,000 in each group). Participants were not aware
of the separate intervention arms, and therefore did not know what group they were assigned
to. On April 28, 2013, Phase III text messages began with a notification that the quit date
would be 1 week later, plus 1 week of pre-quit-day messages sent to all participants (8
messages total). These pre-quit-day messages were designed to increase motivation to make
a sustained attempt to quit smoking.
The High Frequency Text Contact (HFTC) treatment group received an additional 91
messages over the 6 weeks after May 5, 2013: 3 messages per day for weeks 1–2, 2 per day
for weeks 3–5, and 1 per day for week 6. At the end of each text message, participants in
both groups were offered the opportunity to cancel the service via text. The text messages
sent to the HFTC group provided encouragement, practical advice to help maintain
cessation, and information on health effects of smoking. The Low Frequency Text Contact
(LFTC) comparison group received 1 text message a week, for a total of 6 text messages
over the 6-week intervention period. Because only 6 text messages were being sent, LFTC
participants did not receive the full range of text messages available to the HFTC group, and
instead were sent a subset of text messages on smoking’s health effects. See Table 1 for
examples of text messages sent to both the HFTC and LFTC groups.
The day after the 6-week intervention ended (June 16, 2013) all participants (including
participants who opted out of the service during the intervention) received a text message
asking them to report their smoking status via text message (see “Measures – Cessation
Outcomes” for additional information).
Follow-Up Interview with Sub-Sample
During the week following the intervention (June 16–22, 2014), follow-up phone interviews
were conducted with a sub-sample of participants in the HFTC group to assess demographic
factors associated with smoking cessation and intervention satisfaction among those who
received the HFTC intervention. Interviewers called HFTC participants who reported their
smoking status at the end of the intervention, including participants who opted out during
the intervention. If a participant did not answer, hung up, or otherwise did not complete the
interview, the interviewer continued to call other participants until a total of 400 interviews
were completed with participants who reported continuing to smoke (n = 200) or quitting (n
= 200) at the end of the intervention. Seven of these interviewees were later excluded from

analyses because they indicated they were not smokers at the beginning of the study, but
rather were gathering information for another smoker. Interviewees who reported a different
smoking status on the phone than they reported via text were categorized based on their
verbal response. There was an 86.6% agreement between the self-reports via text and
subsequent verbal reports. This resulted in a final sub-sample of 393 interviewees (180
quitters and 213 current smokers).
Measures
Cessation Outcomes – Full Sample—The main outcome of interest was point
prevalence of smoking cessation immediately following the intervention, as well as point
prevalence during Phase IV of the study at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Smoking status
was based on past-7-day abstinence self-reported via text message. Participants were asked
if they had “smoked cigarettes at all, even one puff, in the last 7 days” and were prompted to
reply either “0” if they had not smoked, or “1” if they had smoked. Participants were also
told they would receive a 10 RMB reimbursement (approximately $1.60 USD) to their
mobile phone balance if they responded. This question was asked of all participants at all
time points regardless of whether they opted out during the intervention or did not respond at
any earlier follow-up point.
The name of each participant’s province was provided by Nokia. Nokia also reviewed
system records to confirm that the delivered text messages during the intervention and the
follow-up were received on participants’ mobile phones.
Outcomes from Phone Interviewees – Sub-sample—To assess the quality and
utility of the numerous text messages in the HFTC intervention, interviewees were asked
about their use and perceptions of the HFTC intervention. They were asked to confirm their
current smoking status, then asked whether they received the text messages, how many they
read, whether they were satisfied with the quantity of messages they received, whether the
messages provided useful information, whether the messages encouraged them to quit, and
if they would share these messages with other smokers. Demographic data on age,
education, urban/rural residential status, marital status, and health status were also gathered
during the phone interview.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were completed to compare cessation rates
between the intervention and control groups in the full sample at each follow-up point. The
main analyses were based on the intent-to-treat principle, whereby individuals who opted
out after randomization and those who did not respond to the smoking status prompt were
considered to have continued smoking. This type of analysis is considered the most
conservative and is the standard for smoking cessation studies.14 We also conducted less
conservative analyses, excluding those who did not respond at the point of follow-up. Our
ability to analyze continuous abstinence was hampered by the large amount of missing
smoking status data for participants responding across all follow-up time points.

For the interviewee sub-sample, chi-square analyses were completed to assess relationships
between smoking status, demographic variables (province, marital status, highest level of
education attained, and age), and self-described health status. Simple logistic and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to further describe the relationships
between each variable and smoking status, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios are
provided. The final multiple logistic regression model contained each of the demographic
variables as well as health status. Descriptive data indicating the interviewees’ perceptions
about the utility of the HFTC intervention are also provided.
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.
Results
Data were collected and analyzed for 8,000 adults—4,000 in the HFTC intervention and
4,000 in the LFTC comparison group. In the intervention group, 426 respondents (10.7%)
declined to receive messages before the quit date, and 458 respondents in the control group
(11.5%) declined to receive these messages (see the Figure to see a flowchart for opt-out
rates during the intervention and for follow-up smoking status response rates). By the end of
the 6-week intervention, 1,716 HFTC participants (42.9%) and 614 LFTC participants
(15.4%) had opted out of receiving additional messages (p<0.001).
Cessation Outcomes – Full Sample
The 7-day point prevalence cessation rates at the end of the intervention (0 month) and at
follow-up (1, 3, and 6 months) are displayed in Table 2. Using the conservative intent-to-
treat approach which considered all non-responders to be smokers, we observed high
reported quit rates (between 26.7 and 30.5%) at all of the follow-up time points for both the
HFTC and LFTC groups. The non-smoking point prevalence did not differ by treatment
group for this approach. Excluding those who did not report their smoking status, we
observe significantly greater 7-day point prevalence abstinence in the HFTC group
compared to the LFTC group immediately after the intervention (66% vs. 58% for the HFTC
and LFTC, respectively; p < 0.001); 1 month after the intervention (67% vs. 64% for the
HFTC and LFTC, respectively; p = 0.027); and at 6 months (67% vs. 63% for the HFTC and
LFTC, respectively; p = 0.032). Statistically significant differences were noted at each time
point, but the magnitude of these differences is not clinically meaningful. These differences
should also be interpreted cautiously given the high non-response rates in both the HFTC
and LFTC groups during the study (0m = 55.8% of the full sample, 1m = 53.4%, 3m =
57.6%, 6m = 57.2%). The non-response rates did not differ significantly by treatment group.
Additionally, response varied by participant: Those who did not respond at one time point
may have responded at other time points (data not shown).
Outcomes from Phone Interviewees – Sub-sample
Among the 393 HFTC participants included in the call sample, the overwhelming majority
(96.4%) were male, and most reported living in an urban location (84.6%) and being married
(72.0%). Approximately 43% were between 18 and 29 years of age; 25.7% were ages 30–
39; 23.4% were 40–49; and 8% were age 50 and older (data not shown). When comparing

the demographics of interviewees who opted out to those who received the full intervention,
we did not detect any significant differences. In addition, we conducted chi-square analyses
to determine if people who opted out of the intervention were less likely to answer the call
and complete the interview than people who did not opt out of the intervention. We found
that people who opted out of the intervention completed the phone interview at a rate very
similar to that of people who completed the full intervention; the difference was not
significant (χ2(1) = 0.416, p = 0.519).
Table 3 presents the demographic profile of the interviewees by smoking status at the time of
the interview, as well as unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of smoking. When adjusting for
all of the presented covariates, smoking status did not vary significantly by province,
participant age, highest level of education, or marital status (at p < 0.05). However,
interviewees who reported being in good health [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.68, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.69–4.24] or poor/fair health (AOR = 7.42, 95% CI = 2.36–
23.37) were more likely to report smoking than those who reported excellent or very good
health. Additionally, interviewees from rural areas were 3 times more likely to report
continued smoking compared to participants from urban areas (AOR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.51–
6.25). In the unadjusted analysis, interviewees who were 30–39 years old had marginally
higher odds (p = 0.07) of smoking compared to those younger than 29, but these results no
longer approached significance when data were adjusted for the other covariates in the
model.
Interviewees were also asked questions about the utility of the program (Table 4). Over 80%
of this sample of HFTC participants stated that the number of messages was “the right
amount,” while 11.5% and 7.4% stated that there were too many or too few, respectively.
The majority of interviewees responded that they read all the messages (80.7%).
Interviewees responded positively to the content, with 93% stating that useful information
was provided. Additionally, nearly 91% of interviewees reported that the information
motivated them to quit, and 86% stated that they were likely to share the information with
someone else. It is important to note that satisfaction was assessed among interviewees who
had responded to the first smoking status assessment at 0 month, and does not represent
those who did not respond at this time point.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first large randomized controlled trial of a text message–
based smoking cessation program in China. This study has demonstrated that a text
message–based smoking cessation intervention can be successfully delivered in China and
may help increase cessation rates among China’s 300 million smokers. Although a non-
active comparison group was not included in this study, the reported cessation rates across
all follow-up points are quite high (26.7%–30.5%) compared to national cessation rates
report from previous studies in China.3, 11 These quit rates were within the range of those
found in other Chinese smoking cessation intervention studies involving a variety of
treatments (8–51%).17–19 In addition, this project successfully translated and culturally
adapted a U.S. smoking cessation text message library for a Chinese audience. This Chinese

language library is now being disseminated to other emerging cessation programs within
China.
Despite the high quit rates, the intent-to-treat analysis did not detect any difference in quit
rates between the HFTC and LFTC groups. It is possible that the minimal level of
information and support provided in the LFTC group was sufficient to prompt cessation
among this sample of smokers who were already interested in quitting. Cessation support
services are not widely available in China,8 and compared to developed/Western countries,
awareness about the health risks of smoking is relatively low.9 The amount of information
provided to both intervention groups may have been sufficient to encourage cessation among
this population, who may be more motivated and easy to convince to quit than the average
smoker in China, thus resulting in higher than expected quit rates in both intervention
groups. Many participants in both groups were also seeking health information from Nokia
Life Tools and therefore may have been more motivated to utilize and benefit from the
intervention than the average smoker.
In contrast to the intent-to-treat analysis, our analyses excluding non-respondents found that
people in the HFTC group were significantly more likely to quit smoking than those in the
LFTC group at 0, 1, and 6 months follow-up. Although these findings are encouraging about
the potential effectiveness of the HFTC intervention, this difference is not clinically
significant and must be interpreted with caution given the high non-response and
intervention opt-out rates. In view of the higher opt-out rate in the HFTC group compared
with the LFTC group (42.9% and 15.4%, respectively), it is possible that the HFTC
participants felt they were receiving too many text messages. This suggests that sending
fewer cessation text messages may improve retention, but our subsequent findings revealed
that most HFTC phone interviewees (81.2%) felt they received the right amount of texts. It
is likely that the HFTC group had a higher opt-out rate in part because HFTC participants
received more texts, each of which included a prompt offering the participants the
opportunity to opt out. The high frequency of these texts prompting people to opt out of the
intervention could have led to more opting out by HFTC than LFTC participants.
Unfortunately, the number of unknowns makes it difficult to conclude that one intervention
was more effective than the other. Future research should further assess the ideal number of
smoking cessation messages to send to Chinese smokers to ensure that they receive adequate
support without being overwhelmed by text messages.
Our analysis of the sub-sample of 393 interviewees receiving the HFTC intervention
revealed two significant predictors of smoking cessation: location and perceived health
status. Interviewees were more likely to continue smoking if they lived in rural rather than
urban areas, or reported being in fair/poor or good health compared to excellent/very good
health. Improvements in health can be seen even within a short time of smoking cessation,
but it is not clear if the interviewees reported better health as a result of their quitting status.
The few other studies that have assessed predictors of smoking cessation among Chinese
current smokers have produced inconsistent results.11, 19, 20 Further research is needed to
assess characteristics associated with cessation among Chinese smokers.

Overall results from the phone interview sub-sample show that the program received largely
positive feedback, and the level of engagement was high. Most interviewees reported
reading all of the text messages (80.7%), and only 11.5% thought they received too many
texts. Most interviewees also said that the messages were helpful and that they would share
the messages with other smokers. This high level of satisfaction suggests that other smokers
in China would be willing to use and benefit from this program.
Among the strengths of this study is that its sample was one of the largest of any smoking
cessation text message study to date,14, 15, 21 including participants from rural and urban
areas in three Chinese provinces. This intervention was also designed using health behavior
change principles, and the messages were pre-tested and adapted to match the Chinese
cultural context.
This study had several limitations. All data were collected via text message, and baseline
data were not collected on variables such as smoking history, patterns of tobacco use, and
demographic characteristics, which prevented a fuller understanding of how these factors
may have affected quit rates. Relying on self-report via text also may have elicited biased
responses about quit status, as well as their opinions on the HFTC intervention. As with
many smoking cessation studies, self-reported quit rates tend to be higher than biologically
verified quit rates.14, 22 The actual smoking abstinence rate is likely to have been lower than
what was reported.
In addition to high opt-out rates, the low post-intervention response rates also hindered our
ability to assess the impact of the intervention. This is a common limitation of automated
mhealth and ehealth interventions, and previous research suggests that the most efficient
way to counter this possibility is by making multiple attempts to personally call each
participant who did not respond.23 Limited resources prevented us from pursuing this
method of follow-up, but this should be considered in future research. Lastly, the two
intervention groups differed in terms of number of text messages as well as in the breadth
and depth of the content they received, which would have confounded the relationship
between number of texts and content had our study detected a meaningful difference
between the two intervention groups. Future studies should take this into account when
identifying appropriate control groups. In the future, multi-arm trials that can manipulate
more than one parameter would be helpful to assess what attributes increase the
effectiveness of the intervention.
Despite these limitations, our study suggests that mobile phone cessation interventions can
help fill the large gap in cessation support services in China.8 China has more than one-third
of the world’s smokers2 and the cost of smoking is rising rapidly7; evidence-based text
message cessation services may offer a cost-effective method of cessation support that
capitalizes on existing mobile technology that is highly utilized in China.13 This study
yielded overwhelmingly positive feedback about the intervention and high quit rates in both
groups, which suggests that further study of a cessation text messaging intervention in China
and other large, high-burden countries is warranted.

In conclusion, our study found that a text message–based cessation intervention is feasible to
implement in China and may increase cessation rates. Users reported high levels of
satisfaction and willingness to participate in the program and recommend the program to
other smokers. Further research is needed both to assess more accurately the intervention’s
impact on smoking cessation and to determine which intervention attributes are most
effective in increasing long-term smoking abstinence.

SO WHAT- Implications for Health Promotion Practitioners and Researchers
What is already known on this topic?
Research suggests that text message–based interventions could be effective in motivating
or sustaining smoking cessation efforts. However, these efforts had not been tested on a
large scale in China, where smoking rates are high, knowledge of the health effects of
smoking is low, motivation to quit is low, and availability of cessation treatment is very
limited.
What does this article add?
Findings show that a large-scale smoking cessation intervention utilizing text messages is
feasible to implement in rural and urban areas in China, and may positively affect
smoking cessation attempts.
What are the implications for health promotion practice or research?
This evidence-based smoking cessation message library for Chinese smokers shows great
promise for increasing smoking cessation, but additional research is needed to further
evaluate what attributes of text message interventions are effective at increasing smoking
cessation rates in resource-limited countries. With more than 301 million smokers in
China, this low-burden mhealth intervention has great potential to reduce smoking-
related morbidity and mortality in China by educating, motivating, and supporting
smokers who are interested in quitting.
