number of AIAN populations. Overestimation of other
women’s alcohol consumption may contribute to
increased drinking (Dunnagan et al., 2007) and increased
perception of risks associated with drinking may reduce
consumption (Testa and Reifman, 1996). Social norms
that tolerate risky drinking may prevent women from rec-
ognizing and addressing problems. According to the 2007
National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the vast major-
ity of people needing treatment for alcohol abuse were
unaware that they needed it (Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration, 2008). Nonetheless,
attempts to shift social norms relating to alcohol con-
sumption have been used in interventions among non-
AIAN populations with mixed results (Clapp et al., 2003;
Lewis and Neighbors, 2006). The present results indicate
that, among AIAN women in our source group, interven-
tions addressing social norms may prove effective. Find-
ings support narrow social norms among variables such
as drinks per occasion among drinkers, drinks needed to
feel tipsy, and age at first drink. These variables were not
different among groups with different vulnerability to
AEP. The perception of how much other women drink
was an important predictor of reduced drinking during
follow-up.
In addition to perceiving social norms of higher alcohol
consumption, the present study revealed 2 other predictors
of reduction in alcohol use: testing positive for depression
or impaired functionality and a greater number of binge
drinking episodes over a 2-week period. Treatment for
depression was recommended for a third of the women in
our sample (36%). This proportion is striking when com-
pared to the prevalence of depression among U.S. women
(14% in 2006) (Farr et al., 2010) and among 2,289 adult
Alaska Native women (20%) (Dillard et al., 2012) mea-
sured using the same PHQ-9 instrument. In women, as
opposed to men, depression appears to predate alcohol
problems (Helzer and Pryzbeck, 1988). Screening for
depression may facilitate identification of women vulnera-
ble to AEP. Furthermore, addressing depression in this
population may be a helpful independent approach to pre-
venting FASD.
The finding that a greater magnitude of change was pre-
dicted by higher number of binge episodes at baseline is
somewhatunexpectedinthatthestrategyofSBIRTisgeared
toward a broader population of relatively lower risk. How-
ever, recognition of the extent of one’s binge drinking may

Controlling for baseline alcoholconsumption onlyserved
to improve the predictive power of our model (adjusted R2
increasedto78.9%).Inaddition,bingedrinking,perception
of social norms, and depression/functionality were consis-
tently predictive of primary variable change at each follow-
up time point. Variables that were, perhaps unexpectedly,
not significantly predictive of change were age, smoking,
income,illegaldruguse,andreligiosity.
