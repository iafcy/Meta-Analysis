Abstract
Background: Internet access has grown markedly inLatinos during the past decade.However, therehave been no
Internet-based physical activity interventions designedfor Latinos,despite large disparitiesin lifestyle-related
conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, particularly in Latina women. The current study tested the efficacy ofa
6-month culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-languageInternet-based physical activityintervention.
Methods: Inactive Latinas (N=205) were randomly assignedto theTailored Physical Activity InternetIntervention
or the Wellness Contact Control InternetGroup. Participants inboth groups received emailson a tapered schedule
over 6months to alert them to new content onthewebsite. The primary outcome was minutes/week of moderate
to vigorous physical activity(MVPA) at6 months as measuredby the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall; activity was also
measured by accelerometers. Data were collected between2011 and 2014 and analyzedin 2015 attheUniversity
ofCalifornia, SanDiego.
Results: Increasesinminutes/weekofMVPAweresignificantlygreaterintheInterventionGroupcomparedtothe
ControlGroup(meandifference=50.00,SE=9.5,p<0.01).IncreasesinobjectivelymeasuredMVPAwerealso
significantlylargerintheInterventionGroup(meandifferences=31.0,SE=10.7,p<.01).TheInterventionGroupwasalso
significantlymorelikelytomeetnationalphysicalactivityguidelinesat6months(OR=3.12,95%CI1.46–6.66,p<.05).
