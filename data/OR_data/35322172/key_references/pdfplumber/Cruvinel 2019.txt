Abstract
Objective: Text messaging interventions are effective. Despite high utilization of smartphones,
few studies evaluate text messaging for cessation in middle-/lower-income countries. Initiating
tobacco treatment in hospitals is an effective but underutilized approach for reaching smokers. We
evaluated a hybrid phone counseling/text messaging intervention for supporting cessation among
hospitalized smokers in Brazil.
Methods: We used an experimental design to assess the feasibility and potential effect size of the
intervention. Participants (N = 66) were recruited from a university hospital and randomized in a
2:1 ratio into TXT (one session of telephone counseling plus 2 weeks of text messaging; N = 44)
or Standard Care control group (N = 22). Participants lost to follow-up were counted as smokers.
Results: Counselors sent 1186 texts, of which 924 (77.9%) were received by study participants.
Participants rated the TXT content as “helpful” (80.4%) and the phone counseling length to be “just
right” (95.1%). Although the study was not powered to evaluate abstinence rates, we did observe
a higher prevalence of abstinence in the TXT compared to control group at both 1-month follow-up
(25.0% vs. 9.1%) and 3-month follow-up (31.8% vs. 9.1%). Carbon monoxide-verified abstinence at
month 3 was also higher in TXT (20.5% vs. 4.5%).
Conclusions: This hybrid telephone/text intervention should progress to full-scale effectiveness
testing as it achieved favorable outcomes, was acceptable to participants, and was readily imple-
mented. This type of intervention has strong potential for expanding the reach of hospital-initiated
tobacco treatment in middle-/lower-income countries.
Implications: This study extends research on hospital-initiated smoking cessation by establishing
the feasibility of a novel text-messaging approach for post-discharge follow-up. Text messaging is
a low-cost alternative to proactive telephone counseling that could help overcome resource barri-
ers in middle- and lower-income countries. This hybrid texting/counseling intervention identified
smokers in hospitals, established rapport through a single telephone follow-up, and expanded

acceptability and reach of later support by using text-messaging, which is free of charge in this and
other low-income countries. The favorable cessation outcomes achieved by the hybrid intervention
provide support for a fully powered effectiveness trial.
