Abstract
Background: Filipino Americans have a high prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease compared
with other Asian American subgroups and non-Hispanic whites. Mobile health (mHealth) weight loss interventions can reduce
chronic disease risks, but these are untested in Filipino Americans with T2D.
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and potential efficacy of a pilot, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of a culturally adapted mHealth weight loss lifestyle intervention (Pilipino Americans Go4Health [PilAm Go4Health])
for overweight Filipino Americans with T2D.
Methods: This was a 2-arm pilot RCT of the 3-month PilAm Go4Health intervention (phase 1) with an active waitlist control
and 3-month follow-up (phase 2). The waitlist control received the PilAm Go4Health in phase 2, whereas the intervention group
transitioned to the 3-month follow-up. PilAm Go4Health incorporated a Fitbit accelerometer, mobile app with diary for health
behavior tracking (steps, food/calories, and weight), and social media (Facebook) for virtual social support, including 7 in-person
monthly meetings. Filipino American adults ≥18 years with T2D were recruited from Northern California. Feasibility was measured
by rates of recruitment, engagement, and retention. Multilevel regression analyses assessed within and between group differences
for the secondary outcome of percent weight change and other outcomes of weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and steps.
Results: A total of 45 Filipino American adults were enrolled and randomized. Mean age was 58 (SD 10) years, 62% (28/45)
were women, and mean BMI was 30.1 (SD 4.6). Participant retention and study completion were 100%, with both the intervention
and waitlist group achieving near-perfect attendance at all 7 intervention office visits. Groups receiving the PilAm Go4Health in
phase 1 (intervention group) and phase 2 (waitlist group) had significantly greater weight loss, −2.6% (−3.9 to −1.4) and −3.3%
(−1.8 to −4.8), respectively, compared with the nonintervention group, resulting in a moderate to small effect sizes (d=0.53 and
0.37, respectively). In phase 1, 18% (4/22) of the intervention group achieved a 5% weight loss, whereas 82% (18/22) maintained
or lost 2% to 5% of their weight and continued to maintain this weight loss in the 3-month follow-up. Other health outcomes,
including waist circumference, BMI, and step counts, improved when each arm received the PilAm Go4Health, but the fasting
glucose and HbA1c outcomes were mixed.

Conclusions: The PilAm Go4Health was feasible and demonstrated potential efficacy in reducing diabetes risks in overweight
Filipino Americans with T2D. This study supports the use of mHealth and other promising intervention strategies to reduce
obesity and diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Further testing in a full-scale RCT is warranted. These findings may support
intervention translation to reduce diabetes risks in other at-risk diverse populations.
