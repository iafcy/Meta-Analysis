            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term smoking cessation efficacy of varying doses of transdermal nicotine delivery systems 4 to 5 years post-quit day.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A follow-up study was conducted 48 to 62 months after quit day among patients who were enrolled in the Transdermal Nicotine Study Group investigation. The latter study included group smoking cessation counseling and randomized assignment to 21, 14, or 7 mg nicotine patches or placebo patches. Seven of nine smoking cessation research centers participated in the long term follow-up investigation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The self-reported continuous quit rate among patients originally assigned 21 mg (20.2%) was significantly higher than rates for patients assigned 14 mg (10.4%), 7 mg (11.8%), or placebo patches (7.4%). Log rank survival analysis found no difference in relapse rates after 1 year postcessation. Smokers under age 30 years were significantly less likely to be abstinent at long term follow-up compared to smokers > or = 30 years of age (3 vs 13%, respectively). Mean weight gain in confirmed continuous quitters was 10.1 kg in men and 8.0 kg in women. Of the 63 continuous abstainers surveyed, 30 respondents (48%) reported that they no longer craved cigarettes, and no individual reported daily craving for cigarettes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Nicotine patch therapy with 21 mg/day patches resulted in a significantly higher long-term continuous abstinence rate compared to lower dose patches and placebo. Relapse rates among the various treatment conditions were similar after 1 year postcessation."

            "abstract": "There is an increasing emphasis on designing health promotion interventions for low-socioeconomic-status (SES) individuals. However, many previously developed behavior change tools have not been tested in this population. Self-efficacy was measured at pre- and postintervention as part of a randomized clinical trial to reduce cholesterol levels in rural low-SES Southern adults. A 22-item scale was designed and validated to measure subjects' confidence in their abilities to make dietary changes. High mean self-efficacy was noted in both control and intervention subjects at pre- and postintervention. Mean self-efficacy score was a significant predictor of dietary change at both preintervention and postintervention. This study demonstrates that self-efficacy is a predictor of ability to make dietary changes in a low-SES rural population. This finding is of significance to researchers and practitioners wishing to design theory-based health promotion interventions in this population."

Eighty-eight retirees (females = 72) aged 49-86 (M = 65.66, SD = 7.53) from South Brazil took part in the study, 54 (females = 48) in the experimental group (M = 66.37 years old, SD = 7.42), and 34 (females = 24) waitlist controls (M = 64.53 years old, SD = 7.68). The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Brazilian version of the scales: Interpersonal Reactivity Index; 12-item General Health Questionnaire; Life Orientation Test-Revised;14-item Perceived Stress Scale; Resilience Scale; and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Mixed factorial ANOVA models revealed significant decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress levels, whereas improvement in life satisfaction and resilience was detected in the experimental group at the end of the program. No main effect was found for empathy and optimism. Interaction effects yielded significant difference between groups for measures of empathy, optimism, depression, and anxiety symptoms after the program. There was no significant interaction effect for the other outcome variables. The usefulness and applicability of this model of intervention to aid future health practices and policies are discussed. Contextual issues in the fields of health promotion and disease prevention in Brazil are also problematized."

Analysis of data from 1,044 15-30-year-old prisoners produced evidence of HIV/AIDS risks in prisons. One percent of prisoners surveyed reported all three prison risk activities--engaging in sex, injecting drugs, and getting a tattoo. Two-by-two table analysis consistently showed statistically significant associations between risk activities. These results conservatively describe the presence and nature of such risks: Risks do occur, risks vary and the relationships between risks vary, and Russian prisoners already take steps to reduce risk. This evidence helps to justify and informs HIV/AIDS prevention and health promotion interventions in the Russian prison system."

            "abstract": "Obesity is a public health concern with significant economic costs affecting employers. Worksite wellness programs benefit from developing tailored interventions that consider employees' health-related knowledge and self-efficacy to change behavior. Correction is a high stress occupation with elevated rates of overweight and obesity. Poor stress management and barriers to achieve optimal health in the work environment increases the need for adequate knowledge and self-efficacy, or the level of confidence to eat healthy and be physically active. This cross-sectional pilot study used a sample of sixteen correctional employees who participated in a Nutrition and Physical Activity Questionnaire. This survey assesses knowledge and self-efficacy for nutrition and physical activity and current health behaviors, such as current dietary habits and level of physical activity. Demographic and anthropometric data were also collected for statistical analyses. Participants were primarily male correction officers working first shift with a mean (±SE) BMI of 29 (±1.05) kg/m2, classified as overweight. Multiple regression analyses revealed that knowledge and self-efficacy scores predicted variation in BMI when controlling for other scores in the model. Findings from this study may be applicable for future health promotion interventions in high-risk occupations. In high-risk occupations such as corrections, understanding environmental and organizational barriers to achieving good health and reducing chronic disease risk is important. However, in addition to reducing these barriers, increasing knowledge, improving skills and self-efficacy to achieve good health are also critical in order to develop effective interventions for this population."

Using models and theories of physical activity, we decided to systematically study the educational and promotional interventions carried out in Iran from 2003 to 2013.Three information databases were used to systematically select papers using key words including Iranian Magazine Database (MAGIRAN), Iran Medical Library (MEDLIB), and Scientific Information Database (SID). Twenty papers were selected and studied .Having been applied in 9 studies, The Trans Theoretical Model (TTM) was the most widespread model in Iran (PENDER in 3 studies, BASNEF in 2, and the Theory of Planned Behavior in 2 studies). With regards to the educational methods, almost all studies used a combination of methods. The most widely used Integrative educational method was group discussion. Only one integrated study was done. Behavior maintenance was not addressed in 75% of the studies. Almost all studies used self-reporting instruments. The effectiveness of educational methods was assessed in none of the studies. Most of the included studies had several methodological weaknesses, which hinder the validity and applicability of their results. According to the findings, the necessity of need assessment in using models, epidemiology and methodology consultation, addressing maintenance of physical activity, using other theories and models such as social marketing and social-cognitive theory, and other educational methods like empirical and complementary are suggested."

Participants were 110 adult nicotine dependent smokers interested in quitting smoking. All subjects received behavioral counseling and nicotine patches. Subjects were randomly assigned to the naltrexone or placebo group. Naltrexone was administered daily starting three days prior to the quit date (25 mg daily) and continued for 8 weeks thereafter (50 mg daily). Smoking cessation status was assessed at the end of treatment and at 24 week follow-up. The efficacy of naltrexone was moderated by depressive symptoms such that naltrexone was related to better quit rates than placebo at higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that individual differences in depressive symptoms may be important determinants of clinical response to naltrexone, and may help to clarify discrepancies in prior studies of naltrexone and smoking cessation."

The authors try to answer this question based on reflective analysis of four evaluations that they conducted in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali. The experiences reported illustrate the desire to conduct the evaluation approach in line with the principles of health promotion but also the difficulties involved to overcome the obstacles to practical application of evaluation. Considerable progress has yet to be made to ensure that evaluation fully meets the expectations of stakeholders and the values of health promotion : all of the dynamics generated by health promotion interventions must be taken into account, equity must be integrated at the heart of the reflection, innovative practices must be supported in view of their durability. Because it facilitates the emergence and sharing of multiple visions of this still poorly defined concept, evaluation constitutes an avenue to improvement of health promotion in Africa."

This paper explores how health needs assessments may be further strengthened for health promotion planning via an assessment of environmental assets rooted in the multiple environments (policy, information, social and physical environments) that shape health and behavior. Guided by a behavioral-ecological perspective- one that seeks to identify environmental assets that can influence health behavior, and an implementation science perspective- one that seeks to interweave health promotion strategies into existing environmental assets, we present a basic framework for assessing environmental assets and review examples from the literature to illustrate the incorporation of environmental assets into health program design. Health promotion practitioners and researchers implicitly identify and apply environmental assets in the design and implementation of health promotion interventions;this paper provides foundation for greater intentionality in assessing environmental assets for health promotion planning."

According to participants, the ERS was intended to facilitate both the improvement of available interventions and the improvement of health promotion in practice. While participants expected that describing and rating interventions promoted learning and enhanced the transferability of interventions, they were concerned that the ERS approach was not suitable for guiding intervention development and improving health promotion in practice. The expert committees that assessed the interventions struggled with a lack of norms for the relevance of effects and questions about how effects should be studied and rated. Health promotion practitioners were concerned that the ERS neglected the local adaptation of interventions and did not encourage the improvement of aspects like applicability and costs. Policy-makers and practitioners were worried that the lack of proven effectiveness legitimised cutbacks rather than learning and advancing health promotion.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      While measuring and centrally rating the effectiveness of interventions can be beneficial, the evidence based-inspired ERS approach is too limited to guide both intervention development and the improvement of health promotion in practice.

Whilst in the UK and Europe, gay businesses are increasingly recognized as being important settings through which to deliver HIV prevention and health promotion interventions to target vulnerable populations; in Japan such settings-based approaches are relatively underdeveloped. This article draws on qualitative data from a recently completed study conducted to explore whether it is feasible, acceptable and desirable to build on the recent European Everywhere project for adaptation and implementation in Japan. A series of expert workshops were conducted in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka with intersectoral representatives from Japanese and UK non-governmental organizations (NGOs), gay businesses, universities and gay communities (n = 46). Further discussion groups and meetings were held with NGO members and researchers from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Research Group on HIV Prevention Policy, Programme Implementation and Evaluation among MSM (n = 34). The results showed that it is desirable, feasible and acceptable to adapt and implement a Japanese version of Everywhere. Such a practical, policy-relevant, settings-based HIV prevention framework for gay businesses may help to facilitate the necessary scale up of prevention responses among MSM in Japan. Given the high degree of sexual mobility between countries in Asia, there is considerable potential for the Everywhere Project (or its Japanese variant) to be expanded and adapted to other countries within the Asia-Pacific region."

            "abstract": "Measurement of children's height and weight at regular intervals is important for identifying growth problems as well as for planning health promotion interventions for those at risk from under or over nutrition. Opportunistic measurement is recommended when children are seen by healthcare professionals for other reasons. Identification of variations in practice around measurement of height and weight in a children's unit led to the development of guidelines, purchase of new equipment, implementation of educational strategies and introduction of a growth link nurse role. Repeat audit revealed that these approaches did not bring about the desired changes in practice. Growth assessment is a quick, non invasive procedure that can provide valuable information about the general health and well being of the child but is perceived as a low priority by some healthcare professionals. Different approaches are needed to improve this important aspect of health care for children."

In fact, Australian evidence indicates the oral health of the community could be getting worse. It is now well-understood that this traditional surgical model of oral health care will never successfully manage the disease itself. It is proposed that a health-promoting, minimally invasive oral disease management model of care may lead to a sustainable benefit to the oral health status of the individual and community groups. The aim of this paper is to describe such a model of oral health care (MoC) currently being implemented by the North Richmond Community Health Oral Health (NRCH-OH) program in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; this model may serve as a template for other services to re-orient their healthcare delivery towards health promotion and prevention. The paper describes the guiding principles and theories for the model and also its operational components, which are: pre-engagement while on the waitlist; client engagement at the reception area; the assessment phase; oral health education (high-risk clients only); disease management; and reviews and recall."

Australian post-surgical breast cancer patients (N = 162) were assigned to either the 8-week Encore intervention or a Waitlist control. Intervention impact was assessed in terms of quality of life, cancer-specific distress, and social support. Changes in familiarity with exercise, self-efficacy and social support were tested as mediators of the intervention impact on quality of life. Overall adherence and satisfaction with the program were high. Significant enhancements at follow-up for quality of life and social support were evident for intervention compared with control participants. Familiarity with exercise and self-efficacy satisfied the requirements for mediation of quality of life. These findings provide evidence for psychosocial benefits of YWCA Encore multi-component program and support the use of such community-based programs for breast cancer survivors. The role of exercise familiarity and self-efficacy as probable mediators of the multi-component intervention is a critical finding and highlights the need for future investigations into the underlying mediating processes of similar interventions for cancer patients."

We also present several key considerations for the development of sexuality-based HIV health promotion directed toward this population, including the importance of developing HIV risk reduction messages that are responsive to (1) their predominant sexual and safer sex behavioral patterns; (2) the societal gender roles, norms, and scripts that guide heterosexual interactions; and (3) developmental and cultural influences on sexual behavior.

Although some data regarding health behaviors of this population exist, receptivity to health promotion is largely unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A survey was mailed to 380 survivors (age range, 11-33 years) of childhood leukemia, lymphoma, or central nervous system carcinomas (and guardians of survivors < 18 years old) to elicit data on exercise, dietary intake of calcium, fat, and fruits and vegetables, smoking status, readiness to pursue lifestyle change, quality of life, and interest in various health interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Responses from 209 survivors (a 55% response rate) suggested that most did not meet guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption (79%), calcium intake (68%), or exercise (52%), 42% were overweight/obese, and 84% consumed > 30% of calories from fat. Older (> 18 years) compared with younger (< 18 years) survivors were more likely to smoke (17% vs. 1%), to be obese (21.6% vs. 14.6%), and to have suboptimal calcium intakes (75.6% vs. 57.6%). No differences in lifestyle behaviors were observed between cancer groups. Compared with interventions aimed at weight control, improving self-esteem, or smoking cessation, the highest levels of interest were found consistently for interventions aimed at getting in shape and eating healthy. Survivors preferred mailed interventions to those delivered in-person, by telephone counselors, or via computers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Survivors of childhood cancer practiced several suboptimal health behaviors.

            "abstract": "This paper describes a review of the possibilities of improving HIV/AIDS prevention and reproductive health of teenagers and adolescents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This approach was based on compilation of institutional, political, legislative and national strategy data. The document review was completed by information collected from 15 key informants and by direct observation of the work of peer educators and community workers, allowing evaluation of the possibilities of development of the priority domains of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion in young adolescents. Health promotion interventions for adolescents are globally ensured institutionally by three specialized programmes of the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with numerous national and international partners. Organized operationally outside of the primary health care circuit, strategic actions are more specifically directed towards acquisition of knowledge than individual skills by means of IEC (information, education and communication) and (BCC) (behaviour change communication) approaches, but with disappointing results. Although traces of these five priority domains of the Ottawa Charter are perceptible in the national response to the health problems of adolescents, the work of the various actors is not coordinated and organized in compliance with health promotion guidelines. The training of health workers appears to be a major determinant to structure this response around a dynamic federating the actions of all stakeholders to orient them towards the options of the health promotion approach."

            "abstract": "Physical inactivity is one of the main modifiable risk factors for a range of noncommunicable diseases. Of particular interest are adult males, a hard-to-reach population group for health promotion interventions. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of the published health-related physical activity interventions that have targeted adult males. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHL®, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus™ was conducted for intervention studies published in English, between January 1990 and August 2010. Studies including community-dwelling adult men (≥ 18 years), or including both males and females where data on male participants could be extracted and examined, were included in this review. Studies assessing changes in levels of physical activity, physical fitness or changes in biomarkers of disease risk relevant to physical activity (e.g. body weight, waist circumference, lipids, blood pressure) were the primary focus. A total of 14 studies focusing on physical activity only and nine combined physical activity and nutrition studies were also included in this review. Ten of the 14 physical activity only studies and four of the nine combined physical activity and nutrition studies demonstrated significant increases in physical activity outcomes. Face-to-face, group-based and print-based methods were most commonly employed in these interventions. Within each mode of delivery, a number of elements including regular feedback, access to self-monitoring tools, elements of social support, variety in activities and a degree of friendly competition, were revealed as positive inclusions for this population group. Males are generally under-represented in health-promotion interventions and should therefore be targeted specifically, and while results of the included studies are encouraging, there is a lack of intervention studies targeting adult males. Further research into this population group is therefore required."

The current state of knowledge in this area was assessed using a specific method including a review of literature reviews and a classification of health promotion interventions identified using scientific databases. We found a large number of promising programmes. Briefly, some interventions based on environmental changes and provision of shade were considered to be promising. Health education programmes delivered at school have been proven to be effective in various settings, from nursery school to college. Some parentbased interventions designed to promote children's sun protection behaviours have been shown to be relevant. Appearance-based actions, using for instance photoaging information, may be effective. Finally, some multi-component interventions in community settings appear to be promising. These findings present a number of limitations due to the marked diversity of outcome measures and the general quality of the documents reviewed. Furthermore, most interventions are poorly described in the reviews. The present study should therefore be considered to be a first step that needs to be completed by a more detailed description of the promising interventions and of their transposition to the French context."

Based on this information, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial to assess the efficacy of simvastatin in smoking cessation. After informed consent, 118 participants received behavioral cessation support and were randomly assigned to a 3-month treatment with simvastatin or placebo. The primary outcome was biochemically verified abstinence or smoking reduction at 3-month post-target quit date (TQD). Secondary outcomes were abstinence during weeks 9-12 post-TQD, prolonged abstinence or reduction at months 6 and 12 post-TQD, safety and craving assessed at each visit during the 3-month period of treatment. Simvastatin treatment was not associated with higher 3-month abstinence or smoking reduction compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes. Simvastatin was well tolerated. Over 3 and 9 months follow-up period, 78% simvastatin and 69% placebo participants were retained in the study. At 6 and 12 months, smoking remained significantly reduced from baseline in both groups. Our results demonstrate that a 3-month simvastatin treatment (40 mg/day), added to individual behavioral cessation support, does not improve significantly smoking cessation compared to placebo in humans."

We drew on the concepts of intersectionality, representation and context from feminist, sociology and human geography literature, respectively, to help us understand how adaptations for ethnic groups approach the variable of ethnicity. Findings include (i) the intersections of ethnicity and demographic variables such as age and gender highlight the different ways in which people interact, interpret and participate in adapted interventions; (ii) the representational elements of ethnicity such as ancestry or religion are more complexly lived than they are defined in adapted interventions and (iii) the contextual experiences surrounding ethnicity considerations shape the receptivity, durability and continuity of adapted interventions.

Quitting smoking significantly benefits health, but for highly dependent smokers, unable to overcome their nicotine dependence, the concept of smoking reduction as a method of harm reduction is gaining ground. The University Hospital of Basle, Switzerland, has run double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation and smoking reduction studies: the CEASE trial evaluated the efficacy of the nicotine patch in achieving abstinence, and the Rosette study is evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the nicotine oral inhaler in smokers who do not wish to quit. Smokers were instructed either to quit smoking (CEASE) or to reduce cigarette consumption by > 50% (Rosette). In both studies, success rates for active treatment versus placebo at 4 months demonstrated that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is effective in achieving both smoking cessation and reduction. Current approaches to smoking cessation and reduction at our clinic are discussed. Combination NRT rather than monotherapy is commonly used to achieve both smoking reduction and cessation. Treatment appears to be most effective if subjects are allowed to select their preferred NRT product. There are clear differences in patient populations aiming to quit or reduce, the cessation population being more motivated. Smoking cessation remains the ultimate aim but, if unfeasible, a significant reduction in cigarette consumption is a valid goal."

            "abstract": "The use of qualitative methods can provide an in-depth understanding of the issues and barriers related to community health and can help to inform the planning of health promotion programs and interventions. Although there are many examples in the literature that describe the application of quantitative data to program planning, few articles explicitly describe the application of qualitative data, such as data gathered using focus groups, in-depth interviews, and windshield tours, in program planning. Using the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership in Detroit, Michigan, as a case study example, this article explains the methods of incorporating qualitative data into each stage of program planning and development, including community assessment, development of goals and objectives, implementation of activities, and program evaluation."

            "title": "An Experimental Feasibility Study of a Hybrid Telephone Counseling/Text Messaging Intervention for Post-Discharge Cessation Support Among Hospitalized Smokers in Brazil.",
            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nText messaging interventions are effective. Despite high utilization of smartphones, few studies evaluate text messaging for cessation in middle-/lower-income countries. Initiating tobacco treatment in hospitals is an effective but underutilized approach for reaching smokers. We evaluated a hybrid phone counseling/text messaging intervention for supporting cessation among hospitalized smokers in Brazil.\n## METHODS\nWe used an experimental design to assess the feasibility and potential effect size of the intervention. Participants (N = 66) were recruited from a university hospital and randomized in a 2:1 ratio into TXT (one session of telephone counseling plus 2 weeks of text messaging; N = 44) or Standard Care control group (N = 22). Participants lost to follow-up were counted as smokers.\n## RESULTS\nCounselors sent 1186 texts, of which 924 (77.9%) were received by study participants. Participants rated the TXT content as \"helpful\" (80.4%) and the phone counseling length to be \"just right\" (95.1%). Although the study was not powered to evaluate abstinence rates, we did observe a higher prevalence of abstinence in the TXT compared to control group at both 1-month follow-up (25.0% vs. 9.1%) and 3-month follow-up (31.8% vs. 9.1%). Carbon monoxide-verified abstinence at month 3 was also higher in TXT (20.5% vs. 4.5%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis hybrid telephone/text intervention should progress to full-scale effectiveness testing as it achieved favorable outcomes, was acceptable to participants, and was readily implemented. This type of intervention has strong potential for expanding the reach of hospital-initiated tobacco treatment in middle-/lower-income countries.\n## IMPLICATIONS\nThis study extends research on hospital-initiated smoking cessation by establishing the feasibility of a novel text-messaging approach for post-discharge follow-up. Text messaging is a low-cost alternative to proactive telephone counseling that could help overcome resource barriers in middle- and lower-income countries. This hybrid texting/counseling intervention identified smokers in hospitals, established rapport through a single telephone follow-up, and expanded acceptability and reach of later support by using text-messaging, which is free of charge in this and other low-income countries. The favorable cessation outcomes achieved by the hybrid intervention provide support for a fully powered effectiveness trial.\n"

Historically, both epidemiology and prevention activities have focused primarily on the islands' large heroin injector population. Although the available surveillance data indicate high rates of STIs and HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), there has been little social and behavioral research among MSM and hence little empirical information to inform intervention development and planning.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Given the absence of data on MSM and their importance in the emerging epidemic on the island, this paper describes a sample of MSM patients in an STI/HIV treatment center in the San Juan metropolitan area between October 2009 and June 2011 (n = 120). Assessment of sexual risk includes measures of onset of oral, vaginal, and anal sex, as well as current sexual practices and partner characteristics.

Barriers including language are associated with lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence seen among Latinos, yet ART and interventions for clinic visit adherence are rarely developed or delivered in Spanish.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe aim was to adapt a computer-based counseling tool, demonstrated to reduce HIV-1 viral load and sexual risk transmission in a population of English-speaking adults, for use during routine clinical visits for an HIV-positive Spanish-speaking population (CARE+ Spanish); the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the theoretical framework guiding program development.\n## METHODS\nA longitudinal randomized controlled trial was conducted from June 4, 2010 to March 29, 2012. Participants were recruited from a comprehensive HIV treatment center comprising three clinics in New York City. Eligibility criteria were (1) adults (age ≥18 years), (2) Latino birth or ancestry, (3) speaks Spanish (mono- or multilingual), and (4) on antiretrovirals. Linear and generalized mixed linear effects models were used to analyze primary outcomes, which included ART adherence, sexual transmission risk behaviors, and HIV-1 viral loads. Exit interviews were offered to purposively selected intervention participants to explore cultural acceptability of the tool among participants, and focus groups explored the acceptability and system efficiency issues among clinic providers, using the TAM framework.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 494 Spanish-speaking HIV clinic attendees were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention (arm A: n=253) or risk assessment-only control (arm B, n=241) group and followed up at 3-month intervals for one year. Gender distribution was 296 (68.4%) male, 110 (25.4%) female, and 10 (2.3%) transgender. By study end, 433 of 494 (87.7%) participants were retained. Although intervention participants had reduced viral loads, increased ART adherence and decreased sexual transmission risk behaviors over time, these findings were not statistically significant. We also conducted 61 qualitative exit interviews with participants and two focus groups with a total of 16 providers.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA computer-based counseling tool grounded in the TAM theoretical model and delivered in Spanish was acceptable and feasible to implement in a high-volume HIV clinic setting. It was able to provide evidence-based, linguistically appropriate ART adherence support without requiring additional staff time, bilingual status, or translation services. We found that language preferences and cultural acceptability of a computer-based counseling tool exist on a continuum in our urban Spanish-speaking population. Theoretical frameworks of technology's usefulness for behavioral modification need further exploration in other languages and cultures.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01013935; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01013935 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6ikaD3MT7).\n"

Current Aboriginal smokers (>16 years old), who were willing to make a quit attempt in the next month, were recruited from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and a government telephone coaching service. The intervention was a multifaceted Android or iOS app comprising a personalized profile and quit plan, text and in-app motivational messages, and a challenge feature allowing users to compete with others. The comparator was usual cessation support services. Outcome data collection and analysis were conducted blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence verified by carbon monoxide breath testing at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included point prevalence of abstinence and use of smoking cessation therapies and services.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 49 participants were recruited. Competing service delivery priorities, the lack of resources for research, and lack of support for randomization to a control group were the major recruitment barriers. At baseline, 23/49 (47%) of participants had tried to quit in recent weeks. At 6-month follow-up, only 1 participant (intervention arm) was abstinent. The process evaluation highlighted low to moderate app usage (3-10 new users per month and 4-8 returning users per month), an average of 2.9 sessions per user per month and 6.3 min per session. Key themes from interviews with intervention participants (n=15) included the following: (1) the powerful influence of prevailing social norms around acceptability of smoking; (2) high usage of mobile devices for phone, text, and social media but very low use of other smartphone apps; (3) the role of family and social group support in supporting quit attempts; and (4) low awareness and utilization of smoking cessation support services. Despite the broad acceptability of the app, participants also recommended technical improvements to improve functionality, greater customization of text messages, integration with existing social media platforms, and gamification features.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSmoking cessation apps need to be integrated with commonly used functions of mobile phones and draw on social networks to support their use. Although they have the potential to increase utilization of cessation support services and treatments, more research is needed to identify optimal implementation models. Robust evaluation is critical to determine their impact; however, an RCT design may not be feasible in this setting.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616001550493; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=371792 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/76TiV7HA6).\n"

Upon treatment completion, a questionnaire assessed participants' attributions of change along with their self-efficacy in their ability to maintain treatment gains. Participants differed in strength of attributions of change and self-efficacy according to both their therapy condition and their hypothesized medication condition. Specifically, those in the MBSCT condition who hypothesized that they received placebo displayed greater confidence in continuing changes without medication compared with the other groups. How treatment condition and attributions of change relate to self-efficacy for long-term maintenance of treatment gains are discussed."

Existing health and social care structures rarely meet the needs of YOD patients. Internet-based interventions are a novel format of delivering health-related education, counseling, and support to this vulnerable yet underserved group.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The RHAPSODY (Research to Assess Policies and Strategies for Dementia in the Young) project is a European initiative to improve care for people with YOD by providing an internet-based information and skill-building program for family carers. The e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining support, and looking after oneself. It will be evaluated in a pilot study in three countries using a randomized unblinded design with a wait-list control group. Participants will be informal carers of people with dementia in Alzheimer's disease or behavioral-variant Frontotemporal degeneration with an onset before the age of 65 years. The primary outcome will be caregiving self-efficacy after 6 weeks of program use. As secondary outcomes, caregivers' stress and burden, carer health-related quality of life, caring-related knowledge, patient problem behaviors, and user satisfaction will be assessed. Program utilization will be monitored and a health-economic evaluation will also be performed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The RHAPSODY project will add to the evidence on the potential and limitations of a conveniently accessible, user-friendly, and comprehensive internet-based intervention as an alternative for traditional forms of counseling and support in healthcare, aiming to optimize care and support for people with YOD and their informal caregivers."

Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect.Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent.Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner."

            "abstract": "As recently discussed in the public health literature, many questions concerning 'structural' approaches in health promotion seem to remain unanswered. We argue that, before attempting to provide answers, it is essential to clarify the underlying theoretical assumptions in order to arrive at the right questions one should ask. To this end, we introduce into the current debate an existing theoretical framework that helps conceptualize structural and individual aspects of health promotion interventions at different levels of action. Using an example from the field of physical activity promotion, we illustrate how an integrated framework can help researchers and health promoters rethink important issues and design better interventions. In particular, such an approach may help overcome perceived distinctions between different types of approaches, re-conceptualize ideas about the effectiveness of interventions, and appropriately address issues of health disparities."

The main objective of this study was to obtain information on some of the factors that influence food-buying practices of grocery shoppers in London, Ontario. For this study, a copy of Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating tearsheet and a self-administered seven-item postcard-style questionnaire were distributed to 2,000 grocery shoppers in ten London A&P supermarkets; 29% of receptive shoppers (572 of 2,000) completed the survey. Grocery shoppers indicated that price, freshness and health considerations were the top three factors considered important when buying food. Average food expenditure for a family of three was approximately $103 per week. A majority of respondents (55%) wanted more information on healthy food choices. The results may provide information for health educators to understand better the factors that influence grocery shoppers food-buying practices. Knowledge of these factors may also help health educators design nutrition information and health promotion interventions at point-of-purchase outlets that could be aimed at influencing more grocery shoppers to take steps toward healthier food-buying behaviours."

Participants were 107 undergraduate university students (mean age 22.3 ± 3.96 years).

No effects on DBP, high frequency component of HRV, the ratio of low- and high-frequency, and RT were found. Beyond actual caffeine intake, response expectancy score was also a determinant of subjective experience which refers to a placebo component in the total effect.

Although 95% CIs were wide, pooling of all-cause mortality found no difference between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50-1.52), including when stratified by participants with (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.40-3.83) and without (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40-1.48) cardiovascular disease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found no evidence that varenicline increases the rate of cardiovascular serious adverse events. Results were similar among those with and without cardiovascular disease. Given varenicline's efficacy as a smoking cessation drug and the long-term cardiovascular benefits of cessation, it should continue to be prescribed for smoking cessation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The support of health promotion activities for older people gains societal relevance in terms of enhancing the health and well-being of older people with a view to the efficient use of financial resources in the healthcare sector. Health economic evaluations have become an important instrument to support decision-making processes in many countries. Sound evidence on the cost-effectiveness of health promotion activities would encourage support for the implementation of health promotion activities for older people. This debate article discusses to what extent economic evaluation techniques are appropriate to support decision makers in the allocation of resources regarding health promotion activities for older people. We address the problem that the economic evaluation of these interventions is hampered by methodological obstacles that limit comparability, e.g. with economic evaluations of curative measures. Our central objective is to describe and discuss the specific problems and challenges entailed in the economic evaluation of health promotion activities especially for older people with regard to their usefulness for informing decision making processes.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Beyond general problems concerning the economic evaluation of health promotion, our discussion focusses on problems that pertain to the analysis of cost and outcomes of health promotion interventions for older people. With regard to costs these are general problems of economic evaluations, namely the actual implementation of a societal perspective, the appropriate measurement and valuation of informal caregiver time, the measurement and valuation of productivity costs and costs incurred in added years of life. The main problems concerning the identification and measurement of outcomes are related to the identification of outcome parameters that, firstly, adequately reflect the broad effects of health promotion interventions, especially social benefits that gain importance for older people, and secondly, ensure a comparability of effects across different age groups. In particular, the limitations of the widely used QALY for older people are discussed and recently developed alternatives are presented.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The key conclusion of the article is that a comparison of the effects of different health promotion initiatives between different age groups by means of economic evaluation is not recommendable. Taking into account the complex outcomes of health promotion interventions it has to be accepted that the outcomes of these interventions will often not be comparable with clinical interventions and have to be assessed differently."

Trials must provide very similar (ideally identical) levels of behavioural support or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to participants in active drug and comparator trial arms.The following RCT designs are considered acceptable.Placebo RCTs: any form of NRT or other pharmacotherapy, with or without behavioural support/CBT, or brief advice compared with placebo NRT and additional support of similar intensity.RCTs providing a comparison between i) behavioural support/CBT or brief advice and ii) any form of NRT or other pharmacotherapy added to behavioural support of similar (ideally identical) intensity.Parallel- or cluster-randomised design trials are eligible for inclusion.

Two assessors independently extracted data and cross checked individual outcomes of this process to ensure accuracy.

Subgroup analysis comparing placebo-RCTs with those which did not use placebos found that efficacy estimates for cessation varied with trial design (placebo RCTs, RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.56, four studies, 1524 women; non-placebo RCTs, RR 7.81, 95% CI 1.51 to 40.35, two studies, 221 women; P value for random-effects subgroup interaction test = 0.03).

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not NRT is effective or safe when used to promote smoking cessation in pregnancy or to determine whether or not using NRT has positive or negative impacts on birth outcomes. Further research evidence of efficacy and safety is needed, ideally from placebo-controlled RCTs that investigate higher doses of NRT than were tested in the included studies."

A qualitative case study was carried out. Data were collected from participating LHWs (n = 11) via anonymized online activity logs (n = 7) and semi-structured interviews (n = 7). Deductive-inductive thematic analysis was guided by five a priori themes identified from the literature: community relationships; intrinsic traits, values and motivations; capacity building; program design; and work conditions. Data supported the enablers and barriers to program effectiveness and implementation reported by previous research. Subthemes identified the importance of the LHW bridging role; the empowerment model; integrating the program; and program inclusiveness. This research contributes to the growing practice literature regarding how to effectively implement diverse LHW models in diverse settings.

A cross-sectional study was performed in order to investigate health promotion interventions among mental health service outpatients. A sample of 135 patients was used to test the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire designed to measure subjective experiences of health promotion interventions carried out by the mental health services. The factor structure of the questionnaire was tested by means of principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation. Reliability was measured in terms of internal consistency of the factors and test-retest reliability in a subsample of patients. The final scale contained 19 items derived from four factors: alliance, empowerment, educational support, and practical support. In terms of internal consistency, reliability was found to be good, both for the overall scale and the subscales.

            "abstract": "On an urban planet, slums or informal settlements present an increasing challenge for health promotion. The living conditions in complex informal settlements interact with how people navigate through their daily lives and political institutions to shape health inequities. In this article, we suggest that only a relational place-based characterization of informal settlements can accurately capture the forces contributing to existing urban health inequities and inform appropriate and effective health promotion interventions. We explore our relational framework using household survey, spatial mapping and qualitative focus group data gathered in partnership with residents and non-governmental organizations in the Mathare informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. All data interpretation included participation with local residents and organizations. We focus on the inter-relationships between inadequate sanitation and disease, social, economic and human rights for women and girls, who we show are most vulnerable from poor slum infrastructure. We suggest that this collaborative process results in co-produced insights about the meanings and relationships between infrastructure, security, resilience and health. We conclude that complex informal settlements require relational and context-specific data gathering and analyses to understand the multiple determinants of health and to inform appropriate and effective healthy city interventions."

An understanding of the impact of these previous attempts to quit is vital for selecting medications that may be more successful in a future attempt to quit. In particular, the effect of repeated use of bupropion SR (Zyban; INN, amfebutamone) on abstinence rates has not been studied previously.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 450 smokers who had previously used bupropion in a smoking cessation attempt.

Empirical support for the stress process model exists for several caregiving contexts, but little research has investigated the Parkinson's disease caregiving experience in Mexico. Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, the objective of this study was to examine whether resilience moderates the relation between perceived stress and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico. Data were collected from April 2015 to February 2016 during outpatient neurology appointments in Mexico City, Mexico. Participants included informal caregivers (N = 95) for a family member with Parkinson's disease. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing their level of perceived stress, resilience, and HRQOL. Regression analyses indicated that resilience moderated the inverse relation between perceived stress and mental HRQOL. However, contrary to hypotheses, resilience did not moderate the relation between stress and physical HRQOL. Findings shed light on resilience as a potential protective factor for mental HRQOL among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico and indicate that resilience may be beneficial to target in mental health promotion interventions."

Across these countries, health-promoting approaches are increasingly viewed as the long-term strategies most likely to prove clinically effective and cost-effective for preventing disease and improving health outcomes in those with established disease.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To identify, appraise and interpret research on the approaches employed to maximise the cross-cultural appropriateness and effectiveness of health promotion interventions for smoking cessation, increasing physical activity and improving healthy eating for African-, Chinese- and South Asian-origin populations.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Two national conferences; seven databases of UK guidelines and international systematic reviews of health promotion interventions aimed at the general population, including the Clinical Evidence, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network databases (1950-2009); 11 databases of research on adapted health promotion interventions for ethnic minority populations, including BIOSIS, EMBASE and MEDLINE (1950-2009); and in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of researchers and health promoters.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      Theoretically based, mixed-methods, phased programme of research that involved user engagement, systematic reviews and qualitative interviews, which were integrated through a realist synthesis. Following a launch conference, two reviewers independently identified and extracted data from guidelines and systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions for the general population and any guidance offered in relation to how to interpret this evidence for ethnic minority populations. Data were thematically analysed. Reviewers then independently identified and critically appraised studies of adapted interventions and summarised data to assess feasibility, acceptability, equity, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed. The quantitative and qualitative data were then synthesised using a realist framework to understand better how adapted interventions work and to assess implementation considerations and prioritise future research. Our preliminary findings were refined through discussion and debate at an end-of-study national user engagement conference.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Initial user engagement emphasised the importance of extending this work beyond individual-centred behavioural interventions to also include examination of community- and ecological-level interventions; however, individual-centred behavioural approaches dominated the 15 relevant guidelines and 111 systematic reviews we identified. The most consistent evidence of effectiveness was for pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation. This body of work, however, provided scant evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions for ethnic minority groups. We identified 173 reports of adapted health promotion interventions, the majority of which focused on US-based African Americans. This body of evidence was used to develop a 46-item Typology of Adaptation and a Programme Theory of Adapted Health Promotion Interventions. Only nine empirical studies directly compared the effectiveness of culturally adapted interventions with standard health promotion interventions, these failing to yield any consistent evidence; no studies reported on cost-effectiveness. The 26 qualitative interviews highlighted the need to extend thinking on ethnicity from conventional dimensions to more contextual considerations. The realist synthesis enabled the production of a decision-making tool (RESET) to support future research.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The lack of robust evidence of effectiveness for physical activity and healthy-eating interventions in the general population identified at the outset limited the comparative synthesis work we could undertake in the latter phases. Furthermore, the majority of studies undertaking an adapted intervention were conducted within African American populations; this raises important questions about the generalisability of findings to, for example, a UK context and other ethnic minority groups. Lastly, given our focus on three health areas and three populations, we have inevitably excluded many studies of adapted interventions for other health topics and other ethnic minority populations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is currently a lack of evidence on how best to deliver smoking cessation, physical activity and healthy eating-related health promotion interventions to ethnic minority populations. Although culturally adapting interventions can increase salience, acceptability and uptake, there is as yet insufficient evidence on the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of these adapted approaches. More head-to-head comparisons of adapted compared with standard interventions are warranted. The Typology of Adaptation, Programme Theory of Adapted Health Promotion Interventions and RESET tool should help researchers to develop more considered approaches to adapting interventions than has hitherto been the case.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."

Furthermore, because prices decreased drastically, a previously published model was adapted applying recent cost data from the Belgian national health insurance. Eleven full economic evaluations were identified. Nine studies compared statins with no treatment and presented heterogeneous results. If alternative interventions, such as smoking cessation or low-dose aspirin treatment were included in the analysis, statin therapy became less cost-effective. Prescribing the cheapest statin on the Belgian market (< Euro 90 medication cost per year) resulted in an incremental cost of Euro 29,173 per life-year gained (LYG) in a male high-risk group aged 60 compared to low-dose aspirin. The incremental cost in a male moderate-risk group aged 50 was Euro 87,022/LYG. Low-dose aspirin was more cost-effective ranging from Euro 3,854/LYG to Euro 29,509/LYG compared to smoking cessation therapy. Smoking cessation therapy was the most cost-effective intervention, providing savings compared to no treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In Belgium, the cost-effectiveness of statins for the primary prevention of CVD is rather elevated in comparison with low-dose aspirin, even if the cheapest statin is prescribed. From an economic point of view, prevention with low-dose aspirin is more cost-effective and may present a first choice in primary prevention. Smoking cessation, which is a dominant strategy, should be encouraged at all times."

The benefits of healthier lifestyles for older adults include increased functional ability and improved quality of life. The Study of Exercise and Nutrition in Older Rhode Islanders (SENIOR) Project is a multibehavioral health promotion intervention for community-dwelling older adults focusing on increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable consumption. Intervention materials are stage-tailored for each individual, and include manuals, newsletters, expert system assessments and reports, and telephone coaching. The primary purpose of the SENIOR Project is to investigate the relative effectiveness of a multiple-behavior intervention-based on a single theoretical framework-compared to single-behavior interventions. The secondary purposes are to investigate the intervention's effects on both functional ability and general health outcomes, and how older adults move along a continuum of changing health behaviors. The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change, the conceptual framework for the SENIOR Project, was chosen for the following reasons: performance potential with older adults, individual tailoring on a stage basis, technological features, and interdisciplinary research base and community partnership."

By means of this mechanism, NTX could result in temporary increases in smoking followed by decreased smoking rates among alcoholics not motivated to quit smoking. The change from pretreatment in smoking rates of 73 recently abstinent alcoholics in a 12-week clinical trial of NTX vs. placebo during alcoholism treatment was compared during 8 of the 12 weeks. Only smokers compliant with NTX were included in the analyses. NTX was associated with decreased smoking at every time point, but the effect was significant at only one time point. When alcohol relapsers were excluded, NTX patients showed decreased smoking at every time point, but the effect was significant at only two time points, a reduction of about five cigarettes per day. When smoking stage of change was included in the analyses, NTX showed no significant main or interaction effects on smoking rate. Precontemplators showed significantly less change in smoking rate than all other patients at the first and last four time points. Therefore, NTX alone currently does not show promise for promoting smoking reduction among recently abstinent alcoholics who have not sought or been given smoking cessation treatment. Further research is needed on possible effects with smokers motivated to quit smoking and on other methods of promoting smoking cessation among alcoholics."

We report the combined results, using a pooled analysis, of three previously unpublished trials assessing rimonabant as a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy conducted between 2002 and 2004. Smokers (n = 2097) motivated to quit were enrolled in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, STRATUS EU, US, and META, which consisted of a 10-week treatment period with either rimonabant 20 mg (n = 789), 5 mg (n = 518; used in only two of the three studies), or placebo (n = 790), in conjunction with brief counseling. The impact of drug on prolonged abstinence and adverse events was examined at 8 weeks (end-of-treatment) and at 48 weeks (available for STRATUS EU and US) after the targeted quit date. Rimonabant 20 mg resulted in significantly higher abstinence at end-of-treatment and at 48 weeks post-targeted quit date compared with placebo, while rimonabant 5 mg and placebo did not differ. Serious AEs did not differ by drug group. The 20 mg rimonabant dose, compared with placebo, produced increased nausea, diarrhea, anxiety symptoms, hyporexia, and vomiting, and decreased headache, constipation, and cough. These results support rimonabant 20 mg as a modestly effective aid for smoking cessation. Although work on CB1 antagonists such as rimonabant has mostly been stopped because of unacceptable adverse events, these results may inform and spur the development of other endocannabinoids for smoking cessation."

It considers how evidence concerning effectiveness in health promotion is established through a sequence of research studies, and how such evidence is applied by health promotion practitioners and policy markers in deciding what to do and what to found when addressing public health problems. There are too few rewards for researchers to pursue research with potential for widespread application, and to systematically develop promising interventions to a stage of field dissemination. Practitioners often find themselves in the position of tackling a public health problem where evidence of efficacy is either lacking, or has to be considered alongside a desire to respond to expressed community needs, or the need to respond to political imperative. Some of the major structural barriers which prevent the flow of research into practice are considered, and different approaches to improving the fit between research and practice are proposed."

The purpose of this review is to assist health plans and disease management leaders in making informed decisions for weight management services.

The cost-effectiveness of obesity-related interventions is highly dependent on the risk status of the treated population, as well as the length, cost, and effectiveness of the intervention. Bariatric surgery offers high initial costs and uncertain long-term cost savings. From the perspective of a payor, obesity management services are as cost-effective as other commonly offered health services, though not likely to offer cost savings.

Over the past several decades, the science of subjective well-being has produced insights into these benefits of happiness, and-recognizing their importance-has begun to examine the factors that lead to greater well-being, from cultivating strong relationships to pursuing meaningful goals. However, studies to date have typically focused on improving subjective well-being by intervening with singular constructs, using primarily college student populations, and were short-term in nature. Moreover, little is understood about the impact of a well-being treatment delivered online vs. in-person. In the present article, we describe a comprehensive intervention program including 3-month initial treatment followed by a 3-month follow-up, ENHANCE: Enduring Happiness and Continued Self-Enhancement. One-hundred and sixty participants will be recruited from two different sites to participate in one of two versions of ENHANCE: in-person (n=30) vs. wait-list control (n=30); or online (n=50) vs. wait-list control (n=50). Assessments will be completed at baseline, three months and six months. Our primary outcome is change in subjective well-being across treatment (3months) and follow-up (6months). Secondary outcomes include self-report and objective measures of health, as well as a psychological mediators (e.g., psychological needs) and moderators (e.g., personality) of treatment outcomes.

While such preparedness is vital, we have long-observed a gap in preventive medicine and disaster planning for building personal resilience--preventatively--to persevere through prolonged recovery timeframes. There are many helpful attitudes and behaviors that people can develop to increase their readiness and capacity for drastic life changes, encompassing not only health-protective preparedness actions but health-promoting attitudes for \"minding the risk\" and \"practicing resilience\" as well. For instance, quality of life assessments and well-being interventions are widely-known for the clinically significant improvements they can produce in patient-reported outcomes. Similarly, health promotion interventions are implemented preventatively when a risk is identified yet a disease is not present, and can provide health benefits throughout people's lives, regardless of the type of adversities they eventually encounter (medical, environmental, or other).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We argue there is an overlooked opportunity to leverage well-being theories and methods from clinical settings and public health practice for the purpose of preventatively boosting disaster readiness and bolstering capacity for long-term resilience. We also highlight our previously-published research indicating a role for integrating personal meaning into preparedness messages. This is an opportune time for applying well-being concepts and practices as tools for developing disaster readiness, as risk awareness grows through real-time tracking of hazardous events via social media. For example, two sudden-onset disasters occurred within ten days of each other in 2014 and caught worldwide attention for their extreme hazards, despite dramatic differences in scale. The 22 March 2014 landslide tragedy in Washington State, USA, and the 1 April 2014 Chilean earthquake and Pacific-wide tsunami alerts brought home how persistently vulnerable we all are, and how developing intrinsic personal readiness for scientifically-known risks before disaster unfolds is essential policy. Gap programming that addresses personal readiness challenges in prevention timeframes could save lives and costs. We contend that bridging this readiness gap will prevent situations where people, communities, and systems survive the initial impact, but their resilience trajectories are vulnerable to the challenges of long-haul recovery."

Although more than 70% of smokers express a desire to quit, fewer than 3% remain abstinent for more than one year, highlighting a critical need for more efficacious smoking cessation treatments. Areas covered: The authors discuss the rationale, preclinical and clinical development of varenicline for smoking cessation. They cover the development of varenicline as a partial agonist at α4β2 receptors, the primary neural substrate for nicotine reward. Then, they discuss evidence from preclinical studies indicating varenicline's efficacy in blocking nicotine reward, followed by clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in sustaining abstinence in smokers. Finally, they cover post-market surveillance, including caution in heavy machine operators, putative cardiovascular risk, and the repealed warning for adverse neuropsychiatric events. Expert opinion: Varenicline development was based on strong theoretical rationale and preclinical evidence. Clinical studies indicate that varenicline is safe and more effective in sustaining abstinence than placebo, bupropion or nicotine replacement therapies. However, given that continuous abstinence rates across studies remain low (18 ~ 30% with varenicline; 4 ~ 10% with placebo), novel and more effective medications targeting other nicotinic or glutamate receptors for smoking cessation are required."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In healthy smokers, antidepressants can double the odds of cessation. Because of its four times lower costs and comparable efficacy in healthy smokers, nortriptyline appears to be favourable compared to bupropion. We assessed which of both drugs was most effective and cost-effective in stopping smoking after 1 year compared with placebo among smokers at risk or with existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 255 participants, aged 30-70 years, received smoking cessation counselling and were assigned bupropion, nortriptyline or placebo randomly for 12 weeks. Prolonged abstinence from smoking was defined as a participant's report of no cigarettes from week 4 to week 52, validated by urinary cotinine. Costs were calculated using a societal perspective and uncertainty was assessed using the bootstrap method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prolonged abstinence rate was 20.9% with bupropion, 20.0% with nortriptyline and 13.5% with placebo. The differences between bupropion and placebo [relative risk (RR) = 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-3.0] and between nortriptyline and placebo (RR = 1.5; 95% CI 0.8-2.9) were not significant. Severity of airway obstruction did not influence abstinence significantly. Societal costs were 1368 euros (2.5th-97.5th percentile 193-5260) with bupropion, 1906 euros (2.5th-97.5th 120-17 761) with nortriptyline and 1212 euros (2.5th-97.5th 96-6602) with placebo. Were society willing to pay more than 2000 euros for a quitter, bupropion was most likely to be cost-effective.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion and nortriptyline seem to be equally effective, but bupropion appears to be more cost-effective when compared to placebo and nortriptyline. This impression holds using only health care costs. As the cost-effectiveness analyses concern some uncertainties, the results should be interpreted with care and future studies are needed to replicate the findings."

            "abstract": "Objective: To understand what motivates sedentary indigenous and ethnic minority men to become more physically active. Design: We use thematic analysis to present data from a qualitative study exploring 23 sedentary indigenous Māori (New Zealand) men's experiences of completing a 12-week exercise intervention to improve their metabolic health. Results: Four themes emerged: The Bros - having fellowship and mutual motivation; Being better informed about exercise; Impacting overall wellbeing; and Disseminating the findings beyond the study Exercise interventions informed by indigenous Māori cultural values and knowledge increased its relevance to their daily lives. The motivation for these indigenous men was more culturally-based external factors than an inherent desire to lose weight. Conclusion: Indigenous and minority men in many developed countries have high morbidity and premature mortality related to sedentary lifestyles. The low uptake of physical activities possibly relates to focusing more on outcomes such as weight loss which lacks cultural relevance. When offering health promotion interventions for marginalized populations these findings highlight the importance of culturally tailoring interventions to the unique sources of motivation for each group to increase activity to improve their efficacy."

The experiences of African women in the diaspora practicing elongation are not thoroughly understood. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the health harms and benefits associated with this practice of Zambian women who have migrated to Cape Town, South Africa. Twenty women and seventeen men participated in this study. Between December 2013 and May 2014, in-depth interviews and natural group discussions were conducted with the participants. The focus of this article is to report on the emic of the women related to notions of health, hygiene, and well-being. Labial elongation is perceived as a practice involving minor, short-term adverse effects that can be prevented by following some basic hygiene. Overall, personal and social value is placed on this practice because of its reported benefits for the sexual health of men and women, and for women's femininity and self-image. Further research is necessary on how female genital modifications influence Zambians' sexual preferences to inform the development of culturally appropriate health promotion interventions."

The participants were 48 heterosexual young adult males who attended 2 laboratory sessions. During Session 1, participants completed a set of screening and individual differences measures, and during Session 2 they were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 beverage conditions: control, alcohol (0.65 g alcohol/kg body weight), or placebo. Following the experimental manipulation, all participants completed measures regarding attitudes toward condom use, intention to engage in risky sex, and condom use negotiation skills. The results showed that participants who consumed alcohol had poorer negotiation skills and greater intention to engage in risky sex compared to participants who did not drink alcohol. Although alcohol did not affect any dimension of attitude regarding condom use, attitude about condoms' effects on sex, as well as sexual sensation seeking, were correlated with both intention ratings and skills. Multiple regression models, including both attitudes and sensation seeking, showed that attitudes accounted for 20-25% of variance independent of beverage condition in predicting intention ratings and skills. The findings were consistent with past research showing that alcohol consumption can have detrimental effects on determinants of sexual health behavior and that individual differences factors can enhance the power of models like the IMB to predict such behavior."

The main purpose of these aids is to reduce pain, improve physical function and, possibly, slow disease progression. This is the second update of the original review published in Issue 1, 2005, and first updated in 2007.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the benefits and harms of braces and foot/ankle orthoses in the treatment of patients with OA of the knee.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE (current contents, HealthSTAR) up to March 2014. We screened reference lists of identified trials and clinical trial registers for ongoing studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised and controlled clinical trials investigating all types of braces and foot/ankle orthoses for OA of the knee compared with an active control or no treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tool of The Cochrane Collaboration. We analysed the quality of the results by performing an overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. As a result of heterogeneity of studies, pooling of outcome data was possible for only three insole studies.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 13 studies (n = 1356): four studies in the first version, three studies in the first update and six additional studies (n = 529 participants) in the second update. We included studies that reported results when study participants with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren & Lawrence grade I-IV) were treated with a knee brace (valgus knee brace, neutral brace or neoprene sleeve) or an orthosis (laterally or medially wedged insole, neutral insole, variable or constant stiffness shoe) or were given no treatment. The main comparisons included (1) brace versus no treatment; (2) foot/ankle orthosis versus no treatment or other treatment; and (3) brace versus foot/ankle orthosis. Seven studies had low risk, two studies had high risk and four studies had unclear risk of selection bias. Five studies had low risk, three studies had high risk and five studies had unclear risk of detection bias. Ten studies had high risk and three studies had low risk of performance bias. Nine studies had low risk and four studies had high risk of reporting bias.Four studies compared brace versus no treatment, but only one provided useful data for meta-analysis at 12-month follow-up. One study (n = 117, low-quality evidence) showed lack of evidence of an effect on visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores (absolute percent change 0%, mean difference (MD) 0.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 0.84), function scores (absolute percent change 1%, MD 1.0, 95% CI -2.98 to 4.98) and health-related quality of life scores (absolute percent change 4%, MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.04) after 12 months. Many participants stopped their initial treatment because of lack of effect (24 of 60 participants in the brace group and 14 of 57 participants in the no treatment group; absolute percent change 15%, risk ratio (RR) 1.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.82). The other studies reported some improvement in pain, function and health-related quality of life (P value ≤ 0.001). Stiffness and treatment failure (need for surgery) were not reported in the included studies.For the comparison of laterally wedged insole versus no insole, one study (n = 40, low-quality evidence) showed a lower VAS pain score in the laterally wedged insole group (absolute percent change 16%, MD -1.60, 95% CI -2.31 to -0.89) after nine months. Function, stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and adverse events were not reported in the included study.For the comparison of laterally wedged versus neutral insole after pooling of three studies (n = 358, moderate-quality evidence), little evidence was found of an effect on numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores (absolute percent change 1.0%, MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.65), Western Ontario-McMaster Osteoarthritis Scale (WOMAC) stiffness scores (absolute percent change 0.1%, MD 0.07, 95% CI -4.96 to 5.1) and WOMAC function scores (absolute percent change 0.9%, MD 0.94, 95% CI - 2.98 to 4.87) after 12 months. Evidence of an effect on health-related quality of life scores (absolute percent change 1.0%, MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03) was lacking in one study (n = 179, moderate-quality evidence). Treatment failure and adverse events were not studied for this comparison in the included studies.Data for the comparison of laterally wedged insole versus valgus knee brace could not be pooled. After six months' follow-up, no statistically significant difference was noted in VAS pain scores (absolute percent change -2.0%, MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.75) and WOMAC function scores (absolute percent change 0.1%, MD 0.1, 95% CI -7.26 to 0.75) in one study (n = 91, low-quality evidence); however both groups showed improvement. Stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and adverse events were not reported in the included studies for this comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence was inconclusive for the benefits of bracing for pain, stiffness, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with medial compartment knee OA. On the basis of one laterally wedged insole versus no treatment study, we conclude that evidence of an effect on pain in patients with varus knee OA is lacking. Moderate-quality evidence shows lack of an effect on improvement in pain, stiffness and function between patients treated with a laterally wedged insole and those treated with a neutral insole. Low-quality evidence shows lack of an effect on improvement in pain, stiffness and function between patients treated with a valgus knee brace and those treated with a laterally wedged insole. The optimal choice for an orthosis remains unclear, and long-term implications are lacking."

            "abstract": "The current article suggests that the core characteristics of the Internet--its anonymity, accessibility, affordability, privacy, and acceptability--make it ideally suited as an efficient and effective channel for delivery of sexual and reproductive health promotion interventions. The authors analysis also asserts that it is essential to create Internet-based sexual and reproductive health promotion efforts that are based upon comprehensive and empirically validated models of the initiation and maintenance of health behavior change. Accumulated research shows that the Internet is indeed a widely used and important resource for information concerning sexuality for many individuals, with particularly widespread utilization among younger individuals. In this context, numerous successful attempts have been made to exploit the Internet for the promotion of behaviors essential to sexuality and reproductive health, although these effects have often been limited in scope. The current discussion concludes with theoretical and practical illustrations of Internet-based sexual and reproductive health interventions, employing a theoretical foundation, the Information- motivation-behavioral skills model of sexual and reproductive health, and an internet delivery vehicle, www.sexualityandu.ca, that is based upon it."

To date, no method of cessation in long-term users has been studied in a randomized trial. We enrolled 26 subjects at the Mayo Clinic site of the Lung Health Study who had used nicotine gum for more than 6 months to participate in a trial where subjects were randomly assigned to: (1) abrupt cessation, (2) taper with placebo gum, or (3) taper with active gum. At the end of the 6-week trial, the percentage of subjects abstinent from gum use and not smoking was not different among the three groups: 66.7% for the abrupt cessation group, 71.4% for the taper with placebo gum group and 60% for the taper with active gum group. One subject in the taper with placebo gum group relapsed to smoking during the trial but was abstinent from smoking again at long-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up (median 284 days) showed 65% of subjects were abstinent from all nicotine products. Motivated subjects can stop long-term nicotine gum use without relapse to gum use or smoking by either abrupt cessation or brief tapering."

            "abstract": "The present study investigates attitudes towards aspects of health promotion in mental health services, as rated by patients and staff. The aim of the study was to investigate similarities and differences in attitudes towards health promotion interventions among patients and staff in mental health services, using a newly developed questionnaire, the Health Promotion Intervention Questionnaire (HPIQ). The study has a cross-sectional design and a sample of 141 patients and 140 staff were recruited to the study. The response rate was 59% for the patients and 50% for the staff. The participants were asked to rate the attitudes of the 19 items included in the HPIQ. The result showed that patients and staff in some cases share similar attitudes regarding aspects of health promotion intervention. According to both groups, empowerment is the most important intervention in health promotion. Significant differences between the ratings of patients and staff appeared regarding all subscales of HPIQ. Patients rated alliance and educational support significantly higher than staff and staff-rated empowerment and practical support significantly higher than patients. Based on these findings, it is of importance to meet patients' desire for information and knowledge in an interactive manner with an empowerment approach to promote health in mental health services."

            "abstract": "Using carers to help assess, monitor, or promote health in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) may be one way of improving health outcomes in a population that experiences significant health inequalities. This paper provides a review of carer-led health interventions in various populations and healthcare settings, in order to investigate potential roles for carers in ID health care. We used rapid review methodology, using the Scopus database, citation tracking and input from ID healthcare professionals to identify relevant research. 24 studies were included in the final review. For people with ID, the only existing interventions found were carer-completed health diaries which, while being well received, failed to improve health outcomes. Studies in non-ID populations show that carers can successfully deliver screening procedures, health promotion interventions and interventions to improve coping skills, pain management and cognitive functioning. While such examples provide a useful starting point for the development of future carer-led health interventions for people with ID, the paucity of research in this area means that the most appropriate means of engaging carers in a way that will reliably impact on health outcomes in this population remains, as yet, unknown."

Daily smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day who had no intention to quit smoking in the next 6 months were recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to either a 6-month treatment of nicotine (choice among a 15-mg nicotine patch, a 4-mg nicotine gum, a 10-mg nicotine inhaler, or a combination of these, N = 265), matching placebo products (N = 269), or no intervention (N = 389). Products were sent to participants by mail. Education was limited to a booklet. Of 923 participants, 879 (95%) were followed up after 6 months. Mean baseline consumption was 30 cigarettes per day in all groups. At 6 months, cigarette consumption decreased by a median of 10 cigarettes per day in the nicotine group, 7.5 in the placebo group, and 2.5 among controls ( < 0.04 for all pair-wise comparisons). Smoking cessation rates were low (2%-4%) and did not differ significantly between groups. Quit attempts were less frequent among controls (21%) than among the nicotine (28%, = 0.04) and placebo (27%, = 0.08) subjects. In conclusion, nicotine replacement therapy helped smokers reduce their cigarette consumption and maintain this reduction over 6 months, but a large part of this reduction was attributable to a placebo effect. Nicotine treatment for smoking reduction had no detectable impact on smoking cessation."

The interventions involved 39 sedentary older adults living in senior congregate housing in Israel, each randomly assigned to an intervention program. Information about PA levels, self-efficacy, and social support for exercise was collected through personal interviews before, after, and at a one-month follow-up. At follow-up, participants were asked to report whether they remained in contact with other group members. Results: PASAI program participants showed significantly higher levels of PA compared to PA program participants. Both self-efficacy and social support were associated with changes in PA. In the PASAI program, 67% of participants remained in contact with other group members; by contrast, PA participants did not maintain any contact. Conclusion: Self-efficacy perception and on-going social support encourage adherence to PA."

We used purposive sampling to identify 19 people working in school-based health programmes and interviewed them about the barriers and enablers of successful collaboration. Data were analysed thematically. We found that collaboration between complex systems was a skilled endeavour which relied on a strong foundation of communication and interpersonal professional relationships. Understanding the core business, operational context and intersectoral point-of-view of collaborative partners was important both for establishing good intersectoral programmes and sustaining them as contexts and personnel changed. Aligning divergent sectoral agendas early in the collaborative process was essential for ensuring that all partners could meet their core business needs while also delivering the programme outcomes."

Data come from wave three (2011-2012) of the nationally-representative Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Sexual orientation was asked in the self-completion portion of the study. Markers of health include physical and mental functioning, minor psychological distress, self-rated health, substance use and disability. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses tested for differences in markers of health between sexual orientation groups. Overall, heterosexual respondents had the best health while bisexual respondents had the worst. Gay and lesbian respondents reported poorer health than heterosexuals, specifically with regards to mental functioning, distress and illness status. The other and PNS respondents were most similar to each other and generally experienced fewer health inequalities than gay and lesbian respondents; they were less likely to use tobacco or alcohol. In sum, sexual minorities experience health inequality. The inclusion of other and PNS respondents has not been done in other studies and shows that while they may be healthier than gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents they still experiences poorer health than heterosexuals.

The effects of exercise on self-efficacy, sleep, work ability, cognitive functioning and aerobic fitness (secondary outcomes) were also investigated. Methods Employees with high levels of work-related fatigue were randomly assigned to either a 6-week exercise intervention (EI; N=49) or a wait-list control group (WLC; N=47). All participants were measured pre- (T0) and post-intervention (T1). EI participants were also measured 6 (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the end of the intervention. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP). PP analyses only included EI participants (N=31) who completed the intervention and WLC participants (N= 35) who did not increase their exercise level during the wait period. Results Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that, at T1, the EI group reported lower emotional exhaustion and overall fatigue than the WLC group, however, only according to PP analyses. Both according to ITT and PP analyses, EI participants showed higher sleep quality, work ability, and self-reported cognitive functioning at T1 compared to WLC participants. Intervention effects were maintained at T2 and T3. Conclusions The exercise intervention had enduring effects on work-related fatigue and broader indicators of employee well-being. This study demonstrates that, in case of work-related fatigue, exercise does constitute a powerful medicine for those who comply with the treatment."

Two hundred participants reporting no strong nausea, no clear reduction in smoking enjoyment, and less than 50% reduction in their baseline smoking on day 12 received additional tablets of varenicline or placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      All participants began standard varenicline tartrate dosing, gradually increasing to 2 mg/d.

            "abstract": "The term 'culturally sensitive' is often used to describe interventions adapted for minority ethnic communities. However, understanding of strategies for adapting behavioural interventions for such communities is limited. The questions addressed in this paper are: What are the main strategies for adapting interventions to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) for minority ethnic communities? Why have interventions been adapted in these ways? A systematic review was carried out to investigate interventions for preventing CHD, including promoting physical activity, smoking cessation and healthier diets in Pakistani, Chinese and Indian communities in countries where these groups are minorities. International databases and key websites were searched, and 23 477 titles and abstracts were initially identified. Seventeen papers met inclusion and quality criteria. A 'meta-ethnographic' approach to data synthesis was employed to identify underlying principles for adapting interventions. The rationale underpinning adaptations is not made explicit in individual studies, limiting generalizability. Five principles for adapting behavioural interventions for minority ethnic communities were identified: (i) use community resources to publicize the intervention and increase accessibility; (ii) identify and address barriers to access and participation; (iii) develop communication strategies which are sensitive to language use and information requirements; (iv) work with cultural or religious values that either promote or hinder behavioural change; and (v) accommodate varying degrees of cultural identification. While the principles require further testing and verification, they have been generated through a systematic approach to study identification, quality appraisal and data synthesis. This represents significant progress in advancing understanding of adapted behavioural interventions for minority ethnic communities."

The aim of this study was to add experiential knowledge from former patients. We explored the lived experience of 12 former inpatients at a mental healthcare hospital. We describe what they perceive as mental health promoting efforts. A salutogenic theoretical framework and the methodology of interpretative phenomenological analysis were used. The analysis revealed an appetite for learning in order to develop an in depth understanding of their former experiences. This was motivated by a desire to master daily life despite living with an illness and to increase health and well-being. The participants perceived the learning processes within the healthcare setting as mental health promoting. This craving for a better life is compatible with health promotion.

Substantial evidence has shown that family caregivers suffer from significant health problems arising from the demands of caregiving. Although there are programs supporting caregivers, there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness. Acupressure is an ancient Chinese healing method designed to restore the flow of Qi (vital energy) by applying external pressure to acupoints. A randomized, wait-list controlled trial was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress (primary objective) and stress-related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life (secondary objectives) in Chinese caregivers of older family members.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred Chinese participants, aged ≥ 21 years, who are the primary caregivers of an older family member and screen positive for caregiver stress and symptoms of fatigue/insomnia/depression will be recruited from a community setting in Hong Kong.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the complete and continuous abstinence from smoking from the beginning of week 4 to the end of week 7. Participants were followed up at month 6. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      All patients were chronic smokers with a smoking history of about 51 pack-years. Continuous smoking abstinence rates from week 4 to 7 were significantly higher in participants receiving bupropion SR than in those receiving placebo (28% [57/204] vs 16% [32/200], p=0.003). Continuous abstinence rates from weeks 4 to 12 (18% [36/204] vs 10% [20/200]) and weeks 4 to 26 (16% [32/204] vs 9% [18/200]) were also higher in participants receiving bupropion SR than in those taking placebo (p<0.05). Furthermore, symptoms of tobacco craving and withdrawal were attenuated in those receiving bupropion SR. Seven individuals discontinued study medication because of adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion SRis a well-tolerated and effective aid to smoking cessation in people with mild to moderate COPD."

            "abstract": "This study examined the efficacy of two group treatments for pathological gambling, a node-link mapping-enhanced cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT-mapping) and twelve-step facilitated (TSF) group treatment. Forty-nine participants meeting criteria for pathological gambling were recruited from local newspaper advertisements. These participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: TSF (n = 11), CBGT-mapping (n = 18), and Wait-List control (n = 9); 11 refused treatment prior to randomization. Outcome measures included number of DSM-IV criteria met, perception of control/self-efficacy, desire to gamble, and frequency of gambling episodes. Analyses revealed a significant treatment group x time interaction (η²(partial) = .39). Specifically, the group treatments resulted in significant improvements in the dependent measures, while the Wait-List group remained relatively stable. Overall, CBGT-mapping and TSF had no significant differences on any outcome measure at follow-up assessments. Analysis of post-treatment and 6-month follow-up reveal a significant improvement in gambling outcomes (i.e., fewer DSM-IV criteria met, greater self-efficacy, and fewer gambling episodes (η²(partial) = .35), with treatment gains maintained at 6 months. These results are consistent with previous research for group treatment for pathological gambling and provide support for the utility of TSF and a mapping-based CBT therapy as viable intervention for pathological gambling."

The developed model is a new method of mental health promotion for mental health nurses working in comprehensive schools. The professional practice model has been developed in workshops together with school staff, interest groups, parents and students. Information gathered from the workshops was analysed using action research methods. Mental health promotion interventions are delivered at three levels: universal, which is an intervention that affects the whole school or community; selective, which is an intervention focusing on a certain group of students; and indicated, which is an individually focused intervention. All interventions are delivered within the school setting, which is a universal setting for all school-aged children. The interventions share the goal of promoting mental health. The purposes of the interventions are enhancing protective factors, reducing risk factors relating to mental health problems and early identification of mental health problems as well as rapid delivery of support or referral to specialized services. The common effect of the interventions on all levels is the increase in the experience of positive mental health."

As it is least prone to bias, subacromial decompression compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Other comparisons were subacromial decompression versus exercises or non-operative treatment. Major outcomes were mean pain scores, shoulder function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, adverse events and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year. For serious adverse events, we also included data from prospective cohort studies designed to record harms that evaluated subacromial decompression surgery or shoulder arthroscopy.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included eight trials, with a total of 1062 randomised participants with rotator cuff disease, all with subacromial impingement. Two trials (506 participants) compared arthroscopic subacromial decompression with arthroscopy only (placebo surgery), with all groups receiving postoperative exercises. These trials included a third treatment group: no treatment (active monitoring) in one and exercises in the other. Six trials (556 participants) compared arthroscopic subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercises alone. Two of these trials included a third arm: sham laser in one and open subacromial decompression in the other.Trial size varied from 42 to 313 participants. Participant mean age ranged between 42 and 65 years. Only two trials reported mean symptom duration (18 to 22 months in one trial and 30 to 31 months in the other), two did not report duration and four reported it categorically.Both placebo-controlled trials were at low risk of bias for the comparison of surgery versus placebo surgery. The other trials were at high risk of bias for several criteria, most notably at risk of performance or detection bias due to lack of participant and personnel blinding. We have restricted the reporting of results of benefits in the Abstract to the placebo-controlled trials.Compared with placebo, high-certainty evidence indicates that subacromial decompression provides no improvement in pain, shoulder function, or health-related quality of life up to one year, and probably no improvement in global success (moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision).At one year, mean pain (on a scale zero to 10, higher scores indicate more pain), was 2.9 points after placebo surgery and 0.26 better (0.84 better to 0.33 worse), after subacromial decompression (284 participants), an absolute difference of 3% (8% better to 3% worse), and relative difference of 4% (12% better to 5% worse). At one year, mean function (on a scale 0 to 100, higher score indicating better outcome), was 69 points after placebo surgery and 2.8 better (1.4 worse to 6.9 better), after surgery (274 participants), an absolute difference of 3% (7% better to 1% worse), and relative difference of 9% (22% better to 4% worse). Global success rate was 97/148 (or 655 per 1000), after placebo and 101/142 (or 708 per 1000) after surgery corresponding to RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). Health-related quality of life was 0.73 units (European Quality of Life EQ-5D, -0.59 to 1, higher score indicating better quality of life), after placebo and 0.03 units worse (0.011 units worse to 0.06 units better), after subacromial decompression (285 participants), an absolute difference of 1.3% (5% worse to 2.5% better), and relative difference of 4% (15% worse to 7% better).Adverse events including frozen shoulder or transient minor complications of surgery were reported in approximately 3% of participants across treatment groups in two randomised controlled trials, but due to low event rates we are uncertain if the risks differ between groups: 5/165 (37 per 1000) reported adverse events with subacromial decompression and 9/241 (34 per 1000) with placebo or non-operative treatment, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.65) (moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). The trials did not report serious adverse events.Based upon moderate-certainty evidence from two observational trials from the same prospective surgery registry, which also included other shoulder arthroscopic procedures (downgraded for indirectness), the incidence proportion of serious adverse events within 30 days following surgery was 0.5% (0.4% to 0.7%; data collected 2006 to 2011), or 0.6% (0.5 % to 0.7%; data collected 2011 to 2013). Serious adverse events such as deep infection, pulmonary embolism, nerve injury, and death have been observed in participants following shoulder surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The data in this review do not support the use of subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff disease manifest as painful shoulder impingement. High-certainty evidence shows that subacromial decompression does not provide clinically important benefits over placebo in pain, function or health-related quality of life. Including results from open-label trials (with high risk of bias) did not change the estimates considerably. Due to imprecision, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate for global assessment of treatment success; there was probably no clinically important benefit in this outcome either compared with placebo, exercises or non-operative treatment.Adverse event rates were low, 3% or less across treatment groups in the trials, which is consistent with adverse event rates reported in the two observational studies. Although precise estimates are unknown, the risk of serious adverse events is likely less than 1%."

In addition, we examined the possible moderating influence of sex on any association. The genotype x treatment interaction effect at 12-week follow-up indicated a greater benefit of active nicotine replacement treatment compared with placebo on likelihood of abstinence in the COMT Met/Met genotype group (33% versus 12%), in comparison to the Met/Val + Val/Val group (22% versus 16%). Our results indicate that COMT genotype may moderate the effect of active transdermal nicotine patch compared with placebo, with reduced relative benefit of nicotine replacement therapy in individuals with Met/Val or Val/Val genotype. Our data follow an emerging pattern of results suggesting that genetic variation in the dopamine pathway may provide a future basis for tailored smoking cessation therapies, but indicate that different genes influencing various components of this pathway may have different effects on response to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy."

Subjects were aged 18 through 70 years, smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day, and were without current major depression. Nortriptyline hydrochloride or matched placebo was started at 25 mg before bed 10 days prior to quit day and titrated to 75 mg/d or to the maximal tolerated dose. The behavioral intervention consisted of 2 group sessions and 12 individual follow-up visits. Withdrawal symptoms were measured using a daily diary, and smoking cessation was defined as self-reported abstinence, expired carbon monoxide of 9 ppm or less, and a 6-month urine cotinine level of less than 50 ng/mL.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 214 patients were randomized (108 to nortriptyline and 106 to placebo). There was a significant reduction in several withdrawal symptoms including anxious/tense, anger/irritability, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and impatience by day 8 after quit day in the nortriptyline group. The cessation rate at 6 months was 15 (14%) of 108 and 3 (3%) of 106, respectively (P = .003; absolute difference, 11%; 95% confidence interval, -18% to -4%).

            "abstract": "As the Latino population in the United States experiences rapid growth, the well-being of Latino adolescents is a growing concern because of their high rates of mental health problems. Latino adolescents have higher rates of mental health problems than their peers, including depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, and violence. Sophisticated, realistic health promotion efforts are needed to reduce these risk behaviors and enhance protective factors. Parents and schools can be key protective factors, or assets, in adolescents' lives. This article details the steps undertaken to develop Project Wings Home Visits, a collaborative school-based, community-linked mental health promotion intervention for Latino adolescents and their families. Core to the intervention is the use of a community health worker model to provide home-based outreach and education to parents of Latino adolescents. The intervention was developed using a community-based participatory research approach that involved the cooperation of a community health care system, a public high school, and a university. Our process demonstrates the benefits, strengths, and challenges of using community-based participatory research in creating and implementing health promotion interventions."

            "abstract": "This article reviews 59 studies of hypnosis and smoking cessation as to whether the research empirically supports hypnosis as a treatment. Whereas hypnotic procedures generally yield higher rates of abstinence relative to wait-list and no-treatment conditions, hypnotic interventions are generally comparable to a variety of nonhypnotic treatments. The evidence for whether hypnosis yields outcomes superior to placebos is mixed. In short, hypnosis cannot be considered a specific and efficacious treatment for smoking cessation. Furthermore, in many cases, it is impossible to rule out cognitive/behavioral and educational interventions as the source of positive treatment gains associated with hypnotic treatments. Hypnosis cannot, as yet, be regarded as a well-established treatment for smoking cessation. Nevertheless, it seems justified to classify hypnosis as a \"possibly efficacious\" treatment for smoking cessation."

In 2007/2008, a re-recruitment took place including 2,012 participants: 743 men, 1,269 women (647 deaths, 197 losses, 470 declined further participation). In 2009/2010 n = 1,627 returned the questionnaire (90 deaths, 47 losses, 248 declined further participation) resulting in a good participation rate over ten years with limited and quantified dropouts. Presently, follow-up data from 2007/2008 (wave 2) and 2009/2010 (wave 3) are available. Data wave 4 is due in 2011/2012, and the project will be continued until 2013. Information on survival and need of nursing care was collected continuously and cross-checked against official records. We used Fisher's exact test and t-tests. The study served repeatedly to evaluate health promotion interventions and concepts.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      LUCAS shows that a cohort study of older persons is feasible and can maintain a good participation rate over ten years, even when extensive self-reported health data are collected repeatedly through self-filled questionnaires. Evidently individual health developments of elderly persons can be tracked quantifying simultaneously behaviour, co-morbidity, functional competence and their changes. In future, we expect to generate results of significance about the five study aims listed above."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a directive patient-centred style of counselling, designed to help people to explore and resolve ambivalence about behaviour change. It was developed as a treatment for alcohol abuse, but may help people to a make a successful attempt to stop smoking.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy of MI for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, in addition to another form of smoking cessation treatment, and compared with other types of smoking cessation treatment. We also investigated whether more intensive MI is more effective than less intensive MI for smoking cessation.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for studies using the term motivat* NEAR2 (interview* OR enhanc* OR session* OR counsel* OR practi* OR behav*) in the title or abstract, or motivation* as a keyword. We also searched trial registries to identify unpublished studies. Date of the most recent search: August 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials in which MI or its variants were offered to smokers to assist smoking cessation. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional non-MI intervention components not matched between arms. We excluded trials in pregnant women as these are covered elsewhere.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking cessation was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for smoking cessation for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models. We extracted data on mental health outcomes and quality of life and summarised these narratively.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 37 eligible studies involving over 15,000 participants who smoked tobacco. The majority of studies recruited participants with particular characteristics, often from groups of people who are less likely to seek support to stop smoking than the general population. Although a few studies recruited participants who intended to stop smoking soon or had no intentions to quit, most recruited a population without regard to their intention to quit. MI was conducted in one to 12 sessions, with the total duration of MI ranging from five to 315 minutes across studies. We judged four of the 37 studies to be at low risk of bias, and 11 to be at high risk, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk did not significantly alter results, apart from in one case - our analysis comparing higher to lower intensity MI.We found low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, comparing the effect of MI to no treatment for smoking cessation (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; I2 = 0%; adjusted N = 684). One study was excluded from this analysis as the participants recruited (incarcerated men) were not comparable to the other participants included in the analysis, resulting in substantial statistical heterogeneity when all studies were pooled (I2 = 87%). Enhancing existing smoking cessation support with additional MI, compared with existing support alone, gave an RR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.36; adjusted N = 4167; I2 = 47%), and MI compared with other forms of smoking cessation support gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.69; I2 = 54%; N = 5192). We judged both of these estimates to be of low certainty due to heterogeneity and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence detected a benefit of higher intensity MI when compared with lower intensity MI (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; adjusted N = 5620; I2 = 0%). The evidence was limited because three of the five studies in this comparison were at risk of bias. Excluding them gave an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I2 = n/a; N = 482), changing the interpretation of the results.Mental health and quality of life outcomes were reported in only one study, providing little evidence on whether MI improves mental well-being.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not MI helps people to stop smoking compared with no intervention, as an addition to other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation, or compared with other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation. It is also unclear whether more intensive MI is more effective than less intensive MI. All estimates of treatment effect were of low certainty because of concerns about bias in the trials, imprecision and inconsistency. Consequently, future trials are likely to change these conclusions. There is almost no evidence on whether MI for smoking cessation improves mental well-being."

            "abstract": "Mental health is essential for functioning, general health, and quality of life in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs), as for high-income countries. This study aimed first to search in the English language peer-reviewed literature for reviews of mental health promotion interventions in the Asia-Pacific region. A global rapid review by Barry and colleagues indicated a paucity of publications on this topic in the peer-reviewed literature. The second aim of the study followed from this observation. Two systematic reviews of English language literature were conducted as case studies in two countries with known interest in mental health promotion, Thailand and China. The reviews covered publications in peer-reviewed journals and the \"grey\" literature. In Thailand, the review demonstrated: strong evidence for an empowerment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers; a reduction in HIV-related stigma in a community-based program; and a coping program for adolescents. The second review concerned suicide prevention interventions in China. It found one relevant study, a WHO multi-site study of suicide prevention. We found surprisingly little evidence in either country of interventions focused on health equity or modifying the social determinants of mental health. We agree with Barry and colleagues that there is an urgent need to invest in the policy, practice, and research capacity for mental health promotion in LAMICs so that mental health promotion can be incorporated into the wider health promotion and global health development agenda. This includes the Global Action for Health Equity Network. Evidence-based interventions in parenting, schools, workplaces, and among older people can be initiated or adapted and evaluated in LAMIC settings."

Interventions are needed to reduce this disparity.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo test the feasibility of a Web-based intervention to influence attitudes toward and intentions about smoking cigarettes among American Indian youth who attended a Native summer camp in the Northern Plains.\n## METHODS\nThe study website, the SmokingZine, was originally developed and tested in Canadian youth, then adapted to be appropriate for American Indian youth. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the influence of exposure to the adapted SmokingZine website on smoking attitudes and behaviors among American Indian youth 12-18 years of age. Participants assigned to the intervention group were given access to the website for 1 hour per day during their camp experience and asked to sign in to the site and use it. Control group participants were not given access to the site.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 52% of intervention youth signed in to the website at least once. Among nonsmokers, intentions to try a cigarette in the intervention group declined from 16% to 0%, and increased from 8% to 25% in the control group (P < .05). Compared with the control group, youth in the intervention group were more likely to help others quit (21 percentage point change in intervention versus no change in control; P < .05) and had less positive attitudes about the drug effects of smoking (-0.19 change in intervention versus 0.67 in control; P < .05).\n## CONCLUSION\nThese data indicate that SmokingZine needs more long-term, rigorous investigation as a way to keep American Indian youth from becoming regular smokers. Because the intervention group could use computers only 1 hour per day, increasing access might result in more visits and a greater effect of the website on smoking behaviors.\n"

The schools' students were randomly distributed into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group participated in StayingFit, an online program designed to encourage and guide healthy eating habits and control body weight. Data on food consumption, anthropometry, physical activity level, and sedentary behavior were collected from all of the students at the beginning of and after the 12-month study. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected at baseline. The baseline data indicated high rates of overweight (14.4% overweight and 8.5% obese), insufficiently active (87.6%), and sedentary (63.7%). Furthermore, few adolescents regularly consumed fruits (18.8%) and vegetables/legumes (16.4%). Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. At the end of the follow-up period, students in the intervention group had a 43% increased chance of regularly consuming beans (OR = 1.43, 95% CIs = 1.10-1.86) and a 35% decreased chance of regularly consuming soft drinks (OR = 0.65, 95% CIs = 0.50-0.84).

The EPAI was significantly associated with improving burden at 3 months (p = 0.03) but had no significant effect on depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      Caregiver involvement in an individualized physical activity intervention was associated with increased overall and total moderate physical activity and improved positive affect from baseline to 12 months. Improved positive affect may help caregivers to feel better about themselves and their situation, and better enable them to continue providing care for their family member for a longer time at lower risk to their own mental health."

            "abstract": "Home visiting is an evidence-based strategy used to enhance child and family health outcomes. Such primary healthcare endeavours demand the full participation of individual and families. We conducted a review to identify approaches to planning, executing and assessing home-visiting health promotion interventions to determine how parents and children can be best engaged. A structured search (2000-2015) was undertaken using a defined search protocol. The quality of the papers was assessed using standard appraisal tools. Sixteen studies were retrieved. A content analysis of the findings sections of the papers was undertaken and guided by the eight phases of the PRECEDE-PROCEED health promotion planning framework. The analysis found that while all the PRECEDE assessment areas were represented no studies included all phases. Parents and children did not appear to be actively involved in undertaking the assessments and evaluation of the home-visiting health promotion programmes. The findings suggest that there is a need to develop a consistent home-visiting approach that includes comprehensive assessments in the planning phases and parent and child involvement at each step of programme development, implementation and evaluation. This approach enables the development of tailored and sustainable health promotion intervention in order to achieve optimal child health outcomes."

A lunch of cheese pizza and chocolate bars was offered, and caloric intake was monitored. The analysis focused on subjects (placebo: n = 11; fluoxetine: n = 10) who succeeded in reaching cotinine levels of less than 50% of their starting cotinine levels (signifying a stringent reduction in nicotine intake) and who participated in pre- and post-nicotine reduction lunch sessions 70 days apart. Subjects on placebo gained significantly more weight (mean +/- SEM = +3.3 +/- 0.7 kg) than subjects on fluoxetine (-0.6 +/- 1.2 kg). In fluoxetine-treated subjects, weight gain/loss was strongly correlated with initial body mass index, with higher BMI being associated with greater decreases in weight. A trend towards decreased caloric intake in the fluoxetine group was observed; the change in total calories at lunch was significantly correlated with weight change, an association accounted for principally by change in pizza intake. We conclude that fluoxetine treatment effectively prevents the weight gain that accompanies nicotine reduction and that this phenomenon is mediated, at least in part, by diminished caloric intake."

            "abstract": "For the past 30 years, research examining predictors of successful smoking cessation treatment response has focused primarily on clinical variables, such as levels of tobacco dependence, craving, and self-efficacy. However, recent research has begun to determine biomarkers (such as genotype, nicotine and metabolite levels, and brain imaging findings) that may have utility in predicting smoking cessation. For genotype, genes associated with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and related proteins have been found to predict response to first-line medications (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, or varenicline) or quitting over time without a controlled treatment trial. For nicotine and metabolite levels, function of the cytochrome P450 2A6 liver enzyme, which can be assessed with the nicotine metabolite ratio or via genotype, has been found to predict response, with slow nicotine metabolizers having less severe nicotine dependence and a greater likelihood of quitting with NRT than normal metabolizers. For brain imaging, decreased activation of brain regions associated with emotion regulation and increased connectivity in emotion regulation networks, increased responsiveness to pleasant cues, and altered activation with the Stroop effect have been found in smokers who quit with the first-line medications listed above or counseling. In addition, our group recently demonstrated that lower pre-treatment brain nAChR density is associated with a greater chance of quitting smoking with NRT or placebo. Several of these studies found that specific biomarkers may provide additional information for predicting response beyond subjective symptom or rating scale measures, thereby giving an initial indication that biomarkers may, in the future, be useful for guiding smoking cessation treatment intensity, duration, and type."

Analyses of data from brief elicitation interviews, focus groups, community experts, and a pilot test of the adapted intervention identified environmental, cognitive-information processing, and affect-motivation factors that needed to be addressed during the adaptation process. The participant/counselor relationship was adapted to reflect a hierarchical (cf. collaborative) relationship in order to accommodate Russian expectations about patient interactions with healthcare experts. Key skills building activities (e.g., identification of personal risk behaviors, role-playing) were approached gradually or indirectly in order to maintain participants' engagement in the intervention, and close-ended questions were added to assist participants in understanding unfamiliar concepts such as \"triggers\" and self-efficacy. Information about the prevalence of HIV/STI infections and alcohol use included data specific to St. Petersburg to increase the personal relevance of these materials and messages. Intervention components were tailored to participants' risk reduction and informational needs.

As habits and lifestyle are established in childhood and adolescence, targeting school children before they develop unhealthy habits offers a window of opportunity to halt and reverse the emerging NCD epidemic. However, few experiences from school interventions in low- and middle-income countries have been collected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review experiences of implementing school-based health promotion interventions to identify barriers and recommendations for future interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative investigation of 17 school-based health promotion interventions in low- and middle-income countries was conducted. Data were collected through questionnaires (15 project leaders) and in-depth interviews with nine project leaders. The data from the questionnaires and interviews was triangulated and analysed using content analysis, where themes and categories emerging from the material were explored.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three key themes emerged from the data: 1) policy environment and stakeholder engagement, 2) health education sessions, and 3) practical health promotion activities. The themes explored the experiences and lessons learned from 17 school-based health promotion projects in low- and middle-income countries. Stakeholders at different administrative levels were important for the projects; however, stakeholders close to implementation were seen to be more engaged. Most projects conducted traditional health education lectures, which formed the basis of their intervention. Promotion of physical activity and healthy eating through participatory approaches were identified; however, barriers such as lack of areas suitable for physical activity and lack of healthy food alternatives in schools can obstruct the successful implementation of interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study has documented experiences with school-based health promotion in low- and middle-income countries, and has shown that schools can play an important role in facilitating NCD-related behavioural change in children. The study recommends increased emphasis on a whole-school approach where activities focusing on individual behavioural change are supported by interventions improving the structural environment."

A two group parallel (1:1) randomized-controlled single-blind study with adult smokers (N = 105) was conducted (DRKS00011406). Participants received three sessions of TAU and either six sessions of AAMT or Sham training. During AAMT, participants were trained to implicitly avoid all smoking-related and to approach all smoking-unrelated pictures, while the contingency was 50:50 in Sham training. Participants were assessed after the intervention and 6 months later. Primary outcome was daily cigarette consumption at follow-up. Participants receiving TAU + AAMT did not show a significantly greater reduction of daily cigarette consumption at follow-up compared to TAU + Sham (per-protocol: 95% CI: -2.56-4.89, p = .608; intention-to-treat: 95% CI: -3.11-2.96, p = .968). Using an implicit AAMT (vs. Sham) as an add-on to TAU did not improve clinical outcome. However, no consistent evidence for a change of bias was found.

This trend is partly due to a higher number of accidents but also higher incidence of lifestyle-related diseases like cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. In Denmark, the proportion of smokers as well as of overweight and obese persons is higher among seafarers compared to the general population. This high burden of risk indicates that this occupational group might be a growing challenge at sea in regard to safety and health issues and there is a need to further our understanding of the health promotion approaches that work.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A single-group pre-post design was conducted in 2008-2009 in order to identify changes in lifestyle related behaviors and health risk factors among seafarers (N: 606) in two Danish shipping companies after implementing two structural health promotion interventions (healthy cooking courses for ship cooks and improvement of fitness facilities) as well as health education interventions (smoking cessation courses, individual exercise guidance and extra health check-ups) at the maritime workplace. Baseline and follow-up data were collected with a self-administrated standardized questionnaire and individual health profiling assessing parameters such as physical health and physical fitness.

It is mainly intended for both planning and assessing one's own projects but can also be used to assess other people's projects (external use). This article reports a study on the reliability of Preffi as an external quality assessment instrument. Preffi is used to assess quality at three levels: (i) specific criteria, (ii) clusters of criteria and (iii) entire projects. The study compared Preffi-based assessments of 20 projects by three practitioners with their intuitive assessments of the same projects and with assessments by three experts, which were to be used as external criteria. The intuitive assessments only related to the cluster and project levels. Our main hypothesis was that intuitive assessments by practitioners would be less reliable and accurate than their Preffi-based assessments and the experts' assessments. On the whole, we failed to confirm this hypothesis: the experts' assessments proved less reliable and accurate than the practitioners' intuitive and Preffi-based assessments and differed too much from each other to be used as external criteria. The Preffi-based assessments by the practitioners had an acceptable generalizability coefficient (G) and accuracy (standard error of measurement). At the level of the entire project, two assessors are needed to produce sufficiently reliable and accurate assessments, whereas three are needed for assessment at cluster level. The study also showed that different assessors use different perspectives and base their assessment on a variety of aspects. This was regarded as inevitable and even useful by the assessors themselves. Discussions between assessors are important to achieve consensus. The article suggests some improvements to Preffi to further increase its reliability."

Effectiveness findings depended on sample, design, and method for analysis.

Using intent-to-treat and completer analyses, no significant differences were found in the relative performance between SS and M-TREM on primary or secondary outcomes. When longitudinal data were maximized and modeled in ways that reflect the hierarchical nature of the data, we found that SS and M-TREM performed better than no treatment on PTSD severity and secondary outcomes, and that treatment benefits endured.

            "abstract": "Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) can help to quantify the contribution of the promotion of a screening program to increased participation in screening. The cost-effectiveness (C/E) of screening promotion depends in large part on the endpoints of interest. At the most fundamental level, the C/E of a strategy for promoting screening would focus on the attendance rate, or cost per person screened, and the C/E would be influenced by the costs of promotion, as well as by the size and responsiveness of the target population. In addition, the costs of screening promotion (measured as the cost per additional participant in screening) can be included in a CEA estimate of the screening technology. In this case, depending on the efficacy of the screening test and the costs and influence of the promotion, the C/E of screening may improve or become poorer. In the current study, the authors reviewed the literature on the C/E of cancer screening promotion. The following lessons were learned regarding the C/E of screening and its promotion: 1) high-quality information on the C/E of screening is increasingly available; 2) cost-effective promotion of screening is dependent on cost-effective screening strategies; 3) quality-of-life effects may be important in assessing the overall C/E of screening programs; 4) research efforts aimed at identifying cost-effective approaches to screening promotion are useful but sparse; 5) C/E studies should be better incorporated into well designed effectiveness research efforts; 6) variations in C/E according to intervention characteristics, population characteristics, and context should be evaluated in greater depth; 7) the long-term effects of screening promotion are critical to assessing C/E; 8) the effects of promotion on costs of screening must be better understood; and 9) CEA must be interpreted in light of other information. The authors showed that CEA can be a valuable tool for understanding the merits of health promotion interventions and that CEA is particularly valuable in identifying screening strategies that might be promoted most cost-effectively."

The authors' objective in the current study was to replicate and extend this research by testing the efficacy expectancy priming before intervention delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      In a 2 x 2 factorial experiment, 210 smokers (M = 23 cigarettes/day) recruited from the community (62% female; 92% Caucasian; mean age = 49) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: placebo-tailored intervention/no priming, placebo-tailored intervention/priming, standard intervention/no priming, or standard intervention/priming.

Assessments occurred by mail at baseline and at 1-month postintervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Similar to the earlier study, the placebo-tailored booklets produced superior evaluations and smoking-related cognitive and behavioral changes. Moreover, the pretreatment expectancy priming successfully altered participants' tailoring-related expectancies and also produced superior evaluations and outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Findings support a causal role of tailoring-related expectancies on the efficacy of tailored interventions and suggest that interventions can be enhanced via expectancy priming."

            "abstract": "Psychological treatments for chronic pain, particularly those based upon cognitive behavioural principles, have generally been shown to be efficacious. Recently, a treatment has been developed based upon the fear-avoidance model of chronic musculoskeletal pain, which suggests chronic pain can be relieved by exposing the individual to movements and tasks that have been avoided due to fear of (re)injury. This graded in vivo exposure treatment has been found to be beneficial in case studies. The present investigation utilized a randomized controlled trial method to assess the effectiveness of graded in vivo exposure relative to other conditions. Forty-four chronic low back pain patients were randomly assigned to graded in vivo exposure, graded activity, or a wait-list condition. While only trend differences were observed for pain-related disability, patients in the graded in vivo exposure condition demonstrated (a) significantly greater improvements on measures of fear of pain/movement, fear avoidance beliefs, pain-related anxiety, and pain self-efficacy when compared to those in the graded activity condition, and (b) significantly greater improvements on measures of fear-avoidance beliefs, fear of pain/movement, pain-related anxiety, pain catastrophising, pain experience, and anxiety and depression when compared to those in the wait-list control condition. Additionally, patients in the graded in vivo exposure condition maintained improvements in these areas at one month follow-up. Implications of these findings for the treatment of individuals with chronic low back and other pain conditions are discussed."

Further analyses found that the rate of participation in smoking (P = .09) but not weight programs (P = .72) was positively associated with change in sick day prevalence and that this effect was strongest in baseline smokers (P = .002).

While one in five individuals smoke, and 70% of these indicate a desire to quit, <5% of unaided quit attempts succeed. Cessation aids can double or triple the odds of successfully quitting. Models of smoking-cessation behaviour can elucidate the implications of individual abstinence patterns to allow better tailoring of quit attempts to an individual's characteristics.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a discrete-event simulation (DES) to evaluate the benefits of smoking abstinence using data from the pooled pivotal clinical trials of varenicline versus bupropion or placebo for smoking cessation and to provide a foundation for the development of a lifetime smoking-cessation model.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The DES model simulated the outcome of a single smoking-cessation attempt over 1 year, in accordance with the clinical trial timeframes. Pharmaceutical costs were assessed from the perspective of a healthcare payer. The model randomly sampled patient profiles from the pooled varenicline clinical trials. All patients were physically and mentally healthy adult smokers who were motivated to quit abruptly. The model allowed for comparisons of up to five distinct treatment approaches for smoking cessation. In the current analyses, three interventions corresponding to the clinical trials were evaluated, which included brief counselling plus varenicline 1.0 mg twice daily (bid) or bupropion SR 150 mg bid versus placebo (i.e. brief counselling only). The treatment periods in the clinical trials were 12 weeks (target quit date: day 8), with a 40-week non-treatment follow-up, and counselling continuing over the entire 52-week period in all treatment groups. The main outcome modelled was the continuous abstinence rate (CAR; defined as complete abstinence from smoking and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide ≤ 10 ppm) at end of treatment (weeks 9-12) and long-term follow-up (weeks 9-52), and total time abstinent from smoking over the course of 52 weeks. The model also evaluated costs and cost-effectiveness outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For the varenicline, bupropion and placebo cohorts, respectively, the model predicted CARs for weeks 9-12 of 44.3%, 30.4% and 18.6% compared with observed rates of 44.0%, 29.7% and 17.7%; over weeks 9-52, predicted CARs in the model compared with observed rates in the pooled clinical studies were 22.9%, 16.4% and 9.4% versus 22.4%, 15.4% and 9.3%, respectively. Total mean abstinence times accrued in the model varenicline, bupropion and placebo groups, respectively, were 3.6, 2.6 and 1.5 months and total pharmaceutical treatment costs were $US261, $US442 and $US0 (year 2008 values) over the 1-year model period. Using cost per abstinent-month achieved as a measure of cost effectiveness, varenicline dominated bupropion and yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US124 compared with placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The model accurately replicated abstinence patterns observed in the clinical trial data using individualized predictions and indicated that varenicline was more effective and may be less costly than bupropion.

The present paper aims to review any hospital-based intervention that strives to promote general health in chronically ill teenagers.

Congruently with health promotion principles and values, the interventions described in our selection of articles targeted positive health determinants, in terms of personal skills and attitudes that contribute to psychosocial resiliency. The clinical relevance and feasibility of developing non-disease specific health promotion interventions in clinical settings was confirmed. However, the lack of relevant reported details did not allow us to highlight the key factors and mechanisms associated with successful interventions for health promotion targeted at chronically ill adolescents attending health care settings. Moreover, the design of the included studies varied in quality: number of participants, presence of a post-test and a follow-up, use of validated questionnaires, etc. Well-conducted non-disease specific clinical health promotion interventions still remain an under-investigated area of research, and maybe even of practice."

Successful quitting may be associated with greater inhibitory control but the effectiveness of varenicline in this regard is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to investigate the effect of varenicline on aspects of inhibitory control in smokers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of varenicline 1 mg (or matched placebo) in satiated and abstinent smokers. Tests included Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP), Stop-Signal (SS), Prospective Memory (PM) and the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Smoking enhanced RVIP accuracy and latency to respond. Varenicline did not alter RVIP performance, nor the effect of smoking, suggesting that these effects were unrelated to α4β2 nAChRs. Smoking increased the number of errors during SS and increased the stop latency, indicating that smoking decreased inhibitory control. Varenicline partially mimicked this effect of smoking but also reduced the smoking-induced increase, indicating a role for α4β2 nAChRs. Likewise, smoking increased the number of points bet following a win during CGT and varenicline blocked this effect. There was no effect of smoking or varenicline on PM target detection per se. However, smoking protected the target detection rate in the ongoing task when a concurrent intention was introduced. Varenicline improved response speed in both satiated and abstinent smokers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Some aspects of inhibitory control may be mediated by α4β2-related mechanisms and blockade of smoking-induced disinhibition may contribute towards the action of varenicline as an aid to smoking cessation."

            "abstract": "To assess the smoking cessation efficacy of transdermal nicotine patches as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 158 smokers. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three study regimens that required daily application of two 15-cm2 patches: (1) 24-hour nicotine delivery, (2) nicotine delivery during wakeful hours only, and (3) placebo. The impact of the three regimens on smoking cessation rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms was examined. During the last 2 weeks of the trial, 39% of the 24-hour nicotine regimen delivery group, 35% of those on wakeful hour nicotine regimens, and 13.5% of the placebo treatment group achieved abstinence. Self-reported quit rates for the two nicotine patch-wearing regimens, as compared with that for the placebo group, continued to be significantly higher at 6 months. Moreover, compared with placebo, the transdermal nicotine patches significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms during the first few weeks of quitting. The differences in quit rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms between the two active groups were not statistically significant. The patches were well tolerated both topically and systemically. We concluded that transdermal nicotine, when used as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms and enhanced smoking cessation rates."

            "abstract": "The concept of studying health seeking behaviours has evolved with the course of time and has ultimately become a tool for understanding how people employ the health care systems in their respective socio-cultural, economic and demographic circumstances. All these behaviours actually define social position of health and provide a better understanding of the disease process. It is therefore imperative to study the impacts of all the determinants, such as ethnicity, education of the mother, gender of child, lifestyles, or economics of a community. All the same, biomedical knowledge alone cannot guarantee better health. Health practitioners, managers and policy makers ought to reflect on social determinants while delivering services, designing health promotion interventions and developing policies. To build a responsive health system, there is a strong need to understand the health seeking behaviours on the demand side and that is the only way to expect improved health outcomes. This paper trails the history of pledges and promises, from Alma Ata declaration to Millennium Development Goals, to consider the importance of social determinants for a healthy public policy and health system development."

Possible explanations for this include little new content from the moderator, a definition of content too narrow to hold the interest of participants, and limited responsiveness to user needs. Implications for health promotion practice include the need to consider a life cycle approach to online community development for health promotion and the need for a developing moderator strategy to reflect this. This strategy should reflect two facets of moderation for online health promotion interventions: (1) unengaged and professional oversight to provide a safe space for discussion and to maintain information quality, and (2) a more engaged and interactive presence designed to maintain interest that generates new material for discussion and is responsive to user requests."

The data were collected in connection with the Koulumiete Project in Finland; 1346 pupils and 69 classes from grades seven to nine were included in the present data. In the school conditions category, the physical conditions that most needed improvement were ventilation, toilet facilities and temperature. Time pressure was also reported widely. Concerning social relationships, teachers' interest in how pupils are doing and teachers' fair treatment were the aspects calling for attention. In the means for self-fulfillment category pupils' participation in school development was a key area for reform. The most prevalent psychosomatic symptoms in the health status category were headache and feeling tired or weak. The School Well-being Profile seemed to work well when evaluating well-being differences between classes. By utilizing the results locally, the school personnel can act to develop their own school.

            "abstract": "A population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis evaluated the relationships of dose, plasma concentrations of bupropion and metabolites, and patient covariates with the safety and efficacy of bupropion sustained release (SR) for smoking cessation. A total of 519 outpatient chronic cigarette smokers were randomized to one of three bupropion SR doses: 100, 150, or 300 mg/day or placebo. The bupropion plasma concentration time data were fit and subject-specific bayesian estimates of clearance were obtained. Logistic regression analyses evaluated the role of dose, concentrations, and covariates in predicting efficacy and safety endpoints. For the evaluation of efficacy, patients were classified as quitters or non-quitters on the basis of a 4-week quit variable (defined as complete abstinence for weeks 4-7 of the study). For the evaluation of safety, patients were classified into two categories for each adverse event evaluated, corresponding to whether the patient ever experienced the adverse event during the course of the study or never experienced the event, regardless of whether the event was treatment-emergent. The efficacy of bupropion SR in facilitating smoking cessation was found to be related to dose and a mean metabolite concentration, and quitting in general was found to be related to the number of cigarettes smoked per day at baseline. Smoking cessation was 1.42, 1.69, and 2.84 times more likely in patients receiving 100, 150, and 300 mg/day of bupropion SR, respectively, as compared to placebo (p = 0.0001). As the baseline number of cigarettes smoked per day increased, the likelihood of quitting decreased regardless of the treatment condition. Insomnia and dry mouth were positively associated with mean metabolite concentrations, and dry mouth was inversely related to patient weight. Anxiety was inversely related to predicted steady-state concentration (Cpss), suggesting a positive effect on this withdrawal symptom. Bupropion SR exhibits a statistically significant dose/plasma level-response relationship for smoking cessation. Dry mouth and insomnia, related to concentrations, may be managed with dose reduction, with the realization that smoking cessation may be impaired."

A decision analytical model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CDTQ from the NHS perspective.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No systematic reviews of the effectiveness of CDTQ and no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically addressing CDTQ were identified. Seven randomised placebo-controlled trials satisfied the inclusion criteria; six of these were industry sponsored. However, sustained smoking cessation was only reported as a secondary outcome in these trials and required commencement of cessation within the first 6 weeks of treatment. Meta-analyses of the study level results demonstrated statistically significant superiority of NRT compared with placebo. Individual patient data from unpublished reports of five RCTs were used to calculate sustained abstinence of at least 6 months starting at any time during the treatment period (generally 12 months). From this the meta-analysis indicated statistically significant superiority of NRT versus placebo [relative risk 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 3.15]. The proportions achieving this outcome across all five RCTs were 6.75% of participants in receipt of NRT and 3.29% of those receiving placebo. The number-needed-to-treat was 29. This measure of sustained abstinence was used for economic modelling. No existing economic analyses of CDTQ were identified. A de novo decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of making CDTQ with NRT available for smokers unwilling or unable to attempt an abrupt quit. The outcome measure was expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model results suggest that CDTQ with NRT delivers incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from around 1500 pounds/QALY to 7700 pounds/QALY depending on the age at which smoking cessation was achieved and the modes of CDTQ delivery. Assuming applicability to a single population, CDTQ was not cost-effective compared with abrupt quitting. If CDTQ with NRT were to be offered on the NHS as a matter of policy, the base-case results suggest that it would only be effective and cost-effective if a substantial majority of the people attempting CDTQ with NRT were those who would otherwise make no attempt to quit. This result is robust to considerable variation in the forms of CDTQ with NRT offered, and to the assumptions about QALY gained per quit success.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Meta-analysis of RCT evidence of quit rates in NRT-supported smoking reduction studies indicates that NRT is an effective intervention in achieving sustained smoking abstinence for smokers who declare unwillingness or inability to attempt an abrupt quit. The 12-month sustained abstinence success rate in this population (approximately 5.3% with NRT versus approximately 2.6% with placebo) is considerably less than that documented for an abrupt quit NRT regime in smokers willing to attempt an abrupt quit with NRT (which according to other systematic reviews is around 16% with NRT versus 10% with placebo). Most of the evidence of effectiveness of CDTQ came from trials that required considerable patient-investigator contact. Therefore, for CDTQ with NRT to generate similar abstinence rates for this recalcitrant population in a real-world setting would probably require a similar mode of delivery. The modelling undertaken, which was based on reasonable assumptions about costs, benefits and success rates, suggests that CDTQ is highly cost-effective compared with no quit attempt. CDTQ remains cost-effective if dilution from abrupt quitting forms a small proportion of CDTQ attempts. In an alternative analysis in which smokers who switch from an abrupt quit to CDTQ retain the success rate of abrupt quitters, all forms of CDTQ appear cost-effective. Randomised trials in recalcitrant smokers allowing head-to-head comparison of CDTQ delivered with various modalities would be informative."

Researchers have hypothesized that they might be effective, in part, because they reduce cue reactivity and cue-induced cravings.

We assessed participants at two time points: 24 h (n = 140) and 4 weeks (n = 176) after the quit date. At both sessions, we measured the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP), an ERP component reliably associated with motivational relevance, and self-reported tonic craving using the brief version of the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At both sessions, emotional and cigarette-related images evoked significantly larger LPPs than neutral images. Neither drug type nor smoking abstinence altered this effect at either session. At both sessions, varenicline and bupropion significantly reduced self-reported tonic craving relative to the placebo condition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While both varenicline and bupropion reduced self-reported tonic craving, neither medication altered the amplitude of the LPP to cigarette-related or emotional pictures in smokers attempting to quit. These medications may influence abstinence by means other than by reducing neuroaffective responses to cigarette-related cues. Smokers should be prepared for the likelihood that even after several weeks of successful abstinence, once treatment ends, cigarette-related cues may remain motivationally relevant and trigger cravings that might lead to relapse.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion and varenicline do not alter electrophysiological responses, as measured by the LPP, to cigarette-related and emotional images.

Results showed that as South Korean adults grew older they began to recognize changes in their bodies. In their 60s, functional changes were explicit and individuals finally admitted that they were getting older. Disease was a part of life, which was inseparable from their daily lives, and death was accepted as a natural event. As South Korean adults grew older, they felt a strong responsibility for their children and tried to live an honest and respectable life. This was a common perception held regarding aging. Thus they pursued a traditional family-oriented life. Even though aging was something that many wished to avoid, it was accepted as part of life. As they experienced the agony of life, they began to accept the realities of living, and wished for their family's happiness and a better future. The present study aimed to increase understanding of the aging experience and to provide a foundation for future research to develop effective health promotion interventions for this population."

Non-treatment follow-up lasted 12 weeks (40 weeks in Japan). Primary endpoint was the carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate (CAR) for weeks 9-12 (last 4 weeks of treatment). Secondary endpoint was CAR for weeks 9-24.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      CAR was higher for varenicline than placebo during weeks 9-12 (58.6 vs. 34.3%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.08-3.60; p < 0.0001), and through 12 weeks of follow-up (CAR weeks 9-24; 41.4 vs. 25.3%; OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.56-2.77; p < 0.0001). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in the varenicline group (greater incidence than the placebo group) were: nausea (31.5%), headache (8.5%), dizziness (7.8%), insomnia (7.4%), and upper abdominal pain (5.4%). Serious AEs occurred in four varenicline and five placebo participants. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 3.6% of varenicline and 1.6% of placebo participants. Compared with the Western studies, abstinence rates for both varenicline and placebo were numerically higher in the Asian studies, although treatment effects were similar between the two populations.

It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit or reduce smoking.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatments for nicotine dependence in schizophrenia.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register and electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception to April 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomized trials for smoking cessation or reduction, comparing any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention with placebo or with another therapeutic control in adult smokers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data. Outcome measures included smoking abstinence, reduction in the amount smoked and any change in mental state. We extracted abstinence and reduction data at the end of treatment and at least six months after the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence or reduction and biochemically validated data where available. Any reported adverse events were noted. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a random effects model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 21 trials (11 trials of smoking cessation; four trials of smoking reduction; one trial for relapse prevention; five trials reported smoking outcomes for interventions aimed at other purposes). Seven trials compared bupropion with placebo; meta-analysis showed that smoking cessation rates after bupropion were significantly higher than placebo at the end of treatment (seven trials, N=340; risk ratio [RR] 2.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61 to 4.99) and after six months (five trials, N=214, RR 2.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 7.58). Expired carbon monoxide (CO) level and the number of cigarettes smoked daily were significantly lower with bupropion at the end of therapy but not after six months. There were no significant differences in positive, negative and depressive symptoms between bupropion and placebo group. There was no report of major adverse event such as seizures with bupropion.Contingent reinforcement (CR) with money may increase smoking abstinence rates and reduce the level of smoking in patients with schizophrenia. However, it is uncertain whether these benefits are maintained in the longer term. There was no evidence of benefit for the few trials of other pharmacological therapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)) and psychosocial interventions in helping smokers with schizophrenia to quit or reduce smoking.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia, without jeopardising their mental state. Bupropion may also reduce the amount these patients smoke. CR may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking. We failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking behaviour in schizophrenia."

Net abstinence rates were determined for smokers, depending on their stage of readiness to quit, that is, \"prepared,\" \"contemplative,\" and \"precontemplative,\" leading to an assessment of the number of smokers achieving abstinence as a result of the Smokescreen intervention. Costs were calculated from the perspectives of smokers, family physicians, organizers, trainers, and all parties combined.

Although there has been a great deal of research in this field, little information is available regarding the methodologies to develop and implement effective online interventions. This article describes two social cognitive theory-based online health behavior interventions used in a large-scale dissemination study (N = 866), their implementation processes, and the lessons learned during the implementation processes. The two interventions were a short-term (8-week) intensive online Bone Power program and a longer term (12-month) Bone Power Plus program, including the Bone Power program followed by a 10-month online booster intervention (biweekly eHealth newsletters). This study used a small-group approach (32 intervention groups), and to effectively manage those groups, an eLearning management program was used as an upper layer of the Web intervention. Both interventions were implemented successfully with high retention rates (80.7% at 18 months). The theory-based approaches and the online infrastructure used in this study showed a promising potential as an effective platform for online behavior studies. Further replication studies with different samples and settings are needed to validate the utility of this intervention structure."

As an extension of our previous work, we planned to examine the synergistic effects of CBTD and bupropion on smoking cessation outcomes in general and among smokers with depression vulnerability factors. Participants were 524 smokers (47.5% female, M (age) = 44.27 years) who were randomized to one of four 12-week treatments: (a) standard, cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) plus bupropion (BUP), (b) ST plus placebo (PLAC), (c) standard cessation treatment combined with cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression (CBTD) plus BUP, and (d) CBTD plus PLAC. Follow-up assessments were conducted 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and self-reported abstinence was verified biochemically. Consistent with previous studies, bupropion, in comparison with placebo, resulted in better smoking outcomes in both intensive group treatments. Adding CBTD to standard intensive group treatment did not result in improved smoking cessation outcomes. In addition, neither CBTD nor bupropion, either alone or in combination, was differentially effective for smokers with single-past-episode major depressive disorder (MDD), recurrent MDD, or elevated depressive symptoms. However, findings with regard to recurrent MDD and elevated depressive symptoms should be interpreted with caution given the low rate of recurrent MDD and the low level of depressive symptoms in our sample.

Factors associated with discussing STIs before sex and condom use intention with a new partner were analysed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 2339 responses were analysed. Men had lower STI knowledge scores, lower use of condoms and greater beliefs that condoms reduced interest in sex as age increased. Younger men (aged 18-29 years) were more likely to report intentions of only having sex with a new partner if a condom was used compared with older men aged over 60 years. Predictors of having a discussion about STIs with a new partner were older age, better knowledge of STIs, greater distress at a potential diagnosis of an STI and stronger future condom use intention. Intention to only have sex with a new female partner if a condom was used was associated with higher STI knowledge, discussing STIs with a new partner and distress at a diagnosis of an STI. Men with a higher number of sexual partners in the last year were less likely to have an STI discussion with new partners or intend to use a condom with a new partner.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Older Internet-dating, heterosexual men are vulnerable to STIs. Health promotion interventions to increase STI awareness, condom use and STI testing in older men are warranted."

Sixty-six women who were either users or non-users of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) were randomly assigned, using a weighted randomization scheme, to smoking cessation (SC) or to smoking cessation after 6 weeks of monitoring (wait-list control group, WLC). We measured hormones [estrone, estradiol, testosterone, parathyroid hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione] and SHBG, markers of bone turnover [procollagen peptide (PINP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC), N- and C-terminal collagen cross-links (NTx and CTx)], and cotinine, at baseline and again at 6 weeks in women who reported smoking cessation and in women randomized to the WLC group. Analyses included 20 subjects who quit or significantly reduced their smoking and 18 subjects in the WLC group. After controlling for differences in age and ERT use between groups, we found a significant change in SHBG in the SC vs. the WLC group (-8% vs. +5%, respectively; p = 0.01), and in DHEA (-18% vs. -5%, respectively; p = 0.04), but not in other hormonal concentrations. We also noted a significant change in NTx in the SC vs. WLC group (-5% vs. +56%, respectively, p = 0.01), but not in other markers of bone turnover. Percentage changes in SHBG and NTx were correlated with changes in plasma cotinine (r = 0.48; p = 0.004 and r = 0.36; p = 0.04, respectively). Six weeks of smoking abstinence produces reductions in SHBG and NTx. This may partly explain how smoking contributes to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women."

            "abstract": "In France, current structuring of preventive and health promotion policies has created a context favoring evidence-based actions. Yet, in health promotion and health education, interventions are very much setting dependent, potentially compromising this type of approach to health promotion. Thus, in an attempt to inform participants in health promotion in the French setting of ongoing international debates on the topic, we present the main limitations developed in literature, highlighting recent work responding to the challenge. Our analysis is focused on three points: the issue of the level of intervention and indicators to assess efficacy and effectiveness of health promotion interventions; the issue of research methodologies, their capacity to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of health promotion interventions and the transferability of their outcomes; the issue of the external validity of studies, and in particular the information necessary for understanding complex mechanisms of intervention. On the basis of this analysis, and with the aim of improving evidence-based health promotion practices, we propose practical perspectives in the French environment for policymakers, local practitioners and researchers. To conclude, we link this issue with the concept of knowledge transfer, which is developed in other countries."

Topiramate-treated men reported significantly lower tobacco withdrawal scores than both women taking topiramate and men on placebo. On average, male cessators on placebo gained 3.30 kg, whereas topiramate led to a 0.72 kg weight loss (P = 0.03). Study discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs) were significantly higher in the topiramate group (topiramate 23% versus placebo 2%). The most commonly reported AEs in the topiramate arm were paraesthesia, fatigue, difficulty with concentration/attention and nervousness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Topiramate produced gender-specific effects on smoking cessation. Male smokers had markedly greater quit rates than female smokers and men were roughly four times more likely to quit smoking when treated with topiramate as compared to placebo. Topiramate was fairly well tolerated, although higher discontinuation rates were seen. Topiramate's triple effects aiding smoking abstinence, attenuating nicotine withdrawal and preventing post-cessation weight gain might make it a promising agent for treating tobacco addiction, at least in men."

Health promotion interventions for women who experience violence have not been tailored specifically for Indigenous women. Reclaiming Our Spirits (ROS) is a health promotion intervention designed for Indigenous women living in an urban context in Canada. In this paper, we describe the development of the intervention, results of a pilot study, and the revised subsequent intervention. Building on a theory-based health promotion intervention (iHEAL) showing promising results in feasibility studies, ROS was developed using a series of related approaches including (a) guidance from Indigenous women with research expertise specific to IPV and Indigenous women's experiences; (b) articulation of an Indigenous lens, including using Cree (one of the largest Indigenous language groups in North America) concepts to identify key aspects; and (c) interviews with Elders (n = 10) living in the study setting. Offered over 6-8 months, ROS consists of a Circle, led by an Indigenous Elder, and 1:1 visits with a Registered Nurse, focused on six areas for health promotion derived from previous research. Pilot testing with Indigenous women (n = 21) produced signs of improvement in most measures of health from pre- to post-intervention. Women found the pilot intervention acceptable and helpful but also offered valuable suggestions for improvement. A revised intervention, with greater structure within the Circle and nurses with stronger knowledge of Indigenous women's experience and community health, is currently undergoing testing. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Immediate treatment groups were compared with wait-list control groups. Differential treatment gains based on the order of presentation of 2 components of CBT (cognitive restructuring and cognitive/behavioral coping) and the role of catastrophizing in treatment outcome were examined. Thirty-four participants enrolled in a 10-week group treatment and 11 completed a wait-list self-monitoring period. Participants reported significant reductions in catastrophizing and anxiety and increased self-efficacy compared with wait-list control subjects, and these were maintained at follow-up. Although we did not find overall differences in the reduction of headache frequency or intensity compared with wait-list control subjects, calculation of clinical significance on headache indicators suggest that approximately 50% of treated participants showed meaningful changes in headache indices as well. Order of treatment modules was not related to gains during treatment or at follow-up; however, almost all changes occurred during the second half of treatment, suggesting that duration of treatment participation is important.\n    \n\n\n          Perspective:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive-behavioral treatment targeting reduction of catastrophizing for chronic headache pain reduced negative cognitive and affective variables associated with recurrent headache, increased headache management self-efficacy, and in half of the participants, produced clinically meaningful reductions in headache indicators.

Developing effective health promotion interventions in this environment is a challenge. Taking an ecological approach, the objective of this study was to identify the key social, economic, cultural and environmental factors that contribute to poor hygiene in remote Aboriginal communities, and to determine approaches that will improve hygiene and reduce the burden of infection among children. The methods included a mix of quantitative and qualitative community-based studies and literature reviews. Study findings showed that a combination of crowding, non-functioning health hardware and poor standards of personal and domestic hygiene underlie the high burden of infection experienced by children. Also, models of health promotion drawn from developed and developing countries can be adapted for use in remote Australian Aboriginal community contexts. High levels of disadvantage in relation to social determinants of health underlie the problem of poor environmental conditions and poor child health in remote Australian Aboriginal communities. Measures need to be taken to address the immediate problems that impact on children's health-for example, by ensuring the availability of functional and adequate water and sanitation facilities-but these interventions are unlikely to have a major effect unless the underlying issues are also addressed."

Two focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with prison inmates in each of four facilities. Additionally, one FGD was conducted in each prison with non-health trained (custodial) personnel who were Nguni speakers from the same community (n = 27). The data revealed unique terminology and meanings attached to several biomedically defined STIs. These sociocultural constructions were not limited to inmates as findings from warders' discussions showed a similar pattern. Moreover, we found the existence of a number of traditional 'folk' STIs and culture-specific prevention methods. These conceptualizations influence reported health-care-seeking behaviour, where dual consultation of traditional healers and biomedical remedies is widely practiced.

Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the associations between (a) the number and type of BCC events conducted in a ward and the volume of subsequent fortified oil redeemed in the ward and (b) distance of clinic shows, a component of the BCC campaign, from participating retailers and the volume of fortified oil redeemed in the store. After 1 year of the campaign, the volume of fortified oil redeemed monthly increased by more than 5 times in Manyara and by more than three times in Shinyanga. Among the different types of BCC events conducted, only clinic shows and cooking shows were significantly associated with the volume of redemptions (p < .05). Compared with retailers where at least one clinic show was conducted within 0.5 km from its location, the volume of redemptions was significantly lower at retailers where no clinic show conducted within 3.0 km from its location (p < .05).

We used parametric recurrent event survival analyses to better understand the dynamic relationship between a set of Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE, Marlatt & Gordon, 1985) responses to lapsing and subsequent lapse-relapse progression. Participants were 203 smokers who achieved abstinence and responded to items assessing three core components of the AVE (internal attribution, abstinence self-efficacy and guilt) following a total of 1,001 lapse episodes in near real time. Neither self-blame, self-efficacy, nor guilt following participants' first lapse predicted relapse. Controlling for responses to their first lapse, responses to each additional lapse did prospectively predict lapse progression, such that drops in self-efficacy were associated with accelerated progression to a subsequent lapse (HR = 1.09, CI = 1.02-1.15), while increases in internal attributions of blame actually protected against lapsing (HR = 0.98, CI = 0.97-0.99). Treatment with nicotine patches slowed recurrent lapse progression (HR = 0.58, CI = 0.48-0.70), but this effect dissipated over multiple lapses, and was moderated by elevated ratings of postlapse guilt (HR = 1.08, CI = 1.01-1.18), which predicted accelerated progression within the active patch group, while protecting against lapse in the placebo group. Results highlight the dynamic nature of lapse responses during smoking cessation, indicating that self-efficacy predicts progression from one lapse to the next, while attributions of self-blame and guilt influenced progression in unexpected ways."

Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles in English published between 2001 and 2016. Twelve studies were included. Three themes were identified on analysis: impact on healthcare services; barriers and motivators influencing influenza vaccination uptake; and health promotion interventions. Studies suggest vaccination may reduce the health-care costs of influenza-associated infection. Socioeconomic factors, information about vaccination and cultural beliefs may influence an individual's decision. Multicomponent interventions, such as home visits combined with reminders, support increased uptake. Interventions are identified that could be adopted at the community level in Singapore and other countries to improve influenza vaccination uptake among older adults."

A critical element in these initiatives is attracting the participation of employees at risk for high benefits use. This study presents evidence that suggests accomplishing this task has economic savings implications to large employers. A health and wellness intervention program offered at GlaxoSmithKline, entitled the Contract for Health and Wellness, is examined. Focusing on a group of 6049 employees, the study examines the impact on health behaviors and on integrated health benefits use of this continuously employed population from 1996 to 2000. Total benefits costs are examined for participants and nonparticipants, and the annual savings associated with the isolated impact of the program are, on average, $613 per participant. Reductions in disability costs accounted for the majority of these savings."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of early death in the UK and worldwide. Public health guidance recommends the use of varenicline, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as smoking cessation aids in the UK. Additionally, the first electronic cigarette has been licensed for use as a smoking cessation medicine. However, there are ongoing concerns about the safety of these medicines. We present a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine how these smoking cessation medicines compare to each other with respect to their neuropsychiatric safety in adult smokers. Secondary aims include updating the evidence regarding the effectiveness and cardiovascular safety of these medicines for use in a cost-effectiveness analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We will include randomised controlled trials and observational studies with control groups comparing monotherapy with varenicline, bupropion, NRT or electronic cigarette and combination therapies to each other, placebo or usual care. The primary composite safety outcome will be serious adverse events, defined as events that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalisation or resulted in significant disability or congenital/birth defect. The preferred effectiveness outcome will be sustained smoking cessation defined as abstinence for a minimum of 6 months as determined by biochemical validation. We will include trials identified by previous reviews and search relevant databases for newly published trials as well as contacting study authors to identify unpublished information. We will conduct fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analyses for each pairwise comparison of treatments and outcome; where these estimates differ, we will consider reasons for heterogeneity, quantified using the between-study variance (τ2). For each outcome, we will construct a NMA in a Bayesian framework which will be compared with the pair-wise results, allowing us to rank treatments. The effectiveness estimates from the NMA will be entered into a probabilistic economic model.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      Ethics approval is not required for this evidence synthesis study as it involves analysis of secondary data from randomised controlled trials and observational studies.

Among the studies that reported significant associations with cessation, the effects were observed in smokers treated with placebo treatment in some studies and conversely in those receiving active pharmacological therapy (bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies) in others. Thus, it remains unclear whether CHRNA5-A3-B4 is a useful marker for optimizing smoking cessation. Using data from 654 Caucasian smokers treated with placebo, nicotine patch or varenicline, we investigated whether CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants were associated with smoking cessation outcomes, and whether there were significant genotype-by-treatment or haplotype-by-treatment interactions. We observed no significant associations between CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants and smoking cessation, despite replicating previous associations with baseline tobacco consumption. At end of treatment the effect size on smoking cessation in the placebo, patch and varenicline groups for rs16969968 [GG vs. GA+AA] was OR = 0.66 (P = 0.23), OR = 1.01 (P = 0.99), and OR = 1.30 (P = 0.36) respectively, of rs588765 [CC vs. CT+TT] was OR = 0.96 (P = 0.90), OR = 0.84 (P = 0.58), and OR = 0.74 (P = 0.29) respectively, and for rs578776 [GG vs. GA+AA] on smoking cessation was OR = 1.02 (P = 0.95), OR = 0.75 (P = 0.35), and OR = 1.20 (P = 0.51) respectively. Furthermore, we observed no associations with cessation using the CHRNA5-A3-B4 haplotype (constructed using rs16969968 and rs588765), nor did we observe any significant genotype-by-treatment interactions, with or without adjusting for the rate of nicotine metabolism (all P>0.05). We also observed no significant genetic associations with 6 month or 12 month smoking abstinence. In conclusion, we found no association between CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants and smoking cessation rates in this clinical trial; however, as expected, significant associations with baseline tobacco consumption were replicated. Our data suggest that CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene variants do not exhibit a robust association with smoking cessation and are unlikely to be useful for clinically optimizing smoking cessation pharmacotherapy for Caucasian smokers."

            "abstract": "The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis states that environmental influences in utero and in early life can determine health and disease in later life through the programming of genes and/or altered gene expression. The DOHaD is likely to have had an effect in South Africa during the fifty years of apartheid; and during the twenty years since the dawn of democracy in 1994. This has profound implications for public health and health promotion policies in South Africa, a country experiencing increased prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and risk factors and behaviours for NCDs due to rapid social and economic transition, and because of the DOHaD. Public health policy and health promotion interventions, such as those introduced by the South African Government over the past 20 years, were designed to improve the health of pregnant women (and their unborn children). They could in addition, through the DOHaD mechanism, reduce NCDs and their risk factors in their offspring in later life. The quality of public health data over the past 40 years in South Africa precludes the possibility of proving the DOHaD hypothesis in that context. Nevertheless, public health and health promotion policies need to be strengthened, if South Africa and other low and middle income countries (LMICs) are to avoid the very high prevalence of NCDs seen in Europe and North America in the 50 years following the Second World War, as a result of socio economic transition and the DOHaD."

Stress and coping items also predicted concurrent and future emotional exhaustion controlling for covariates; however, only coping consistently predicted additional variance in future emotional exhaustion with both stress and coping items in the model. Further, the coping item, not the stress item, demonstrated sensitivity to detect intervention effects; that is, teachers randomly assigned to receive a classroom management intervention (the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management program) had significantly higher coping scores compared to a wait-list comparison group. The results of this study provide support for the continued use of single-item stress and coping measures of teacher well-being, and areas for further research and potential use of these measures are discussed."

This study aimed to investigate short- and long-term effects of an exercise-based patient education programme (ePEP) that focuses on empowering pwMS to a sustainable and self-regulated exercise training management. Methods. Fourteen pwMS were randomly assigned to immediate experimental group (EG-I: n = 8) and waitlist-control group (EG-W: n = 6) and attended biweekly in a six-week ePEP. All participants were measured for walking ability, quality of life, fatigue, and self-efficacy towards physical exercise before and after the ePEP, after 12 weeks, and one year after baseline. Short-term effects were analysed in a randomised control trial and long-term effects of all ePEP participants (EG-I + EG-W = EG-all) in a quasi-experimental design. Results. Only functional gait significantly improved in EG-I compared to EG-W (p = 0.008, r = -0.67). Moderate to large effects were found in EG-all for walking ability. Not significant, however, relevant changes were detected for quality of life and fatigue. Self-efficacy showed no changes. Conclusion.

Although impediments to good depression and anxiety outcomes exist for all older adults, they are even more pronounced for older Latinos, who tend to have fewer socioeconomic resources. These factors underscore the need for prevention-based interventions that are effective, scalable, relevant, respectful, and specific to this population. The Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA) program is a community health worker-led, multicomponent, health promotion intervention. The diverse needs and circumstances of older Latinos (highly sedentary, culture-specific health beliefs, service disparities) were incorporated into the design of HOLA to reduce risk factors and improve health-related outcomes associated with common mental disorders in this group. The authors describe HOLA (highlighted in this case example) and why health promotion interventions like HOLA may hold promise as effective, practical, and nonstigmatizing interventions for preventing common mental disorders in older Latinos who are at risk for developing these disorders."

Other outcome measures included additional cognitive assessments, salivary cortisol, respiratory rate, heart rate variability, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness (NEO) personality traits, and SF-36 health-related quality of life. 128 participants completed the study though Visit 2 assessments. There was no significant change in the primary or other cognitive outcome measures. Even after statistical adjustment for multiple outcomes, self-rated measures related to negative affect and stress were all significantly improved in the MM intervention compared to wait-list group (PANAS-negative, CESD, PSS, and SF-36 health-related quality of life Vitality and Mental Health Component). The SF-36 Mental Health Component score improved more than the minimum clinically important difference. There were also significant changes in personality traits such as Neuroticism. Changes in positive affect were not observed. There were no group differences in salivary cortisol, or heart rate variability. These moderate sized improvements in self-rated measures were not paralleled by improvements in cognitive function or physiological measures. Potential explanations for this discrepancy in stress-related outcomes are discussed to help improve future studies."

Lack of control has also been implicated as an etiologic factor in the development of psychosocial problems in epilepsy. Cognitive-behavioral interventions emphasizing the mediating role of thoughts and self-control appear to be particularly relevant for patients with epilepsy because anxiety and depression are the most common problems. Despite its apparent importance, very little systematic research has been published on the effectiveness of psychological treatment of epilepsy. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a seminal outcome evaluation of psychological intervention for adult patients in Hong Kong. Using a waitlist control group, the treatment program focused particularly on cognitive restructuring and seizure control. Results indicated significant gains by the treatment group in overall quality of life and self-efficacy. In particular, marked improvements were noted for emotional well-being, seizure, and stress management. The clinical implications are discussed in the context of developing specific intervention programs and outcome measures specific to the various needs of adult patients with epilepsy."

Four databases were searched for articles reporting on prepost single and multigroup studies in police officers and trainees. Data were extracted and bias assessed to evaluate study characteristics, intervention design and the impact of interventions on health. Database searching identified 25 articles reporting on 21 studies relevant to the aims of this review. Few studies (n=3) were of long duration (≥6 months). Nine of 21 studies evaluated structured physical activity and/or diet programmes only, 5 studies used education and behaviour change support-only interventions, 5 combined structured programmes with education and behaviour change support, and 2 studies used computer prompts to minimise sedentary behaviour. A wide array of lifestyle behaviour and health outcomes was measured, with 11/13 multigroup and 8/8 single-group studies reporting beneficial impacts on outcomes. High risk of bias was evident across most studies. In those with the lowest risk of bias (n=2), a large effect on blood pressure and small effects on diet, sleep quality, stress and tobacco use, were reported. Health promotion interventions can impact beneficially on health of the police force, particularly blood pressure, diet, sleep, stress and tobacco use. Limited reporting made comparison of findings challenging. Combined structured programmes with education and behaviour change support and programmes including peer support resulted in the most impact on health-related outcomes."

This analysis updated a meta-analysis of 11 of these trials that found no significant sex differences due to nicotine patch.

The nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zopiclone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of insomnia. Importantly, it also has minimal effects on next-day performance and psychological function. 458 patients treated with zopiclone for 14 days showed significantly greater improvement compared with placebo recipients in sleep evaluation questions and scores for activity, social and professional quality-of-life aspects. After 8 weeks, the improvement in scores for sleep, activity and social questions remained significantly higher in patients who had received zopiclone compared with placebo recipients. No significant differences were observed between 167 patients who had been taking zopiclone for at least 12 months and a control group of 381 persons with no sleep problems in virtually all of the 5 aspects of the quality-of-life questionnaire.

Benefits include allaying death anxiety to increased engagement in health promotion interventions. Nonetheless, the focus on death conversations remains centred on the imminently dying. This qualitative study investigated New Zealanders' perspectives on the value of, opportunities for, and barriers to death conversations in primary healthcare. METHODS Twenty-one participants were interviewed. Participants were young older adults (54-65 years) not receiving palliative care or diagnosed with a terminal illness. Most were women who identified ethnically as New Zealand European. An immersion-crystallisation approach to thematic development was used to accommodate the multidisciplinary research framework. RESULTS Four core themes were identified: 'a need to talk about death'; 'the role of the GP'; 'broaching the topic'; and 'media'. CONCLUSION A cultural silence on death has rendered both the medical and lay community insufficiently prepared for frank and meaningful engagement with the topic, exacerbated by restricted consultation timeframes. The ease of death conversations may be facilitated by taking a family-centred approach, using community organisations and settings, and harnessing conversation entry points provided by the media. Future research should aim to develop tailored resources and frameworks to support general practitioners' meaningful engagement with the topic of death both within and outside of the end-of-life context."

The finding that a low level of physical activity is a major determinant of the growing epidemics of obesity is also firm and consistent. The direct association existing between a sedentary lifestyle and the incidence of diabetes mellitus is solid and of great importance for public health. Additional benefits from a a physically active lifestyle are a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of osteoporosis, lower risk of falls and fractures in the elderly, and a lower risk of anxiety and depression. Although evidence is less consistent, low levels of physical activity have been related to a higher risk of colon, breast and lung cancer. Some preliminary evidence relates physical activity with a lower risk of dementia. During the last three decades a huge amount of epidemiological research has led to uniform conclusions about the benefits of a physically active lifestyle. In spite of this fact, the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles is rising. Therefore, health promotion interventions are urgently needed to reach the objective of engaging in regular and moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day in most, preferably all, days of the week."

            "abstract": "Gender-based violence is a widespread problem in South Africa. Past structural inequities have created a climate conducive to violence against women. As an initial step toward developing a health promotion program, we conducted exploratory formative research to examine the barriers that affect the health and well-being of youth. Fourteen focus groups (nine with girls and five with boys) were conducted with 112 adolescents in a racially mixed community on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. We utilized grounded theory and thematic analysis to examine the data. The impact of poverty, ubiquitous gendered violence, transactional sex and unsafe recreational spaces emerged as the major themes. The experiences of youth were consumed by issues of safety rather than the pursuit of other developmentally appropriate markers. Our findings suggest that health promotion programs should create safe spaces for youth and opportunities to critically question the assumptions and manifestations of a patriarchal society. Furthermore, the findings indicate that there is a strong need for multi-sectorial interventions directed at many levels to prevent gender-based violence."

            "abstract": "The long-standing question of who responds to placebo and who does not is of great theoretical and clinical relevance and has received increasing attention in recent years. We therefore performed a post hoc analysis of one of our previously published studies on placebo responses (PRs). In the analysis, fourteen potential predictors for the PR on experimentally induced motion sickness in 32 healthy volunteers were explored using moderated multiple regression. Generalized self-efficacy, generalized self, internal locus of control and cognitive flexibility were significantly associated with symptom improvement in the placebo group, as compared to the untreated control group. Notably, the directions of the associations were such that the \"unfavorable\" side of the constructs (e.g. low self-efficacy) predicted a higher PR. Instead, the \"favorable\" side predicted symptom improvement in the control group. Results fit well with prior research into psychological influences on motion sickness. Although PRs in motion sickness are not well established, it is suggested to include the identified constructs in future research involving motion sickness-related symptoms such as nausea and vertigo. Concerning PRs in general, the results may have implications for clinical as well as experimental research on other symptoms and disorders, such as pain or depression."

However, no consensus exists regarding the most effective way to provide people with risk information. We will review and evaluate the relative merits of two approaches to risk communication. One approach relies on the presentation of numerical information regarding the probability of a health problem occurring, whereas the other relies on the presentation of information about the antecedents and consequences of a health problem. Because people have considerable difficulty understanding and using quantitative information, the effectiveness of interventions that rely solely on numerical probability information has been limited. Interventions that provide people with a broader informational context in which to think about a health problem have had greater success systematically influencing perceptions of personal risk but have several important limitations. However, before any final conclusions can be drawn regarding the relative merits of different communication strategies, investigators must agree on the specific criteria that should be used to identify an effective intervention."

            "abstract": "Varenicline, a partial agonist of alpha(4)beta(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is the most recently approved drug for smoking cessation. This paper reviews the outcomes of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that assess the efficacy of varenicline in comparison to placebo and other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, ie, sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and nicotine transdermal patch. Varenicline has higher abstinence rates than placebo and the alternative active treatments at the end of standard regimen treatment periods. Significantly higher abstinence rates were also found with varenicline in comparison to both placebo and bupropion SR at the end of a 40-week non-treatment follow-up period. Varenicline typically tripled the abstinence rates compared with placebo. In addition, varenicline reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms as well as some of the positive experiences associated with smoking to a greater extent than placebo, bupropion SR, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). These findings are consistent with the proposed agonist/antagonist effects of varenicline. Preliminary studies assessing individual variables such as smoking dependency level and smoking reinforcement types provide justification to examine further the effects of varenicline according to these individual factors. Outcomes from such research could improve our understanding of varenicline's mechanism of action and could ultimately help clinicians to develop individualized smoking cessation programs. Also, given varenicline's ability to reduce the reward from smoking, it might be helpful to use it before cessation to motivate or prepare smokers for a quit attempt."

The study was the first to include an adapted version of the Traumatic Brain Injury Self-Efficacy Scale to assess cognitive self-efficacy (CSE) in people who have experienced cancer. Results revealed participating in the intervention was associated with significantly faster performance on one objective cognitive task that measures processing speed and visual scanning. Significantly larger improvements for the intervention group were also found on measures of perceived cognitive impairments and CSE. There was some evidence to support the roles of CSE and illness perceptions as potential mechanisms of change for the intervention. Overall, the study provided additional evidence of feasibility and efficacy of group psychological intervention for targeting cancer-related cognitive decline."

Smoking cessation results in a positive change in atherogenic factors. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been observed as increasing with smoking cessation. Since the use of nicotine transdermal replacement has become so widespread, this study examined the effect, if any, of the transdermal nicotine system on selected cardiovascular parameters in patients who were abstinent from cigarette smoking, and possible dose effect.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eight cardiovascular outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and Week 6 in both abstinent and non-abstinent patients randomized to four treatment groups; transdermal nicotine system 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg per day, and placebos.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In abstinent patients, systolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased from baseline (while still smoking, before the start of the study) to the end of transdermal treatment, while weight increased. Similarly, HDL increased while LDL decreased and triglycerides increased. In nonabstinent patients, weight also increased from baseline to Week 6 while heart rate decreased. No other variables showed significant change. In abstinent patients, effect of nicotine dosage was observed with greater weight gain in placebo than 21 mg TTS patients and greater decrease in heart rate in placebo than 21 mg TTS patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In summary, the abstinent patients showed a positive effect of smoking cessation on cardiovascular risk factors even while using the transdermal nicotine system.

            "abstract": "Handing down health knowledge and behavior patterns is a main objective of health promotion. Often, interventions do not bring about the intended change of behavior. This could be due, among other things, to the fact that the majority of intervention programs are not based on principles of instructional design to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. A situated design of health promotion measures is to be considered particularly suitable. That accounts for the fact that the acquisition and application of knowledge is an active construction process on the part of the individuals involved, and one that includes the possibility to improve the quality of learning processes in the area of health promotion, and thus increases the probability that acquired knowledge can be applied in real situations. In the context of the problem that most health promotion interventions frequently do not show the desired permanent behavioral changes of the participating individuals, from a pedagogical perspective, it is crucial that current didactic-methodological principles be taken into account. This, too, should be taken into account in connection with an empirical analysis of the reflections in this article. In the following paper, various suggestions for implementation are explained and discussed."

However, to date, relatively limited information is available on preventing teenage fatherhood or improving outcomes for young fathers. A notable gap is concerned with understanding the forms of sexual health programmes that are most effective from the perspective of young men. We conducted a systematic mapping to identify studies involving young men aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy, improving outcomes for teenage fathers or exploring the perspectives of young men around pregnancy and fatherhood. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from January 1996 to August 2008. Three quantitative and 15 qualitative studies were identified, of which nine were UK based. Key themes related to the inappropriateness of current sexual health promotion to respond to the needs of young men. While young men often possessed very similar ideals to young women, existing programmes were problematic when they negatively stereotyped young men and ineffectively addressed models of masculinity or the difficulties young men may have forming meaningful relationships. Further investigations are required on programme development for young men, particularly on sexual health promotion interventions for 'looked-after' young men and those from unstable childhoods."

The STATUS trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combining varenicline with nicotine e-cigarettes for smoking cessation among varenicline non-responders in treatment for mental health illnesses and/or AOD addictions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a pragmatic two-arm, open-label, randomised trial.

Considerable evidence supports a genetic risk for nicotine dependence; however, less is known about the pharmacogenetics of smoking cessation. In the first pharmacogenetic investigation of the efficacy of varenicline and bupropion, we examined whether genes important in the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these drugs and nicotine predict medication efficacy and adverse events. Subjects participated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation clinical trials, comparing varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist, with bupropion, a norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and placebo. Primary analysis included 1175 smokers of European ancestry, and 785 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 24 genes, representing 254 linkage disequilibrium (LD) bins (genes included nAChR subunits, additional varenicline-specific genes, and genes involved in nicotine or bupropion metabolism). For varenicline, continuous abstinence (weeks 9-12) was associated with multiple nAChR subunit genes (including CHRNB2, CHRNA5, and CHRNA4) (OR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.23-2.52) (p<0.005); for bupropion, abstinence was associated with CYP2B6 (OR=1.78; 95% CI: 1.27-2.50) (p<0.001). Incidence of nausea was associated with several nAChR subunit genes (OR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.36-0.70) (p<0.0001) and time to relapse after quitting was associated with HTR3B (HR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.45-2.68) (p<0.0001).

At post-assessment, families in the standard intervention had significantly lower levels of observed child aversive behavior, mother reports of PA and dysfunctional parenting, and higher levels of mother- and partner-rated behavioral self-efficacy than the waitlist control. Families in the standard intervention also had significantly lower levels mother-rated dysfunctional parenting than the brief intervention, and the brief intervention had significantly lower levels of mother-rated dysfunctional parenting than waitlist. There were no significant group differences at post-assessment for measures of parental negative affect or satisfaction with the partner relationship. By 6 month follow-up, families in the brief and standard intervention did not differ significantly on any measure. The implications of the findings to delivery of brief parenting interventions are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 43:291-303, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

            "abstract": "At the 2006 National Conference of the Australian Health Promotion, Māori academic and public health physician Dr Papaarangi Reid challenged us to critique our own practice and asked whether health promotion needs to be de-colonised. In this paper, one Indigenous and two non-Indigenous researchers working within the Aboriginal community controlled health sector reflect on ways in which research and health promotion interventions with Indigenous populations challenge or reinforce the very values that have led to the disadvantage, neglect and apathy experienced by Indigenous populations in the first place. While our practice is framed by the principles of Aboriginal self-determination and community control, we suggest that de-colonising is not so much about the need to invent new research methods nor to search for research methods in traditional Aboriginal culture; it is much more about values, processes and relationships. We recognise the need to challenge the deficit model in health promotion and research, and we do not want to inflict any more damage to the community, through reinforcing stereotypes, creating fear, or contributing to further bad press. We argue for adopting a methodology that shifts power and enables Indigenous people to frame research in ways they want it framed, and for taking a holistic approach and focusing on community strength and resilience."

While the efficacy and safety of this medication have been demonstrated, success rates remain low, and efforts to understand mechanisms of efficacy are in progress. A behavioral economics framework is one unique way to examine how demand for a drug changes under different circumstances. Therefore, the current randomized placebo-controlled, cross-over study aimed to examine effects of varenicline on subjective cigarette craving and objective demand for cigarettes measured by a hypothetical behavioral economic task as well as associations between subjective craving and objective demand.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Non-treatment seeking (n = 37) daily smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) completed a measure of subjective craving for cigarettes and the Cigarette Purchase Task following overnight nicotine abstinence.

This study assessed the impact of PEERS on family chaos, parenting stress, and parenting self-efficacy via a randomized, controlled trial. Results suggested beneficial effects for the experimental group in the domain of family chaos compared to the waitlist control, while parents in the PEERS experimental group also demonstrated increased parenting self-efficacy.

Consequently, the not insubstantial body of literature on sustainability in health promotion is not particularly helpful to decision makers. In this paper we seek to provide some guidance for the development of sustainability for health promotion interventions, arguing that it is necessary to be able to differentiate between (i). levels of social organization which are the focus of change, (ii). the programmes and agencies which are the means employed to achieve change, and (iii). the outcomes or effects that are achieved. Furthermore, funding allocations need to be congruent with programme characteristics if one is serious about achieving sustainability."

Two hundred and fourteen intervention were identified. Illegal drugs were the topic on which the largest number of interventions were focused (29.8%), followed by alcohol (15.9%), the risk-related sexual behaviours (14.6%) and leisure time (12.6%). The activities carried out most often were: participation-based educational methods (30.7%), explanatory education methods (11.5%) and the preparation of educational materials (11%). In 80.8% of the cases, some evaluation of the health promotion activities was found. The type of evaluation employed most often was the process evaluation (73.7%), and the medium-long term results evaluation being those employed the least (2.2%). The evaluation methodologies used most often were questionnaires (28.2%). A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed in 13.2% of the cases. The four interventions in which the medium-long term impact was gauged had the purpose of preventing and reducing cigarette smoking and/or drinking and or marijuana smoking, all of these initiatives achieving a reduction in cigarette smoking. In conclusion, it seems necessary to improve the design of the evaluations of the health promotion initiatives addressed to young people in Spain and to increase the dissemination of the same by way of their publication."

However, models to guide and evaluate capacity building among social service agency staff in community settings are rare in the literature. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a 1-day (7 h) train-the-trainer (TTT) workshop for the \"Enhancing Family Well-Being Project\". The workshop aimed at equipping staff from different community agencies with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and evaluate positive psychology-based interventions for their clients in Sham Shui Po, an over-crowded and low-income district in Hong Kong.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The current TTT extended and improved on our previous successful model by adding research and evaluation methods (including the Logic Model, process evaluation, and randomized controlled trial), which are important to plan and evaluate the community interventions. Evaluation of the TTT was guided by the Integrated Model of Training Evaluation and Effectiveness (IMTEE), with quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were collected from pretraining (T1), post-training (T2), and 6-month (T3) and 12-month (T4) follow-up surveys. Qualitative data were collected from four focus groups of agency staff after the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ninety-three staff from 30 community agencies attended the training, and 90 completed the baseline survey. Eighty-eight, 63, and 57 staff performed the evaluations at T2, T3, and T4, respectively. Agency staff were satisfied with the TTT. Immediate enhancement of knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes toward the training content was found at T2 (Cohen's d ranged from 0.24 to 1.22, all p < 0.05). Enhancement of knowledge of all training contents persisted at T3 and T4 (Cohen's d ranged from 0.34 to 0.63, all p < 0.05). Enhancement of self-efficacy in the use of positive psychology in intervention design persisted at T3 (Cohen's d = 0.22, p = 0.04). The skills learned were utilized to plan and develop subsequent interventions. Twenty-nine interventions were successfully designed and implemented by the agency staff, and delivered to 1,586 participants. The agency staff indicated their intention to utilize the skills they had learned for other interventions (score ≥4 out of 6) and to share these skills with their colleagues. Qualitative feedbacks from 23 agency staff supported the quantitative results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our brief TTT was effectively delivered to a large number of agency staff and showed effects that persisted up to 12 months. Our training and evaluation models may offer a template for capacity building among social service agency staff for community brief, universal family health promotion interventions in diverse settings."

We also examined outcomes at week 6 and, among subjects who smoked during the first 2 weeks of treatment, the probability of reestablishing abstinence later, as well as the effect of active treatment on this outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed pooled data from 2 previously published, parallel, double-blind studies in which subjects were initially randomized to receive an active nicotine patch (starting at 21 mg) or a placebo patch. Subjects randomized to active treatment followed a double-blind step-down dosing regimen: 24-h/21-mg patches for the first 6 weeks of treatment, followed by 14- and 7-mg patches for successive 2-week periods. Biochemically verified abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide <or=8 ppm) was assessed during laboratory visits.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Most subjects were white (94.8%) and female (61.6%), with a mean (SD) age of 43.1 (10.2) years.

To assess the effect of treatment on recovery from smoking lapses, we examined the probability of abstinence during week 10 among subjects who smoked during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Among them, treatment was associated with a greater probability of later success: 31.4% (50/159) of those treated with the active patch and 12.5% (26/208) of those receiving placebo were abstinent at week 10 (RR = 2.52 [95% CI, 1.64-3.85]).

The number of cues over a 7-day period predicted the incidence of a quit attempt on the eighth day (e.g. from 1.5% when no cues occurred to 3% when 7 cues occurred during the 7 days). This effect was dose-dependent and was due to both between and within-subject predictors. Five cues predicted quit attempts. A cue that made smokers concerned about the cost of cigarettes appeared to be the strongest cue. Cues on the day prior were not more powerful predictors than more distal cues. Intention to not smoke the next day on the evening prior to the eighth day was a partial mediator of the effect of cues on quit attempts.

To gain insight into what young adults (aged 19-28) may be seeking in online sexual resources and approaches, this study explored how young people perceived their sexual health to be influenced by their consumption of the highly utilised sexual medium of Sexually Explicit Internet Movies [SEIM]. Employing an exploratory, qualitative methodology, data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 urban, heterosexual young adults, who self-identified as having consumed SEIM for a period of at least one year. All interviews were audiotaped with permission, transcribed verbatim and the data were analysed to identify emergent thematic concepts. Participants described utilising SEIM as an all-inclusive sexual forum to learn more about the positive aspects of sexual health, in a context that they viewed as being devoid of alternatives. Young adults' perceptions of the utility of SEIM suggest that it would be beneficial to create novel, sex-positive online sexual health interventions. Further exploration is clearly warranted on how Internet resources that are related to sexual health, such as SEIM, can be utilised to facilitate innovative approaches to online sexual health promotion."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis) is the second most common cause of peripheral vertigo after benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and accounts for 7% of the patients who present at outpatient clinics specialising in the treatment of dizziness. The exact aetiology of the condition is unknown and the effects of corticosteroids on the condition and its recovery are uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the management of patients with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis).\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials.

All the trials were small and of low methodological quality. Although there was an overall significant effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo medication on complete caloric recovery at one month (risk ratio (RR) of 2.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 6.00, P = 0.007), no significant effect was seen on complete caloric recovery at 12 months (RR 1.58; 95% CI 0.45 to 5.62, P = 0.48), or on the extent of caloric recovery at either one month (mean difference (MD) 9.60%; 95% CI -20.66 to 39.86, P = 0.53) or at 12 months (MD 6.83%; 95% CI -27.69 to 41.36, P = 0.70). In addition, there was no significant difference between corticosteroids and placebo medication in the symptomatic recovery of vestibular function following idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction with respect to vertigo at 24 hours (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.04 to 3.57, P = 0.40) and use of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score at one, three, six and 12 months.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, there is currently insufficient evidence from these trials to support the administration of corticosteroids to patients with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction.

This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in April 2001.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared.

The main outcome measures was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model (Peto).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 108 trials; 94 with a non NRT control group. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.73 (95% confidence interval 1.62-1.85), The odds ratios for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 for gum, 1.76 for patches, 2.27 for nasal spray, 2.08 for inhaled nicotine and 1.73 for nicotine sublingual tablet. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2mg gum (odds ratio 2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to 4.22). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy, in which bupropion was significantly more effective than nicotine patch or placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All of the commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine gum, transdermal patch, the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual tablets) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in combination). However, its most appropriate place in the therapeutic armamentarium requires further study and consideration."

            "abstract": "Health promotion interventions cannot work if people do not engage with them. The aim of this study was to examine whether disengagement from an adolescent smoking prevention and cessation intervention was an independent risk factor for regular smoking 1 and 2 years later. The data were taken from a cluster randomised controlled trial, in the West Midlands, UK, based on the transtheoretical or stages of change model. In this trial, 8,352 13-14-year old school pupils enrolled, and the data in this report were based on the 7,413 and 6,782 pupils present at 1 and 2 years follow-ups, respectively. The intervention group undertook three sessions using an interactive computer programme. At the end of the programme, pupils recorded their responses to it. Pupils were classed as engaged if they thought the intervention was both useful and interesting; all others were classed as disengaged. Random effects logistic regression related the number of times engaged to regular smoking at 1 and 2 years follow-up, adjusted for school absences and 11 potential confounders. The majority of pupils were engaged by the intervention. For participants using the intervention three times but not engaging once, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for smoking at 1 and 2 years relative to the controls were 1.83 (1.41-2.39) and 1.70 (1.38-2.11). For those engaging three times, they were 0.79 (0.60-1.03) and 0.96 (0.75-1.21). There was no interaction with baseline intention to smoke, classified by stage of change, but there was a borderline significant interaction with baseline smoking status, with disengagement acting as a stronger risk factor among baseline never-smokers. We conclude that disengagement from interventions is a risk factor for smoking independently of experimentation with cigarettes. The best explanation is that disengagement from school, an established risk factor for smoking, generalises to disengagement from didactic school-based health promotion programmes."

Hence, there is a need for cost-effective, accessible interventions that will help people find ways to better manage this difficult problem. This randomized controlled trial examined the effect of a low-cost, community-based, nurse-delivered, group psychoeducation program entitled the Chronic Pain Self-Management Program (CPSMP). It has a standard protocol that was modified from the successful Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP). One hundred and ten individuals with mixed idiopathic chronic pain conditions were enrolled in the study (75% female; mean age 40 years; mean chronicity 6 years) and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the 12-h (CPSMP) intervention group, or the 3-month wait-list control group. Self-report measures of pain-related and other quality of life variables as well as two hypothesized mediating variables were collected pre-treatment and 3 months later by assessors blind to group allocation. One hundred and two subjects completed the study. Results of intention-to-treat analysis indicated that the treatment group made significant short-term improvements in pain, dependency, vitality, aspects of role functioning, life satisfaction and in self-efficacy and resourcefulness as compared to the wait-list control group. Because it has a standard protocol, this intervention has the potential to be reliably delivered at low cost in varied urban and rural community settings and hence be more widely accessible to a greater number of people suffering from chronic pain than is currently the case with more specialized pain clinic services. Based on the results of this study, further research evaluating the long-term impact and potential cost savings to the individual and to the health care system is warranted."

An intervention that has been shown to be effective in one setting may turn out to be ineffective somewhere else, even supposing it can be implemented there. Therefore, systematic reviews of public health interventions should appraise the applicability of the intervention process and the transferability of the intervention effectiveness to other localities. However, applicability and transferability appraisal is seldom reported in systematic reviews of public health and health promotion interventions. This paper aims to introduce an innovative approach to bridging this gap. A list of attributes that may impact on applicability and transferability can be developed, based on knowledge of the proposed intervention. Then the applicability and transferability of the intervention to the local setting can be rated, and given a score, based on knowledge of the local setting. This approach provides a useful tool for evaluating public health interventions and provides a reliable basis for informed decision making in resource-poor settings, where rigorous primary studies are lacking and where very limited resources put a high demand on evidence-based approaches to health promotion."

The present study tested whether the recentness of smoking was an important determinant in the ability of a placebo cigarette to reduce tobacco craving. Placebo (0.07 mg nicotine) and conventional (1.1 mg nicotine) cigarettes were used in a spaced smoking paradigm. In six experimental sessions lasting 240 min, subjects smoked either a placebo or conventional nicotine cigarette in intervals of either 30, 60, or 240 min. Heart rate (HR), exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and subjective (Schuh-Stitzer, QSU) measures of tobacco craving were obtained throughout the spaced smoking paradigm. HR and CO levels increased after smoking both types of cigarettes. Increasing the interval since the last cigarette significantly (p<0.001) increased the baseline values of tobacco craving. Smoking either the placebo or the conventional cigarette caused a significant (p<0.01) reduction in the craving score after smoking. However, the nicotine yield of the cigarette did not influence these patterns. It is concluded that acute tobacco cravings can be repeatedly diminished with cigarettes that do not deliver nicotine."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This review is one of a suite of six Cochrane reviews looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition involving inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment or compared with other pharmacological interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included eight RCTs (474 randomised participants), which compared oral corticosteroids with placebo or no intervention. All trials only recruited adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All trials reported outcomes at two to three weeks, at the end of the short-course oral steroid treatment period. Three trials additionally reported outcomes at three to six months. Two of these studies prescribed intranasal steroids to patients in both arms of the trial at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. Oral steroids versus placebo or no intervention Disease-specific health-related quality of life was reported by one study. This study reported improved quality of life after treatment (two to three weeks) in the group receiving oral steroids compared with the group who received placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.92 to -0.56, 40 participants, modified RSOM-31), which corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be low quality (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). Disease severity as measured by patient-reported symptom scores was reported by two studies, which allowed the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, hyposmia) to be combined into one score. The results at the end of treatment (two to three weeks) showed an improvement in patients receiving oral steroids compared to placebo, both when presented as a mean final value (SMD -2.84, 95% CI -4.09 to -1.59, 22 participants) and as a change from baseline (SMD -2.28, 95% CI -2.76 to -1.80, 114 participants). These correspond to large effect sizes but we assessed the evidence to be low quality.One study (114 participants) followed patients for 10 weeks after the two-week treatment period. All patients in both arms received intranasal steroids at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. The results showed that the initial results after treatment were not sustained (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.15, 114 participants, percentage improvement from baseline). This corresponds to a small effect size and we assessed the evidence to be low quality.There was an increase in adverse events in people receiving orals steroids compared with placebo for gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.78; 187 participants; three studies) and insomnia (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.95; 187 participants; three studies). There was no significant impact of oral steroids on mood disturbances at the dosage used in the included study (risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 0.55 to 11.41; 40 participants; one study). We assessed the evidence to be low quality due to the lack of definitions of the adverse events and the small number of events or sample size, or both). Other comparisons No studies that compared short-course oral steroids with other treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis met the inclusion criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At the end of the treatment course (two to three weeks) there is an improvement in health-related quality of life and symptom severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps taking oral corticosteroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding is low. At three to six months after the end of the oral steroid treatment period, there is little or no improvement in health-related quality of life or symptom severity for patients taking an initial course of oral steroids compared with placebo or no treatment.The data on the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids indicate that there may be an increase in insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances but it is not clear whether there is an increase in mood disturbances. All of the adverse events results are based on low quality evidence.More research in this area, particularly research evaluating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.There is no evidence for oral steroids compared with other treatments."

            "abstract": "Islamic religious settings (IRS) may be useful places to implement obesity interventions for Muslims. However, little is known about the level and nature of such activity in these settings. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature, and requested grey information from Muslim organizations, local councils, and mosques in 13 selected areas in the United Kingdom. Thirty-five interventions were identified; most were poorly described and not evaluated. Twenty-seven interventions focused on physical activity behaviours, four on diet behaviours, one on both behaviours, and seven addressed long-term conditions associated with obesity. Most interventions were led by volunteers from the congregation/faith leaders and were funded through donations from congregants or charity organizations. The evidence suggests that health promotion interventions in IRS have a relatively high reach. Obesity interventions are commonly delivered in UK IRS. Most target physical activity behaviours, are instigated and led by volunteers from the congregation or faith leaders, receive no public funding, and are only recorded in people's memories. High-quality evaluations of well-specified interventions in this context are needed. We suggest that the methods used in this review, including the learning around positionality of researchers, could be adopted by other researchers as a way to locate opportunities for effective community-level interventions."

            "abstract": "Increased focus on prevention presents health promoters with new opportunities and challenges. In this context, the study of factors influencing policy-maker decisions to scale up health promotion interventions from small projects or controlled trials to wider state, national or international roll-out is increasingly important. This study aimed to: (i) examine the perspectives of senior researchers and policy-makers regarding concepts of 'scaling up' and 'scalability'; (ii) generate an agreed definition of 'scalability' and (iii) identify intervention and research design factors perceived to increase the potential for interventions to be implemented on a more widespread basis or 'scaled up'. A two-stage Delphi process with an expert panel of senior Australian public health intervention researchers (n = 7) and policy-makers (n = 7) and a review of relevant literature were conducted. Through this process 'scalability' was defined as: the ability of a health intervention shown to be efficacious on a small scale and or under controlled conditions to be expanded under real world conditions to reach a greater proportion of the eligible population, while retaining effectiveness. Results showed that in health promotion research insufficient attention is given to issues of effectiveness, reach and adoption; human, technical and organizational resources; costs; intervention delivery; contextual factors and appropriate evaluation approaches. If these issues were addressed in the funding, design and reporting of intervention research, it would advance the quality and usability of research for policy-makers and by doing so improve uptake and expansion of promising programs into practice."

Widely available on the Internet, it is reported to carry a wide range of health risks and side effects such as localised skin problems, nerve damage and oil-filled cysts, as well as muscle damage and the development of scar tissue. Given the tension between health risk and quick muscle enlargement, how lay users explain and justify their synthol intake becomes an important question. Drawing on discourse analysis, we focus on how lay expertise is worked up by users in the absence of available specialist knowledge by invoking medical and pharmaceutical discourses as legitimation, providing novices with support, gaining trust through positive personal narratives and thus gaining credibility as experts.

The intervention, housed in kiosks in supermarkets and based on social cognitive theory, used tailored information and self-regulation strategies delivered in 15 brief weekly segments. The study sample (N = 277), stratified and randomly assigned to treatment or control, was 96% female, was 92% White, had a median annual income of about $35,000, and had a mean education of 14. 78 +/- 2.11 years. About 12% of the sample reported incomes of $20,000 or less, and about 20% reported 12 years or fewer of education. Analysis of covariance immediately after intervention and at a 4- to 6-month follow-up found that treatment led to improved levels of fat, fiber, and fruits and vegetables. Treatment also led to higher levels of nutrition-related self-efficacy, physical outcome expectations, and social outcome expectations. Logistic regression analysis determined that the treatment group was more likely than the control group to attain goals for fat, fiber, and fruits and vegetables at posttest and to attain goals for fat at follow-up. Latent variable structural equation analysis revealed self-efficacy and physical outcome expectations mediated treatment effects on nutrition. In addition, physical outcome expectations mediated the effect of self-efficacy on nutrition outcomes. Implications for future computer-based health promotion interventions are discussed."

            "abstract": "In this experiment, we tested for opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of pain control through cognitive means and the relation of opioid involvement to perceived coping efficacy. Subjects were taught cognitive methods of pain control, were administered a placebo, or received no intervention. Their pain tolerance was then measured at periodic intervals after they were administered either a saline solution or naloxone, an opiate antagonist that blocks the effects of endogenous opiates. Training in cognitive control strengthened perceived self-efficacy both to withstand and to reduce pain; placebo medication enhanced perceived efficacy to withstand pain but not reductive efficacy; and neither form of perceived self-efficacy changed without any intervention. Regardless of condition, the stronger the perceived self-efficacy to withstand pain, the longer subjects endured mounting pain stimulation. The findings provide evidence that attenuation of the impact of pain stimulation through cognitive control is mediated by both opioid and nonopioid mechanisms. Cognitive copers administered naloxone were less able to tolerate pain stimulation than were their saline counterparts. The stronger the perceived self-efficacy to reduce pain, the greater was the opioid activation. Cognitive copers were also able to achieve some increase in pain tolerance even when opioid mechanisms were blocked by naloxone, which is in keeping with a nonopioid component in cognitive pain control. We found suggestive evidence that placebo medication may also activate some opioid involvement. Because placebos do not impart pain reduction skills, it was perceived self-efficacy to endure pain that predicted degree of opioid activation."

Initial results from AT indicated significant increases in abstinence self-efficacy and medication utilization and declines in cigarettes smoked per day across time. Given historical racial disparities, it is unclear if both African Americans and White smokers would benefit equally from this type of intervention. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine racial differences in response to AT guided smoking cessation for African American and White smokers living with HIV. One hundred PLWH smokers (n = 100) were randomized to receive either AT guided smoking cessation or Treatment as Usual (TAU) which consisted of instructing participants to talk to a provider about smoking cessation assistance when ready to make a quit attempt. Participants were African American (75%) and White (25%) and majority men (71%) who had never been married (56%). African Americans smoked fewer cigarettes and were more likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes compared to White smokers at baseline. African Americans increased their use of other tobacco products (cigars/cigarillos) over time relative to White smokers. A significant interaction between race and quit goal was observed, with White smokers who reported complete abstinence as their goal having higher quit rates, while African Americans who reported a goal other than complete abstinence demonstrating higher quit rates. The increased use of cigars/cigarillos during quit attempts as well as having a goal other than complete abstinence should be considered when applying algorithm based interventions for PLWH African American smokers."

MATRIALS AND METHODS: A double blind placebo controlled trial was conducted to see the efficacy of Bupropion in smoking cessation. Smokers with current depression were excluded. The subjects (n = 30) were randomly assigned to receive Bupropion SR 300 mg/day or placebo for seven weeks. Target quit date was preferentially 8(th) day of starting the treatment. Intensive counseling was provided by the physician at the baseline and brief counseling at every visit weekly during the treatment phase and at weeks 12 and 16.

Rates of continuous abstinence at weeks 4, 7 and 16 were 46.67%, 40% and 33.33% in the drug group and 13.33%, 13.33% and 13.33% in the placebo group respectively. The rates were significantly higher in the drug group till week 4 starting from week 2 of the treatment phase. The mean weight gain in drug group was found to be significant less as compared to the placebo at week 16 (P = 0.025) The mean change of depression scores from the baseline was not significantly different between the two groups at any point of time. The withdrawal symptom score increase from the baseline was not significantly higher at any point of time in the drug group but in the placebo group the increase was significantly higher for seven days after target quit date and at weeks 3 and 4 (P < 0.05). The most common adverse events in the drug group were insomnia, which was seen in 6 (40%) patients and dry mouth and/or altered taste in 4 (26.67%) patients, which was significantly higher as compared to placebo. PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME: The univariate predictors of a successful outcome were the point prevalence abstinence at week 16 were older age (>40 years), (P = 0.044) and quitter status at week 2 (P = 0.001). Multivariate predictors in order of importance were Quit status at 2nd week (P = 0.002) and Age >40 years (P = 0.031). The combined predictive value of these two variables was found to be 86.3%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion helps in smoking cessation.

The primary outcome measure was continuous, CO-verified abstinence from the target quit date for 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No significant effect of glucose tablets on abstinence was found (14.6% vs 13.4% abstinence in the glucose and placebo groups, respectively). However, there was a significant interaction with a glucose effect observed in smokers also receiving other medication (18.2% vs 12.6%, p < 0.05) but not otherwise (10.7% vs 14.3% ; p < 0.05 for the interaction).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      No significant effect of glucose tablets over and above sweet tasting tablets could be detected overall, but the possibility of an effect as an adjunct to NRT or bupropion merits further investigation."

            "abstract": "People with disabilities (PWD) are more likely to use tobacco and less likely to access tobacco cessation programs compared with people without disabilities. Living Independent From Tobacco (LIFT), an evidence-based intervention designed for PWD, was piloted with dyads of PWD (n = 5) and their caregivers (n = 7). As an important source of practical and social support for PWD, caregivers also impact health-related attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors of PWD. Caregivers who smoke may unwittingly interfere with cessation efforts of the people they support. We found that LIFT could be offered to dyads of PWD and their caregivers with fidelity. The intervention was associated with increased use of coping strategies and self-efficacy to reduce smoking. Tobacco use decreased at post-test (-34.94%), with further reduction 6-months after the intervention (-50.60%). Implications for offering inclusive health promotion interventions to both PWD and their caregivers are discussed."

            "abstract": "In this article, the authors draw on the disciplines of sociology and environmental and social epidemiology to further understanding of mechanisms through which social factors contribute to disparate environmental exposures and health inequalities. They propose a conceptual framework for environmental health promotion that considers dynamic social processes through which social and environmental inequalities--and associated health disparities--are produced, reproduced, and potentially transformed. Using empirical evidence from the published literature, as well as their own practical experiences in conducting community-based participatory research in Detroit and Harlem, the authors examine health promotion interventions at various levels (community-wide, regional, and national) that aim to improve population health by addressing various aspects of social processes and/or physical environments. Finally, they recommend moving beyond environmental remediation strategies toward environmental health promotion efforts that are sustainable and explicitly designed to reduce social, environmental, and health inequalities."

            "abstract": "Nutrition literacy and food literacy have become increasingly important concepts in health promotion. Researchers use one or the other term to describe the competencies needed to maintain a healthy diet. This systematic review examines whether these terms are synonymous or if their meanings are substantially different.We searched major bibliographic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, SocIndex and ERIC) for publications that provided an original definition of nutrition or food literacy. Then we used Nutbeam's tripartite health literacy model as an analytical grid. The definitions we found included specific competencies, which we mapped to the domains of functional, interactive, or critical literacy.In the 173 full-text publications we screened, we found six original definitions of nutrition literacy, and 13 original definitions of food literacy. Seven food literacy definitions were integrated into a conceptual framework. Analysing their structure revealed that nutrition literacy and food literacy are seen as specific forms of health literacy, and represent distinct but complementary concepts. Definitions of nutrition literacy mainly described the abilities necessary to obtain and understand nutrition information. Definitions of food literacy incorporated a broader spectrum of theoretical and practical knowledge and skills. To be food literate also means to apply information on food choices and critically reflect on the effect of food choice on personal health and on society. Since food literacy is based on a more comprehensive understanding of health behaviours, it is the more viable term to use in health promotion interventions. For the practical implication, a harmonization of the different definitions is desirable."

We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for primary and secondary outcomes of the review. We collected data on adverse events from included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen studies randomising 741 participants with CTS were included in the review. Two compared a mobilisation regimen to a no treatment control, three compared one mobilisation intervention (for example carpal bone mobilisation) to another (for example soft tissue mobilisation), nine compared nerve mobilisation delivered as part of a multi-component intervention to another non-surgical intervention (for example splint or therapeutic ultrasound), and three compared a mobilisation intervention other than nerve mobilisation (for example yoga or chiropractic treatment) to another non-surgical intervention. The risk of bias of the included studies was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only three explicitly reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed, and four reporting blinding of participants. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions delivered, outcomes measured and timing of outcome assessment, therefore, we were unable to pool results across studies. Only four studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short-term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared to baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post-treatment). However, of these, only three fully reported outcome data sufficient for inclusion in the review. One very low quality trial with 14 participants found that all participants receiving either neurodynamic mobilisation or carpal bone mobilisation and none in the no treatment group reported overall improvement (RR 15.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 220.92), though the precision of this effect estimate is very low. One low quality trial with 22 participants found that the chance of being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with treatment was 24% higher for participants receiving instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilisation compared to standard soft tissue mobilisation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.75), though participants were not blinded and it was unclear if the allocation sequence was concealed. Another very low-quality trial with 26 participants found that more CTS-affected wrists receiving nerve gliding exercises plus splint plus activity modification had no pathologic finding on median and ulnar nerve distal sensory latency assessment at the end of treatment than wrists receiving splint plus activity modification alone (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.30). However, a unit of analysis error occurred in this trial, as the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS was not accounted for. Only two studies measured adverse effects, so more data are required before any firm conclusions on the safety of exercise and mobilisation interventions can be made. In general, the results of secondary outcomes of the review (short- and long-term improvement in CTS symptoms, functional ability, health-related quality of life, neurophysiologic parameters, and the need for surgery) for most comparisons had 95% CIs which incorporated effects in either direction.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for CTS. People with CTS who indicate a preference for exercise or mobilisation interventions should be informed of the limited evidence of effectiveness and safety of this intervention by their treatment provider. Until more high quality randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of various exercise and mobilisation interventions compared to other non-surgical interventions are undertaken, the decision to provide this type of non-surgical intervention to people with CTS should be based on the clinician's expertise in being able to deliver these treatments and patient's preferences."

Topiramate reduces heavy drinking and has separately been found to help non-alcohol-dependent individuals quit smoking.

Longitudinal mixed-effects regression indicated that the effect of treatment on smoking was moderated by the Type × Time interaction. Specifically, during the nontreatment follow-up phase, Type B's treated with topiramate had relative suppressed levels of smoking compared with placebo-treated Type B's.

For the development of effective empowerment promoting interventions, adequate study designs, methods, and indicators for assessing empowerment are essential. In order to better understand which evaluation procedures have been used so far, and which advantages and disadvantages are connected to them, we systematically reviewed empowerment-based health promotion interventions. We included 26 studies, which use a broad variety of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods designs and various data collection methods; qualitative and mixed-methods designs predominated. The quantitative measurement instruments are heterogeneous: Mainly self-designed or modified scales are applied. All studies consider indicators reflecting individual competencies and motivations, whereas indicators capturing the organizational and political components of empowerment are less common. Involving target group members in the development of evaluation procedures and combining different data sources are mentioned as specific steps to improve the quality of data collection. Given the flexible and context-dependent nature of empowerment approaches, the development of a \"gold standard\" for its evaluation seems unrealistic. However, the analyzed studies can be used to deduce recommendations that may help to conduct high-quality evaluations of empowerment, for example, mixed-methods designs, participation of target groups, and reflective loops within the research team."

            "abstract": "Social learning theory considers self-efficacy as a causal factor in behavior change. However, in line with behavioral theory, recent clinical research suggests self-efficacy ratings may reflect, rather than cause, behavior change. To test these two disparate views, self-efficacy was related to actual smoking abstinence on the next day (i.e., self-efficacy causes change), and abstinence status over 1 day was tested as a predictor of rated self-efficacy for quitting the next day (i.e., reflects change). All data were from two similar crossover studies evaluating the short-term effects of both placebo versus medication, nicotine patch (n = 209) or varenicline (n = 123), on smoking abstinence during week-long practice quit attempts. Placebo and active medication periods were separated by an ad lib smoking washout, and analyses were controlled for prior-day's abstinence or self-efficacy values. Results were very consistent between studies in showing essentially bidirectional associations: daily self-efficacy predicted next-day's abstinence, and current-day's abstinence status predicted self-efficacy for abstinence the next day. However, secondary factors differentially predicted abstinence and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy, between these two medication studies. These data provide some support for both social learning and behavioral theories of smoking behavior change, although self-efficacy may only briefly predict subsequent short periods of abstinence as assessed in these studies. Nonetheless, because self-efficacy has long been assumed to cause behavior change, including smoking cessation, the notion of self-efficacy as a reflection of recent smoking behavior change in these studies warrants greater attention in clinical research on smoking cessation treatment."

The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The results of included studies were synthesised using narrative and statistical methods. A separate systematic search was undertaken to identify existing health economic analyses of home-based, nurse-led health promotion programmes. Included studies were critically appraised using a published checklist. Owing to resource constraints, a de novo health economic model was not developed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eleven studies were included in the systematic review of clinical effectiveness. There was considerable heterogeneity among the studies with respect to the nature of the intervention, the nurses delivering the programmes and the populations in which the interventions were assessed. Overall, the quality of the included studies was good: all but one of the included studies were judged to be at medium or low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of eight studies suggested a statistically significant mortality benefit for the home-based health promotion groups, whereas a meta-analysis of four studies suggested non-significant benefits in terms of fewer falls in the intervention groups than in the control groups. Positive outcomes for home-based, nurse-led health promotion interventions were also reported within individual studies across several other outcomes. Only three economic studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review of cost-effectiveness. This evidence base consists of one non-randomised cost minimisation analysis and two economic evaluations undertaken alongside randomised controlled trials. Two of these studies involved an intervention targeted specifically at patients with a known underlying incurable disease, whereas the third study examined the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early discharge in patients with a range of conditions, including fractures, neurological conditions and cardiorespiratory conditions. Each study indicated some likelihood that home-based, nurse-led health promotion may offer cost savings to the NHS and associated sectors, such as social services. However, one study did not report any comparison of health outcomes and instead simply assumed equivalence between the intervention and comparator groups, whereas the other two studies suggested at best a negligible incremental benefit in terms of preference-based health-related quality-of-life measures.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The evidence base for clinical effectiveness is subject to considerable heterogeneity. The UK economic evidence base is limited to three studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of the evidence included in this systematic review, home-based, nurse-led health promotion may offer clinical benefits across a number of important health dimensions. However, it is generally unclear from the available studies which components of this type of complex intervention contribute towards individual aspects of benefit for older people. Given the limitations of the current evidence base, it remains unclear whether or not home-based health promotion interventions offer good value for money for the NHS and associated sectors. Given the considerable uncertainties in the available evidence base, it is difficult to isolate the key areas in which future research would be valuable or the exact study design required.

            "abstract": "This paper reports on a review undertaken for the Health Education Board for Scotland on 'health events'. On the basis of a literature review and interviews with 20 professionals in the UK, it appraised the effectiveness of such activities, assessed their current extent and status, and ultimately considered whether they are useful and relevant within emergent contexts. It suggests that the evidence base for health events is relatively weak, particularly given the scale of such work. At best, all that can be said is that there is some evidence that some of these events have some use within very specific assumptions and values. Consideration is given to possible ways forward. The paper also considers a series of related issues that impinge on the assessment of complex health promotion interventions. From our field interviews, health events are perceived by most to be labour intensive and ineffective. Rather, they are undertaken for a range of pragmatic 'public relations' reasons that exist independent of knowledge, attitudinal or behavioural outcomes. This ambiguity of expectation coupled with a paucity of published high-quality literature led to the use of a judicial approach to evidence appraisal. It considers the ways in which this exercise could be undertaken, ultimately being sceptical of systematic meta-reviews."

It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      In April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Criteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      When possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression. There was no evidence found for the use of bupropion in smokers with current depression. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants in smokers with current or past depression. There was also not enough evidence to evaluate the group of trials that investigated interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions."

A potential pharmaceutical treatment for smoking cessation is selegiline, a selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor. A few clinical trials have been carried out using selegiline but the results have been mixed. We sought to determine if genetic markers in cholinergic loci in the 15q24 chromosomal region predict response to smoking cessation therapy with selegiline.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the selegiline transdermal system in heavy smokers, with follow-up at weeks 25 and 52. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15q24 region, which contains the genes for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4, were investigated for association with treatment response.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The CHRNB4 promoter SNP rs3813567 was associated with both point prevalence abstinence and post-quit craving. Carriers of the minor C allele treated with selegiline showed lower rates of abstinence and higher levels of craving than selegiline-treated non-carriers, indicating that the rs3813567 C allele adversely affects abstinence in selegiline-treated smokers. This effect was not present among placebo-treated smokers. Selegiline-treated smokers with the CHRNA5 rs680244 GG genotype had lower post-quit craving, and unlike placebo-treated GG-carrying smokers, did not experience a post-quit increase in depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Variants in genes encoding cholinergic receptors affect abstinence, craving and mood in selegiline-treated smokers.

A post-test design prevents the risk of testing bias. The required sample size is 14 schools, with 10 classes per school and 13 unregistered students per class. The questionnaire assesses demographics, behavioural determinants (attitude, self-efficacy, knowledge and social outcomes), intention to register (as a donor) and registration status. Six months after delivery, registration status will be assessed again.

When used by non-pregnant smokers, pharmacotherapies (nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline) are effective for smoking cessation, however, their efficacy and safety in pregnancy remains unknown. Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), or e-cigarettes, are becoming widely used but their efficacy and safety when used for smoking cessation in pregnancy are also unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the efficacy and safety of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (including NRT, varenicline and bupropion), other medications, or ENDS when used for smoking cessation in pregnancy.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 July 2015), checked references of retrieved studies, and contacted authors.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in pregnant women with designs that permit the independent effects of any type of pharmacotherapy or ENDS on smoking cessation to be ascertained were eligible for inclusion.The following RCT designs are included.Placebo-RCTs: any form of NRT, other pharmacotherapy, or ENDS, with or without behavioural support/cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), or brief advice, compared with an identical placebo and behavioural support of similar intensity.RCTs providing a comparison between i) any form of NRT, other pharmacotherapy, or ENDS added to behavioural support/CBT, or brief advice and ii) behavioural support of similar (ideally identical) intensity.Parallel- or cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised, cross-over and within-participant designs were not, due to the potential biases associated with these designs.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and also independently extracted data and cross checked individual outcomes of this process to ensure accuracy. The primary efficacy outcome was smoking cessation in later pregnancy (in all but one trial, at or around delivery); safety was assessed by 11 outcomes (principally birth outcomes) that indicated neonatal and infant well-being; and we also collated data on adherence with trial treatments.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      This review includes a total of nine trials which enrolled 2210 pregnant smokers: eight trials of NRT and one trial of bupropion as adjuncts to behavioural support/CBT. The risk of bias was generally low across trials with virtually all domains of the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool being satisfied for the majority of studies. We found no trials investigating varenicline or ENDS. Compared to placebo and non-placebo controls, there was a difference in smoking rates observed in later pregnancy favouring use of NRT (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.93, eight studies, 2199 women). However, subgroup analysis of placebo-RCTs provided a lower RR in favour of NRT (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.66, five studies, 1926 women), whereas within the two non-placebo RCTs there was a strong positive effect of NRT, (RR 8.51, 95% CI 2.05 to 35.28, three studies, 273 women; P value for random-effects subgroup interaction test = 0.01). There were no differences between NRT and control groups in rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, birthweight, low birthweight, admissions to neonatal intensive care, caesarean section, congenital abnormalities or neonatal death. Compared to placebo group infants, at two years of age, infants born to women who had been randomised to NRT had higher rates of 'survival without developmental impairment' (one trial). Generally, adherence with trial NRT regimens was low. Non-serious side effects observed with NRT included headache, nausea and local reactions (e.g. skin irritation from patches or foul taste from gum), but these data could not be pooled.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NRT used in pregnancy for smoking cessation increases smoking cessation rates measured in late pregnancy by approximately 40%. There is evidence, suggesting that when potentially-biased, non-placebo RCTs are excluded from analyses, NRT is no more effective than placebo. There is no evidence that NRT used for smoking cessation in pregnancy has either positive or negative impacts on birth outcomes. However, evidence from the only trial to have followed up infants after birth, suggests use of NRT promotes healthy developmental outcomes in infants. Further research evidence on NRT efficacy and safety is needed, ideally from placebo-controlled RCTs which achieve higher adherence rates and which monitor infants' outcomes into childhood. Accruing data suggests that it would be ethical for future RCTs to investigate higher doses of NRT than those tested in the included studies."

Participants' expectations and experiences of the innovative nicotine vaccine were characterized by ambivalence: Although they complied with the research design, throughout the study they tinkered with discourses, objects, and activities to make them serve their individual goals. They made the concepts of nicotine vaccination and placebo treatment meaningful for quitting, reshaped the meaning of research tests and obligatory visits to serve their own personal goals, and introduced a new element into the trial by creating space to discuss problems that might endanger the quit attempt.

ANOVA determined whether diet and BMI differed among mothers scoring in the highest, middle, and lowest tertiles on the Likert scales. For self-efficacy, coping, sets goals, and outcome expectations scales, lowest tertile mothers had significantly higher BMIs than highest tertile mothers. The lowest tertile for self-efficacy, self-reward, and self-monitoring consumed significantly less fibre, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and fruit and vegetables than upper tertiles. On the self-efficacy scale, the lowest tertile consumed significantly more calories, fat, and cholesterol than higher tertiles. Environmental structuring scale findings indicate users of television during dinner had significantly lower intakes of fibre, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and fruits and vegetables than those almost never using TV during dinner. Stepwise regression revealed self-monitoring, environmental structuring, self-reward, and outcome expectations were significant positive predictors of self-efficacy. Self-monitoring was a significant positive predictor of outcome expectations.

The MSM draws on positive deviance practices and processes, focus groups, community advisors, behavioral change theory, and evidence-based strategies. Use of the MSM is illustrated in the development of ethnic-specific weight loss interventions for low-income postpartum women. The MSM may be useful in designing future health programs designed for other special populations for whom existing interventions are unavailable or lack relevance."

In Japan, 39.3% of men smoke and this is a major public health concern.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and dose-response relationship of varenicline in Japanese smokers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study, subjects were randomized to receive varenicline at 0.25 mg BID, 0.5 mg BID, 1 mg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks followed by a 40-week, nontreatment follow-up phase. The primary efficacy variable was the continuous abstinence rate (CAR), defined as no reported smoking (not even a puff) or other nicotine use and confirmed by end-expiratory carbon monoxide level <or=10 ppm, during the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12). Secondary end points included CARs for weeks 9-24 and 9-52. Craving, withdrawal, and smoking satisfaction were determined by the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, the Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges, and the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire. The tolerability of varenicline was also evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 618 subjects who received treatment, 515 (83.3%) were classified as nicotine dependent (scoring >or=5 on the Tobacco Dependence Screener), and constituted the primary analysis group. Of these, 385 (74.8%) subjects were male, and the mean age was within the range of 39.0 to 40.2 years. Across treatment groups, subjects claimed to have smoked a mean of 23.1 to 24.9 cigarettes per day in the preceding 30 days, and the mean score on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was within the range from 5.4 to 5.7. The CAR for weeks 9-12 was significantly higher for all doses of varenicline compared with placebo (39.5% [51/129]). The highest CAR of 65.4% (85/130) was achieved with varenicline 1 mg BID (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] = 2.98 [1.78-4.99]; P < 0.001). The CAR for weeks 9-52 was significantly greater for varenicline 1 mg BID than placebo (34.6% [45/130] vs 23.3% [30/129]; OR [95% CI] = 1.81 [1.04-3.17]; P = 0.036). The CARs for weeks 9-24 at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg BID were 33.6% (43/128), 35.2% (45/128), 37.7% (49/130), and for weeks 9-52 at 0.25 and 0.5 mg BID were 27.3% (35/128) and 28.9% (37/128) but failed to reach significance versus the placebo (29.5% [38/129] for weeks 9-24 and 23.3% [30/129] for weeks 9-52). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were more prevalent among varenicline-treated subjects (79.1% [121/153] at 0.25 mg BID, 80.6% [125/155] at 0.5 mg BID, and 80.1% [125/156] at 1 mg BID) than placebo subjects (71.4% [110/154]). The 3 most prevalent AEs at varenicline 1 mg BID were nasopharyngitis (35.9% [56/156]), nausea (24.4% [38/156]), and headache (10.3% [16/156]), all of which were of mild or moderate intensity. Nausea was the only AE that appeared dose related (7.2% [11/153] at 0.25 mg BID, 9.7% [15/155] at 0.5 mg BID, and 24.4% [38/156] at 1 mg BID) versus placebo (7.8% [12/154]).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Varenicline was associated with dose-dependent improvement in smoking abstinence rates during the last 4 weeks of treatment and in the longer term over 40 weeks of nontreatment follow-up.

            "abstract": "We propose using a class of community-level measures--environmental indicators--as part of the evaluation of community-based health-promotion programs. Community-level measures of health-related behavior can be divided into three conceptual categories. The first two categories comprise statistical aggregates (e.g., means, sums, percentages) of measurements made on individuals, distinguished by whether individual-level covariates are also available. Individual-disaggregated measures include covariates, such as a comprehensive survey of health-risk behavior, including demographic information; individual-aggregated measures, such as sales data, do not. Our main focus is on the third category, environmental indicators, derived from observations of the community environment. Environmental indicators measures aspects of the physical, legal, social, and economic environment in a community that reflect, and likely influence, the attitudes and behavior of individual community members. They also measure an important intermediate step in community-based health-promotion interventions, namely environmental factors that programs target to modify individual attitudes and behavior. We present examples of environmental indicators for tobacco use and diet."

Smoking: all participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses; those lost to follow-up (7% for primary outcome) were assumed to be smoking. At 1 month after randomisation, the validated cessation rate was higher in the NRT group {21.3% vs. 11.7%, odds ratio [OR], [95% confidence interval (CI)] for cessation with NRT, 2.05 [1.46 to 2.88]}.

Mental health practices have focued on psychopathphysiology. Stigma heavily plagued clients with mental illnesses and is one of the greatest barriers to mental health recovery. Personal strengths like strengths self-efficacy, people's confidence in using their personal strengths, and resourcefulness, the ability to carry out daily activities, have been linked to positive mental health. However, the linkage between strengths self-efficacy, resourcefulness and mental health recovery remains uncharted. A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed methods study will be conducted. A funded study by the Sigma Theta Tau, Upsilon Eta Chapter, August 2013, involving a convenience sample of 100 participants is planned. Included are community dwelling adults between 21 to 65 years old having been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses. Clients with current co-occurring substance abuse will be excluded. Participants complete questionnaires and undergo an interview. Correlations among the study variables will be examined. Regression analysis will determine if recovery can be predicted by strengths self-efficacy, resourcefulness and stigma experience. Interview data will be transcribed and analyzed by thematic analysis. This study will look beyond clients' disability to focus on their recovery and healing capacities such as strengths self-efficacy and resourcefulness. Findings will expand our knowledge about mental health recovery. Knowledge gained from this study may pave the way for future nursing strategies to aid recovery and inform the development of positive, strengths-based interventions."

            "abstract": "In patients with chronic disorders, control self-efficacy is the confidence with managing symptoms and coping with the demands of illness. Can do treatment (CDT) is an intensive, 3-day, social cognitive theory-based, multidisciplinary treatment that focuses on identification of stressors, goal setting, exploration of boundaries, and establishment of new boundaries. An uncontrolled study showed that patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and low-disability had improved control self-efficacy six months after CDT. Hence, in a 6-month, single-centre, randomized (1:1), unmasked, controlled trial in RRMS patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤4.0, we compared CDT with no intervention and the option to receive CDT after completion of study participation. Follow-up assessments were at one, three and six months. Primary endpoint was control self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale Control [MSSES-C] (minimum 90, maximum 900) at six months. Secondary endpoints were functional self-efficacy (MSSES-F), participation and autonomy (Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire [IPA]), health-related quality of life (MS Quality of Life-54 Items questionnaire [MSQoL-54]), anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) and coping skills (Utrecht Coping List [UCL]) at six months. Tertiary endpoint was care-related strain on support partners (Caregiver Strain Index) at six months. Of the 158 patients that were included, 79 were assigned to CDT and 79 to the control group. Two CDT patients discontinued treatment prematurely. Sixty-one (77%) control patients chose to receive CDT after study participation. Intention-to-treat ANCOVA analyses were performed with follow-up values as dependent, and condition, baseline values, disease duration and gender as independent variables. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) MSSES-C score in the CDT group vs. control group at baseline was 468 (162) vs. 477 (136), and at six months 578 (166) vs. 540 (135) (p = 0.100). Secondary and tertiary endpoints did not differ between groups, except for the UCL palliative reaction score being slightly higher in the CDT group (p = 0.039). On post hoc analyses the MSSES-C score at one and three months was higher in the CDT vs. control group: 597 (114) vs. 491 (131) (p<0.0001) and 561 (160) vs. 514 (143) (p = 0.018), respectively; and at one month the MSSES-F, IPA Limitations, HADS Anxiety and Depression, and MSQoL-54 Mental and Physical scores were also in favour of the CDT group. We conclude that in low-disability RRMS patients, the intensive 3-day social cognitive theory-based CDT did not improve control self-efficacy at six months follow-up compared to waitlist controls. The absence of a between-group difference at six months relates to a gradual improvement in the control group. In all, this social cognitive theory-based approach for improving self-efficacy needs further investigation before being broadly applied in RRMS patients."

            "abstract": "There is an implied assumption that addictions to different substances vary in strength from weak (easier to stop) to strong (harder to stop), though explicit definitions are lacking. Our hypothesis is that the strength of addictions can be measured by cessation rates found with placebo or no treatment controls, and that a weaker addiction would have a higher cessation rate than a stronger addiction. We report an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cessation trials, using randomised or quasi-randomised trials and reporting objectively-measured abstinence. The outcome for comparison was quit rates-typically the percentage of participants abstinent according to an objective test of abstinence at six months or longer. Twenty-eight cessation reviews (139,000 participants) were found. Most data came from reviews of smoking cessation in over 127,000 participants, and other reviews each covered a few thousand participants. Few reviews used data from studies shorter than three months, and almost all determined abstinence using objective measures. Cessation rates with placebo in randomised trials using objective measures of abstinence and typically over six months duration were 8% for nicotine, 18% for alcohol, 47% for cocaine, and 44% for opioids. Evidence from placebo cessation rates indicates that nicotine is more difficult to give up than alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Tobacco is also a severe addiction, with a number of major deleterious health effects in a large number of people."

The XeQoL correlated with the UWSF (τ = -0.24, P = .008), the ESSPRI (τ =0.45, P = .0001), VAS 1-2 and VAS 5-8 and the SF-36 score (τ = -0.28, P = .002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients with PSS had a poorer HRQoL and oral quality of life than controls. UWSF contributes to the oral quality of life which, in turn, has an impact on HRQoL. Symptomatic treatment of xerostomia as well as the prevention of infections, decay and tooth loss would help to improve the oral quality of life in these patients."

            "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of cigarette use and water pipe smoking in Jordanian university students and to analyze differences in determinants between cigarette smokers and non-smokers. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 400 students (18-24 years, 51% males). Smokers were compared with non-smokers on several smoking-related determinants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, χ 2 test and binary logistic regression analysis. The prevalence rates of cigarette use and water pipe smoking were 25.9% and 23.3%, respectively. Cigarette smokers differed significantly from non-smokers on almost all of the assessed determinants. The I-Change model explained 85% of the total variance of cigarette-smoking behavior. Cigarette smoking was determined by being male and older, having more depressive symptoms, having less Muslim identity, being more emancipated, perceiving more pros of smoking, having more modeling from peers and having lower self-efficacy. The popularity of cigarette use and water pipe smoking among Jordanian students necessitates health promotion interventions that motivate students not to engage in smoking behaviors by clearly outlining the outcomes of smoking and the healthier alternatives, how to cope with social influences and difficult situations in order to increase self-efficacy."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Public health strategies place increasing emphasis on opportunities to promote healthy behaviours within the workplace setting. Previous research has suggested worksite health promotion programmes have positive effects on physical activity and weight loss, yet little is known regarding their effects on dietary behaviour. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of worksite interventions on employee diets.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Electronic databases (MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LexisNexis) were searched for relevant articles published between 1995 and April 2009. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were peer-reviewed English language publications describing a worksite-based health promotion intervention with minimum study duration of eight weeks. All study designs were eligible. Studies had to report one or more diet-related outcome (energy, fat, fruit, or vegetable intakes). Methodological quality was assessed using a checklist that included randomisation methods, use of a control group, and study attrition rates.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen studies were included in the review. Eight programmes focussed on employee education, and the remainder targeted change to the worksite environment, either alone or in combination with education. Study methodological quality was moderate. In general, worksite interventions led to positive changes in fruit, vegetable and total fat intake. However, reliance on self-reported methods of dietary assessment means there is a significant risk of bias. No study measured more robust outcomes such as absenteeism, productivity, or healthcare utilisation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this review suggest that worksite health promotion programmes are associated with moderate improvement in dietary intake. The quality of studies to date has been frequently sub-optimal and further, well designed studies are needed in order to reliably determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Future programmes to improve employee dietary habits should move beyond individual education and aim to intervene at multiple levels of the worksite environment."

Nevertheless, exactly how and when to use evidence, theory, and community-based participation during planning represents a challenge. In this Perspective, we describe Intervention Mapping (IM), a framework for theory- and evidence-based health promotion program planning that addresses this challenge by providing a systematic and stepwise approach to planning interventions. IM has been used to develop health promotion interventions and implementation strategies in community and clinical settings globally, with over 1000 published articles employing the framework. In this Perspective, we also highlight recent and innovative applications of IM described in the articles of the Frontiers in Public Health Special Topic on IM. We conclude by discussing new directions in the application of IM including novel methods for identifying determinants of behavior and environmental conditions, the application of IM for planning implementation strategies, and IM for adaptation of evidence-based programs in new settings."

            "abstract": "Adolescents interact with their peers in multiple social settings and form various types of peer relationships that affect drinking behavior. Friendship and popularity perceptions constitute critical relationships during adolescence. These two relations are commonly measured by asking students to name their friends, and this network is used to construct drinking exposure and peer status variables. This study takes a multiplex network approach by examining the congruity between friendships and popularity as correlates of adolescent drinking. Using data on friendship and popularity nominations among high school adolescents in Los Angeles, California (N = 1707; five schools), we examined the associations between an adolescent's drinking and drinking by (a) their friends only; (b) multiplexed friendships, friends also perceived as popular; and (c) congruent, multiplexed-friends, close friends perceived as popular. Logistic regression results indicated that friend-only drinking, but not multiplexed-friend drinking, was significantly associated with self-drinking (AOR = 3.51, p < 0.05). However, congruent, multiplexed-friend drinking also was associated with self-drinking (AOR = 3.10, p < 0.05). This study provides insight into how adolescent health behavior is predicated on the multiplexed nature of peer relationships. The results have implications for the design of health promotion interventions for adolescent drinking."

To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT."

Our study assessed the impact of the Transcendental Meditation® (TM®) technique on self-efficacy, perceived stress, and mental and physical quality of life of these women. This single-blind controlled study involved 81 women who were assigned to either practice of the Transcendental Meditation program (n = 42) or wait-list (delayed start) control group (n = 39). Participants learned the Transcendental Meditation program over five sessions, then practiced at home for 20 minutes twice a day, and attended twice monthly group meetings over a 3-month period. The primary outcome measure was self-efficacy using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Perceived stress using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, and physical and mental quality of life using subscales of the Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS, HIV version) were secondary outcome measures. Significant improvements were shown in self-efficacy (p < .001), perceived stress (p < .010), and mental and physical well-being (p < .010). Compliance with TM home practice was >88%. This is the first controlled study to demonstrate the effect of TM in the daily lives of mothers living in impoverished conditions. Further questionnaires were administered to participants at 8 months and at 36 months with questions about changes they may have experienced in their daily life since starting TM. \"Yes,\" \"No\" self-reported answers suggested that the women experienced improved health, improved relationships with others, and increased employment rates. These findings taken as a whole have important implications for developing self-efficacy, improving mental and physical quality of life, and reducing stress in the lives of these vulnerable women."

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of MI in a population of homeless, unemployed, and substance dependent veterans who are being wait-listed for entry into a residential treatment program. Seventy-five veterans placed on a wait-list were randomized to receive a single MI or standard (Std) intake interview. Outcomes assessed were entry, and length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes assessed included program completion and rates of graduation. Readiness to change and self-efficacy were assessed before and after the interview. Significantly more participants entered the program in the MI group (95%) than in the Std group (71%). Although those in the MI group remained in the program longer, and had higher program completion and graduation rates, these differences were not statistically significant. No significant between-group or within-group differences were found in readiness or self-efficacy. This study demonstrates that a single, easily administered intervention can increase program entry. Also based on the study findings, further research into the question of whether MI can increase program retention, in a severely distressed population, is warranted."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is temporarily to replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aims of this review were:To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 132 trials; 111 with over 40,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50-70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT."

This study was a pilot to find out how to use mobile phone-based peer support to improve the psychosocial health of, and facilitate settlement in a group of nine Nuer refugee women in Melbourne, Australia. Nine participants recruited by a community leader received peer support training over two five-week periods. They were further provided with mobile phone recharge vouchers to call one another to practice peer support techniques. The fifth and final sessions were focus groups to evaluate the intervention. Notes from the focus groups were thematically analysed. The women reported greater confidence and empowerment as they received more support, had better connections within the group and better access to information. Relationships with friends, family and the community became richer as they adopted and experienced more functional communication patterns. Using mobile phones for peer support helped to re-create community by bridging the geographical distance that separates refugee women. It allowed the women, from similar backgrounds and with similar experiences, to provide mutual support and exchange information through a verbal channel, the form of communication they are most comfortable with. The program demonstrates the positive psychosocial effect of peer support in a refugee community, and provides a viable model for using mobile phones in health promotion interventions. The successful outcomes, as perceived by the participants, are indicative of the potential of using technology to bridge health inequities in a marginalised group."

More than half of adults are overweight or obese, with an 80% increase in women with BMIs > 40 (Grundy et al., 1999; Leermakers, Dunn, & Blair, 2000). Physical activity is a common strategy for weight loss, but activity levels in more than 60% of adults are not sufficient to provide appropriate health benefits (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2003). Women are usually less active than men (CDC, 2003; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2000). Many obese individuals engage in physical activity programs only to return to unhealthy behaviors. Walking is one of the most beneficial and easiest ways for obese women to increase their physical activity. This article reviews the literature on bone and joint benefits of walking for obese women.

Engaging informal support systems to promote healthy behaviors in everyday life may increase the effectiveness of health promotion interventions targeting this at-risk population. In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 fitness trainers serving adults with SMI in a health promotion program at community mental health centers to explore their perspectives on the potential of enlisting support from significant others for health behavior change. Trainers reported that the majority of participants had a relative or significant other who influenced their health behaviors, and they saw potential value in involving them in efforts to improve health outcomes by extending support into participants' daily lives. They did not feel qualified to work with families of individuals with mental illness, but they were willing to partner with providers who had experience in this area. Social workers who practice with families could play a critical role on health promotion teams addressing cardiovascular risk in adults with SMI by using their skills and experiences to engage families in supporting a relative through the process of health behavior change."

            "abstract": "Fatigue in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases can be caused by several conditions and anaemia is one of them. Anaemia can be caused by acute GI bleeding, or it can appear in relation to more chronic conditions: iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and/or anaemia of chronic disease (ACD). Acute anaemia due to acute upper GI bleedings (AUGIB) is often treated with blood transfusions and/or oral iron supplementations. The need for blood transfusions prior to endoscopic intervention has been well described in guidelines. However, guidelines for the monitoring and treatment of anaemia in patients after nonvariceal AUGIB are generally lacking. A retrospective study showed that more than 80% of patients were discharged from hospital with anaemia and less than 20% of them were recommended iron supplementations. Chronic anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is well known. Anaemia can be caused by deficiency conditions (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12); chronic bleeding; inflammation or medication (or a combination of these). Fatigue in IBD is found in 40% of IBD patients, even with disease in remission. The PhD dissertation is based on two studies. 1. A randomised placebo controlled trial where patients were allocated to iron supplementation (oral or intravenous) or placebo. Patients with nonvariceal AUGIB and anaemia were included in the study (N = 97). The primary follow-up time was 13 weeks, followed by additional three months follow-up. 2. A cross-sectional study including Scandinavian outpatients with IBD. Five hospitals in Denmark, Norway and Sweden included consecutively 5% of their cohort of patients with IBD (N = 429). The aims were: 1. To investigate the effect of iron supplementation in patients who had anaemia after endoscopic intervention for AUGIB. Furthermore, to investigate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and fatigue in these patients. 2. To determine the prevalence and type of anaemia, iron deficiency (ID) and fatigue in an unselected group of Scandinavian IBD outpatients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      1. Using haemoglobin (Hb) as a marker, the results of the intervention study on anaemic AUGIB patients showed that iron supplementations were superior to no treatment and intravenous iron was more effective to fill the patients iron stores than was oral iron. No differences in the Hb levels were found between the oral and intravenous iron groups after 13 weeks. Data on HRQoL and fatigue showed in general an improvement during the follow-up period. The improvement was not solely linked to treatment of anaemia. 2. The overall prevalence of anaemia in the Scandinavian population of IBD outpatients was 19%. Most patients had both IDA and ACD. The prevalence of ID was 35%. Fatigue was found in 44% of patients, and the physical dimensions of fatigue were the most marked. Anaemia and/or ID were not associated with increased fatigue.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      1. Treatment with iron supplementations of post-discharge anaemia after AUGIB had significant effect on Hb levels. Intravenous iron supplementation should be chosen if adherence to treatment is essential. The patients' HRQoL was not affected by anaemia. 2. Anaemia in IBD outpatients was present in one of five patients and only 20% had pure IDA. The remains had pure \"ACD\" or a combination between ACD and IDA. Fatigue was present in nearly half of the patients and was not associated with anaemia, but was related to gender and age. Physical fatigue was the most affected dimension of fatigue."

Women had obtained most of their information from television and radio. No AIDS health promotion programs had been targeted specifically to rural women. General knowledge regarding modes of transmission and prevention were good. The majority of women (85.5%) identified at least one known mode of transmission. Prostitution and contaminated needles were seen as the predominant sources of risk by these women. This knowledge, however, had not been applied to personal life circumstances in such a way that would facilitate avoidance of HIV infection. For example, few women considered themselves to be at risk for HIV infection even when they recognized that their husbands had engaged in risk-related behaviors (e.g., contracting for the services of commercial sex workers). Focus group discussions clarified the relationship between knowledge about HIV/AIDS, assessment of personal risk, use of condoms, and prevention strategies in general. Areas of misperception and confusion were identified, as well as potential vehicles for and content of AIDS health promotion initiatives.

African Americans living in the stroke belt are at an even higher risk for these conditions. Recently, increasing numbers of health agencies and researchers have successfully partnered with the black church to respond to the troubling statistics regarding these health disparities. Because the black church has a long history of being in the forefront of addressing critical social, economic, political, and health issues of African Americans, it is clear they are the principal gatekeepers in reversing these negative health trends. Working with churches to reduce cardiovascular disease is not a new concept. Hypertension screening programs were established at churches approximately 30 years ago. This article shares findings of elements to improve relations between community agencies and pastors, explores the strengths and challenges of working with churches, examines the role of the pastors in establishing successful programs, and identifies model programs. This article will identify key factors that are essential to cardiovascular health programs that purport to reach high-risk populations for cardiovascular disease with life saving environmental policies and behavior change strategies. Suggestions are provided for working with pastors, churches, and church resources to maximize the desired outcomes of future health promotion interventions. Examples of strategies include serving healthier choices during church meals; the inclusion of relevant scriptural citations in promotional materials; the implementation of instruction, training, and exercise programs; and, the provision of tangible compensation to the churches and congregants facilitating the health initiatives."

Evidence-informed tweets were developed, pilot tested and distributed to all followers of the Ministry of Health's Twitter account with the aim of influencing the agenda on road safety in Saudi Arabia. The dissemination pattern and influence of this health communication was assessed. We collected 70 tweets into two groups (29 intervention tweets and 41 additional supported tweets) extracted from the Tweetreach data set and then analysed them using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Using the concept of innovation/imitation as defined in the Bass Model, we classified retweeting by direct followers as innovation and retweeting by users who were not followers as imitation. In the study, we identify an informative indicator of successful diffusion and propose a novel procedure to measure innovation/imitation coefficients ( p and q). We also provided a statistical procedure for evaluating tweet adoption by innovators (influentials) and imitators. In addition, we also assessed the use of message design tools for new media messages. The resulting information can be used to improve public health and health promotion interventions at the levels of planning, design, implementation and evaluation."

The objectives were to determine whether higher dosage and longer duration of nicotine patch therapy would increase the success rate. Thirty-six chest clinics enrolled a total of 3,575 smokers. Subjects were allocated to one of five treatment arms: placebo and either standard or higher dose nicotine patches (15 mg and 25 mg daily) each given for 8 or 22 weeks with adjunctive moderately intensive support. The 12 month sustained success rates were: 25 mg patch for 22 weeks (L-25), 15.4%; 25 mg patch for 8 weeks (S-25), 15.9%; 15 mg patch for 22 weeks (L-15), 13.7%; 15 mg patch for 8 weeks (S-15), 11.7%; and placebo (P-0) 9.9% (placebo versus 15 mg, p<0.05; 25 mg versus 15 mg, p<0.03; 25 mg versus placebo, p<0.001, Chi-squared test). There was no significant difference in success rate between the two active treatment durations. Of the first week abstainers (n=1,698), 25.1% achieved success at 12 months as opposed to first week smokers, 2.7% of 1,877 subjects (p< 0.001). In summary, a higher than standard dose of nicotine patch was associated with an increase in the long-term success in smoking cessation but continuation of treatment beyond 8-12 weeks did not increase the success rates."

In 2 large well designed clinical trials, sustained release bupropion 300 mg/day (the recommended dose) for 7 or 9 weeks was associated with considerably and significantly higher smoking abstinence rates (continuous abstinence and 7-day point prevalence rates) than placebo during treatment and at follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Point prevalence rates at 12 months in 2 studies were 23.1 and 30.3% with bupropion, whereas values for placebo were 12.4 and 15.6%. Continuous abstinence rates at 12 months, available from 1 trial, were 18.4% with bupropion and 5.6% with placebo. Furthermore, bupropion was associated with significantly higher quitting rates than nicotine patch in a comparative study. Combination therapy with bupropion and nicotine patch provided slightly higher abstinence rates than bupropion alone, although differences were not statistically significant. The combination was superior to nicotine patch alone. Data from a preliminary report of long term bupropion treatment (52 weeks) showed that the drug was associated with significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months. However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion is an effective and well tolerated smoking cessation intervention. Further studies with long term follow-up will be useful in determining whether abstinence rates are maintained with bupropion. In addition, clarification of its efficacy in comparison with other therapies used for smoking cessation would help to establish its clinical value. The reduced potential for weight gain with bupropion and the ability to use bupropion in combination with nicotine replacement therapy make the drug a useful treatment option for smoking cessation."

However, the application of epidemiological risk knowledge to individuals within such communities is not straightforward and creates tensions for community health workers who are part of the communities that they are serving. Situated qualitative interview data were co-produced with community health workers employed in a superdiverse, deprived, post-industrial region of the United Kingdom, using photo-voice methods, to develop an account of how they made sense of the challenges of their work. The analysis draws on and develops theories of risk work and resilience work, which draw on practice theory. The key findings were that, first, being a critical insider enabled community health workers to make sense of the diverse constraints on health and lifestyles within their community. Second, they understood their own public health role as limited by operating within this context, so they articulated their occupational identity as focused on supporting clients to make small but sustainable changes to their own and their families' lifestyles. Third, the uncertainties of translating population based risk information to individual clients were (at least partially) resolved at an embodied level, with the community health workers identifying as accessible and trusted role models for the value of changed lifestyles. The article is important for policy and practice as it provides a critique of a rapidly evolving new mode of delivery of public health services, and insights on the development of this new public health workforce."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite well-known risk factors and predictive survival models, many patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) die while on the waiting list for lung transplant. We evaluated whether specific Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R) scales provide additional benefit to conventional tools in identifying referral timing and waitlist mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From January 2010 to January 2015, 152 patients (34% on the waitlist) were evaluated with the CFQ-R and standard protocol quarterly. Data were used to explore the prognostic association of health-related quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Physical Functioning domain (PFD) of the CFQ-R predicted mortality in advanced CF disease better than habitual parameters (p = 0.005). For patients with the same forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), a low score categorized patients with an increased risk of death. For patients with CF and FEV1 <30% predicted and a low Physical score, mortality rate was ~35% at 2 years. The best model for probability of inclusion on the waitlist was FEV1 % (p < 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.90, 0.97]) and Physical Functioning (p = 0.013, HR = 0.96; 95% CI [0.95, 0.99]). The best model for probability of death similarly included FEV1 % (p = 0.09, HR = 0.97; 95% CI [0.94, 1.00]) and CFQ-R Physical Functioning score (p = 0.005, HR = 0.97; 95% CI [0.95, 0.99]). The Health Perception score showed similar results. A low Health Perception score combined with a high resting heart rate showed a trend for mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The CFQ-R may be an additional tool for guiding decisions to place a patient with CF on the waiting list for lung transplantation. The CFQ-R Physical Functioning and Health Perception scales were more accurate than conventional tools in predicting death before transplant."

            "abstract": "Youth cigarette smoking is a major public health concern in Southeast Asia. A suspected determinant of youth smoking is perceived peer behavior. Previous research has suggested that the probability that a teenager will use substances increases when there is the perception that most peers engage in the substance use behavior. This study aimed to assess the perceptions of the prevalence of peer cigarette smoking in samples of high school students from three Southeast Asian countries and to examine the association of these perceptions to self-reported personal use of cigarettes. Perceptions of the prevalence of peer smoking were generally characterized by the perception that most students do not smoke. However, a significant percentage of students held the perception that most students were current smokers. Students who held this perception were at increased risk of being current smokers relative to those who believed most students were not current smokers. The results of this study imply that public health programs may benefit from health promotion interventions which focus on dispelling misconceptions that most youth smoke cigarettes."

This event provoked phobic anxiety for traveling through the undersea tunnel in a number of individuals in the area. A treatment program for tunnel phobia was designed to test whether such a phobia could be mitigated by procedures previously proven effective in the treatment of other phobias. The program was presented to 18 persons with a specific phobia for tunnels and included a general discussion on the construction of undersea tunnels, given by an engineer from the tunnel construction company, and on phobic anxiety. It further consisted of gradual exposure to the tunnel in situ. Treatment effects were strong. All patients were able to travel on their own by car through the tunnel after the treatment. Their somatic complaints and phobic thoughts related to the tunnel were substantially reduced, and their mastery of tunnel driving was convincingly increased compared with the wait-list reference group."

As programs designed to promote children's health and well-being are scarce, a new health-promotion program, All Children in Focus, has been developed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the program in promoting parental self-efficacy and child health and development, as well as to investigate possible moderators of these outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multicenter randomized waitlist-controlled trial was conducted. The trial included 621 parents with children aged 3-12 years. Parents were randomized to receive the intervention directly or to join a waitlist control group. Parents completed questionnaires at baseline, 2 weeks after the intervention, and 6 months post-baseline.

One variable was found to moderate both outcomes: parents' positive mental health. Furthermore, parents' educational level and number of children moderated parental self-efficacy, while the children's age moderated child health and development.

We employed a self-administered questionnaire, the adapted mobilisation scale-individual. As the first step, we investigated the multidimensional nature of the ICRE construct and explored the validity and reliability (internal consistency) of the ICRE scale. Two datasets were used. The first dataset comprised a cross-sectional random sample of 1,000 inhabitants of Rapla County selected in 2003 from the National Population Register, which was used to confirm the composition of the dimensions of the scale and to examine the reliability of the dimensions. The second dataset comprised two waves of data: 120 participants from three health promotion programs in 2003 (pre-test) and 115 participants in 2005 (post-test), and the dataset was used to compare participants' pre-test and post-test ratings of their levels of empowerment. The content validity ratio, determined using Lawshe's formula, was high (0.98). Five dimensions of ICRE, self-efficacy, intention, participation, motivation and critical awareness, emerged from the factor analysis. The internal consistency (α) of the total empowerment scale was 0.86 (subscales self-efficacy α=0.88, intention α=0.83, participation α=0.81 and motivation α=0.69; critical awareness comprised only one item). The levels of ICRE dimensions measured after the application of the empowerment expansion framework were significantly more favourable for the dimensions self-efficacy, participation, intention and motivation to participate. We conclude that for Rapla community workgroups and networks, their ICRE was rendered more favourable after the implementation of the empowerment expansion framework."

Peak torques of the knee extensor and knee flexor muscle groups were measured bilaterally in 95 individuals (mean age 59.4 years) using an isokinetic dynamometer. Isokinetic concentric contractions were performed at angular velocities of 1.05 and 3.14 rad x s(-1). Physical activity, including household, leisure, and sporting activities, was assessed. The results show that the average peak torques exhibited were lower than previously reported in studies using the same methodology with different populations of similar age and body size. Over one-third of the participants were sedentary, with just 13% being active enough to obtain health benefits. The poor muscle strength and low physical activity of this self selecting group of healthy working adults were surprising, and potentially a cause for concern. The combination of retirement being a potential watershed for a decrease in physical activity and the known age-related decline in physical performance indicates that some of these participants are at risk of losing their functional independence fairly early in the retirement stage. We recommend the introduction of effective health promotion interventions for individuals approaching retirement, encouraging them to become more physically active."

This paper provides a practice-oriented description of the initial 'community network' maintenance strategy of the FCP, the barriers that were encountered as this network strategy was implemented, the alternative 'capacity-building' strategy directed at local health educators and the successful implementation of this alternative. Also discussed are the community organization issues underlying the shift in intervention maintenance strategies and the specific components of the capacity-building strategy, including its focus on health educators, and its application of a training of trainers model and cooperative learning methods to provide professional development, technical assistance and other resources to a target group of community health educators. Our experience indicates that capacity-building is a viable method for intervention maintenance and that it may also facilitate efforts to disseminate model health promotion programs to communities lacking experience in community health promotion intervention."

In this review, we describe an overview of tobacco control interventions that have led to substantial declines in tobacco use and the relationship between these declines with CVH and CVD. We review interventions that have had success in high-income countries (HICs) as well as those that are gaining traction in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We emphasize the challenges to comprehensive tobacco prevention and control strategies faced by LMICs, and highlight the special role of cardiovascular health professionals in achieving CVH promotion and CVD prevention endpoints through tobacco control. Tobacco prevention and control strategies have a strong scientific basis, yet a distinct gap remains between this evidence and implementation of tobacco control policies, particularly in LMICs. Health professionals can contribute to tobacco control efforts, especially through patient-level clinical interventions, when supported by a health care system and government that recognize and support tobacco control as a critical strategy for CVH promotion and CVD prevention. Understanding, supporting, and applying current and evolving policies, programs, and practices in tobacco prevention and control is the province of all health professionals, especially those concerned with CVH promotion and CVD prevention.

This review replaces the original protocol for neuropathic pain that was withdrawn.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the analgesic effectiveness of TENS versus placebo (sham) TENS, TENS versus usual care, TENS versus no treatment and TENS in addition to usual care versus usual care alone in the management of neuropathic pain in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, PEDro, LILACS (up to September 2016) and various clinical trials registries. We also searched bibliographies of included studies for further relevant studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials where TENS was evaluated in the treatment of central or peripheral neuropathic pain. We included studies if they investigated the following: TENS versus placebo (sham) TENS, TENS versus usual care, TENS versus no treatment and TENS in addition to usual care versus usual care alone in the management of neuropathic pain in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently screened all database search results and identified papers requiring full-text assessment. Subsequently, two review authors independently applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to these studies. The same review authors then independently extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane standard tool and rated the quality of evidence using GRADE.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 15 studies with 724 participants. We found a range of treatment protocols in terms of duration of care, TENS application times and intensity of application. Briefly, duration of care ranged from four days through to three months. Similarly, we found variation of TENS application times; from 15 minutes up to hourly sessions applied four times daily. We typically found intensity of TENS set to comfortable perceptible tingling with very few studies titrating the dose to maintain this perception. Of the comparisons, we had planned to explore, we were only able to undertake a quantitative synthesis for TENS versus sham TENS. Insufficient data and large diversity in the control conditions prevented us from undertaking a quantitative synthesis for the remaining comparisons.For TENS compared to sham TENS, five studies were suitable for pooled analysis. We described the remainder of the studies in narrative form. Overall, we judged 11 studies at high risk of bias, and four at unclear risk. Due to the small number of eligible studies, the high levels of risk of bias across the studies and small sample sizes, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the pooled analysis and very low individual GRADE rating of outcomes from single studies. For the individual studies discussed in narrative form, the methodological limitations, quality of reporting and heterogeneous nature of interventions compared did not allow for reliable overall estimates of the effect of TENS.Five studies (across various neuropathic conditions) were suitable for pooled analysis of TENS versus sham TENS investigating change in pain intensity using a visual analogue scale. We found a mean postintervention difference in effect size favouring TENS of -1.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.08 to -1.09, P < 0.00001, n = 207, six comparisons from five studies) (very low quality evidence). There was no significant heterogeneity in this analysis. While this exceeded our prespecified minimally important difference for pain outcomes, we assessed the quality of evidence as very low meaning we have very little confidence in this effect estimate and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from that reported in this review. Only one study of these five investigated health related quality of life as an outcome meaning we were unable to report on this outcome in this comparison. Similarly, we were unable to report on global impression of change or changes in analgesic use in this pooled analysis.Ten small studies compared TENS to some form of usual care. However, there was great diversity in what constituted usual care, precluding pooling of data. Most of these studies found either no difference in pain outcomes between TENS versus other active treatments or favoured the comparator intervention (very low quality evidence). We were unable to report on other primary and secondary outcomes in these single trials (health-related quality of life, global impression of change and changes in analgesic use).Of the 15 included studies, three reported adverse events which were minor and limited to 'skin irritation' at or around the site of electrode placement (very low quality evidence). Three studies reported no adverse events while the remainder did not report any detail with regard adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this review, we reported on the comparison between TENS and sham TENS. The quality of the evidence was very low meaning we were unable to confidently state whether TENS is effective for pain control in people with neuropathic pain. The very low quality of evidence means we have very limited confidence in the effect estimate reported; the true effect is likely to be substantially different. We make recommendations with respect to future TENS study designs which may meaningfully reduce the uncertainty relating to the effectiveness of this treatment modality."

The second group received placebo patches; while the third group was treated with behavioral training alone. Treatment effects were measured by daily cigarette consumption. Nicotine-treated subjects reached significantly higher abstinence rates during and at the end of treatment than both placebo- and control-subjects: 69% in the nicotine condition, 51.2% and 44.4% under placebo and control conditions respectively. Effects are influenced by initial cigarette consumption, with the light smokers benefitting most from the nicotine patch.

Both aspects might be explored with information obtained from economic evaluations, illustrated in this study with data from a cost-effectiveness analysis of an elderly safety promotion programme implemented in Sweden. Previously, resource mobilization has been used as a process indicator for successful community participation. We propose that resource mobilization can be measured as the proportion of total intervention costs paid by collaborators. In the case presented here, local collaborators contributed 50 per cent of the total intervention costs (SEK 6.45 million, in Swedish krona 2004; 1 USD = 7.35 SEK), while participants, i.e. the elderly in the intervention area, contributed 13 per cent and the remainder, 37 per cent, was paid by project funds. In a subsector financial analysis, the distribution of costs and financial benefits from interventions among different sectors in society is described. The estimated financial benefits in the case were divided between the health-care system (SEK 2.5 million), the local authority (SEK 3.7 million) and the elderly and their relatives (SEK 0.3 million). The only net beneficiary was the local authority. In the case presented here, the health promotion objective of local community participation was achieved as half of the total costs was mobilized from local collaborators. The local community participation objective was supported by financial incentives for at least one key collaborator."

With the assistance of four local interviewers, we conducted 16 semi-structured focus groups to understand how existing social norms contributed to child marriage in participants' communities. We found great variety in the influence of social norms on people's health-related practices: across these four communities, social norms made compliance with the child marriage practice (respectively) possible, tolerated, appropriate, and obligatory. Effective health promotion interventions should be grounded within sound theoretical understandings of the varying influence of social norms.

They also reported acquiring new health information, that trying new activities was inspiring, and the use of pedometers and photo-food diaries helped them reflect on their health behaviours. The adolescents' experiences were also echoed by their teachers. Conclusions: To facilitate empowerment and stimulate learning, health-promotion interventions targeting adolescents could enable active learning activities in groups, by using visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allowing adolescents to influence intervention activities."

The reviewers matched the components of SM programmes into the relevant behaviour change technique domains according to the definitions of the behaviour change taxonomy (version 1). Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials assessing an SM programme for TMD. Manual searches were also conducted for potentially important journals. Eligibility criteria for the review included: the type of study, the participants, the intervention utilised and the comparators/control. Fifteen randomised controlled trials with 554 patients were included in this review. The review concludes a minority of the available behaviour change techniques are currently employed in SM programmes. Other behaviour change techniques should be examined to see whether there is a theoretical underpinning that might support their inclusion in self-management programmes in TMD. Further trials are required to conclude that SM programmes are more effective than no treatment at all and or placebo. With more structured SM programmes, greater therapeutic benefits might be achieved, and certainly if SM programmes published in the literature define their components through use of the behaviour change taxonomy, it would be easier for clinicians to replicate efficacious programmes."

The medication was gradually titrated up to 50 mg during the week before the quit date and then maintained at this dose for 12 weeks. For the first 4 weeks after the quit date, all participants received a nicotine patch to mitigate tobacco withdrawal and attended weekly individual cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation counseling sessions. After this time, participants continued with naltrexone or placebo through 12 weeks. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 26 and 52 weeks. During treatment, naltrexone (vs placebo) increased quit rates, attenuated smoking urge, and reduced weight gain. At follow-up, after medication discontinuation, the effect of naltrexone on improving quit rates was no longer evident. Men and women experienced different benefits from naltrexone; men showed greater reductions in smoking, whereas women showed greater reductions in weight gain. In sum, naltrexone showed acute efficacy in treating nicotine dependence, but after the medication was discontinued, the effect on quit rate was not maintained. Further study of naltrexone in smoking cessation treatment and reduction of cessation-related weight gain, as well as preclinical investigation of mechanisms underlying sex differences, is warranted."

Among participants with sustained abstinence, increased MVPA was associated with increased vigor (r=0.23, p=.025) and decreased perceived difficulty with staying smoke-free (r=-0.21, p=.038).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      PA promotion as an adjunct to tobacco treatment increases MVPA levels; changes in MVPA predict sustained abstinence, perhaps by improving mood and self-efficacy."

            "abstract": "Some studies have shown that female smokers and smokers with a history of depression have an increased risk of relapse following smoking cessation treatment. This study examined the efficacy of bupropion sustained-release (SR) and the nicotine patch for smoking cessation in subgroups of smokers at possible risk for relapse. Data for this study were from a previously published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 893 smokers were randomized to four treatment conditions: placebo tablet + placebo patch, placebo tablet + 21 mg/24-hr nicotine patch, 300mg bupropion SR + placebo patch, and 300mg bupropion SR + 21 mg/24-hr nicotine patch. Study medication continued for 8 weeks after the quit day; brief individual cessation counseling was provided during weekly clinic visits. In comparison to the placebo tablet, bupropion SR approximately tripled 1-year non-smoking rates among women and previously depressed individuals. In contrast, the nicotine patch did not significantly improve cessation rates for any group. We conclude that bupropion SR is a first-line treatment for smoking that has the potential to benefit all smokers, especially women and the previously depressed."

            "abstract": "The wide-spread dissemination of evidence-based programs that can improve health outcomes among older populations often requires an understanding of factors influencing community adoption of such programs. One such program is Texercise Select, a community-based health promotion program previously shown to improve functional health, physical activity, nutritional habits and quality of the life among older adults. This paper assesses the cost-effectiveness of Texercise Select in the context of supportive environments to facilitate its delivery and statewide sustainability. Participants were surveyed using self-reported instruments distributed at program baseline and conclusion. Program costs were based on actual direct costs of program implementation and included costs of recruitment and outreach, personnel costs and participant incentives. Program effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, as well as health outcomes, such as healthy days, weekly physical activity and Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test scores. Preference-based EuroQol (EQ-5D) scores were estimated from the number of healthy days reported by participants and converted into QALYs. There was a significant increase in the number of healthy days (p < 0.05) over the 12-week program. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $1374 to $1452 per QALY gained. The reported cost-effective ratios are well within the common cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 for a gained QALY. Some sociodemographic differences were also observed in program impact and cost. Non-Hispanic whites experienced significant improvements in healthy days from baseline to the follow-up period and had higher cost-effectiveness ratios. Results indicate that the Texercise Select program is a cost-effective strategy for increasing physical activity and improving healthy dietary practices among older adults as compared to similar health promotion interventions. In line with the significant improvement in healthy days, physical activity and nutrition-related outcomes among participants, this study supports the use of Texercise Select as an intervention with substantial health and cost benefits."

Although the efficacy of church-based health programs have been established, it is unknown which aspects of church-based health promotion drive health behavior change. Process evaluation is a way to increase our understanding of key components of church-based health promotion and to move the field forward. Thus, a systematic review of the utilization of process evaluation in church-based health programs was conducted. Articles from 1990 to 2008 were screened for eligibility, resulting in the analysis of 67 articles. The majority of church-based health programs assessed recruitment (88.1%) and reach (80.6%). About 28.4% assessed dose delivered, and 27.3% measured dose received. Context and fidelity was assessed by 34.3% and 20.9%, respectively, of church-based interventions. Approximately 9% of church-based programs measured fidelity. On average, only three of seven possible components of process evaluation were measured among the studies reviewed. The number of process evaluation components assessed did not differ by program feature (e.g., target population, target health condition, program objective, etc.). Consistency in the conceptualization and measurement of process evaluation may facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive process evaluation effort in church-based and other health promotion interventions."

To facilitate the assessment of computer technology attitudes, one aim of the longitudinal study reported in this paper was to test and refine a new 22-item measure of computer technology attitudes designed specifically for older adults, as none such were available. Another aim was to replicate, on a much larger scale, the successful findings of a preliminary study that tested a computer technology training programme for older adults (Laganà 2008). Ninety-six older men and women, mainly from non-European-American backgrounds, were randomly assigned to the waitlist/control or the experimental group. The same six-week one-on-one training was administered to the control subjects at the completion of their post-test. The revised (17-item) version of the Older Adults' Computer Technology Attitudes Scale (OACTAS) showed strong reliability: the results of a factor analysis were robust, and two analyses of covariance demonstrated that the training programme induced significant changes in attitudes and self-efficacy. Such results encourage the recruitment of older persons into training programmes aimed at increasing computer technology attitudes and self-efficacy."

Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of variations in base-case assumptions regarding the monetary benefits that would accrue if an intervention were successful, probabilities of quitting, drug costs, cost of lost work time for a health care provider visit, and cost of the visit itself.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The analysis showed that bupropion is more cost-beneficial than either NTP or bupropion/NTP, with a net benefit in the first post-quit year of up to $338 per employee who attempts to quit compared with $26 for NTP, $178 for the two in combination, and $258 for placebo. These results were robust to most plausible variations in the assumptions used in the model. One exception was the monetary benefit of successful intervention (assumed in the base-case to be $1,654).

            "abstract": "Health promotion interventions with marginalised groups are increasingly expected to demonstrate genuine community participation in their design and delivery. However, ideals of egalitarian democratic participation are far removed from the starting point of the hierarchical and exploitative social relations that typically characterise marginalised communities. What scope is there for health promotion projects to implement ideals of community leadership within the realities of marginalisation and inequality? We examine how the Sonagachi Project, a successful sex-worker-led HIV prevention project in India, has engaged with the unequal social relations in which it is embedded. Our ethnographic study is based on observation of the Project's participatory activities and 39 interviews with a range of its stakeholders (including sex worker employees of the Project, non-sex-worker development professionals, brothel managers, sex workers' clients). The analysis shows that the project is deeply shaped by its relationships with non-sex-worker interest groups. In order to be permitted access to the red light district, it has had to accommodate the interests of local men's clubs and brothel managers. The economic and organisational capacity to run such a project has depended upon the direct input of development professionals and funding agencies. Thus, the 'community' that leads this project is much wider than a local grouping of marginalised sex workers. We argue that, given existing power relations, the engagement with other interest groups was necessary to the project's success. Moreover, as the project has developed, sex workers' interests and leadership have gained increasing prominence. We suggest that existing optimistic expectations of participation inhibit acknowledgement of the troubling work of balancing power relations. Rather than denying such power relations, projects should be expected to plan for them."

This article presents findings from a multi-phase study looking at 'what works' in mental health promotion for men. Work here reports the collection and analysis of the tacit knowledge of those working within mental health promotion interventions for men. A 'multiple hub and spoke' approach was used to assist data collection. Thirteen key players, active in the men's mental health field, half from the UK and half beyond, formed an Investigative Network collecting data, mainly through interviews, from wider geographical and professional community contexts where they had networks. The focus of data collection was on 'what works' in mental health promotion for men. Data was analysed using thematic analysis techniques. Findings suggest that settings which created safe male spaces acted to promote trust, reduce stigma and normalize men's engagement in interventions. Embedding interventions within the communities of men being engaged, fully involving these men, and holding 'male-positive' values engendered familiarity and consolidated trust. Using 'male-sensitive' language and activity-based approaches allowed for positive expressions of emotions, facilitated social engagement, and provided a base for open communication. Appropriate partnerships were also seen as a necessary requirement for success and as crucial for maximizing intervention impact. The importance of gender and 'masculinity' was apparent throughout these findings and taking time to understand gender could facilitate positive ways of working alongside men, increasing levels of engagement and successful outcomes."

Psychological resilience is thought to play an important role in promoting healthy aging and thus may be important in the context of aging with MS. This study aimed to evaluate whether Everyday Matters, a novel positive psychology program, had a positive effect on resilience and other related outcomes in adults with MS relative to a wait-list control group. Research Method/Design: This was a single-center two-group pilot randomized (1:1) controlled trial comparing the Everyday Matters intervention to a waitlist control. Randomized participants were N = 31 adults with MS aged ≥ 45 years. The 6-week program, developed by the National MS Society, was delivered via group teleconference and supplemented with readings, videos, and online participation.

A total of 690 physicians and nurses who had smoked an average of 10 cigarettes/day over the previous year and were motivated to quit smoking, were randomised in a double-blind manner to receive bupropion SR (days 1-3, 150 mg/day; days 4-49, 150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 weeks, with follow-up to week 52. All subjects received regular follow-up and brief motivational support throughout the study. Questions regarding their smoking cessation advice formed part of the study, with the aim of determining whether study participants became more proactive with their smoking cessation advice. A positive shift from baseline to end of study was observed with respect to the advice and support they gave to their smoking patients. These changes were not related to study treatment or current smoking status. An increase in advising patients to quit smoking and in offering cessation counselling was observed. Participation in a smoking-cessation study by physicians and nurses who smoke has a positive effect, regardless of study medication, in smoking cessation advice and counselling given to their patients."

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of smoking cessation with nicotine replacement in a lung clinic in a low resource set-up suitable for implementation in other lung clinics. This was an open, randomized trial with 4 different nicotine replacement regimes combined with minimal behavioural support in daily routine. A total of 446 smokers (>9 cigarettes x day(-1)) were allocated to a nurse-conducted smoking cessation programme with 4 treatment arms: a 5-mg nicotine patch (\"placebo\"), a 15-mg nicotine patch, nicotine inhaler, and a 15-mg nicotine patch plus nicotine inhaler. Recommended use of the nicotine products were 3 months with the possibility of continuing use up to 9 months on an individual basis. Individual follow-up studies were scheduled after 2 and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The 12-month point prevalence was 6% (5-mg patch (placebo)), 16% (15-mg patch) (p<0.05), 9% (inhaler) and 11% (15-mg patch plus inhaler), respectively. To conclude, the set-up investigated in this study which included minimal behavioural support with nicotine patches should be evaluated in other lung clinics, as it doubled success rate when compared to a placebo with a 1-yr point prevalence of 16% and also the resources used are limited."

Research indicates that older immigrants face the double burden of frailty, caused by a weaker health status, and the immigration process. Health promotion interventions can be used to prevent frailty and support healthy ageing in this population. Healthcare professionals are a crucial part of health promotion and the present study aimed to explore healthcare professionals' experiences of health in context of daily life among older immigrants to and provide a basis for the development of a health promotion intervention targeted at older immigrants. Four focus group discussions were conducted with professionals who worked with home-dwelling older people from Finland, currently living in Sweden. Participants represented a variety of healthcare professions. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The healthcare professionals perceived that health in daily life was (i) connected to the view of oneself as a capable person and (ii) participants strove to maintain their own origin. The findings highlighted that when planning for health promotion interventions for older immigrants, the point of departure should be to recognise the person as a person and the background of immigration is not the first issue to address. Therefore, a person-centred health promotion intervention is recommended to open a dialogue between healthcare professionals and older immigrants, so that a common view of the intervention can be reached."

The use of this psychoactive substance can have acute health implications such as tachycardia, arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease. Given the tension between health risk and ephedrine-induced weight loss, how men justify their use of ephedrine becomes an important question. In particular, we wished to analyse how male users talked to others about ephedrine in discussions linked to an online version of a popular men's magazine. Because we were particularly interested in how men accounted for their ephedrine use, we used discourse analysis to examine their posts. In analysing the data, we noted that a 'community of practice' was constructed online categorising legitimate (and barred) users, emphasising the benefits of ephedrine and downplaying health-defeating side effects. Our analysis has clear implications for engaging men who use ephedrine in health promotion interventions."

The aim of this systematic review is to provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions for youth aged 12-25 years. Searching a range of electronic databases, 28 studies conducted since 2000 were identified. Eight studies evaluating six mental health promotion interventions and 20 studies evaluating 15 prevention interventions were reviewed. The results from the mental health promotion interventions indicate that there is some evidence that skills-based interventions presented in a module-based format can have a significant impact on adolescent mental health, however, an insufficient number of studies limits this finding. The results from the online prevention interventions indicate the significant positive effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on adolescents' and emerging adults' anxiety and depression symptoms. The rates of non-completion were moderate to high across a number of studies. Implementation findings provide some evidence that participant face-to-face and/or web-based support was an important feature in terms of program completion and outcomes. Additional research examining factors affecting exposure, adherence and outcomes is required. The quality of evidence across the studies varied significantly, thus highlighting the need for more rigorous, higher quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of youth.

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the effects of treatment with varenicline, a partial agonist at the α4β2 and full agonist at the α7 nicotine acetylcholine receptor, on cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia. In all, 120 clinically stable people with schizophrenia participated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week trial. Antipsychotic and concomitant medication doses remained fixed throughout the study. Varenicline was titrated up to 1 mg twice daily for weeks 2-8. Neuropsychological, clinical, and safety assessments were administered at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. In the primary analyses of neurocognitive differences at week 8, no varenicline-placebo differences were significant. In secondary longitudinal analyses, varenicline improved compared with placebo on the Digital Symbol Substitution Test (p=0.013) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test non-perseverative errors (p=0.043). Some treatment effects were different between smokers and non-smokers. In smokers, Continuous Performance Test hit reaction time (p=0.008) and Stroop Interference (p=0.004) were reduced for varenicline compared with placebo, while there were no treatment differences in non-smokers. No significant treatment main effects or interactions were noted for total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale or the Scale for the Assessment for Negative Symptoms. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of adjunctive varenicline treatment with antipsychotics for some cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia. In some cases, effects of treatment varied between smokers and non-smokers. Further study is required to assess the functional significance of these changes."

The rapidity with which nicotine is absorbed when given as a nasal spray suggests that it might be effective for those for whom the other means of replacement are too slow. The efficacy and safety of a nasal nicotine spray as an adjunct to group treatment for stopping smoking were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 227 cigarette smokers attending the Maudsley Hospital Smokers Clinic received 4 weeks of supportive group treatment plus active nicotine (0.5 mg per shot) or placebo nasal spray. The main end-point was biochemically validated complete abstinence from smoking from the third week of group treatment until the 12-month follow-up. Side-effects were assessed by self-reports and, where necessary, by physical examination. Of subjects assigned to active treatment 26% (n = 30) were validated abstinent throughout the year, compared with 10% (n = 11) of those assigned to placebo (relative abstinence rate 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.5, p less than 0.001). The advantage of the active spray was greatest in the heaviest smokers. Plasma nicotine concentrations from the spray were typically between one-half and three-quarters of baseline smoking levels. Tobacco-withdrawal symptoms, craving for cigarettes, and weight gain in abstinent subjects were reduced by the active spray. Minor irritant side-effects were frequent in both active and placebo sprays, but only 2 subjects had the spray discontinued as a result. No serious adverse effects were encountered. Nasal nicotine spray combined with supportive group treatment is an effective aid to smoking cessation."

The overall aims are to contribute first, to the theoretical frameworks for the planning and analysis of food and health interventions at worksites and second, to a foodscape approach to worksite food interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The article is based on a case study of the design of a canteen takeaway (CTA) scheme for employees at two Danish hospitals. This was carried out as part of a project to investigate the shaping and impact of schemes that offer employees meals to buy, to take home or to eat at the worksite during irregular working hours. Data collection was carried out through semi-structured interviews with stakeholders within the two change processes. Two focus group interviews were also carried out at one hospital and results from a user survey carried out by other researchers at the other hospital were included. Theoretically, the study was based on the social constitution approach to change processes at worksites and a co-evolution approach to problem-solution complexes as part of change processes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both interventions were initiated because of the need to improve the food supply for the evening shift and the work-life balance. The shaping of the schemes at the two hospitals became rather different change processes due to the local organizational processes shaped by previously developed norms and values. At one hospital the change process challenged norms and values about food culture and challenged ideas in the canteen kitchen about working hours. At the other hospital, the change was more of a learning process that aimed at finding the best way to offer a CTA scheme.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Worksite health promotion practitioners should be aware that the intervention itself is an object of negotiation between different stakeholders at a worksite based on existing norms and values. The social contextual model and the setting approach to worksite health interventions lack reflections about how such norms and values might influence the shaping of the intervention. It is recommended that future planning and analyses of worksite health promotion interventions apply a combination of the social constitution approach to worksites and an integrated food supply and demand perspective based on analyses of the co-evolution of problem-solution complexes."

A total of 253 Flemish sports clubs, consisting of 156 YSC and of 97 ASC, completed the online questionnaire, covering club characteristics (e.g. finances, human resources), perceived motives and barriers for health promotion and the health promoting sports club index. Even though YSC were more health promoting than ASC, the results indicated that all sports clubs could improve their health promotion orientation. The most consistent predictors of health promotion orientation are perceived motives index for YSC and perceived lack of resources for ASC. Based on these results, interventions to enhance the health promoting orientation need to tackle the lack of resources such as lack of expertise regarding health promotion. Interventions aimed specifically at YSC should emphasize the direct benefits, for example by demonstrating how health promotion helps clubs to improve the provision of high quality sports participation and by awarding a health promotion quality label."

Health promotion, as a field, has paid only limited attention to gender inequity to date, but could be an active agent of change if gender equity became an explicit goal of health promotion research, policy and programmes. As an aspect of gendered health systems, health promotion interventions may maintain, exacerbate or reduce gender-related health inequities, depending upon the degree and quality of gender-responsiveness within the programme or policy. This article introduces a framework for gender-transformative health promotion that builds on understanding gender as a determinant of health and outlines a continuum of actions to address gender and health. Gender-transformative health promotion interventions could play a significant role in improving the lives of millions of girls and women worldwide. Gender-related principles of action are identified that extend the core principles of health promotion but reflect the significance of attending to gender in the development and use of evidence, engagement of stakeholders and selection of interventions. We illustrate the framework with examples from a range of women's health promotion activities, including cardiovascular disease prevention, tobacco control, and alcohol use. The literature suggests that gender-responsiveness will enhance the acceptance, relevance and effectiveness of health promotion interventions. By moving beyond responsiveness to transformation, gender-transformative health promotion could enhance both health and social outcomes for large numbers of women and men, girls and boys."

Considering the daunting and, at best, slow process of changing the same risk factors through health promotion interventions on food policy, dietary and physical activity behaviors, and urban planning to make less prevalent the sedentary lifestyles developed over decades, the argument here is to view the Polypill as a harm reduction strategy that would complement health promotion, as Nicotine Replacement Therapy did for tobacco control, seat belts did for traffic injuries, and needle exchange programs did for secondary complications of injection drug use."

            "abstract": "Positive changes in one health behavior may be accompanied by other constructive health behavior changes. Thus, the authors investigated the association of smoking reduction and cessation to changes in fruit and vegetable (FV) intake and engaging in walking for exercise. This study included 539 Black light smokers (≤10 cigarettes per day ≥25 days/month) enrolled in a 2 × 2 factorial study (placebo vs. nicotine gum, health education vs. motivational interviewing). Reducing cigarette consumption (p = .02) and quitting smoking (p < .01), as well as receiving the nicotine gum (p = .04), was associated with increased FV intake, after controlling for baseline FV intake. Compared with those who did not reduce their smoking, both reducers (p < .001) and quitters (p < .001) were more likely to walk for exercise at follow-up, after controlling for baseline walking status (p = .01). Thus, addressing one health risk behavior may prompt other positive health behaviors, which may argue for developing interventions targeting multiple health risk behaviors."

Although natural spaces are coming to be recognised as health-promoting settings for general populations, little is understood about the use of nature-contact in treatment and care for individuals experiencing ill-health.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This paper provides a summary of key research findings and presents a case study examining the self-reported health and well-being benefits of nature contact for a small clinical sample. The 'Spectrum of Interventions for Mental Health Problems and Mental Disorders' provides a conceptual framework for ordering current and future information relating to nature-based interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Evidence demonstrates that separately, physical activity, social connection, and contact with nature enhance human health and well-being. The case example illustrates how 'active', 'social' and 'adventurous' contact with nature may be combined within a treatment intervention to protect and enhance the health of individuals experiencing chronic mental, emotional and physical health difficulties.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      'Contact with nature' constitutes a health promotion strategy with potential application in prevention, early intervention, treatment and care.

Some physicians use suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) therapy to achieve a reduction in the number and volume of TN. In addition, minimally invasive treatments, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) sclerotherapy, laser photocoagulation (LP), and microwave (MW), radiofrequency (RF) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, have been proposed, especially for pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints, as an alternative to surgery. However, the risk to benefit ratio of all treatments for benign TN is currently unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of LT4 or minimally invasive therapies (PEI, LP, and RF/HIFU/MW ablation) on benign TN.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We identified studies from computerised searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS (all performed up to April 2014). We also searched trial registers, examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted study authors.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included studies if they were RCTs of LT4, PEI, LP, RF, HIFU or MW therapy in participants with an established diagnosis of benign TN. We excluded trials investigating the prevention of recurrence of thyroid disease after surgery, irradiation or treatment with radioiodine.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-one studies randomised 2952 outpatients to investigate the effects of different therapies on benign TN. Studies on LT4, PEI, LP and RF ablation therapy randomised 2083, 607, 192 and 70 participants, respectively. We found no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy in benign TN. The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4 and one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions. Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies. Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials.No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life. Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, reporting no abnormal cytological findings. One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.LT4 compared with no treatment or placebo was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 16% compared with 10% of participants after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.38); P = 0.03; 958 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies. LT4 therapy was generally well tolerated: three studies provided quantitative data on signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which were observed in 25% of LT4-treated versus 7% of placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (269 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).PEI compared with cyst aspiration only was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 83% compared with 44% of participants after 1 to 24 months of follow-up (RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.54); P = 0.0003; 105 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Improvements in neck compression symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up were seen in 78% of participants receiving PEI versus 38% of those in comparator groups. No reliable summary effect estimate could be established, RR ranged from 1.0 to 3.06 in favour of PEI (370 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). In all trials, participants experienced periprocedural cervical tenderness and light-to-moderate pain usually lasting from minutes to several hours. As a result of the PEI procedure, 26% of participants reported slight-to-moderate pain compared with 12% of those receiving cyst aspiration only (RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12); P = 0.28; 104 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).One study comparing LP with LT4 showed a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of LP after 12 months of follow-up in 33% of LP participants versus 0% of LT4 participants, respectively (62 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence). A total of 82% of LP-treated versus 0% of untreated participants showed improvements in pressure symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up (RR 26.65 (95% CI 5.47 to 129.72); P < 0.0001; 92 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Around 20% of LP-treated participants reported light-to-moderate cervical pain lasting 48 hours or more (97 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).One trial with 40 participants, comparing RF with no treatment, resulted in a mean nodule volume reduction of 76% in the RF group compared with 0% of those in the no-treatment group at six months of follow-up (low-quality evidence). These RF-treated participants had fewer pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints after 12 months of follow-up compared with untreated participants (a 2.8 decrease versus a 1.1 increase on a six-point scale, respectively, with higher values indicating more severe symptoms; low-quality evidence). All participants complained of pain and discomfort during RF, which disappeared when the energy was reduced or turned off (low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      No study evaluated all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life or provided systematic data on the development of thyroid cancer. Longest follow-up was five years and median follow-up was 12 months. Nodule volume reductions were achieved by PEI, LP and RF, and to a lesser extent, by LT4. However, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure is doubtful. PEI, LP and RF led to improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Adverse events such as light-to-moderate periprocedural pain were seen after PEI, LP and RF. Future studies should focus on patient-important outcome measures, especially health-related quality of life, and compare minimally invasive procedures with surgery. RCTs with follow-up periods of several years and good-quality observational studies are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, all-cause mortality and long-term adverse events."

The agreed contents between both parties to be used in the HPI will be posted on three social media channels (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) along 24 months. The 3 months before starting the HPI, and the 3 months after the HPI will be used as control data. The effect of the HPI will be assessed by comparing formats, frequency, and reactions to the published HPI messages, as well as comparing potential changes in five support-intended communication behaviours expressed on social media, and variations in sentiment analysis before vs during and after the HPI.

Qualitative and quantitative process data were collected using surveys, field notes, and open-item questionnaires, which assessed program fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, reach, recruitment, and context. Triangulation of methods was also employed to better understand how the program was implemented and received by the facilitator, staff members, and children in the program. Results indicated that program implementation had an almost perfect rate of fidelity with most lessons recording 100% tasks completed. Lessons were implemented in their intended order and lasted approximately 30 minutes as planned. After-school staff members reported that the program was well received by children, and this program should be replicated in the future. Attendance records showed that a majority of the children attended each lesson on the initial day of delivery (70.4%) and informal make-up lessons were implemented to compensate for the other children. Finally, several known sources of contamination were found such as past and concurrent exposure to similar health promotion interventions, which could potentially influence study outcomes.

This paper focuses on the sustainment of health promotion interventions in community mental health organisations, where the institutional context has been found to play an important role. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was used to characterise the extent of sustainment of health promotion interventions and to identify important factors that influence it. The study builds on a previously reported qualitative multiple case design focusing on four Danish community mental health organisations. We aimed to include cases (provider organisations) with varied political-administrative contexts that were expected to impact sustainment. Data included 27 semistructured interviews with managers and frontline staff. The analysis adopted a thematic approach combining within-case and cross-case analysis. One important factor contributing to sustainment was the high degree of coherence generated during and after implementation. Perceptions of meaningfulness and formal tools for external accountability such as municipal activity plans also stimulated the cognitive participation of management and staff in sustaining the intervention. On the practical level of collective action, working with health promotion in a continuous way was particularly supported by two formal tools: internal health policies and municipal activity plans. Sustainment was further aided by reflexive monitoring based on ongoing informal assessments, supplemented by information required for status reports to the municipality on individual users and information from the annual individual user health checks. Future studies should adapt NPT to a broader range of cases to assess more thoroughly its contribution to the literature on sustainment. Future interventions need to pay closer attention to securing continuous and active local management support as well as to political-administrative contexts as potential external drivers of sustainment."

            "abstract": "Effective health promotion interventions are critical to addressing the health needs of Indigenous people. We reviewed published and unpublished evaluation reports between 2000 and 2005 to identify practice issues pertinent to evaluators of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health promotion initiatives. While the review of the literature was not systematic it was sufficiently comprehensive to provide a snapshot of evaluation practice currently in place within the Australian context. We found that published evaluation literature infrequently referred to the utilisation of guidelines for ethical research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The implications of this are that the importance and relevance of the guidelines for evaluative research are not being widely promoted or disseminated to evaluation practitioners and the role of the guidelines for improving evaluation practice remain unclear. While many innovative health promotion programs appear to have been highly regarded and well received by communities, the evaluation studies were not always able to report conclusively on the impact and health outcomes of these interventions or programs. This was due mainly to limitations in evaluation design that in some cases were insufficiently robust to measure the complex and multifaceted interventions described. To enhance rigour, evaluators of community health promotion initiatives could utilise mixed method approaches overtly informed by appropriate ethical guidelines, together with a broader range of qualitative methods aided by critical appraisal tools to assist in the design of evaluation studies."

In this project, the influence of a popular community-based parent-child program was assessed in a non-clinical sample of families. Families participating in a 10-week Parent-Child Mother Goose Program (n.d.) and families on the waitlist for the program were asked to complete questionnaires to assess parenting efficacy and satisfaction as well as parents' perception of their own and their child's attachment styles at the beginning of the program, the end of the program, and six months later. Mothers in the program group reported significantly more positive change in their reports of parenting efficacy over time and also reported significantly more change in their children's attachment category. Specifically, children in the program group were significantly more likely to be classified as secure over time (55% at T1 to 81% at T3) as compared to the waitlist participants (45% at T1 to 62% at T2). In this popular 10-week, community-based program, parents learned skills that continued to influence their relationship with their children six months after the conclusion of the program."

            "abstract": "Health promotion aspires to work in empowering, participatory ways, with the goal of supporting people to increase control over their health. However, buried in this goal is an ethical tension: while increasing people's autonomy, health promotion also imposes a particular, health promotion-sanctioned version of what is good. This tension positions practitioners precariously, where the ethos of empowerment risks increasing health promotion's paternalistic control over people, rather than people's control over their own health. Herein we argue that this ethical tension is amplified in Indigenous Australia, where colonial processes of control over Indigenous lands, lives and cultures are indistinguishable from contemporary health promotion 'interventions'. Moreover, the potential stigmatisation produced in any paternalistic acts 'done for their own good' cannot be assumed to have evaporated within the self-proclaimed 'empowering' narratives of health promotion. This issue's guest editor's call for health promotion to engage 'with politics and with philosophical ideas about the state and the citizen' is particularly relevant in an Indigenous Australian context. Indigenous Australians continue to experience health promotion as a moral project of control through intervention, which contradicts health promotion's central goal of empowerment. Therefore, Indigenous health promotion is an invaluable site for discussion and analysis of health promotion's broader ethical tensions. Given the persistent and alarming Indigenous health inequalities, this paper calls for systematic ethical reflection in order to redress health promotion's general failure to reduce health inequalities experienced by Indigenous Australians."

            "abstract": "Barriers encountered in implementing a physical activity intervention in primary health care settings, and ways to address them, are described in this paper. A randomized comparison trial was designed to examine the impact of health care providers' written prescriptions for physical activity, with or without additional physical activity resources, to adult, nonpregnant patients on preventive care or chronic disease monitoring visits. Following abysmal recruitment outcomes, the research protocol was altered to make it more appealing to all the participants, i.e., health care providers, office personnel, and patients. Various barriers--financial, motivational, and executive--to the implementation of health promotion interventions in primary health care settings were experienced and identified. These barriers have been classified by the different participants in the research process, viz., healthcare providers, administrative personnel, researchers, and patients. Some of the barriers identified were lack of time and reimbursement for health promotion activities, and inadequate practice capacity, for health care providers; increased time and labor demands for administrative personnel; constrained access to participants, and limited funding, for researchers; and superseding commitments, and inaccurate comprehension of the research protocol, for patients. Solutions suggested to overcome these barriers include financial support, e.g., funding for researchers, remuneration for health care organization personnel, reimbursement for providers, payment for participants, and free or subsidized postage, and use of health facilities; motivational strategies such as inspirational leadership, and contests within health care organizations; and partnerships, with other expert technical and creative entities, to improve the quality, efficiency, and acceptability of health promotion interventions."

Studies of racial/ethnic and cultural variation in obesity causal beliefs, however, are scarce. To address this gap, this study described beliefs about the underlying causes of obesity (genetic inheritance, diet, and physical activity) in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women participating in a longitudinal cohort study in South King County, Washington State (n = 1,002).Design: Analysis of baseline survey data. Self-reported obesity causal beliefs were compared by race/ethnicity and acculturation indicators (survey language and nativity) using marginal effect estimates generated from multinomial logistic regression models.Results: Hispanic women had a higher probability of not believing 'at all' in inheritance and physical activity as causes of obesity - an absolute increase of 33% and 5% over non-Hispanic White women, respectively. Both acculturation indicators were also associated with a higher probability of not believing 'at all' in inheritance as a cause of obesity, though Hispanic women who completed the survey in English and were born in the United States had genetic causal beliefs similar to non-Hispanic White women. Behavioral attributions did not vary by acculturation indicators in Hispanic women.Conclusions: Differences in obesity casual beliefs, particularly genetic attributions, exist and may be important for developing and delivering effective obesity-related health promotion interventions. Identifying the determinants and public health consequences of cultural variation in obesity attributions should be the focus of future research."

Recently, several initiatives tried to improve public awareness that symptoms of stroke need to be treated as a medical emergency. However, ethnic communities present cultural barriers, requiring tailored health promotion interventions, whose effectiveness remains uncertain.

Practical cultural adaptation strategies were not linked to specific theoretical frameworks. Interventions widely differed as for target populations, settings, delivery methods, contents and professional roles involved. All study designs were quantitative, and the emerging evidence of effectiveness was inconclusive.Such interventions operate in very complex scenarios, and several variables may influence their effectiveness. Therefore, qualitative or mixed-methods study designs may shed light on barriers and facilitators, experiential education strategies and community involvement.Network- and community-level theories may help improving design and evaluation of interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Eleven case reports and four RCTs provide evidence about stroke awareness interventions organized in the US.

Current secondary prevention approaches lack adequate scope to address CSA as a multidimensional ischemic and persistent pain problem. This trial evaluated the impact of a low-cost six-week angina psychoeducation program, entitled The Chronic Angina Self-Management Program (CASMP), on HRQL, self-efficacy, and resourcefulness to self-manage anginal pain. One hundred thirty participants were randomized to the CASMP or three-month wait-list usual care; 117 completed the study. Measures were taken at baseline and three months. General HRQL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form and the disease-specific Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). Self-efficacy and resourcefulness were measured using the Self-Efficacy Scale and the Self-Control Schedule, respectively. The mean age of participants was 68 years, 80% were male. Analysis of variance of change scores yielded significant improvements in treatment group physical functioning [F=11.75(1,114), P<0.001] and general health [F=10.94(1,114), P=0.001] aspects of generic HRQL.

Fifty smokers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder and whose symptoms had been stable for at least two months were enrolled in a program providing group support and NRT (patches) in individually adjusted doses set to maintain baseline nicotine intake. All participants attended weekly group support/motivation sessions. Smoking activity was determined by measuring carbon monoxide levels in expired air. Participants who quit tobacco use completely during the first three months were entered into a single-blind phase in which they received either placebo or active nicotine patches for up to six additional months, along with biweekly group sessions. Sixty days into the open-label phase, 66% of the subjects had reduced their use of tobacco by at least 75%. After 90 days of open-label treatment, 18 subjects (36%) were tobacco-free and qualified to enter the six-month, single-blind phase, eight on placebo and nine on active patches. A significantly greater proportion of those on placebo (8 of 8) compared with those on active patches (3 of 9) relapsed prior to completion of the 6-month period. This difference is statistically significant at the p = 0.009 level. The results of this study indicate that long-term use of NRT is feasible and effective for sustained tobacco-free success and may be an important strategy for reducing health risks due to tobacco use in this special population."

Accordingly, a growing body of literature points to the importance of a sound approach to planning and evaluation in order to improve the quality of PA programmes. However, while numerous PA programmes have been designed for the elderly in recent years, their evaluation has been scarce.

This pattern held for separate examinations of cocaine and methamphetamine dependence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Nicotine craving accounts for a small but meaningful portion of the relationship between smoking-cessation treatment and smoking abstinence during SUD treatment. Nicotine craving following a quit attempt may be a useful therapeutic target for increasing the effectiveness of smoking-cessation treatment in substance dependence."

First-line FDA-approved medications of nicotine patch, varenicline, and bupropion were tested as model drugs, in three separate placebo-controlled studies.

Sensitivity to medication efficacy signal was observed only in smokers high in intrinsic quit motivation (i.e., already preparing to quit soon) and not smokers low in intrinsic quit motivation, even if monetarily reinforced for abstinence (i.e., given extrinsic motivation).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A crossover procedure requiring less time and fewer subjects than formal trials may provide an efficient strategy for a go/no-go decision whether to advance to subsequent phase 2 randomized clinical trials with a novel drug. Future research is needed to replicate our results and evaluate this procedure with novel compounds, identify factors that may limit its utility, and evaluate its applicability to testing efficacy of compounds for treating other forms of addiction."

            "abstract": "This study explored, from a public health perspective, factors that contribute to inconsistent condom use by men in Curaçao through semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 21 heterosexual men. The findings show that there is an important disconnect between what is considered culturally appropriate sexual behaviour for men and women and condom use, that diverging from prescribed notions of masculinity and femininity in order to use condoms consistently is difficult, and that condom use is particularly problematic in the context of concurrent partnerships and sexual economic exchanges. Participants further reported that Caribbean family structures, whereby mothers assume the role as primary caregiver and fathers contribute biologically but, to a much lesser extent socially, also have an impact on condom use. Additionally, consistent condom use was reported to be impeded by a cultural taboo on talking seriously about sex and sexual health. In their totality, findings provide important input from men for the development of sexual health promotion interventions that are cognizant of the cultural context in which inconsistent condom use occurs, and that are geared not only to the individual level but also to the interpersonal and structural levels."

To this end, ecological momentary assessments (EMA) are now being collected extensively. The time-varying effect model (TVEM) is a statistical technique ideally suited to model processes that unfold as behavior and nicotine dependence change. Coefficients are expressed dynamically over time and are represented as smooth functions of time.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The TVEM approach is demonstrated using data from a smoking-cessation trial.

Recently, evidence has emerged that glutamate transmission plays an important role in relapse. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine prodrug, restores glutamate homeostasis and appears to be a potential new treatment for substance dependence. In the current pilot study, the effects of NAC on short-term abstinence of smoking were investigated. Subjects were heavy smokers randomized to receive placebo (n = 12) or NAC 3,600 mg/day (n = 10) in a double-blind fashion during 3.5 days. Subjects were asked to stop smoking and report on nicotine craving, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and cigarette smoking during treatment. At the end of the treatment, subjects were invited to smoke a cigarette and to rate the rewarding effect of this cigarette. There was no significant effect of NAC on craving (p = 0.23, d = 0.52) and only a statistical trend towards fewer withdrawal symptoms in the NAC condition (p = 0.07, d = 0.80). Interestingly, subjects receiving NAC rated the first cigarette after the abstinence period of 3.5 days as significantly less rewarding than subjects on placebo (p = 0.04, d = 0.85). It is concluded that the results of this pilot study are encouraging and suggest that NAC might be a promising new treatment option for relapse prevention in nicotine dependence."

Using baseline data for 1016 parent-child dyads, we examined the association of parental health literacy with parents' oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, as well as indicators of parental and pediatric oral health. More limited health literacy was associated with lower levels of oral health knowledge, more negative oral health attitudes, and lower levels of adherence to recommended oral health behavior. Parents with more limited health literacy also had significantly worse oral health status (OHS) and reported their children to have significantly worse oral health-related quality of life.

This paper aims to explore the degree to which dose is currently understood as a distinct and well-defined implementation concept outside of clinical settings.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched four databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews and Global Health) to identify original research articles published between 2000 and 2015 on health promotion interventions that contained the word 'dose' or 'dosage' in the title, abstract or keywords. We identified 130 articles meeting inclusion criteria and extracted data on how dose/dosage was defined and operationalised, which we then synthesised to reveal key themes in the use of this concept across health promotion interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Dose was defined in a variety of ways, including in relation to the amount of intervention delivered and/or received, the level of participation in the intervention and, in some instances, the quality of intervention delivery. We also observed some conflation of concepts that are traditionally kept separate (such as fidelity) either as slippage or as part of composite measures (such as 'intervention dose').\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Dose is not a well-defined or consistently applied concept in evaluations of health promotion interventions. While current approaches to conceptualisation and measurement of dose are suitable for interventions in organisational settings, they are less well suited to policies delivered at a population level. Dose often accompanies a traditional monotonic linear view of causality (e.g. dose response) which may or may not fully represent the intervention's theory of how change is brought about. Finally, we found dose and dosage to be used interchangeably. We recommend a distinction between these terms, with 'dosage' having the advantage of capturing change to amount 'dispensed' over time (in response to effects achieved). Dosage therefore acknowledges the inevitable dynamic and complexity of implementation."

This paper offers the model more generally as a common frame of reference for broader public health practice and indicator development. The model builds around the physical, mental and social health of individuals and shows how health develops by interaction between individual and environmental health determinants. It demonstrates that health development can be analysed from a salutogenic and a pathogenic perspective and explains how the differing starting points of different intervention approaches such as health promotion and health care are related to these two perspectives. Finally, a classification system for pathogenic and salutogenic public health outcome indicators is derived from the model and has been applied to the current core list of the European Community Health Indicator system. The model and its application highlight the need for systematic salutogenic indicator development in the field of public health and for strengthening the health promotion perspective in the future."

Since dopamine may play a critical role in mediating the reinforcing effects of nicotine, we hypothesized that administering levodopa in its therapeutic form (carbidopa/levodopa) might be effective for smoking cessation by replacing the effects of dopamine that smokers may seek during smoking. A pilot open-label study using carbidopa/levodopa for smokers wanting to stop smoking was carried out at the Mayo Clinic Nicotine Research Center, Rochester, MN. The dosing schedule was one tablet TID for 1 week, 1 1/2 tablets TID for 1 week, then two tablets TID for 6 weeks. Each tablet contained 25 mg of carbidopa and 100 mg of levodopa. The subjects were 40 adult smokers smoking > or = 20 cigarettes per day for 3 or more years. Self-reported abstinence from smoking was confirmed by expired air CO level of < or = 8 ppm. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms were assessed at baseline and daily during the medication phase. Smoking abstinence rates and withdrawal symptom relief were compared to the placebo (n = 153) arm of a previously reported bupropion smoking cessation trial. The biochemically confirmed, 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence rate at the end of carbidopa/levodopa treatment was 20.0% versus 19.0% for the placebo group (p > 0.10), and 12.5% of the carbidopa/levodopa group were abstinent versus 15.7% for the placebo group (p > 0.10) at 6 months. Subjects from both studies had significant increases in withdrawal scores from baseline, but there were no significant differences between the two groups at any time period. We found no differences in smoking abstinence rates or nicotine withdrawal symptom relief in smokers receiving carbidopa/levodopa compared to placebo. Despite the theoretical reasons why carbidopa/levodopa might be effective as a pharmacological adjunct in treating smokers, it was not observed in this group of smokers at this dose."

            "abstract": "A recognized 'paradigm war' exists between the two distinct approaches of health education and health promotion practice. This tension is both unhealthy and unhelpful and is known to have a profound effect on nursing activity. Leading health promotionalists have begun to acknowledge the futility of the stated paradigm tension, realizing that health education and health promotion interventions are not that dissimilar in their origins and intentions. Progressive health education and health promotion programmes acknowledge the interrelatedness of both approaches and seek to incorporate favourable aspects of the two. The aim of this article is to present arguments and stances that help to diffuse/avoid the stated paradigm conflict, as a basis for health education and health promotion reform in nursing. It also seeks to clarify the nature of both health education and health promotion practice so as to avoid contextual confusion. In doing so, this article draws significantly from the author's previous work. This article concludes that the constructive review of any intended health education/health promotion programme lies in the consideration of each approach according to its own relative merits, what is required of the programme, and the nature of the setting in which the intervention takes place."

The nicotine replacement treatment lasted for 3 months and was carried out according to the manufacturers recommendations. Abstinence was defined as smoking no cigarette during the last week of each month and COHb-levels < or = 1.2%. Efficacy was assessed using abstinence rates, withdrawal symptoms and cigarette consumption. Although at the commencement of the study all subjects expressed a high motivation to stop smoking, about a third were lost to follow-up at 4 weeks. This was attributed mainly to the lack of counselling and group dynamics. The greatest effect on smoking cessation and cigarette consumption was attributable to a non-specific aspect of treatment, i.e. the motivation to stop smoking on application of the first patch. On an intention-to-treat basis (all subjects), abstinence rates were 24% and 18% after 1 month, 24% and 14% after 2 months and 14% and 6% after 3 months for the nicotine-TTS and placebo-TTS, respectively. Nicotine-TTS was at least twice as effective as placebo in maintaining nicotine abstinence. The superiority of the nicotine-TTS was supported by the trend to a higher craving-for-cigarettes score and significantly higher blood COHb and cigarette consumption in the non-abstainers treated with placebo."

We randomly assigned 151 smokers to either a reduction group or a waitlist group. In the reduction group, we measured urinary 1-HOP at two baseline intervals. Then, the smokers were expected to reduce their CPD by 25% in weeks 0-2, 50% in weeks 2-4, and 75% in weeks 4-6 and to maintain reduced smoking through week 26. In the waitlist group, four baseline measurements were taken and then the smokers joined the reduction group. Urinary 1-HOP was quantified at weeks 4, 6, 8, 12, and 26 after baseline. Statistically significant reductions in urinary 1-HOP were observed at most time points examined in groups of smokers who reduced to different extents. Reductions in the waitlist group were also generally significantly greater than baseline levels. The reductions in 1-HOP were usually modest (ranging from 14% to 35% in all groups and time points examined), which partially reflects the fact that there are sources of pyrene exposure other than cigarette smoke. Thus, cessation of smoking would only be expected to result in partial reductions of 1-HOP. The observed reductions in 1-HOP were not fully consistent with reductions in CPD probably due to uncontrolled dietary factors. Collectively, the results demonstrate that some smokers can achieve substantial reductions in 1-HOP, reflecting reduced uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, by reducing CPD, but there was not a consistent relationship between these parameters."

Efforts to promote physical activity in Latina women show promising results, yet such interventions are yet to be extended to Latino men. This study tested a computer expert system‒tailored, text messaging-supported physical activity intervention for underactive Spanish-speaking Latino men compared with a control group matched for contact time. Potential predictors of intervention success were also explored.\n## STUDY DESIGN\nRandomized trial. Participants were randomized to receive a Tailored Physical Activity Intervention (Intervention) or a Wellness Control (Control). Data were collected in 2015-2017 and analyzed in 2018-2019.\n## SETTING/PARTICIPANTS\nInsufficiently active Latino men (n=46).\n## INTERVENTION\nIntervention participants received a baseline counseling session and then, individually tailored print materials and text messages on a tapered schedule for 6 months. Control participants received printed wellness materials and text messages on the same schedule.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary outcome was a change in weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity from baseline to 6 months measured by accelerometers. Self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity measured by the 7-day Physical Activity Recall Interview was a secondary outcome.\n## RESULTS\nFor Intervention participants, median accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity increased from 10.0 minutes/week at baseline to 57.5 minutes/week at 6 months, whereas for Control participants, it increased from 21.0 minutes/week at baseline to 23.0 minutes/week at 6 months (p<0.05). Similar results were found for self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity. At 6 months, 47% of Intervention participants met national guidelines of 150 minutes/week versus 25% of Control participants (p=0.15, not significant).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFindings suggest that an individually tailored intervention can successfully increase moderate to vigorous physical activity in underactive Latino men. Such technology-supported interventions have the potential for broad dissemination.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThis study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02512419.\n"

In total, 16 studies were annotated for the narrative synthesis; these articles all reported an outcome-oriented evaluation of an HP-related intervention in a natural disaster situation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) or vulnerable populations in high-income countries (HIC). These 16 studies were also assessed for quality of their evaluation design.

We asked, in particular, (1) How is effectiveness being measured and what are the specific problems in effecting health behavior change?, and (2) To what extent is the designated role of social networking grounded in theory?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The narrative synthesis approach to literature review was used to analyze the existing evidence. We searched the indexed scientific literature using keywords associated with health promotion and social networking. The papers included were only those making substantial study of both social networking and health promotion—either reporting the results of the intervention or detailing evidence-based plans. General papers about social networking and health were not included.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The search identified 162 potentially relevant documents after review of titles and abstracts. Of these, 42 satisfied the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Six studies described randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of online social networking within health promotion interventions. Most of the trials investigated the value of a \"social networking condition\" in general and did not identify specific features that might play a role in effectiveness. Issues about the usability and level of uptake of interventions were more common among pilot studies, while observational studies showed positive evidence about the role of social support. A total of 20 papers showed the use of theory in the design of interventions, but authors evaluated effectiveness in only 10 papers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      More research is needed in this area to understand the actual effect of social network technologies on health promotion. More RCTs of greater length need to be conducted taking into account contextual factors such as patient characteristics and types of a social network technology. Also, more evidence is needed regarding the actual usability of online social networking and how different interface design elements may help or hinder behavior change and engagement. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate further the effect of theory on the effectiveness of this type of technology for health promotion. Research is needed linking theoretical grounding with observation and analysis of health promotion in online networks."

Phase 1 will identify programme theories about implementation (ideas about what enables or inhibits effective health promotion to be delivered in a school setting). Phase 2 will test the programme theories so that they can be challenged, endorsed and/or refined. A Review Advisory Group of education and health professionals will be convened to help identify and choose potential programme theories, provide a 'reality check' on the clarity and explanatory strength of the mechanisms to be tested, and help shape the presentation of findings to be usable by practitioners and decision-makers.

After a 1-week baseline, smokers were exposed to an 8-week drug and behavioral intervention involving buspirone or placebo (up to 60 mg/day) with concurrent group cognitive behavioral intervention. All smokers were to quit smoking on the target date, set at 4 weeks after the program began. Medication was provided for an additional 4 weeks after group treatment ended. The results showed that buspirone had a beneficial effect on smoking abstinence but only among smokers who were already relatively high in anxiety and only for as long as the drug was available. Moreover, when provided to smokers who were relatively low in anxiety, the drug appeared to interfere with abstinence, although these effects also reversed when the drug was withdrawn. These effects were associated with an attenuation of the expected rise in anxiety before the quit date and its actual reversal thereafter, but only in the buspirone high-anxiety group. One-month abstinence averaged 88, 61, 60, and 89% for the buspirone high-anxiety, placebo high-anxiety, buspirone low-anxiety, and placebo low-anxiety groups, respectively.

Ninety-two elderly patients with AMD (average age = 79) from a university ophthalmology clinic were randomly assigned to the self-management intervention (n = 44) or to a wait-list (n = 48). All patients were legally blind in at least one eye. The intervention consisted of 6 weekly 2-hour group sessions providing education about the disease, group discussion, and behavioral and cognitive skills training to address barriers to independence. All participants eventually completed the intervention allowing pre-post comparisons for all patients. The battery of measures included the Profile of Mood States (POMS); Quality of Well-Being Scale; and assessments of self-efficacy, participation in activities, and use of vision aids. Participants' initial psychological distress was high (mean total POMS = 59.72) and similar to distress experienced by other serious chronic illness populations (e.g. cancer, bone marrow transplant). Analysis of covariance testing the primary hypothesis revealed that intervention participants experienced significantly (p = .04) reduced psychological distress (pre mean = 61.45; post mean = 51.14) in comparison with wait-list controls (pre mean = 57.72; post mean = 62.32).

Further, intervention participants increased their use of vision aids (p < .001; pre mean = 3.37, post mean = 6.69). This study demonstrates that a relatively brief behavioral intervention can substantially reduce psychological distress and increase self-efficacy in elderly adults experiencing vision loss due to macular degeneration. Self-management intervention appears to improve mood, self-efficacy, and use of vision aids, further enhancing the lives of poorly sighted individuals with AMD."

Methodological features were described using the CONSORT checklists; risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook classification.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      With design inclusion criteria relaxed to include an uncontrolled trial, only three intervention studies were retrieved, from the United States, Canada and Taiwan. All had limitations and high risk of bias, but benefits were reported. Outcomes included fewer cigarettes smoked during the intervention period, down from mean (SD) 20 (8)-12 (9) per day (p < 0·001); significantly reduced fat mass (0·68 vs. 0·07 kg; p = 0·028); and significant gains across a battery of fitness assessments. The paucity of work focused on nurses' health behaviours was the important finding.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The workplace is a potentially fruitful location for health promotion intervention but nurses have seldom been recognised as a target participant group. Given the international priority ascribed to nursing workforce retention, this is a missed opportunity for occupational health planning. Potential benefits to nurses' welfare and well-being may accrue from well-designed intervention studies.\n    \n\n\n          Relevance to clinical practice:\n        \n      \n      Nurse leaders have a key role in driving recognition, spearheading commitment and development of targeted, whole-organisation programmes to promote health profile improvement for the nursing workforce."

            "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) and income disparity are strong predictors of health, and health promotion interventions that address them are more likely to be meaningful to participants and to sustain positive effects. Seeds of HOPE is an innovative project that is the result of a long-standing collaboration between the University of North Carolina (UNC) Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prevention Research Center, and communities in rural North Carolina. Initial formative work, including key informant interviews, community surveys, and focus groups, strengthened our understanding of the link between hope and health and the importance of addressing social and economic issues as part of our health promotion interventions. A Seeds of HOPE strategic plan was developed using a community-based participatory process and led to the idea to start Threads of HOPE, an enterprise that will serve as a business laboratory where women will produce and market a unique product and also learn business skills. Threads of HOPE will be a health-enhancing business and will serve as a training program for a new cadre of women entrepreneurs in two rural communities."

These two paradigms are closely related but are not inter-dependent. Despite this, it is known that many nurses confuse the terms and use them interchangeably. With this in mind, it is necessary to re-conceptualize the terms in an attempt to bring them to a current form of 'maturity'.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The aim of the paper is to provide an up-to-date analysis of health promotion and health education that serves as a conceptual and operational foundation for clinicians and researchers.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A concept analysis following the criterion-based methods described by Morse and her colleagues was applied to the terms health education and health promotion, using generic and nursing-related literature.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The conceptual literature on health education is consistent between generic and nursing-related sources. On the contrary, earlier nursing literature on health promotion is now at odds with more recent socio-political and community action models of health promotion, in that it focuses on individualistic and behavioural forms of 'health promotion'. A significant proportion of later nursing-related literature, however, suggests a maturing of the concept that brings it further in line with a socio-political health promotion agenda.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      While the theoretical and conceptual literature surrounding health education has remained relatively constant and unchanged over the last decade or so, the same cannot be said for the health promotion literature. The evolving dominance of socio-political action in health promotion has overtaken individualistic and behaviourally-related forms. While the recent nursing literature addresses and acknowledges the place of socio-political activity as the mainstay of health promotion interventions, this is largely from a theoretical stance and is not applied in practice."

This \"double placebo\" design controls sensory, psychological and ritual variables associated with each drug form. Withdrawal symptoms were rated four times daily for 3 days in each condition. Total baseline (smoking) withdrawal scores using visual analogue scales (VAS) averaged 101.1. During cessation, total withdrawal increased to 187.0 for the double placebo condition, 142.2 for the active gum/placebo patch treatment and 128.3 for the active patch/placebo gum treatment. The double active condition equalled smoking with score 99.2. All pairwise comparisons were significant (P < 0.001) except between the two single active conditions and between smoking versus the double active condition. Significant time-of-day effects by treatment on withdrawal were observed for the double placebo condition (P < 0.05) with less withdrawal in the morning. The findings suggest: 1) combining nicotine gum with transdermal nicotine may be superior to either treatment alone, 2) more symptoms may be nicotine specific (relieved by replacement) than previously thought."

            "abstract": "Prostate health has emerged as a key health issue for men. Nearly 10,000 men die from prostate cancer each year and many more live with non-cancerous, but debilitating, prostate conditions. Despite the widespread prevalence, evidence suggests that men lack knowledge about male cancers and conditions, and are more likely to ignore signs and delay seeking help. Health promotion with men in the workplace is, therefore, increasingly being advocated as an important way of providing men with health information and encouraging them to see a health professional where appropriate. However, there has not been a developed account of men's views on health promotion within the workplace. This paper presents the findings of a small-scale qualitative study that explored men's perceptions and experiences of three different workplace-based health promotion interventions to improve prostate health awareness and their attitudes towards the workplace as an appropriate setting for promoting men's health. This paper shows that men generally welcomed a workplace-based health promotion campaign targeted specifically at them. However, the masculine 'culture' of the workplace, where concerns about health were likely to be met with ridicule rather than concern, was one important factor in understanding these men's views of different health promotion interventions."

This review explores community-based content, delivery, recruitment, or retention strategies used with young men of color aged 15 to 24 years. Of 17 articles describing 16 individual interventions and 1 describing multiple interventions (with samples ranging from 37 to 4,800), 13 reported significant results in one or more domains. No studies specifically targeted the needs of young men and only three had more than 50% male participants. There was a gap in studies that addressed young men in the ages of interest with most interventions reaching participants aged 11 to 19 years. Cultural tailoring was addressed through recruitment setting, interventionist characteristics, community involvement, and theoretical frameworks such as motivational interviewing that allow individual goal setting. Because young men seek access to preventive health services less than young women, it is suggested that interventions that are community based or use push technology (send information directly to the user) be increased."

            "abstract": "The placebo effect of a psychoactive drug can be defined as the effect of expecting the drug in the absence of its pharmacological actions. As nicotine is widely believed to be the primary factor driving cigarette smoking, smokers are likely to expect nicotine to alleviate craving and withdrawal. The present review examines the extent to which any observed effects of nicotine, and especially its craving- and withdrawal-reducing effects, can be attributed to placebo. We begin by reviewing studies that examined the placebo effects of nicotine in the laboratory and follow with a review of potential placebo effects that are typically not controlled in placebo-controlled studies of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In laboratory studies, nicotine instructions decrease tobacco smoking, craving and/or withdrawal, while nicotine-specific effects have not been consistently reported. In field trials of NRT, there is a general failure to assess smokers' beliefs regarding their drug assignment. This omission makes it difficult to unequivocally attribute findings of placebo-controlled NRT studies to the physiological effects of nicotine. In sum, our review indicates that the placebo effects of nicotine, and specifically nicotine content expectations, may account for many of the benefits associated with nicotine delivery devices in both laboratory and field studies."

This is due, in part, to clinician concern that combining smoking cessation treatment with SUD treatment could lead to poorer SUD outcomes. The NIDA Clinical Trials Network is conducting a 10-week, two-group, randomized trial to evaluate the impact of providing smoking cessation treatment (SCT) with SUD treatment as usual (TAU), compared to TAU alone, in smokers who are in outpatient treatment for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence. Approximately 528 participants, recruited from 12 community treatment programs, will be randomized into the trial. The present paper describes key design decisions made during protocol development. The trial is designed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and stimulant use, which prior research suggests is linked, and should contribute to our understanding of how best to address the co-occurring problems of nicotine dependence and cocaine/methamphetamine-dependence. Unique aspects of the trial include the primary question of interest, which concerns the impact of providing SCT on SUD outcomes rather than on smoking outcomes, and the intensity of the SCT chosen, which includes bupropion, nicotine replacement, and two psychosocial interventions."

For pharmacological treatments, nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) as well as bupropion allow to increase 6 month-abstinence rates by more than 80% in comparison with placebo while varenicline prescription doubles success rates in the same conditions. These results mean that for 10 smokers who quit with placebo, 18 are expected to quit with NRT or bupropion and 28 are expected to quit with varenicline. Varenicline is 50% more effective than nicotine patch and 70% more effective than nicotine gum. Nevertheless, a combination including NRT patch and oral nicotine forms is as effective as varenicline, thus leading to encourage the prescription of a combination NRT when NRT are chosen. For these three pharmacological treatments, cardiovascular as well as neuropsychiatric tolerance were not found statistically different from placebo in randomized controlled trials. Yet, bupropion prescription leads to an increasing risk of seizure (1/1000 to 1/1500). For behavioral treatment, motivational interviewing as well as cognitive behavior therapies are been proven to be effective to stop smoking but few smokers have access to this treatment.

In the field of health promotion and prevention, the systematic planning process of social marketing can offer new ideas and perspectives to the traditions of social science. Major characteristics of social marketing encompass continuous market research focussing on attitudes, motives and behavioural patterns of the target group, an integrated mix of strategic key elements, and the perpetual evaluation of all procedures. So far, however, it is unclear in how far social marketing is actually more effective than other concepts of programme planning. Furthermore, it has to be discussed whether the underlying philosophy of social marketing and its implicit understanding of relationships to the public are reconcilable with health promotion principles. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the social marketing concept has achieved widespread application and is subject to controversial scientific discussions, whereas this approach is hardly considered in German health promotion research and practice. Given the increasing call for quality management and evaluation of health promotion interventions, the social marketing concept may contribute useful insights at an operational level and thus add to a discussion on effective approaches for programme planning."

            "abstract": "Bridging the gap between research-based evidence and public health policy and practice is a considerable challenge to public health improvement this century, requiring a rethinking of conventional approaches to health research production and use. Traditionally the process of research translation has been viewed as linear and unidirectional, from epidemiological research to identify health problems and determinants, to efficacy and effectiveness trials and studies of strategies to maximise the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based interventions in practice. A criticism of this approach is the considerable time it takes to achieve translation of health research into practice. Hybrid evaluation designs provide one means of accelerating the research translation process by simultaneously collecting information regarding intervention impacts and implementation and dissemination strategy. However, few health promotion research trials employ such designs and often fail to report information to enable assessment of the feasibility and potential impact of implementation and dissemination strategies. In addition to intervention effects, policy makers and practitioners also want to know the impact of implementation strategies. This commentary will define the three categories of effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs, describe their application in health promotion evaluation, and discuss the potential implications of more systematic use of such designs for the translation of health promotion and evaluation.So what?Greater use of effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs may accelerate research translation by providing more practice- and policy-relevant information to end-users, more quickly."

This study is part of a multicentric project evaluating the lifestyles of middle school students (grades 6-8), carried out by the Research and Health Education Group (GRES) and was performed during the 2006/2007 school year. In total 432 students participated in the study by completing a self-administered questionnaire. Data was analysed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results show an increasing trend in the number of smokers from grades 6 to 8. In grades 6 and 8 most smokers are female while in grade 7 male smokers outnumber female smokers. Three percent of the student population reports smoking occasionally and 3% are regular smokers. In light of these results families, schools and institutions should take charge of programming and implementing health promotion interventions aimed at reducing risks and improving the quality of life of students in Catania."

The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the behaviour change techniques that have been used in primary school-based interventions to prevent dental caries (utilizing a Cochrane systematic review that we have undertaken) and to identify opportunities for improving future interventions by incorporating a comprehensive range of behaviour change techniques. Papers of five interventions were reviewed and data were independently extracted. Results indicate that behaviour change techniques were limited to information-behaviour links, information on consequences, instruction and demonstration of behaviours. None of the interventions were based on behaviour change theory. We conclude that behaviour change techniques used in school interventions to reduce dental caries were limited and focused around providing information about how behaviour impacts on health and the consequences of not developing the correct health behaviours as well as providing oral hygiene instruction. Establishing which techniques are effective is difficult due to poor reporting of interventions in studies. Future design of oral health promotion interventions using behaviour change theory for development and evaluation (and reporting results in academic journals) could strengthen the potential for efficacy and provide a framework to use a much wider range of behaviour change techniques. Future studies should include development and publication of intervention manuals which is becoming standard practice in other health promoting programmes."

An electronic questionnaire was developed and administered to the students after the intervention. The participants' evaluations of the intervention were fairly positive. Almost all of the participants were at least partly satisfied with the classroom lesson. They mostly reported learning new information about STIs and sexuality. Information material was also read and participants self-evaluated themselves as having learned from the materials. Free condoms were obtained and the students felt that the condom distribution was useful.

The study sample includes 44 interventions selected through a network of key informants from five cities--Liverpool, Sandwell, Vienna, Pula, and Rijeka--by using a chain technique. Data on each intervention are collected through an in-depth interview with a program leader, the collection of project-related documents, and on-site observation. Qualitative analysis of data performed with content analysis and computer-assisted free-text analysis reveals different characteristics of interventions depending on whether they are initiated by the city government sector, health-care system, or citizens sector (independent of the city or country). The assessment of the efficiency of these three groups of interventions also differs because of varying features, scope (activity potentials) and impact they are able to accomplish. We have identified ways in which the efficiency of all three groups of interventions can be improved. The efficiency of the interventions within the city sector can be increased through an improved process of delegation to other sectors, higher involvement of user groups, and higher receptivity and organizational flexibility. The efficiency of the interventions within the citizens sector can be improved through professional, organizational, and financial support. Support from the professional community is important for citizens sector interventions in confirming the importance of the problem they address and legitimizing the actions they propose and undertake."

            "abstract": "There has been increased interest in men's health over the past two decades. A major focus has been on men's apparent reluctance to seek health-related help. As such, innovative methods to facilitate health promotion engagement and preventive health practices among men have emerged. Men's health promotion activity in Australia has paid particular attention to settings and social marketing approaches. These, more often than not, have been aligned to hegemonic constructions of masculinity. As such, traditional gender-roles are perpetuated, which may, despite best intentions, reinforce negative health behaviours among men. However, the health promotion community is well positioned to strategically free men from the constraints of hegemonic masculinity. By paying attention to commentary relating to the social construction of gender, an alternative pathway is evident. Of particular interest is discussion relating to multiple masculinities, in contrast to one dominant form. This opens the door to develop a range of health promotion interventions targeted to specific groups of men, including those that are most marginalised and disadvantaged. In doing so, health inequities among men relating to age, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity can be more purposefully addressed. This paper explores the intersection between current health promotion practice and recent commentary relating to gender. I conclude by suggesting that health promotion researchers, practitioners and policy makers need to account for multiple masculinities in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of health promotion activities aimed at men in order to move men's health promotion forward in Australia."

Education programmes and resource materials were developed by midwives and researchers as part of a cluster randomized trial of Midwifery Education for Women who Smoke (the MEWS study). Development included a cohort study, advice from lactation consultants and smoking cessation counsellors (including Ma-ori professionals), and early consultation with midwives who would be delivering the programmes. Resources developed included videotapes, charts and laminated information cards. Resources were pre-tested with pregnant women and opinion leaders. Consultation with the midwives allocated to each of the intervention groups in the trial raised a number of issues. These were addressed, and solutions incorporated into each of the programmes, to enable effective delivery within usual care. Following delivery of the programmes, women and their midwives were surveyed and a sample interviewed to ascertain attitudes to the programmes and resources. Women and their midwives responded positively to the smoking cessation education programme, the breastfeeding promotion programme and the resources used. Those women who did not stop smoking completely often succeeded in significantly reducing their tobacco consumption. Women identified their midwife as a valuable resource and appreciated her ongoing encouragement. Involvement of health professionals who are to deliver health promotion interventions is essential for successful integration of programmes into usual care. Midwives were able to effectively deliver programmes that were developed and targeted to their needs as health educators. The pregnancy-specific resources developed for women who smoke played an important part in helping midwives deliver their health promotion messages more effectively."

Overall, 110 outcome evaluations were located. Only a quarter of these reported that interventions were implemented in response to the explicit needs and/or views of the employees and very few involved partnerships. Most of the programmes targeted individual behaviour and supportive organizational change was limited. The majority of the outcome evaluations were not sufficiently rigorous to make a strong case for the effectiveness of workplace health promotion. However, some pointers to success were identified. It was concluded that there seems to be a wide disparity between what counts as 'good practice' within workplace health promotion and what is reported in the evaluation of effectiveness literature.

Mechanistic outcomes were self-reported cravings and physiologic reactivity to smoking cues. The primary clinical outcome was 6-week, biochemically-verified, continuous tobacco abstinence. DCS, relative to placebo, augmentation of CET resulted in lower self-reported craving to smoking pictorial and in vivo cues (d = 0.8 to 1.21) in a relevant subsample of participants who were reactive to cues and free from smoking-related reconditioning experiences. Select craving outcomes were correlated with smoking abstinence, and DCS augmentation was associated with a trend toward a higher continuous abstinence rate (33% vs. 13% for placebo augmentation).

This paper explores what constitutes an intervention that works from the perspective of health promotion professionals (HPP), and how, according to them, the development and implementation of interventions should be improved. We interviewed 81 HPPs about the use of 10 health promotion interventions at 30 Municipality Health Services in The Netherlands. The HPPs described an intervention that works as something that produces its intended effects after being realized in a local situation. Interventions are realized by combining elements of a supplied intervention (e.g. a theory, artefacts) with elements that are situated in the local context (e.g. funding, local network). Interventions that are transferred contain implicit assumptions about local contexts, but it is often unclear what precisely constitutes an intervention and what is assumed of local contexts. An intervention that works is a situated configuration of aligned elements. A linear EB approach depends on the realization of the local circumstances in which 'evidence based' interventions can work. Various strategies are possible for approximating such circumstances, but the core assumption that the configuration that is realized in practice is similar to the 'evidence based' intervention seems unrealistic for most health promotion in The Netherlands. Under such circumstances, attention should shift from central quality assurance to the system of actors and the distributed actions and heterogeneous learning processes that together add up to interventions that work."

Moreover, Bupropion SR proved to be an effective cessation aid for women (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.92-3.17). No treatment-gender interaction was observed; women and men benefited equally from treatment with Bupropion SR (Q = 0.01, NS). Overall, women were less successful at quitting than men, regardless of treatment (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65-0.95).

The importance of these programmes has been increasing since the evidence has shown that this type of health promotion interventions may reduce the deleterious effects of the ageing process. However, no study has already identified the general characteristics of these programmes nor if they use any scheme to assess the quality of the service provided. A widely-used scheme is the EFQM Excellence Model, which will be in the core of our present work. Thus, the main aims of this preliminary study were 1) to identify the general characteristics of the PA programmes developed by the Portuguese Local Public Administration 2) to determine the extent of implementation of quality initiatives in these programmes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected by an on-line questionnaire sent to all Continental Municipalities (n = 278).

            "abstract": "Concerted efforts to create health-promoting sport, racing and arts venues have become possible since the advent of health promotion foundations in four of Australia's eight states and territories. Large numbers of Australians attend sport, racing and arts venues in pursuit of leisure activities. There is evidence that sport and racing participants and spectators, and certain subgroups of the arts community, have adverse risk-factor profiles that make them an ideal target for health promotion interventions. Through the use of sponsorship, health promotion foundations 'purchase' health-promoting policies in sport, racing and arts settings-policies that have the potential to become institutionalised once sponsorship dollars are depleted. This paper discusses the policies 'purchased' by the foundations and outlines a comprehensive surveillance and evaluation system developed for the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation. The system monitors the implementation of health-promoting environments at the micro level (sponsorship project); intermediate level (sponsored group); and macro level (community). The article concludes by outlining some of the lessons learned in Western Australia. These provide the basis for development of best practice in working with sport, racing and arts groups, and other sectors outside health, to create health-promoting environments."

Of the intratreatment markers examined, withdrawal severity and nicotine replacement levels also were not consistently predictive of cessation success. However, any smoking during the second week of treatment was a consistent and powerful predictor of failure at the end of treatment and after 6 months. Among active nicotine patch patients who smoked at all during week 2 after quitting, 83% and 97% (studies 1 and 2, respectively) were smoking at 6-month follow-up. Conversely, abstinence during the second week of treatment predicted successful smoking cessation. Among active nicotine patch patients who were totally abstinent during week 2 after quitting, 46% and 41% (studies 1 and 2, respectively) were abstinent at 6-month follow-up. Of all nicotine patch patients in both studies who were smoking at 6-month follow-up, 74% began smoking during week 1 or 2. Among all placebo patch patients who were smoking at 6-month follow-up, 86% began smoking during week 1 or 2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Smoking status (abstinent or smoking) during the first 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy, particularly week 2, was highly correlated with clinical outcome and can serve as a powerful predictor of smoking cessation. Early smoking behavior also predicted outcome among placebo patch users. Traditional measures of dependence are not consistently predictive of cessation success. Clinicians are advised to emphasize the importance of total abstinence after a quit attempt and to follow-up with patients within the first 2 weeks of quitting; smoking during this critical time should be assessed and treatment may be altered as appropriate."

            "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to investigate the association of social support and the sense of community (SOC) with satisfaction with life (SWL) and immigrant health. We propose a model in which perceived social support from close sources (family and friends), as mediated by SOC and life satisfaction, would be positively associated with mental and physical health. Limited evidence exists from multivariate models that concurrently examine the association of both factors with SWL and health-related outcomes. We investigate the hypothesized association in a structural equations model (SEM) analysis. The participants consisted of 1131 immigrants (49% men and 51% women) (age 18-70, M = 33). The study was conducted in Malaga (Spain). Cross-sectional data were collected using a random-route sampling and survey methodology. In this model, greater social support from native friends was associated with a greater SOC. Social support from family and native friends was associated with greater SWL. Also, a greater SOC was associated with greater SWL. No association was found between SOC and mental health symptoms, whereas, greater SWL was associated with fewer mental health and illness symptoms. These results suggest that among immigrants, support networks involving family and native friends, and integration into the community are important influences for immigrants to achieve life satisfaction. These results are widely applicable and have implications that are relevant to the design of health promotion interventions."

Innovative health promotion strategies involving technologies such as social media may engage this \"hard-to-reach\" group. There is a paucity of evidence for the efficacy of social media technologies for health promotion in the Australian transport industry.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study analyzed qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions to evaluate a social media health promotion intervention, the Truckin' Healthy Facebook webpage, in selected Australian transport industry workplaces.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We engaged 5 workplace managers and 30 truck drivers from 6 transport industry organizations in developing workplace health promotion strategies, including a social media intervention, within a Participatory Action Research approach. Mixed methods, including a pre- and postintervention manager survey, truck driver survey, key informant semistructured interviews, truck driver focus groups, and focused observation, were used to evaluate the social media intervention. We asked questions about workplace managers' and truck drivers' opinions, engagement, and satisfaction with the intervention.

Truck drivers were poorly engaged with the intervention because (1) many believed they were the \"wrong age\" and lacked the necessary skills; (2) the cost of smartphone technology was prohibitive; (3) they confined their use of social media to nonwork-related purposes; and (4) many workplaces had \"no Facebook\" policies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of social media as a health promotion intervention in transport industry workplaces has potential. Workplace interventions using social media can benefit from a Participatory Action Research approach. Involving managers and workers in the design of social media health promotion interventions and developing strategies to support and deliver the interventions helps to facilitate their success. The workers' profile, including their age and familiarity with social media, and work, workplace, and family context is important to consider in this process. Much more research needs to be undertaken to better understand the effective use of social media to engage \"hard-to-reach\" groups."

Twenty-two subjects were randomized to a placebo group and 20 to the SmokeRx program. The results show that the odds of reduced or validated cessation of smoking were not significantly different between the groups at any juncture over the 6 months of the trial but that there was a trend for higher odds in the SmokeRx group. Subjects were also more likely to drop out of the placebo group (p = .06), suggesting a possible positive effect of the SmokeRx regimen. Overall, early dropouts (at 2 week follow-up) appeared less motivated to quit smoking, as they were more likely to be younger, had smoked more than 5 years, had greater difficulty refraining from smoking in places where it is forbidden, had fewer previous quit attempts, did not intend to quit smoking in the next month, and exercised fewer hours per week. These results suggest that a larger trial of SmokeRx may be warranted and that more studies that assess the efficacy of herbal formulas are needed to provide valid data for non-nicotine smoking cessation options."

As assessed by repeated measure ANOVA, the 3-HC to cotinine ratio was stable in the Waitlist phase [coefficient of variation for 3 to 4 measurements, 38% (range, 5-110%)], whereas minor variation was noted in the Reduction phase [coefficient of variation for 3-5 measurements, 35% (range, 10-107%)].\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In nonreducing ad libitum smokers, the 3-HC to cotinine ratio was generally stable, whereas during smoking reduction using NRT, some small variation was detected. Although the current findings are suggestive of the stability of the 3-HC to cotinine ratio in a predominantly Caucasian sample smoking freely or reducing smoking with NRT, additional research is needed in more diverse populations."

            "abstract": "The current study attempted a rigorous test of the construct validity of a widely used self-report measure of dispositional mindfulness, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), within the context of an active controlled randomized trial (n = 130). The trial included three arms: mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an active control condition that did not include instruction in mindfulness meditation (Health Enhancement Program [HEP]), and a waitlist control condition. Partial evidence for the convergent validity of the FFMQ was shown in correlations at baseline between FFMQ facets and measures of psychological symptoms and psychological well-being. In addition, facets of the FFMQ were shown to increase over the course of an MBSR intervention relative to a waitlist control condition. However, the FFMQ failed to show discriminant validity. Specifically, facets of the FFMQ were shown to increase over the course of the HEP intervention relative to the waitlist control condition. MBSR and HEP, in contrast, did not differ in changes in FFMQ score over time. Implications of these findings for the measurement and theory of mindfulness and MBSR are discussed.

            "abstract": "The Internet is seen by many as a form of cyberspace or environment in which to interact and socialise. This research project drew from the data of a quantitative and qualitative study of gay men in Perth, Western Australia. We examined gay men's usage patterns of chat rooms and other social aspects of the Internet to meet sexual partners. We then reviewed in detail the meanings gay men have for the various Internet environments, and the range of friendship, relationship, casual, or esoteric sex-seeking goals. We argue that gay men view and engage with the Internet differently from how they view and engage with other more traditional gay spaces. This different approach influences how interaction between the men, either online or face-to-face, progresses and how assumptions and expectations are built. This has implications for how sexual health promotion interventions determine the appropriate role and relationship they have with these online social spaces."

Twenty-four healthy volunteers, not intending to quit smoking, were housed in an experimental unit during three 72-h conditions, consisting of either free smoking, enforced smoking cessation with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches, or enforced smoking cessation with placebo patches. The conditions were adhered to using a randomized crossover design, each separated by at least 10 days of washout. Patches, administered in a double-blind fashion, were given as nicotine (21 mg/24 h) and placebo every 24 h. Self-reported cigarette craving and withdrawal were assessed using multi-item scales at fixed intervals over each condition period.

During the placebo and NRT patch periods, craving intensity displayed a circadian rhythm, with craving levels lowest in the morning and peaking in the evening. Nicotine delivered via the patch had no impact on these circadian variations in craving.

            "abstract": "In this systematic review, we summarized and evaluated the evidence for effects of, and associations between, immersive nature-experience on mental, physical, and social health promotion outcomes. Immersive nature-experience was operationalized as non-competitive activities, both sedentary and active, occurring in natural environments removed from everyday environments. We defined health according to the World Health Organization's holistic and positive definition of health and included steady-state, intermediate, and health promotion outcomes. An electronic search was performed for Danish, English, German, Norwegian, and Swedish articles published between January 2004 and May 2017. Manual approaches, e.g., bibliographies from experts, supplemented the literature search. Data were extracted from 461 publications that met the inclusion criteria. To assess the status and quality of the evidence for health promotion effects of immersive nature-experience, we focused on the subset of studies based on controlled designs (n = 133). Outcome level quality of the evidence was assessed narratively. Interventions most often involved adventure-based activities, short-termed walking, and seated relaxation in natural environments. We found positive effects on a range of health promotion outcomes grouped under psychological wellbeing (n = 97; ≈55% positive; ≈13% mixed; ≈29% non-significant; 2% negative); psychosocial function (n = 67; ≈61% positive; ≈9% mixed; ≈30% non-significant); psychophysiological stress response (n = 50; ≈58% positive; ≈18% mixed; ≈24% non-significant), and cognitive performance (n = 36; ≈58% positive; ≈6% mixed; ≈33% non-significant; 3% negative); and social skills and relationships (n = 34; ≈70% positive; ≈7% mixed; ≈22% non-significant). Findings related to outcomes categorized under physical health, e.g., risk of cardiovascular disease, were less consistent (n = 51; ≈37% positive; ≈28% mixed; ≈35% non-significant). Across the types of interventions and outcomes, the quality of the evidence was deemed low and occasionally moderate. In the review, we identify, discuss, and present possible solutions to four core methodological challenges associated with investigating immersive nature-experience and health outcomes: (1) intervention and program complexity; (2) feasibility and desirability of randomization; (3) blinding of participants and researchers; and (4) transferability and generalizability. The results of the review have been published as a popular-scientific report and a scientific research overview, both in Danish language."

At a 12-month follow-up, 498 participants indicated whether they thought they received bupropion, placebo, or were not sure. Potential mediators of treatment effects on treatment arm guess (i.e., side effects, withdrawal, and mood) were measured during treatment, and 7-day point prevalence cessation was assessed at the end of treatment (EOT) and at 6 and 12 months after quit date. Overall, 55% of participants guessed their randomization correctly. Compared to guessing not sure, participants who guessed they were taking bupropion were more than twice as likely to have been randomized to bupropion. Similarly, participants who guessed placebo were twice as likely to have been randomized to placebo. Treatment arm guess was associated with quit rates. Including treatment arm guess with actual treatment arm in models of quit rates significantly reduced the odds ratio for bupropion efficacy at the EOT and at 6 and 12 months after quit date. There was no evidence for mediation. In bupropion smoking cessation trials, blind failure may occur and participant guess about treatment arm assignment is associated with quit rates."

Against this context, we conducted a content analysis of the journals, examining the nature of the 649 peer-reviewed publications in the same time period. Categories from the traditional bio-medical 'stages of research' models had to be adapted before full classification of articles published was feasible.

Findings support using such an instrument for evaluating intervention programs addressing nutrition behavior and for studies to determine the association of self-efficacy to dietary behavior or related constructs."

Each study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different multi-component nurse-led health promotion and disease prevention (HPDP) interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The nurse-led HPDP interventions were 6- or 12-month multi-component and evidence-based strategies targeting known risk factors for functional decline and frailty. Across the three studies, a common approach was used to measure the change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (SF-36) and the costs of use of health services (Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory) from baseline to the end of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The main lesson learned from the three studies is that nurse-led HPDP interventions for frail older home care clients provide greater improvements in HRQOL compared with usual home care. Such approaches are highly acceptable to this population and can be implemented using existing home care resources. Nurse-led HPDP interventions should include multiple home visits, multidimensional screening and assessment, multi-component evidence-based HPDP strategies, intensive case management, inter-professional collaboration, providers with geriatric training and experience, referral to and coordination of community services, and theory use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of the three trials underscore the need to reinvest in nurse-led HPDP interventions in home care to optimize HRQOL and promote ageing in place in the target population of frail older adults.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Nearly one-fifth of adults in the UK regularly smoke cigarettes. The ill-health associated with smoking costs the NHS over £3B every year. A number of pharmacological interventions are available that can help people to quit smoking. These include nicotinic receptor partial agonists such as varenicline or cytisine. Varenicline is a synthetic product licensed for use in the UK, while cytisine is derived naturally from the seeds of the plant Cytisus laborinum L. (golden rain acacia).\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To review the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and safety of cytisine from smoking cessation compared with varenicline; to develop an economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cytisine and varenicline; and to provide recommendations based on value of information analyses as to whether or not a head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline would represent effective use of resources.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Efficacy and adverse events data were sourced from a recent Cochrane review. These data were supplemented with an updated search of twelve electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library, for the period from December 2011 to January 2013. The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult smokers attempting to quit using varenicline or cytisine. Further interventions were considered (placebo, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion) to allow an indirect comparison between varenicline and cytisine. The primary outcome was abstinence at a minimum of 6 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes were common adverse events such as abnormal dreams, headache, nausea, insomnia and serious adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the clinical evidence was undertaken. A random-effects model was used to allow for heterogeneity between studies. The economic model structure was based on a published model. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to estimate the treatment expected to be most cost-effective given current information. Formal expected value of perfect information, perfect partial information and of sample information were performed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-three (RCTs) were included in the systematic review, comprising a total of 10,610 participants. Twenty-one trials of varenicline of differing dosing schedules and two trials of cytisine at standard dose met the inclusion criteria. No head-to-head trials comparing varenicline with cytisine were identified. The methodological quality of the studies was judged to be moderate to good. Cytisine was more efficacious than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 4.27, 95% credible interval (CrI) 2.05 to 10.05], as was standard-dose varenicline (HR 2.58, 95% Crl 2.16 to 3.15). Standard-dose varenicline treatment was associated with significantly higher rates of headache, insomnia and nausea than placebo; there was no significant difference in the rates of abnormal dreams. There were no significant differences in the rates of headache or nausea between cytisine and placebo; data were identified for neither abnormal dreams nor insomnia. Using expected values, cytisine is anticipated to dominate varenicline, in that it produces more quality-adjusted life-years at a lower associated cost. This occurred in approximately 90% of the scenarios performed. However, owing to the large number of people who wish to quit smoking (estimated to be 3 million over a 10-year period), the implications of making an incorrect decision is large. The expected value of sample information indicated that conducting a head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline was worthwhile, and that 1000 smokers per arm was an appropriate number to recruit.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of the evidence included in this review, varenicline and cytisine are both effective interventions to aid smoking cessation when compared with placebo. Cytisine is estimated to be both more clinically effective and cost-effective than varenicline. However, there is uncertainty in the decision, and a head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline would appear to be an effective use of resources.\n    \n\n\n          Study registration:\n        \n      \n      The study was registered as PROSPERO CRD42012003455.\n    \n\n\n          Funding details:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."

Missed preventive care is a particular problem for workers with low income and no health insurance. The costs of chronic diseases among workers--including health care costs, productivity losses, and employee turnover--have prompted employers to seek health promotion interventions that are both effective and cost-effective. The workplace offers 4 avenues for delivering preventive interventions: health insurance, workplace policies, health promotion programs, and communications. For each of the avenues, the evidence base describes a number of preventive interventions that are applicable to the workplace. On the basis of the evidence and of our work in Washington State, we present a public health approach to preventing chronic diseases via the workplace. In addition to relying on the evidence, this approach makes a compelling business case for preventive interventions to employers."

            "abstract": "The prevalence of smoking in methadone-maintained (MM) patients is over 80% and smoking-abstinence rates are strikingly low, even with the use of first-line smoking-cessation medications. Research has found that cigarettes increase the reinforcing properties of methadone; this interaction may be an additional, daily, challenge to smoking cessation in MM-smokers. This paper describes a novel approach in which patients who experience a particular barrier to achieving smoking abstinence are selected, and the impact of smoking-cessation medications on the identified barrier is evaluated. This is a 7-week, outpatient, randomized, within-subject, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with a follow-up visit at week 8. MM-smokers, who smoke ≥40% of their total daily cigarettes in the 4-h post-methadone-dosing period, as assessed with a Quitbit electronic cigarette lighter, will be recruited from a methadone program in Cincinnati, Ohio. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive four interventions (nicotine nasal spray (1mg per dose, up to 40 times per day), placebo nicotine nasal spray, varenicline (2mg/day), and varenicline placebo) in one of four orders to mitigate potential order effects. The primary outcome analysis will consist of two sets of statistical analyses, one comparing the effect of nicotine nasal spray to its placebo, and one comparing the effect of varenicline to its placebo, on the proportion of daily cigarettes smoked during the 4-h post-methadone-dosing period. This trial is of interest both as an efficient, precision-medicine-based approach to testing smoking-cessation interventions and as a specific strategy for identifying effective smoking-cessation treatment for MM-smokers."

Thirty basketball players of university level and above (both male and female) aged 18-28 years, who scored a minimum of 20 in state trait anxiety inventory, were randomly divided into three equal groups- Experimental (Biofeedback) group, Placebo group and Control (No Treatment) group. The BFB group received HRV BFB training for 10 consecutive days for 20 min that included breathing at individual's resonant frequency through a pacing stimulus; Placebo group was shown motivational video clips for 10 consecutive days for 10 min, whereas No Treatment Control group was not given any intervention. Two way repeated measure ANOVA was applied to analyze the differences within and between the groups. Anxiety, coping self-efficacy, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and performance (dribbling, passing and shooting) at session 1, 10 and 1 month follow up were statistically significant in each group along with interaction of group and time (p < 0.001).

Studies are restricted to only English or Thai.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria; 6 studies were randomized trial (RCT) evaluating variety of herbals. Three RCTs evaluated oral St. John's wort (SJW) extract (N=289), 2 RCTs evaluated oral mix-herbal tea (N=164), and 1 RCT evaluated inhaled aromatic black pepper (N=48). The other study was a non-randomized controlled trial evaluating oral SJW extract among 24 smokers. All interventions were given in a range of 1 week before starting the study and continued up to 14 weeks. Smoking cessation was measured with various methods including the number of cigarettes per day, abstinence rate, expired CO level, and urine cotinine level. Follow-up duration ranged from 3-h session to 6-months period. Evidences of SJW indicated low percentage in abstinence rate for smoking and its effectiveness was not significantly different from placebo. Studies of mix herbal tea showed a statistically significant effectiveness, compared to placebo, in reducing the number of cigarettes per day, craving scale, and total withdrawal scale but not urinary cotinine excretion. Essential oil of black pepper with a hollow plastic tube significantly reduced craving at 3-h session.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Evidence supporting the role of complementary medicines as an anti-smoking is limited. Further research in this field would benefit from the standardization of herbals products to implement on standard interventions and outcome measurement for smoking cessation."

            "abstract": "Rates of chronic diseases are high among Black South Africans but few studies have tested cognitive-behavioural health-promotion interventions to reduce this problem. We tested the efficacy of such an intervention among adolescents in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. We randomly selected 9 of 17 matched pairs of schools and randomised one school in each pair to the cognitive-behavioural health-promotion intervention designed to encourage health-related behaviours and the other to a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk-reduction intervention that served as the control. Interventions were based on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behaviour and qualitative data from the target population. Data collectors, blind to participants' intervention, administered confidential assessments at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Primary outcomes were fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity. Participants were 1057 grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.4 years), with 96.7% retained at 12-month follow-up. Generalised estimating equations revealed that averaged over the follow-ups, a greater percentage of health-promotion intervention participants than HIV/STD control participants met 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable and physical activity guidelines. The intervention also increased health-promotion knowledge, attitude and intention, but did not decrease substance use or substance-use attitude and intention. The findings suggest that theory based and contextually appropriate interventions may increase health behaviours among young adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa."

Relative to a wait-list control group, most memory measures showed significant gains for both self-help and group-based training, with no significant training condition differences, and these gains were maintained at follow-up. Belief measures showed that locus of control was significantly higher for the self-help and group-based training than the control group; memory self-efficacy significantly declined for controls, increased for group-trained participants, and remained constant in the self-help group.

Existing evidence shows that lack of funding, lack of properly trained workforce, as well as heavy workload on health care workers, are the most employed explanations for the limited number of health promotion interventions in the area. This paper presents the results of a descriptive study that pursues to render a comprehensive image of health promotion efforts undertaken in rural Transylvania, Romania. This descriptive analysis is conducted on data extracted from a larger dataset, obtained through a study which pursues a cross-sectional design, with a quantitative strategy of inquiry on access to health information in rural Transylvania. The instrument used for data collection is a questionnaire administered by telephone to a sample of medical doctors working in rural medical offices in the studied area (n = 226). Results show overall low rates of health promotion activities in the area, as well as low levels of collaboration with other local actors. In the context of behavioral risk factors, this study clearly shows the need of targeted health promotion activities in rural Transylvania in order to improve health outcomes and mitigate health disparities."

Recruited participants (N = 1010; 56% male; 69% African American) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions formed by crossing two intervention conditions (i.e., general health promotion vs. sexual risk reduction intervention) with two assessment conditions (i.e., general health vs. sexual health survey). After completing their assigned baseline assessment, participants received the assigned intervention, and returned for follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. In this report, we summarize baseline data, which show high levels of sexual risk behavior; alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use; and fast food consumption. Sexual risk behaviors and substance use were correlated. Participants reported high satisfaction with both interventions but ratings for the sexual risk reduction intervention were higher. Planned follow-up sessions, and subsequent analyses, will assess changes in health behaviors including sexual risk behaviors.

Research and health promotion around modifiable risk factors has produced only a small improvement in this situation since the mid-1990s. This paper reports on life story interviews, conducted between 2002 and 2004, with nineteen mothers of Maori infants who have died of SIDS. Potential participants were identified and accessed with the support of the national Maori SIDS Prevention Programme care-workers, in both urban and rural locations throughout both main islands of New Zealand. The paper articulates, in a thematic fashion, the bereaved mothers' experiences of alienation, marginalisation and exclusion, as a testimony of lives lived under conditions of serious deprivation in an affluent society. Constructing these experiences as non-modifiable risk factors hinders the development of policy and health promotion interventions that could improve the conditions in which Maori mothers live and raise their babies. It is argued that new approaches that target those whose lives are described here and build on the WHO Social Determinants of Health framework are vital to the efforts of New Zealanders to attain health equity and stem the tide of devastating and preventable loss of Maori babies to SIDS."

            "abstract": "The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development of social relationships and functional independence. As such, interventions that target the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functional decline and restore functioning to pre-illness levels. In this entirely remote study, people with recent-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of PRIME (personalized real-time intervention for motivational enhancement), a mobile-based digital health intervention designed to improve motivation and quality of life. Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline, post-trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks, WL participants received PRIME, resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME, participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post-trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post-trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure). Our results suggest that PRIME has the potential to be an effective mobile-based intervention for improving aspects of mood and motivation in young people with SSDs."

Transplant center practices toward smokers vary widely and evoke the classic tension between the ethical principles of justice and utility. We sought to assess current smoking policy variation in U.S. kidney, liver, and pancreas transplant centers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An online survey was sent to program directors of all United Network for Organ Sharing-approved solid abdominal organ transplant programs regarding their policies toward prior and current tobacco use.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Responses were received from 26% of kidney, 31% of liver, and 37% of pancreas transplant centers. Across organ programs, virtually all centers (97% to 100%) reported transplantations for former smokers, whereas 59% of kidney, 62% of liver, and 33% of pancreas programs reported transplantations for current smokers. Organ programs reported similar rates of having smoking cessation programs (74% to 77%) and performing serum cotinine testing (31% to 38%). Smoking was an absolute contraindication to transplantation at 38% of kidney, 15% of liver, and 50% of pancreas programs. Programs with absolute contraindication policies were less likely to perform transplantations in current smokers and more likely to check serum cotinine levels, but no more likely to have smoking cessation programs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is variation in tobacco use policies among abdominal organ transplant programs and centers. Balancing equity and justice when deciding which patients to waitlist requires an individualized approach to the tobacco-using patient, consideration of organ-specific factors, tobacco-related disease burden, and overall patient health. Such multifaceted assessments might be favorable to inflexible tobacco use policies."

Although a wide array of other compounds have also been investigated, their clinical effectiveness remains to be substantiated. Likewise, the utility of mechanical oral hygiene interventions and other oral health promotion measures such as topical application of salivary substitute, remains unsettled. Although many chemical agents contained in oral hygiene products have proven in vitro activity against oral yeast, their clinical effectiveness and potential role as adjuncts or alternative therapies to conventional treatment remains to be confirmed by further high-quality randomised controlled trials.

The aim of the present study was to use the startle probe paradigm and self-report measures of motivational change to assess the effectiveness of MI, compared to Prescriptive Advice (PA) and no treatment, in a sample of 53 smokers (28 male) who were not ready to quit smoking. After the intervention, the MI group reported increased motivation to change compared to both the PA and control groups. MI participants also had a potentiated startle reflex in response to tobacco-related pictures compared to the other two groups. These findings provide evidence that MI reverses the underlying motivational system activated by tobacco related cues."

The PEN-3 model, which frames culture in the context of health promotion interventions, was integrated with the Transtheoretical Model to guide this 13-week pre-test/post-test curriculum. Materials developed included soul food plate visuals, a micronutrient availability worksheet, a fruit stand, and gardening kits. Learning activities included affirmations, stories, case-scenarios, point-of-purchase product recognition, church health teams, and community health fairs. We investigated health-promoting dietary behaviors (consumption of more fruits and vegetables (F&V), serving more F&V to their families, and moderating dietary sodium and fat intakes), and biomedical behaviors (self-monitoring blood pressure and exercising) across five stages of change. Session attendance and program satisfaction were assessed. N = 102 women participated (mean age = 27.5 years). A majority (77%) reported adopting at least one healthy eating behavior (moderating sodium, serving more F&V to their families), 23% adopted at least two such behaviors (reading food labels for sodium; using culinary herbs/spices; serving more F&V to their families), and 45% adopted both dietary (moderating sodium; eating more fruits) and biomedical behaviors. Participants and facilitators favorably evaluated the curriculum and suggested improvements. A multi-conceptual approach coupled with cultural and biomedical tailoring has potential to promote young African American women's movement to more advanced stages of change and improve self-efficacy for fruit and vegetable intake, dietary sodium moderation, and self-monitoring blood pressure and physical activity."

Mobile health (mHealth) weight loss interventions can reduce chronic disease risks, but these are untested in Filipino Americans with T2D.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to assess feasibility and potential efficacy of a pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally adapted mHealth weight loss lifestyle intervention (Pilipino Americans Go4Health [PilAm Go4Health]) for overweight Filipino Americans with T2D.\n## METHODS\nThis was a 2-arm pilot RCT of the 3-month PilAm Go4Health intervention (phase 1) with an active waitlist control and 3-month follow-up (phase 2). The waitlist control received the PilAm Go4Health in phase 2, whereas the intervention group transitioned to the 3-month follow-up. PilAm Go4Health incorporated a Fitbit accelerometer, mobile app with diary for health behavior tracking (steps, food/calories, and weight), and social media (Facebook) for virtual social support, including 7 in-person monthly meetings. Filipino American adults ≥18 years with T2D were recruited from Northern California. Feasibility was measured by rates of recruitment, engagement, and retention. Multilevel regression analyses assessed within and between group differences for the secondary outcome of percent weight change and other outcomes of weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and steps.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 45 Filipino American adults were enrolled and randomized. Mean age was 58 (SD 10) years, 62% (28/45) were women, and mean BMI was 30.1 (SD 4.6). Participant retention and study completion were 100%, with both the intervention and waitlist group achieving near-perfect attendance at all 7 intervention office visits. Groups receiving the PilAm Go4Health in phase 1 (intervention group) and phase 2 (waitlist group) had significantly greater weight loss, -2.6% (-3.9 to -1.4) and -3.3% (-1.8 to -4.8), respectively, compared with the nonintervention group, resulting in a moderate to small effect sizes (d=0.53 and 0.37, respectively). In phase 1, 18% (4/22) of the intervention group achieved a 5% weight loss, whereas 82% (18/22) maintained or lost 2% to 5% of their weight and continued to maintain this weight loss in the 3-month follow-up. Other health outcomes, including waist circumference, BMI, and step counts, improved when each arm received the PilAm Go4Health, but the fasting glucose and HbA1c outcomes were mixed.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe PilAm Go4Health was feasible and demonstrated potential efficacy in reducing diabetes risks in overweight Filipino Americans with T2D. This study supports the use of mHealth and other promising intervention strategies to reduce obesity and diabetes risks in Filipino Americans. Further testing in a full-scale RCT is warranted. These findings may support intervention translation to reduce diabetes risks in other at-risk diverse populations.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT02290184; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02290184 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6vDfrvIPp).\n"

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Evidence that major depression can be a significant hindrance to smoking cessation prompted this examination of the usefulness of sertraline as a cessation aid for smokers with a history of major depression. Specifically, sertraline's efficacy for smoking abstinence and its effects on withdrawal symptoms were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The study design included a 1-week placebo washout, a 9-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase followed by a 9-day taper period, and a 6-month drug-free follow-up. One hundred thirty-four smokers with a history of major depression were randomly assigned to receive sertraline (N=68) or matching placebo (N=66); all received intensive individual cessation counseling during nine clinic visits.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sertraline treatment produced a lower total withdrawal symptom score and less irritability, anxiety, craving, and restlessness than placebo. However, the abstinence rates did not significantly differ between treatment groups: 28.8% (19 of 66) for placebo and 33.8% (23 of 68) for sertraline at the end of treatment and 16.7% (11 of 66) for placebo and 11.8% (eight of 68) for sertraline at the 6-month follow-up. No moderating effects of single or recurrent major depression, depressed mood at baseline, nicotine dependence level, or gender were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Sertraline did not add to the efficacy of an intensive individual counseling program in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. However, given that the end-of-treatment abstinence rate for the placebo group was much higher than expected, it is unclear whether a ceiling effect of the high level of psychological intervention received by all subjects prevented an adequate test of sertraline."

            "abstract": "Distress intolerance is a key vulnerability factor implicated in the maintenance and relapse of cigarette smoking. Yet, past work has not examined changes in these processes during smoking cessation treatment or their relation to smoking cessation outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of two smoking cessation interventions on changes in self-report and behavioral distress intolerance indices during treatment, and whether these changes are associated with smoking cessation outcomes. Treatment-seeking smokers (N = 384) were randomly assigned to one of two 4-session smoking cessation treatment programs: Standard Cessation Program (SCP) or Smoking Treatment and Anxiety Management Program (STAMP). Quit dates were scheduled to coincide with the final treatment session. Physical domains of distress intolerance were assessed at baseline and at each weekly session, via the Discomfort Intolerance Scale (DIS; higher scores indicate more intolerance for discomfort) and Breath Holding Duration Task (shorter durations indicate more intolerance for respiratory distress). The STAMP condition produced a greater rate of reduction in DIS scores than did the SCP condition. Changes in DIS scores during treatment mediated the effect of STAMP treatment on 7-day point prevalence abstinence at Month 3 post-quit attempt. There were no treatment conditions differences in changes in Breath-Holding duration. Data suggest self-reported distress intolerance is malleable in the context of stress sensitivity reduction treatment, but not standard smoking cessation treatment, and such reductions may result in promotion of smoking abstinence."

The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewers' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT."

Economic evaluations of potentially effective treatments for FM are needed. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-utility of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with FM compared to an adjuvant multicomponent intervention (\"FibroQoL\") and to TAU. We performed an economic evaluation alongside a 12 month, randomized, controlled trial; data from 204 (68 per study arm) of the 225 patients (90.1%) were included in the cost-utility analyses, which were conducted both under the government and the public healthcare system perspectives. The main outcome measures were the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) for assessing Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and improvements in health-related quality of life, and the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) for estimating direct and indirect costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated. Two sensitivity analyses (intention-to-treat, ITT, and per protocol, PPA) were conducted. The results indicated that MBSR achieved a significant reduction in costs compared to the other study arms (p < 0.05 in the completers sample), especially in terms of indirect costs and primary healthcare services. It also produced a significant incremental effect compared to TAU in the ITT sample (ΔQALYs = 0.053, p < 0.05, where QALYs represents quality-adjusted life years). Overall, our findings support the efficiency of MBSR over FibroQoL and TAU specifically within a Spanish public healthcare context."

            "abstract": "The predominating way to stop smoking is to do it abruptly. At every given time, the large majority of smokers are not motivated or willing to try and give up. Some smokers are entirely happy with their smoking, a larger group would like to smoke less and a third group wants to quit. With the abrupt quitting message we are only addressing those wanting to quit. Maybe not even all, since some of them may have tried many times already and learned that they cannot quit abruptly. They may have given up on giving up. Some interesting results are given in recent studies that have recruited smokers not motivated to quit but interested in reducing their smoking. From nine randomized placebo-controlled trials where smokers were given behavioural support and pharmacological assistance, motivation to quit seemed to have increased, and in each trial, a proportion of these unmotivated smokers gave up smoking. It is suggested that for smokers unable or not interested in giving up abruptly, a softer and more gradual approach should be considered. Such an approach may bring new smokers into treatment, produce more people wanting to quit and improve public health."

Selected articles listed as a main goal primary prevention of one of four index conditions; were carried out within a US city; included sufficient information to characterize the intervention; and organized at least 25% of its activities within a community setting. In general, programs reached a diverse population of low-income city residents in a variety of settings, employed multiple strategies, and recognized at least some of the principles of effective health promotion.

The growth of financial power of general practitioners makes them key decision-makers in planning and delivering health promotion. The vast majority of people in contact with their family doctor could benefit from making appropriate lifestyle modifications. However, the level and quality of health promotion activity in primary care is variable, with many patients not receiving interventions. A review of research indicates that both skepticism about the relationship between behaviour and risk factor, and lack of confidence in efficacy of health promotion in changing patient behaviour act as barriers to general practitioners taking on more health promotion activity. For prevention work to increase, therefore, general practitioners require more evidence of effective replicable interventions, and appropriate training on the design and implementation of programmes. The role of the Health Education Authority, the national agency for health promotion in England, in meeting these needs is described. The paper also includes a brief discussion of evaluation methods for assessing the success of health promotion interventions."

            "abstract": "Given high rates of smoking among cancer patients, smoking cessation treatment is crucial; yet limited data exist to guide integration of such trials into the oncologic context. In order to determine the feasibility of conducting smoking cessation clinical trials with cancer patients, screening and baseline data from a large randomized placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trial were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to compare enrollees to decliners, describe program enrollees, and assess correlates of confidence in quitting smoking. Out of 14,514 screened patients, 263 (<2%) were eligible; 43 (16%) refused enrollment. Among the eligible patients, 220 (84%) enrolled. Enrollment barriers included smoking rate, medical history/contraindicated medication, lack of interest, and language. Compared to enrollees, decliners were more likely to have advanced cancer. The trial enrolled a sample of 67 (>30%) African Americans; participants had extensive smoking histories; many were highly nicotine dependent; and participants consumed about seven alcoholic beverages/week on average. Head and neck and breast cancer were the most common tumors. About 52 (25%) reported depressive symptoms. A higher level of confidence to quit smoking was related to lower depression and lower tumor stage. Integrating a smoking cessation clinical trial into the oncologic setting is challenging, yet feasible. Recruitment strategies are needed for patients with advanced disease and specific cancers. Once enrolled, addressing participant's depressive symptoms is critical for promoting cessation."

This study examined the effects of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, on acute physiological and subjective effects of intravenous nicotine and on tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Five female and four male smokers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Following overnight abstinence from smoking, subjects were treated orally with a single 100- or 200-mg dose of labetalol or placebo in each of three experimental sessions. Two hours after the medication treatment, subjects received an intravenous injection of 15 microg/kg nicotine. The nicotine-induced increases in heart rate were attenuated with the high dose of labetalol. No treatment effects were found for systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes. For the subjective effects of nicotine, treatment with both high and low doses of labetalol enhanced the ratings of \"head rush\" and \"drug strength.\" The attenuation of tobacco withdrawal symptoms following intravenous nicotine administration was significantly greater with high-dose labetalol treatment, compared with placebo. These results support the proposed role of adrenergic receptors in nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The utility of adrenergic blockers, in combination with nicotine replacement therapies, for smoking cessation needs to be examined further in controlled clinical trials."

Cure rates for pediatric cancers now exceed 60% and, by the year 2000, an estimated 1 of every 1,000 young adults will be a cancer survivor. Because this population is at increased risk for late medical and neoplastic complications that impact adversely on health-related quality of life, it is important to investigate methods to promote risk reduction by motivating survivors to practice health-promoting behaviors. With this background, we initiated a prospective, randomized, controlled feasibility study in which survivors attending a long-term follow-up clinic were randomized to receive standard care or standard care plus an educational intervention. Our objectives were to determine if the intervention would improve the survivors' knowledge about their cancer treatment and risks of late effects and increase their practice of health-protective behaviors. Since July 1995, 272 of 318 families (86%) approached about the study agreed to participate. Of these, 266 are evaluable for assessment of baseline knowledge and health behaviors. Demographic features, baseline knowledge, health perceptions and health behaviors did not differ among randomized groups. Assessment of the intervention's efficacy at changing health behaviors of survivors randomized to the intervention group will be available when the 1-year follow-up evaluations are completed for the study cohort. Our preliminary experience with this pilot study supports the feasibility of educational intervention research in a specialty clinic dedicated to monitoring long-term childhood cancer survivors. Int.

Health promotion initiatives to combat this negative development requires as a first step identifying the magnitude of the different risk factors. A survey was conducted in 2007-08 with two Danish shipping companies on seafarers' health, wellbeing, diet, smoking and physical activity. In addition, a health profile was offered to the respondents, consisting of physiological measurements, such as fitness rating, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol measurement and blood pressure. The response rate in the questionnaire study was 57% (n = 360) of which 76% (n = 272) of the respondents received a health profile. Results (males) showed 44% daily smokers compared with 32% in the general Danish adult male population. Twenty-five percent of the seafarers were obese with a BMI > 30 compared with 12% of the Danish adult male population. Fifty-one percent of the respondents were defined as having metabolic syndrome, compared with 20% of the Danish adult male population. Seafaring is a risky occupation when looking at the seafarers' health and wellbeing. The results of this survey confirm the need for health promotion interventions such as smoking cessation courses, healthy cooking courses and physical exercise programs, etc. that can enable healthier lifestyle.

            "abstract": "During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in societal interest in preventing disability and death in the United States by changing individual behaviors linked to the risk of contracting chronic diseases. This renewed interest in health promotion and disease prevention has not been without its critics. Some critics have accused proponents of life-style interventions of promoting a victim-blaming ideology by neglecting the importance of social influences on health and disease. This article proposes an ecological model for health promotion which focuses attention on both individual and social environmental factors as targets for health promotion interventions. It addresses the importance of interventions directed at changing interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy, factors which support and maintain unhealthy behaviors. The model assumes that appropriate changes in the social environment will produce changes in individuals, and that the support of individuals in the population is essential for implementing environmental changes."

The significant short-term effect was lost with the random-effects model for pooling, or by removing the outlying study that led to heterogeneity. The long-term result shows no effect of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture. There was no consistent evidence that acupuncture is superior to no treatment, and no evidence that the effect of acupuncture was different from that of other anti-smoking interventions, or that any particular acupuncture technique is superior to other techniques.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is no consistent evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation are effective for smoking cessation, but methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn.

A total of 1804 Mexican-American women were interviewed as part of a community survey. Multiple regression results indicate that demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, level of acculturation and health insurance were associated with the total number of Pap smears reported for the 5 years prior to the interview. Pap smear beliefs were the strongest predictor of repeated screening, while global beliefs about cancer did not significantly explain the results. Health promotion interventions should take into consideration the cultural and psychosocial needs of Mexican-American women, placing emphasis on their specific screening-related beliefs, if they are to succeed in promoting repeated compliance with Pap smear screening guidelines."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, fluctuations in symptoms commonly occur after many years of dopamine replacement therapy. The so-called wearing-off phenomenon exists of both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as rigidity and anxiety. Current treatment options are limited and an integrated approach is needed to address the complex interactions between motor and non-motor symptoms. Since wearing-off is eventually inevitable, treatment needs to focus on coping, acceptance and self-efficacy. We developed the body awareness training, named BEWARE, combining physical therapy with acceptance and commitment therapy to help PD patients deal better with wearing-off related anxiety (WRA).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was an investigator-blinded randomized controlled trial. Forty PD patients with WRA were randomly assigned to the BEWARE or to the treatment as usual (TAU) condition.

In a randomized controlled trial across two sites (University of California, San Francisco, and University of California, Berkeley), 199 children between the ages of 7 and 11 were randomized to the Child Life and Attention Skills (CLAS; n = 74) program, parent-focused treatment (PFT; n = 74), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 51). Parents reported on self-efficacy, cognitive errors, positive parenting, and negative parenting prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and in the next school year at follow-up. Compared to TAU, CLAS and PFT had higher posttreatment parenting self-efficacy, and CLAS alone had lower posttreatment parent cognitive errors. At follow-up, only CLAS had improved parent cognitive errors compared to TAU. No other between-group differences were found in parenting self-efficacy or cognitive errors. Improved parenting self-efficacy was associated with improved posttreatment negative parenting outcomes for PFT and CLAS, and improved parent cognitive errors were also related to improvements in positive and negative posttreatment parenting outcomes for CLAS. Posttreatment parenting self-efficacy mediated follow-up negative parenting outcomes for CLAS and posttreatment parent cognitive errors mediated improved follow-up positive and negative parenting outcomes for CLAS. PFT and CLAS led to enhanced parenting self-efficacy, and CLAS appears especially robust in improving parent cognitive errors both in the short and long term. Pathways provide support for the possibility of parent cognitions as mediators of treatment effects on parenting; clinical focus on such cognitions may be useful."

We used a mixed-methods approach to assess collaborative relationships between multiple government sectors and civil society and to suggest possible health promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the urban poor in deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in health promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods. Participants included stakeholders working for or engaging in governments (3), public health care institutions (5), social service providers (3), community-based organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based organisations (3). We conducted semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and then collected survey data. Quantitative data were analysed using social network analysis, and qualitative data were analysed through iterative and consensus processes. The social network analysis indicated that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and controlling informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and communication, (2) need of a coalition with a committed leading actor for future collaboration and (3) organisational and political silos within and across public sectors. Increased understanding of the current status of and challenges to collaboration can inform the planning and implementation of complex intervening strategies and policies tailored to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods. Community-led collaborative actions empower people in marginalised communities to envision a healthier community."

            "abstract": "In the context of the biopsychosocial pain concept and on the basis of empirical evidence those cognitive traits and mechanisms are described that have reliably been found to be potent moderators of pain and disability. Expectations of patients which result in placebo or nocebo effects as well as more complex belief patterns influence subjective pain severity as well as disability. Especially beliefs which relate to self-control, self-efficacy or its counterpart helplessness can distinctly moderate pain, lead to an increase or mitigation of pain intensity and associated disability. The impact of most of these cognitive factors, such as catastrophizing, low self-efficacy, certain pain beliefs, low acceptance or fear of pain can be integrated into the general stress coping model. It denominates situational appraisal and self-appraisal processes beside actual coping behaviors as the main psychological factors influencing severity of pain and related disability."

Depression may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, and smoking cessation sometimes precipitates depression. In some individuals, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking. Antidepressants may substitute for this effect.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long-term smoking cessation. The drugs include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; selegiline; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in December 2002.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant drugs to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation.

The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      There was one trial each of moclobemide, sertraline and venlafaxine, two of fluoxetine, five of nortriptyline, and twenty trials of bupropion.

Nortriptyline (five trials, OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.81 - 4.32) and bupropion (16 trials, OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.67 - 2.34) both increased the odds of cessation. In one trial the combination of bupropion and nicotine patch produced slightly higher quit rates than patch alone, but this was not replicated in a second study. Two trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation have failed to detect a long-term benefit.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline can aid smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not."

However, better measures are needed to improve understanding of this relationship and the mechanisms at play, as well as to evaluate health promotion interventions. Wearable accelerometers are considered as the standard for assessing physical activity in research, but do not perform well for assessing posture (i.e., sitting vs. standing), a critical component of sedentary behavior. The machine learning algorithms that we propose for assessing sedentary behavior will allow us to re-examine existing accelerometer data to better understand the association between sedentary time and health in various populations. We collected two datasets, a laboratory-controlled dataset and a free-living dataset. We trained machine learning classifiers separately on each dataset and compared performance across datasets. The classifiers predict five postures: sit, stand, sit-stand, stand-sit, and stand\\walk. We compared a manually constructed Hidden Markov model (HMM) with an automated HMM from existing software. The manually constructed HMM gave more F1-Macro score on both datasets."

Participants in both groups received emails on a tapered schedule over 6 months to alert them to new content on the website. The primary outcome was minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at 6 months as measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall; activity was also measured by accelerometers. Data were collected between 2011 and 2014 and analyzed in 2015 at the University of California, San Diego.\n## RESULTS\nIncreases in minutes/week of MVPA were significantly greater in the Intervention Group compared to the Control Group (mean difference = 50.00, SE = 9.5, p < 0.01). Increases in objectively measured MVPA were also significantly larger in the Intervention Group (mean differences = 31.0, SE = 10.7, p < .01).

The goals of this study were 1) to understand the results of a randomized clinical trial - Qigong and Exercise Therapy for Elderly Patients with Chronic Neck Pain (QIBANE) - that showed no difference between qigong, exercise therapy, and no-treatment on quality of life, and 2) to understand how elderly individuals with chronic pain experience interventions of qigong and exercise therapy. A qualitative interview study was conducted with 20 QIBANE participants. Interviews asked about motivation for and expectations of trial participation, experiences with the exercise classes (qigong or exercise therapy), and changes in pain experience. Interviews were transcribed, entered into the software program ATLAS.ti, and coded thematically by two coders. Content analysis was performed. All interviewees reflected positively on their QIBANE experience and described their participation in QIBANE as helpful. However, what was discussed in both groups when they talked about \"positive experiences\" in the study differed between the two groups. For example, themes that emerged in the exercise-therapy group related to difficulties associated with aging and staying physically active. In the interviews with qigong group members, emergent themes related to qigong as a method that improved bodily experiences and influenced daily activities. The effects that exercise therapy and qigong have on an elderly population cannot be captured by health-related quality-of-life measurements, such as the Short Form (36) Health Survey. Broader concepts of quality of life that include the concepts of self-efficacy and positive affect may be more appropriate. The results presented in this study suggest that for this population group, the approach of patient-centered outcomes is especially pertinent in order to design meaningful intervention studies in the elderly. This means that research questions, interventions, and outcome measurements need to take into account the special situation of elderly people."

Results: Mixed-model analysis of variances (ANOVAs) revealed significant increases in life satisfaction (Main effect: F(3, 91.71) = 4.63, p < 0.01) and self-efficacy (Main effect: F(3, 91.32) = 4.05, p < 0.01) as well as significant decreases in negative affect (Main effect: F(2, 75.88) = 5.24, p < 0.01) and loneliness (Main effect: F(2, 71.78) = 7.49, p < 0.01) in both interventions at pre-, mid-, post-intervention and follow-up. The group x time interactions were not significant, suggesting that the PA and BA interventions had comparable effects over time. Conclusion: These findings provide insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of guided self-help PA and BA interventions on depressive symptoms."

            "abstract": "This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of text messaging-based health promotion interventions. Nineteen randomized controlled trials conducted in 13 countries met inclusion criteria and were coded on a variety of participant, intervention, and methodological moderators. Meta-analytic procedures were used to compute and aggregate effect sizes. The overall weighted mean effect size representing the impact of these interventions on health outcomes was d = .329 (95% CI = .274, .385; p < .001). This effect size was statistically heterogeneous (Q18 = 55.60, p < .001, I(2) = 67.62), and several variables significantly moderated the effects of interventions. Smoking cessation and physical activity interventions were more successful than interventions targeting other health outcomes. Message tailoring and personalization were significantly associated with greater intervention efficacy. No significant differences were found between text-only interventions and interventions that included texting plus other components. Interventions that used an individualized or decreasing frequency of messages over the course of the intervention were more successful than interventions that used a fixed message frequency. We discuss implications of these results for health promotion interventions that use text messaging."

            "abstract": "There are a lot of methods for smoking cessation but transdermal nicotine system (TNS) is one of the most popular. On a sample of more than 300 smokers we have formerly shown that TNS achieves higher abstinence rate than placebo (38%:21%). In the present study we have tested the optimal administration of TNS. 160 smokers were subdivided in 4 groups of 40, receiving either TNS or placebo, for 3 or 6 weeks. The abstinence rate was evaluated by appropriate questionnaires and measuring CO in the exhaled air. After 3 weeks of TNS 60% of the examinees were abstaining compared to 50% after 6 weeks; the abstinence rates in the placebo groups were 17.5% and 20%, respectively (p < 0.05). Short TNS treatment (3 weeks) is at least as effective as a longer one (6 weeks), which is relevant both medically and economically."

Migrant children are a vulnerable population that seem to have inadequate health promotion interventions, and limited studies have assessed their health status and personal hygiene at schools. This study aimed to evaluate school health promotion and health outcomes of migrant children in Thai public schools (TPSs) and migrant learning centers (MLCs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was applied. Data were collected from questionnaires focusing on health care access, nutritional status, and personal hygiene of migrant children in two MLCs and four TPSs, along with Thai children in the same TPSs. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression model were used to compare access to health promotion and the health status of migrant children with the Thai counterparts.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Blended school health services were generally found in TPSs, which led to indifferent vaccination rates between Thai and migrant children in TPSs (odds ratio [OR] 0.457 (0.186-1.120)). However, vaccination rates of migrant children in MLCs are noticeably around fourfold lower. Overall, migrant children received fewer dental health services than Thai children, both in TPSs (OR 0.198 (0.076,0.517)) and MLCs (OR 0.156 (0.004,0.055)). Other personal hygiene behaviors and nutritional statuses saw no significant difference between Thai children and migrant children in either TPSs or MLCs. The uninsured status among migrant children posed another challenge to health care access, as 81.7% of the migrant children in MLCs and 56.6% in TPSs were uninsured.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Migrant children in MLCs received a lower rate of essential vaccinations compared to those in TPSs. Dental services appeared to be the most neglected area of care in migrant children. The findings indicate the necessity of supportive policy for MLCs, while regulating quality and standards concurrently.

This linear type of relation between research and policy needs to be replaced by a more interactive model that facilitates both researchers obtaining a better understanding of policy processes and policymakers being more aware and involved in the conceptualisation and conduct of research. This paper explores the role of governance in facilitating the research-policy nexus, testing a typology of research utilisation based on Murray's (Soc Policy Society 10(4):459-70, 2011) analysis that considers various degrees of researcher-policymaker deliberation in decision-making processes. The projects were all part of various evaluation efforts carried out by the researchers to explore the use of governance in health promotion activities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Three case studies were chosen to provide some specific examples that illustrate each level of Murray's typology. The examples involve intersectoral health promotion collaborations that combine evidence-based research in health policy initiatives with various levels of researcher involvement. For all three projects, interview data was collated in the same way, coded thematically and analysed to consider the relationship between researchers and policymakers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Comparing the three models and their applicability to health promotion interventions, it could be observed that all programmes demonstrated successful examples of research translation. Strong governance imperatives structuring relationships led to more successful outcomes, whereby research was successfully translated into a public policy initiative that also led to improved health outcomes. The key idea across all of these models was that strong governance arrangements mitigated some of the barriers evidenced by the varying degrees of deliberation and researcher involvement in processes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The paper demonstrates that successful research utilisation is related to strong governance agendas and that early and ongoing involvement of relevant decision-makers and researchers in the governance processes, that is both the conceptualisation and conduct of a study, tend to be the best predictors of success."

Treatment was continued for up to 1 yr. One day after quitting smoking, the average number of daily doses was 11 in the group assigned NNS and 14 in the group assigned the placebo, and after 6 weeks, 14 and 6 doses, respectively, among abstinent participants still using spray. After 3 months, 65% of the abstainers in the nicotine group were still using the NNS.

Many chronically ill persons adjust over time to their illnesses; however, there remains a small but important group of those less adjusted, who are concentrated in specialty clinics and are high users of health care resources. This randomized clinical trial investigated the impact of health promotion interventions in the form of problem-solving counseling or phone support that augmented conventional clinic medical care. Chronically ill, poorly adjusted outpatients (n = 293) attending clinics were randomly assigned to receive additional problem-solving counseling, phone call support, or neither. Psychosocial adjustment to illness, utilization, and expenditures of health services were the main outcomes measured. There were no overall significant differences between groups in their change in psychosocial adjustment and expenditures for health and social care. However, interaction analyses (P < 0.05) gave an indication of who might benefit from these interventions. Those who lived alone and infrequently used problem-solving behaviors to cope with their illness significantly improved their adjustment to illness and had fewer health service expenditures if they received problem-solving counseling. Supportive telephone calls were most effective for those who lived with someone and frequently used problem-solving coping behaviors. These findings suggest that health promotion services should be targeted to outpatients described by specific social support and coping characteristics."

Eleven focus groups were conducted (eight involving older adults, three involving professionals), each discussing a wide range of issues related to determinants of health and quality of life. The most salient themes were health and independence, financial security, social integration, health care services, housing, accessibility of community services, and decision-making power. Older adults' and professionals' comments strongly converged, with specific issues also raised by each. Older adults provided the richest and most in-depth data on intrapersonal factors, such as personal growth, personal qualities, and spirituality. Professionals discussed community environment issues in greater depth. Health promotion interventions to maximize older adults' quality of life are needed. These results contribute to building a knowledge base to guide such efforts, by identifying a variety of possible intervention sectors for future programs."

            "title": "Varenicline: a novel pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.",
            "abstract": "Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries. Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified. In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 1 mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150 mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators. In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 1 mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation. Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation."

            "abstract": "There is a lack of health promotion for the elderly residing in long-term care facilities. It becomes imperative therefore for the nursing profession to readjust its thinking and practice to include health promotion strategies and interventions for institutionalized elderly in the long-term care sector. From using the empowerment theory in the discussion it is clear that nurses can help the elderly receive health promotion strategies and interventions to help the older person make informed choices about their lifestyle, health and treatment. The elderly population continues to grow and more than likely will spend some part of their life in a long-term care setting. Evidence from studies performed by Robertson (1991), Caserta (1995), Phillips (1994) and McBride (2000) suggests that health promotion efforts positively correlate with improved physical and psychological elements of health for the elderly. Nurses largely determine the kind of care that is given and thus can influence the quality of life that elderly client's experience. By advocating for health promotion interventions and strategies for their elderly clients, nurses are demonstrating to the community, their patients, and institution that nurses do have the power to make and influence change for the better. Nurses advocating for health promotion for their elderly patients not only empower choice, but also create an active and involved elderly population. Health promotion exists at all stages of life and does not cease when one is admitted to a long-term care facility (Hutchings, 1999; McBride, 2000)."

Research suggests that Black adults engage in fewer health-promoting behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy eating) than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. These health-promoting behaviors are known protective factors against overweight/obesity and related health concerns. This community-based participatory research study employed a waitlist control design and a university-church partnership approach to test the impact of a church-based health-empowerment program designed to increase health-promoting behaviors (called health-smart behaviors) and improve health indicators (e.g., reduce weight) among overweight/obese Black adult churchgoers. Results indicate that the intervention group (n = 37) experienced a significant increase in levels of healthy eating and physical activity and a significant decrease in weight compared to the waitlist control group (n = 33).

            "abstract": "Nicotine patches are commonly used by people who try to quit smoking. Because high doses of nicotine may increase heart rate and potentiate cardiac arrhythmia or ischemia, its use in patients with coronary artery disease was investigated. The objective was to assess the cardiovascular safety of nicotine patches in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who try to quit smoking. The study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized fashion over a 2-week period. One hundred and six patients with CAD who wished to stop smoking and were taking part in a smoking cessation program were included. Fifty-two patients received nicotine patches (Nicotinell) and 54 received placebo patches. The cardiovascular effects of nicotine patches were assessed by repeated ambulatory ECG monitoring (AEM) and exercise testing. There were no changes in the resting heart rate and in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure between the screening and the two phases of the study in both the Nicotinell and placebo groups. Repeated 48-hour AEM revealed that there were no significant changes in the number and duration of ischemic episodes in both groups. There was no change in the frequency of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Exercise duration and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression increased in both groups during the double-blind treatment phase. More patients in the Nicotinell group claimed tobacco abstinence compared with the placebo group (27% vs. 13%). The use of nicotine patches did not cause aggravation of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia in coronary patients and therefore can be used as a method to promote smoking cessation in this high-risk group."

Higher costs in the NRT group were mainly attributable to the cost of NRT patches (mean = £46.07).

Enforcement of the ban needs to be strengthened in discotheques and at the workplace and in outdoor smoking premises. In covered outdoor areas set up for smokers in winter, passive smoking exposure is high.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      A Cochrane review conducted in 2005 on workplace smoking bans did not conclude that bans helped employees to quit, while another review found that totally smoke-free workplaces are associated with a 3.8% reduction in smoking prevalence, and 3.1 fewer cigarettes smoked per person per day.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Workplaces are ideal settings for health promotion, since it is feasible to organize individual interventions, such as counselling, combined with environmental measures (e.g., smoking bans) in order to support behavioural changes in employees. It is difficult to evaluate these complex interventions using standard evaluation methods such as cluster randomized controlled trials.

            "abstract": "Several studies have documented the effectiveness of bupropion for smoking cessation, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which it facilitates abstinence. In this placebo-controlled randomized trial. We examined whether bupropion's effects on cessation were mediated by changes in withdrawal and/or negative or positive affect (PA). Two hundred and fifty-one smokers received 10-week treatment with bupropion or placebo, plus behavioral counseling. Changes in affect and withdrawal symptoms from pre-quit to 1 week post quit were examined as mediating variables in structural equation models. Cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence cessation rates at the end of treatment (8-weeks post quit date) were 48% for bupropion and 29% for placebo (P=0.001). There were significant treatment effects on withdrawal and negative affect (NA); however, only change in NA predicted cessation. In a path model, change in NA was a significant mediator of bupropion's effects on cessation. However, the proportion of variance accounted for by this mediator was small, suggesting that other unmeasured factors play an important role. Laboratory-based paradigms may be useful to identify other mediators of bupropion's effects, thereby pointing to mechanisms of effect that can be bolstered in future treatment studies."

The aims of this article are to define the systematic stages we used to develop an effective health promotion intervention via the products (e.g. images and stories) of Photovoice. We designed an intervention to improve HIV adherence knowledge, attitudes, and communication with providers through Photovoice. 16 PL-HIV used Photovoice strategies to describe their experiences with medication via images and captions and create an intervention (10 adherence promotion posters) that integrated photo-stories of their adherence motivators, journeys from sickness to health, and how they manage and counter HIV stigma. We outline the systematic process we used to adapt Photovoice to create the effective intervention for replication. The process included six stages: (i) identify scope of the project; (ii) create collaborative project team; (iii) design project materials; (iv) review and revise materials with team members; (v) disseminate materials; and (vi) evaluate materials. Photovoice is used traditionally as a social action research method. In this project, it was adapted to create patient-driven images and stories for health promotion posters. Poster viewers experienced improved self-efficacy for HIV medication adherence. Describing the adaptation of the Photovoice process in a deliberate and transparent way can support fidelity to the essence of the participant-driven method, while also allowing researchers and practitioners to replicate Photovoice as a successful health promotion intervention."

Thus, we need to reflect on intervention development processes that use different types of theories and evidence. In this paper, we provide a reflective discussion on how we identified evidence-based behavior change techniques and counseling themes for a health promotion intervention. In addition, we discuss the challenges that we encountered and what we learned during the process: a) a lack of previous research and meta-analyses, b) inconsistencies in evidence, c) integrating evidence and theories that have different starting points, and d) collaborating with researchers who represent different evidence and theories. During the process, we benefitted from having the clear goal of conducting evidence- and theory-based work. We solved the challenges by, for example, utilizing different types of evidence and being reflective about the reasons behind any inconsistencies in the evidence. In retrospect, we would have benefitted from closer collaboration between the teams that worked separately with different evidence. These kinds of reflective descriptions of development processes and the challenges encountered during them may help other researchers and professionals avoid encountering the same challenges."

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in summer 2015. A 12-week bicycling intervention was implemented at two sites with low-income, overweight, or obese Latino and African American adults. We found that randomized controlled trial methodology was suboptimal for use in this small pilot study and that it negatively affected participation.

The degree to which drama contemplation leads to cognitive changes (increased processing, self-compassion and emotional self-efficacy) and improved well-being was examined in the present research. An experiment was conducted in which young adults (n = 148) were randomly assigned to experience and write reflectively on (i) drama via Hollywood movie clips, (ii) drama via scripts or (iii) to perform a control task. Writing content was analyzed for word use. At baseline and 4-week follow-up measures, participants self-reported self-compassion, emotional self-efficacy, physical symptoms, general health, depressed mood and anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, indirect effects of drama contemplation were found. Tragic drama exposure was associated with word use indicative of increased cognitive processing. The use of greater insight words was related to increased emotional self-efficacy, which in turn was associated with improved psychological and general health, whereas discrepancy word use was associated with increased self-compassion, which was in turn linked to better psychological well-being. Conversely, greater use of causation and certainty words was associated with a marginal decrease in self-compassion and psychological well-being. The persistence of drama has long been related to its capacity to enhance individuals' understanding of the human condition. This study helps explain the connection between reflecting on drama and benefits to self-regulation and health.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Smokers need effective support to maximise the chances of successful quit attempts. Current smoking cessation medications, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline, have been shown to be effective in clinical trials but are underused by smokers attempting to quit due to adverse effects, contraindications, low acceptability and/or high cost. Cytisine is a low-cost, plant-based alkaloid that has been sold as a smoking cessation aid in Eastern Europe for 50 years. A systematic review of trial evidence suggests that cytisine has a positive impact on both short- and long-term abstinence rates compared to placebo. However, the quality of the evidence is poor and insufficient for licensing purposes in many Western countries. A large, well-conducted placebo-controlled trial (n = 740) of cytisine for smoking cessation has recently been published and confirms the findings of earlier studies, with 12-month continuous abstinence rates of 8.4% in the cytisine group compared to 2.4% in the placebo group (Relative risk = 3.4, 95% confidence intervals 1.7-7.1). No research has yet been undertaken to determine the effectiveness of cytisine relative to that of NRT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A single-blind, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial has been designed to determine whether cytisine is at least as effective as NRT in assisting smokers to remain abstinent for at least one month. Participants (n = 1,310) will be recruited through the national telephone-based Quitline service in New Zealand and randomised to receive a standard 25-day course of cytisine tablets (Tabex®) or usual care (eight weeks of NRT patch and/or gum or lozenge). Participants in both study arms will also receive a behavioural support programme comprising an average of three follow-up telephone calls delivered over an eight-week period by Quitline. The primary outcome is continuous abstinence from smoking at one month, defined as not smoking more than five cigarettes since quit date. Outcome data will also be collected at one week, two months and six months post-quit date.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Cytisine appears to be effective compared with placebo, and given its (current) relative low cost may be an acceptable smoking cessation treatment for smokers, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries. Cytisine's 'natural' product status may also increase its acceptability and use among certain groups of smokers, such as indigenous people, smokers in countries where the use of natural medicines is widespread (e.g. China, India), and in those people who do not want to use NRT or anti-depressants to help them quit smoking. However it is important to ascertain the effectiveness of cytisine compared with that of existing cessation treatments.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000590066)."

A total of 75 subjects were randomized to EEG-neurofeedback, mental imagery with a comparable treatment set-up or a waitlist group. At post-treatment, only EEG-neurofeedback led to a reduced frequency of binge eating (p = .015, g = 0.65). The effects remained stable to a 3-month follow-up. EEG-neurofeedback further showed particular beneficial effects on perceived stress and dietary self-efficacy. Differences in outcomes did not arise from divergent treatment expectations. Because EEG-neurofeedback showed a specific efficacy, it may be a promising brain-directed approach that should be tested as a treatment adjunct in clinical groups with binge eating.

            "abstract": "Free radicals in cigarette smoke (CS) cause oxidative damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids, contributing to the pathobiology of atherosclerosis, heart disease, and cancer. In vitro studies have shown that antioxidants quench free radicals and ameliorate certain aspects of biomolecular damage caused by CS. It is hypothesized that a combination of antioxidants is more effective than a single antioxidant, due to their interactions. To investigate whether supplemental antioxidants reduce CS-related lipid peroxidation in vivo and whether they are more effective in combination, we conducted an intervention study in smokers. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we investigated whether vitamin C or an antioxidant mixture containing vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid, and vitamin E decreases plasma F(2)-isoprostane levels, an index of oxidant stress, in smokers. Plasma of 126 smokers (mean age, 46 years; age range, 20-78 years) was analyzed for F(2)-isoprostanes at baseline and after intervention with antioxidants and placebo. In smokers with a body mass index (BMI) above the median, 2 months of daily supplementation with 500 mg of vitamin C decreased plasma F(2)-isoprostane levels by 28.8 pmol/liter when compared with the placebo group (P = 0.001); levels in the mixture group were 7.45 pmol/liter lower after treatment, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.14). There was no treatment effect in smokers with a low BMI. BMI was significantly positively associated with plasma F(2)-isoprostane levels (trend P = 0.001). Antioxidants decrease smoking-related lipid peroxidation markers of oxidative stress in humans with high BMI. Our results do not indicate that an antioxidant combination is more effective than vitamin C alone. The intake of antioxidants may help prevent smoking-related diseases. Smoking cessation should still be considered the most effective way to prevent smoking-related diseases."

We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations."

We also investigated possible sex differences in these relationships, given evidence for sex differences in smoking cessation and central opioid mechanisms, as well as some evidence for sex differences in response to NRT. Our results indicate that OPRM1 genotype may moderate the effect of transdermal nicotine patch compared to placebo during active treatment, with a benefit of active NRT treatment evident in the OPRM1 AA genotype group only and those carrying one or more copies of the G allele demonstrating no benefit of active NRT versus placebo patch. Our results also indicate a sex difference in change in BMI at 8-year follow-up following a smoking cessation attempt, with ex-smokers demonstrating an increase in BMI, and this increase being greater in female subjects than in male subjects. We did not observe any association of OPRM1 genotype with change in BMI, although there was a trend for genotype to influence the observed sex difference in change in BMI over time. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings, and investigate the relationship between both short- and long-term weight gain and smoking cessation and investigate possible mechanisms that may underlie these processes. Future studies should also investigate the role of OPRM1 genotype and smoking cessation on other appetitive and reward behaviours such as alcohol consumption."

            "abstract": "This article describes the application and refinement of community-based prevention marketing (CBPM), an example of community-based participatory research that blends social marketing theories and techniques and community organization principles to guide voluntary health behavior change. The Florida Prevention Research Center has worked with a community coalition in Sarasota County, Florida to define locally important health problems and issues and to develop responsive health-promotion interventions. The CBPM framework has evolved as academic and community-based researchers have gained experience applying it. Community boards can use marketing principles to design evidence-based strategies for addressing local public health concerns. Based on 6 years of experience with the \"Believe in All Your Possibilities\" program, lessons learned that have led to revision and improvement of the CBPM framework are described."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California.\n## METHODS\nSouthern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention.\n## RESULTS\nOf 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired functionality.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nParticipation in assessment alone may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.\n"

            "abstract": "Despite its declining prevalence during the past few decades, tobacco use remains one of the most significant public health issues of the 1990s. Environmental and policy interventions are among the most cost-effective approaches to control tobacco use and prevent cardiovascular diseases. In this article, the authors review and offer to state and local health departments and other public health partners a summary of recommended policy and environmental interventions that have either reduced or show potential to reduce tobacco use. Priority recommendations include clean indoor air policies, restrictions on tobacco advertising and promotion, policies limiting youth access to tobacco, comprehensive school health programs, and excise taxes and other economic incentives. Many of these recommendations should be integrated with other health promotion interventions to also improve nutrition and physical activity. The authors also highlight several successful interventions and strategies used to establish policies at the state and local levels."

            "abstract": "Research increasingly supports promotion of nutrition and physical activity community resources to support individual-level health promotion interventions. However, even when such resources exist, they are often not well used. In this article, the authors describe the results of formative research regarding patient and health promotion professionals' perspectives on methods to encourage use of community resources among patients accessing family planning services at a local health department in eastern North Carolina. In March through May of 2010, the authors conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 female patients, aged 18-44 years, and five local key informants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, imported into Atlas Ti for data management, and independently double-coded. Free, easily accessible, and family-friendly resources were most appealing to participants. Key informants offered creative ideas for promoting the use of resources, such as parks and farmers' markets, and included integration of such resources into health care provider prescriptions and taking group trips to resources. Results of this study can guide similar programs attempting to promote the use of resources among hard-to-reach groups."

Based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), the eight-session, weekly intervention was designed for group delivery via the Internet or telephone. Forty participants were randomly assigned to intervention or waitlist. Depressive symptoms and other outcomes were measured at baseline, after intervening in the intervention group (~8 weeks), and after intervening in the waitlist group (~16 weeks). Depressive symptoms decreased significantly more in the intervention group than the waitlist group; Internet and telephone did not differ. This effect persisted over the 8 weeks when those waitlisted received the intervention. Knowledge/skills increased significantly more in the intervention than the waitlist group. All other changes, though not significant, were in the expected direction. Findings indicate that distance delivery of group MBCT can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in people with epilepsy. Directions for future research are proposed."

The intervention prescribed pedometer-defined walks in weekly walking schedules. These were fitness-tailored and structured in walking load (intensity/volume) according to the principles of training progression. This intervention was offered as a social activity at meeting points of a community-based senior organization. Twenty-nine meeting points (n = 432) constituted the intervention condition. Ten meeting points (n = 148) formed the wait-list control condition. Measurements were organized at intervention start (pretest) and end (posttest). Intention-to-treat linear mixed models showed small positive intervention effects on physical activity, fitness, and aspects of well-being. These results confirm the effectiveness of structured walking interventions with systematic training progression and underscore the value of community-based senior organizations as intervention settings for older adults."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an intense piano training program on general self-efficacy, musical self-efficacy, and physiological stress in older adults. Self-efficacy refers to perceived beliefs regarding the performance of domain-specific tasks or activities, which contribute to psychological and physical health. A key challenge is to identify activities that promote self-efficacy in the aging population. Seventeen healthy community-dwelling older adults (60-85 years) with little to no previous musical training participated in a within subjects experimental design. Measures of self-efficacy and cortisol levels were administered over three time points: an initial pre-testing session, a second pre-testing following a two-week no treatment control period, and a post-testing session upon the completion of piano training. Intense piano training consisted of 30 hours of training (3 hours per day) in which high levels of achievement were required. Results of a three-way Repeated Measures ANOVA over all time points with pairwise comparisons revealed significantly (p < .05) enhanced musical self-efficacy post-training, F (2, 32) = 11.5, p < .001, d = .79. No significant changes in general self-efficacy or cortisol levels were found. These results suggest that domain-specific self-efficacy may increase as a result of short-term intense music training; however, short-term music training may not be sufficient to transfer to general self-efficacy."

Participants (N = 110) were adult male and female nicotine-dependent smokers who expressed interest in quitting smoking. All subjects received six sessions of behavioral counseling (1 hr/session for 6 weeks), and 1 month of the nicotine patch (21 mg for the first 2 weeks, 14 mg the third week, 7 mg the fourth week). Subjects were randomly assigned to the naltrexone or placebo group. The naltrexone group started at 25 mg daily for 3 days prior to the quit date, and increased to 50 mg/day on the quit date and following 8 weeks. At the end of medication treatment, the naltrexone group had better quit rates versus the placebo group (48% quit on naltrexone vs. 41% on placebo), but this difference was not statistically significant. However, men and women differed on several measures: in the placebo group, women had significantly lower quit rates than men (39% vs. 67%, p<.05), but in the naltrexone group, women had quit rates comparable with those of men (58% vs. 62%, p = ns). Further examination revealed that naltrexone significantly reduced men's and women's cessation-related weight gain and selectively reduced women's urge to smoke to relieve negative affect and withdrawal. The results suggest continued examination of naltrexone as an adjunct in smoking cessation, particularly in female smokers, who have historically shown worse outcomes with traditional treatment methods."
