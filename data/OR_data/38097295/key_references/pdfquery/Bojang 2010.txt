Anaemia remains one of the most important health problems 
for children in malaria-endemic countries of Africa; the prevalence 
of severe anaemia, usually defined as a Hb,5g/dL, among 
children in the community varies from 1.3% to 6.4% [1–6] and 
moderate anaemia (Hb,7g/dL) is frequent. Severe anaemia is a 
major cause of hospital admission and contributes substantially to 
inpatient paediatric mortality and mortality. Among children 
in sub-Saharan Africa the prevalence of 
admitted to hospital 
severe anaemia ranged from 7% to 29% in different epidemio- 
logical settings [1–6]. The case fatality rate (CFR) for children with 
severe anaemia is estimated to be between 8% and 18% [3,4,6–10]. 
Causes of severe anaemia in African children include nutritional 
deficiencies, infections, and haemoglobinopathies. However, infec- 
tion with Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main causes in malaria 
endemic areas. Malaria infection results in destruction of both 
infected and non-infected red blood cells and depresses the ability 
of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells. 
Studies in a high malaria transmission area of western Kenya 
indicated that children treated for severe anaemia (Hb,5g/dL) 
were at high risk of dying after they had been discharged from 
hospital due to a rebound of their anaemia [11,12]; 14%–16% of 
children treated for severe malaria died at home within eight 
weeks of discharge.

persistent parasitaemia on discharge from hospital were strong

Background:In malaria endemic countries, children who have experienced an episode of severe anaemia are at increased 
risk of a recurrence of anaemia. There is a need to find ways of protecting these at risk children from malaria and 
chemoprevention offers a potential way of achieving this objective. 
Methods: During the 2003 and 2004 malaria transmission seasons, 1200 Gambian children with moderate or severe 
anaemia (Hb concentration ,7 g/dL) were randomised to receive either monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or 
placebo until the end of the malaria transmission season in which they were enrolled, in a double-blind trial. All study 
subjects were treated with oral iron for 28 days and morbidity was monitored through surveillance at health centres. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of children with moderate or severe anaemia at the end of the transmission season. 
Secondary endpoints included the incidence of clinical episodes of malaria during the surveillance period, outpatient 
attendances, the prevalence of parasitaemia and splenomegaly, nutritional status at the end of the malaria transmission 
season and compliance with the treatment regimen. 
Results:The proportions of children with a Hb concentration of ,7 g/dL at the end of the malaria transmission season were 
similar in the two study groups, 14/464 (3.0%) in children who received at least one dose of SP and 16/471 (3.4%) in those 
who received placebo, prevalence ratio 0.89 (0.44,1.8) P = 0.742. The protective efficacy of SP against episodes of clinical 
malaria was 53% (95% CI 37%, 65%). Treatment with SP was safe and well tolerated; no serious adverse events related to SP 
administration were observed. Mortality following discharge from hospital was low among children who received SP or 
placebo (6 in the SP group and 9 in the placebo group respectively). 
Conclusions:Intermittent treatment with SP did not reduce the proportion of previously anaemic children with moderate or 
severe anaemia at the end of the malaria season, although it prevented malaria. The combination of appropriate 
antimalarial treatment plus one month of iron supplementation and good access to healthcare during follow-up proved 
effective in restoring haemoglobin to an acceptable level in the Gambian setting. 


of appropriate malaria control 
interventions may be a cost- 
effective approach to reducing the morbidity and mortality 
associated with severe anaemia. These findings indicate that there 
is a need to improve the management of African children with 
severe anaemia both within hospital and after their discharge. 
Prevention of malaria through provision of an insecticide treated 
bednet (ITN) is likely to be one effective option. Chemoprevention 
offers another potential approach. 
Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), which involves admin- 
istration of a full treatment course of an antimalarial at specified 
times to at risk subjects regardless of whether or not they are 
known to be parasitaemic, was devised as a strategy for 
overcoming some of the problems associated with chemoprophy- 
laxis whilst taking advantage of its protective effects. IPT was 
developed initially for use in pregnant women and then adapted to 
malaria control in infants (IPTi) and older children (IPTc). The 
role of IPT in the prevention of malaria and anaemia in children 
has been evaluated in a number of trials. In Mali, an area of 
seasonal malaria transmission, two doses of sulphadoxine-pyri- 
methamine (SP) given to children aged 6 months to 9 years at an 
interval of two months gave a protective efficacy of 40% against 
clinical attacks of malaria [13]. In another study undertaken in 
Niakhar, Senegal, an area of intense but short seasonal malaria 
transmission, SP and one dose of artesunate (AS) given to children 
less than 5 years old three times at one monthly intervals 
the peak period of malaria transmission reduced 
throughout 
clinical attacks of malaria by 86% [14]. A further trial was 
undertaken in the same study site to compare different treatment 
regimens and high levels of efficacy against episodes of clinical 
malaria were observed with each treatment regimen [15]. In 
in Ghana, monthly 
another comparative study carried out 
amodiaquine (AQ) plus AS was compared with bimonthly AQ 
plus AS and bimonthly SP. Monthly AS plus AQ was the most 
effective regimen, giving 69% protection against clinical episodes 
of malaria [16]. These results suggest that IPTc has potential as an 
affordable malaria control tool. However, the potential role of IPT 
in the prevention of a recurrence of severe anaemia in children 
who have already been treated for moderate or severe anaemia ( 
Hb,7g/dl) remains to be established. Thus, we have investigated 
whether monthly IPT with SP given during the malaria 
transmission season can protect Gambian children treated 
previously for moderate or severe malaria in hospital against a 
recurrence of anaemia. 

The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist 
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and 
Protocol S1. A summary of 
the recruitment and follow-up 
procedures is shown in Fig. 1. 

The primary objective of the study was determination of the 
impact of IPT with SP on the proportion of children previously 
treated for severe or moderate anaemia who had a recurrence of 
their anaemia at the end of the malaria transmission season. 
Secondary objectives included study of the impact of IPT with SP 
on the incidence of clinical episodes of malaria during the 
surveillance period, outpatient attendances, 
the prevalence of 
parasitaemia and splenomegaly and nutritional status at the end of 
the malaria transmission season and compliance with the 
treatment regimen. 

The study was conducted in the Western Region of The 
Gambia, which includes the capital Banjul. Transmission of 
malaria in The Gambia is seasonal. The climate is typical of sub- 
from 
Sahelian Africa with a long dry season, which lasts

December–June, followed by a relatively short rainy season from 
July–November during which most malaria transmission occurs. 
Morbidity and mortality from malaria follow this pattern, both 
occurring much more frequently during the rainy season, with 
a peak in the month of October. The annual entomological 
inoculation rate varies enormously across the country and is in the 
range of 1–177 infected bites per person year [17]. During the 
course of the study, first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria 
in The Gambia changed from chloroquine to the combination of 
chloroquine and SP. Since 2008, the recommended first line 
treatment for uncomplicated malaria has changed to artemether- 
lumefantrine (CoartemTM, Norvatis Pharma, Basel Switzerland). 
In 2001, the PCR-corrected treatment failure rate in symptomatic 
children at day 28 after the start of treatment with SP was 6% 
[18]. At 
the study there were no standardized 
guidelines for the prevention of anaemia in children. 

1200 children were recruited from the Royal Victoria Teaching 
Hospital (RVTH), Banjul, the Medical Research Council (MRC) 
Hospital, Fajara, or from the major health centres at Brikama, 
Essau and Faji Kunda, 600 children during the 2003 transmission 
season (July to December), and another 600 children in the 2004 
malaria transmission season. The study was extended to include 
the WEC clinic, Sibanor, in 2004. 

The trial was designed as an individually randomised, controlled, 
double-blind study. Children were recruited on presentation to the 
out-patient clinic (OPD) or ward of one of the participating health 
facilities. Children suspected of having anaemia and who were in 
the right age group had their Hb concentration measured and a 
blood film examined for the presence of malaria parasites. Children 
were eligible for enrolment if they were aged between 3 months and 
9 years and had a Hb concentration ,7 g/dL. Children who did 
not meet these criteria were excluded. Individual, signed consent 
was obtained from the parents or guardians of children who met the 
study inclusion criteria. The randomisation list was generated by a 
senior MRC statistician. Provided that consent was given, children 
were individually randomized into either the SP or the placebo 
group in a 1:1 ratio at the time of admission, using permuted blocks 
of 12 generated by computer using the STATA program. Blocks 
were not split across centres. Tablets (enough for 6 doses) were 
packed into envelopes bearing the randomization number by MRC 
staff not involved in the trial in any other way. The next envelope in 
sequence was assigned to the child at the time of their admission to 
hospital. Copies of the randomization code, kept in a sealed opaque 
envelope, were held by the local safety monitor and the MRC 
Laboratories accountant. Some additional replacement envelopes 
were also prepared, which were separately numbered, with a listing 
indicating which of these envelopes should be used in the event that 
a child’s envelope was lost or damaged, None of the investigators, 
health care centre staff or laboratory staff participating in the trial 
had access to the code during the trial. A formal attempt to 
demonstrate blinding (by asking the subjects to guess their treatment 
allocation) was not undertaken. The code was provided to the 
investigators only after a locked copy of the database had been given 
to the chairman of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. 

On admission, children were clinically evaluated and additional 
investigations, 
for example lumbar puncture, were undertaken 
when these were indicated on clinical grounds. The majority of 
children with malaria were treated with intramuscular quinine 
followed by SP. However, a small number received chloroquine 
plus SP. Patients were treated for other conditions as clinically 


indicated. Children were kept 
signs of 
respiratory distress had subsided and until their Hb concentra- 
tion had increased over that found on admission. Their average 
duration of stay in hospital was 4 days (range 1 to 36 days). 
Children with a haemoglobin concentration of ,5 g/dL and/or 
signs of 
immediate 
respiratory distress were scheduled for 
transfusion with whole blood in accordance with national 
guidelines. All patients received iron for 28 days (ferrous fumerate 
syrup at a target dose of 2mg/kg), starting at the time of their 
discharge from hospital. Each child was provided with a photo ID 
card with their unique study number prior to their discharge from 
hospital. Children were asked to return for follow-up 7 days after 
discharge. At this visit, a fingerpick blood sample was collected for 
Hb concentration measurement and thick blood film examination 
for malaria parasites. Any medical condition detected during the 
visit was treated appropriately. 

The first dose of trial medication was given under supervision by 
project staff at the first follow-up visit to the hospital or health 
centre where the child had been admitted, scheduled to be seven 
days after their discharge from hospital. The envelope containing 
the trial medication bearing the child’s study number was then 
transferred to the health centre closest to the child’s home where 
the patient continued to receive monthly chemoprevention given 
by trained field workers. Subsequent monthly doses of SP or 
placebo were given under the supervision of clinic staff until the 
end of the malaria transmission season. Thus, the number of 
treatments that a child was expected to receive varied depending 
upon the time of the year at which they were recruited. SP tablets 
(Cosmos Ltd., 
(500 mg sulphadoxine/25 mg pyrimethamine) 
Nairobi, Kenya) were given at an approximate dose of 1.25 mg 
pyrimethamine/25 mg sulphadoxine per kg. Placebo tablets, 
which were identical 
in shape and colour to the SP tablets, 
contained mainly lactose and maize starch. Older children took 
the study drugs as tablets, which were swallowed whole or chewed. 
Younger children were given their tablets crushed, suspended in 
water and administered with a spoon. 


Mothers/guardians were encouraged to take their child to one 
of the participating health facilities at any time after discharge 
from hospital if their child became unwell. In order to facilitate 
OPD visits, transport fares were given to mothers each time a 
study subject reported to a health facility. Using this method of 
passive surveillance, which best reflects the likely public health 
impact of an antimalarial 
it was unlikely that a 
significant number of cases of severe malaria or other conditions 
would have been missed during the study but a larger number of 
cases of milder malaria might have been identified using active 
surveillance with home visits. A finger prick blood sample was 
obtained from any study child who presented with an axillary 
temperature $37.5uC or a history of fever within the previous 
48 hours for preparation of a thick blood film for microscopy and 
blood spots on a glass fibre mat (Wallac, Finland) were obtained 
for parasite genotyping. Diagnosis and treatment were recorded in 
a standardized form each time a study child was seen at a health 
facility. Children with documented fever (axillary temperature of 
$37.5uC) or a history of recent fever and malaria parasitaemia 
were treated with SP and chloroquine in accordance with Gambia 
Government treatment guideline. Children who presented with 
severe malaria were treated with IM quinine and those who 
presented with uncomplicated malaria within one week of 
receiving SP chemoprevention received oral quinine. During 




follow-up, children with a haemoglobin concentration ,9 g/dL 
were treated with iron for a further 28 days if they have completed 
their initial iron treatment and those with severe anaemia were 
referred for admission. Deaths that occurred at home were 
investigated using the post-mortem questionnaire technique and 
the cause of death established whenever possible. 

All adverse reactions which might be related to drug 
administration were documented at each contact with the study 
subject. Particular attention was paid to the presence of any skin 
reactions, in particular Stevens-Johnson syndrome as this is the 
most important adverse reaction related to SP administration. 

All children were visited in the January after the end of the 
transmission season in which they were enrolled. A standardized 
questionnaire was administered to collect information regarding 
any illness that had occurred since the last visit, use of healthcare 
facilities and use of medicines. Information on the use of bednets 
was collected during this survey. Children were examined by a 
physician, anthropometric data were collected, and a finger-prick 
blood sample was obtained for preparation of a thick blood smear 
and determination of Hb concentration. At 
the 
following dry season in May, study subjects were visited at home 
and a short questionnaire administered to document morbidity 
and mortality during the preceding five months. 


Thick smears were prepared in duplicate so that if the subject 
had symptoms of malaria, one smear could be stained with Field’s 
stain and read promptly to guide treatment. The other smear was 
stained with Giemsa stain and 200 high power fields (HPF) were 
examined before a smear was declared negative. Only the Giemsa- 
stained slide readings were used for the trial analysis. Parasite 
density was expressed per ml with the assumption that 1 parasite 
per high-powered field (hpf) equals 500 parasites per ml [19]. All 
slides were read by two laboratory technicians. If 
there was 
disagreement between these readings on parasite positivity or if the 
difference of the log-densities recorded was more than 1.5, slides 
were read by a third technician. Agreement was reached after the 
slides had been re-checked. Discrepancies occurred mainly in 
smears with very low parasite densities. On rare occasions during 
follow-up, when a laboratory technician was not available to read 
a thick blood smear for malaria parasites, the CoreTM Malaria Pf 
test (CORE Diagnostics, Birmingham, UK) was used to guide 
treatment and a thick blood smear collected for subsequent 
confirmation of the diagnosis. 
Haemoglobin concentration was measured at recruitment, 
during morbidity surveillance and at 
the end of malaria 
transmission season surveys using a portable haemoglobinometer 
(HemoCue AB, Sweden). 
DNA was extracted from glass fibre mats using the chelex 
technique [20]. Polymorphisms in the pfdhfr and the pfdhps genes, 
associated with resistance to pyrimethamine (codons 51, 59 and 108 
of dhfr) and sulphadoxine (codons 437 and 540 of dhps) respectively, 
were tested for using PCR amplification followed by restriction 
fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) [21]. 

The sample size was determined on the basis of previous studies 
carried out in The Gambia. We estimated that 20% of children 
would be moderately anaemic (PCV,20% - approximately equal 

to a Hb concentration of 7 g/dL) at the end of the malaria 
transmission season and that the attack rate of malaria (cumulative 
incidence of malaria) in the control group would be 0.1 episodes 
per month. To detect a reduction by one third (from 20% to 13%) 
in the prevalence of moderate to severe anaemia (Hb,7g/dL) at 
the end of the malaria transmission season with a power of 80%, 
using a significance level of 5% and assuming 15% loss to follow- 
up, 600 children were needed in each group. With this sample size, 
the study had 80% power using a 5% level of significance, to 
detect a reduction by one third in the incidence of clinical attacks 
of malaria in the treatment group. The primary endpoint was the 
prevalence of anaemia (Hb,7), 
the prevalence ratio was 
calculated with 95% confidence interval; the log-binomial model 
[22] was used to estimate the prevalence ratio adjusted for 
covariates 
(baseline Hb concentration, malaria infection at 
baseline, bednet usage and recruitment centre) which were 
specified in an analysis plan written before unblinding. In the 
primary analysis only children who received at least one dose of 
IPT or placebo, and were followed up, were included. Mean 
haemoglobin concentration was compared using a t-test, and an 
adjusted difference between means was obtained using normal 
regression. An episode of clinical malaria was defined as an illness 
accompanied by (a) an axillary temperature of $37?5uC or a 
history of fever within the previous 48 hours, (b) no other obvious 
cause for the fever and (c) the presence of P falciparum asexual stage 
parasitaemia at any density. Malaria with high density parasitae- 
mia was defined as above but included only children with a P 
falciparum parasite density of $5000/mL. Malaria parasitaemia at 
the cross-sectional survey was defined as the presence of asexual 
stage P. falciparum parasitaemia of any density regardless of the 
presence or absence of the symptomatic criteria used for the 
definition of clinical malaria. A serious adverse experience was 
defined as any event which was fatal, life threatening, disabling or 
incapacitating or resulted in hospitalisation or prolonged a hospital 
stay or was associated with overdose (either accidental or 
intentional). Adverse events were not formally graded for severity. 
Cox regression was used to compare the incidence of malaria, and 
of anaemia, between the two groups. Efficacy was defined as the 
percentage reduction in the number of events in the intervention 
group, estimated as 1006(1-hazard ratio). All events were included 
in the analysis and a robust estimator of the variance was used to 
allow for the lack of independence among repeated episodes in the 
same child. For the malaria endpoint, estimates were adjusted for 
the effects of bednet usage defined as sleeping every night under an 
intact or impregnated net, recruitment centre and age. For 
anaemia, estimates were adjusted for net use, recruitment centre, 
baseline prevalence of parasitaemia, and baseline Hb concentra- 
tion. Interaction between treatment group and bednet use was 
examined for both outcomes. Time at risk started at the beginning 
of 
the day 7 visit after 
discharge) and ended on the last day of December of the same 
year. If a subject was lost to follow-up observations were censored 
from the date of the first scheduled visit that they failed to attend. 
If a subject withdrew consent or died, the observation for that 
subject was censored at the date of the death or withdrawal. 
Children who moved temporarily out of 
the study area but 
returned to take some of the courses of treatment remained as part 
of the study cohort. Analyses were done using STATA version 10 
(STATA Corporation, TX, US). 


The study was approved by the London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee and by the joint MRC/ 





Gambia Government Ethics Committee. The conduct of the trial 
was guided by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. 

During the two-year study period, 5917 children with pallor 
who presented at the five trial sites were screened. 1200 eligible 
the study, 
children were enrolled (600 during each year of 
Figure 2). The remaining children were not enrolled because they 
did not meet the inclusion criteria or had one of the exclusion 
criteria. Recruitment started in August during the first year of the 
study and in July during the second year, but the majority of study 
subjects (80%) were recruited during the peak period for malaria 
transmission (September, October and November) and thus were 
eligible to receive only 2 or 3 treatments with SP. 546/600 (91.0%) 
and 539/600 (89.8%) of the children enrolled into the SP and 
placebo groups on admission to hospital received their first dose of 
trial medication. Among the 54 children in the SP group who were 
not seen at the day 7 visit, 45 were lost to follow-up, 7 died and 2 
subjects were withdrawn by their families. In the placebo group, 
61 did not come for the day 7 follow-up and of these 52 were lost 
to follow-up, 7 died and 2 were withdrawn by their families. 951/

the malaria 
transmission season, of these 942 had received at least one dose 
of IPT or placebo. 966/1200 (80%) subjects were seen at the end 
of the following dry season. 



Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients were similar for the 
two treatment groups (Table 1). The prevalence of malaria 
parasitaemia in the SP and placebo groups were 62% and 61% 
respectively and mean parasite densities were similar in each 
group (Table 1). In addition, there were more children in the 
placebo group who had splenomegaly compared to the SP group. 
More children in the SP group slept under a bednet compared to 
children in the placebo group when bednets were inspected at the 
end of the transmission season.

Fourteen of the 1200 children enrolled died in hospital before 
receiving their first dose of trial medication (7 in each group). Two 
had pneumonia, one developed cerebral malaria, and 11 died of 
severe anaemia. Nine children died despite having received a blood 
transfusion. At the day 7 follow-up, the prevalence of malaria 
parasitaemia in the SP and placebo groups was 29/546 (5.3%) and 
25/539 (4.6%) respectively. These patients were asymptomatic and 
most had only low-level parasitaemia. Mean haemoglobin (SD) 
concentrations 7 days after discharge were also similar in the two 
treatment groups [7.51 (3.6) g/dL and 7.45(3.3) g/dL]. 12.5% and 
13% of the children in the SP and placebo groups had haemoglobin 
concentration of less than 5g/dl at the day 7 follow-up visit. 

Because administration of IPT was terminated at the end of the 
malaria transmission season, the number of times that a child 

should have received SP or placebo varied from 1 to 6 (Table 2). 
Compliance was initially high but decreased progressively in 
children who were required to take the most doses. 
Overall impact of IPT on mortality, morbidity and 
nutritional status 
Between the time of first administration of IPT and the end of 
the malaria transmission season, six children died (2 in the SP 
group and 4 in the control group). In the SP group, one child died 
of severe anaemia and another died of severe malaria. In the 
placebo group, four children died of severe malaria. Nine children 
died during the dry season following the period in which IPT was 
given, 4 in the SP group and 5 in the placebo group. In the SP 
group, two children died of severe anaemia and one each of 
malnutrition and acute respiratory infection. In the placebo group, 
2 children died of severe malnutrition and one each of HIV 
infection, a road traffic accident and severe anaemia. Thus, overall 
there were 6 deaths in children who received SP and 9 in those 
who received placebo. 
Twelve study children were re-admitted to one of the health 
facilities in the study area during the follow-up period; 5 and 7 in 
the SP and placebo groups respectively. Three children were 
admitted because of severe anaemia; one in the SP and two in the 
placebo group. One of the children in the placebo group was 
admitted on two occasions because of severe malaria anaemia. 
the intervention against various 
The protective efficacies of 
morbidity endpoints detected during outpatient or dispensary 
visits are shown in Table 3. There were 257 visits to the OPD in 
the placebo group and 184 in the SP group, a reduction of 29% 
(95%CI 13%,42%). The intervention provided 43% (20%,59%) 
efficacy against episodes of documented fever (axillary temperature 
of $37.5uC). Protective efficacy against upper 
respiratory 
infection, skin/soft tissue infection and gastroenteritis was 21%, 
17% and 41% respectively. However, the numbers of these events 
were small and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are wide. 
Children who had received IPT with SP were better nourished 
at the end of the malaria transmission season than children who 
had received placebo. Weight-for-height and mid upper arm 
circumference were significantly higher in the SP than in the 
placebo groups at the December cross-sectional survey (Table 4). 


The proportions of children with a Hb concentration of ,7 g/ 
dL at the end of the malaria transmission season, the primary trial 
endpoint, were similar in the two groups of children, 14/464 
(3.0%, 95%CI 1.5%, 4.6%) in children who received SP and 16/ 
471 (3.4%, 95%CI 1.8%, 5.0%) in those who received placebo 
(prevalence ratio 0.89 (0.44,1.8) P = 0.742). Only one child, in the 
placebo group, had a Hb concentration of ,5g/dL. The mean 
the malaria 
haemoglobin (SD) concentration at 
transmission season was slightly higher in children in the SP 
group [10.8 (1.7) g/dL ] compared to the placebo group [10.6 
(1.8)g/dL ], difference 0.23 (0.002,0.45) P = 0.048 (adjusted for 
baseline Hb and other covariates) but this difference is unlikely to 
have been clinically significant. The cumulative number of 
children who had anaemia (Hb,7g/dL) at OPD visits during 
surveillance or at the end of the transmission season was 32/470 
(6.8%) in the SP group and 42/477 (8.8%) in the placebo group 
(ratio 0.77 (0.50,1.2) P = 0.252), and of these 4/465 (0.9%) had 
Hb,5 in the SP group compared to 11/462 (2.3%) in the placebo 
group (ratio 0.37 (0.12,1.2) P = 0.074). Similar results were 
obtained after adjusting for covariates (Table 3); there was no 
evidence of an interaction between treatment group and bednet 
use.

(Hb,7 g/dL) at the end of the transmission season was slightly 
higher among children who had been transfused (5/43 (14.7%) in 
the placebo group compared to 2/30 (6.67%) in the SP group) but 
there was no evidence of interaction between intervention group 
and having been transfused (P = 0.350). 

During the malaria transmission season following enrolment, 
there were 30 episodes of malaria with high parasitaemia (.5000/ 
ml) in children who received SP compared to 68 in those who 
received placebo, a protective efficacy of 56% (30%,73%). When 
all episodes of malaria are considered, 91 episodes of clinical 
malaria were recorded in children who received SP compared 
with 192 in children who received placebo giving an efficacy of 
53% (37%,65%)[Table 5]. There was no evidence of an 
interaction between treatment group and bednet use. Figure 3 
shows the timing of first episodes of malaria in each group (logrank 
test: P,0.001). 
Seventy-two of 460 children (16%) in the SP group had asexual 
stage P.falciparum parasitaemia compared with 119/473 (25%) in 
the control group (prevalence ratio 0.62 (0.48,0.81) P,0.001) but 
very few children in either group had a parasitaemia of $5000/mL 
(6 (1.3%) SP, 16 (3.4%) placebo, prevalence ratio 0.39 (95%CI 
0.15,0.98) P = 0.037). There was a statistically significant differ- 
ence in the prevalence of splenomegaly between the two groups at 
this time point but the prevalence of splenomegaly was low in both 
groups (2.9% in SP vs 6.5% in placebo group)( p = 0.006). 
Interviews with mothers suggested that 46 and 50 children in 
the SP and placebo groups respectively received antimalarial 
treatment during the dry season.

One hundred and ninety-five (75%) and 182 (70%) of 259 first 
positive samples collected at enrolment were successfully analysed 
for polymorphisms in dhfr (codons 51, 59, and 108) and dhps (codon 
437 and 540) genes respectively. The numbers genotyped among 
78 samples collected from parasitaemic children during the 
December cross-sectional survey were 58 (74%) and 44 (56%) 
for the two genes respectively. The remainder were not analysed 
because there were no detectable PCR products. The prevalence

amine resistance (codons 51, 59 and 108) increased during the 
period of surveillance in children who received monthly SP, from 
87% (72/83) at the time of clinical presentation to 100% (14/14) 
at the end of season, and in those who received placebo from 82% 
(92/112) at the time of clinical presentation to 95.5% (42/44) at 
the end of season. Neither of these increases were statistically 
significant (p = 0.32 and p = 0.06 respectively). The prevalence of 
the codon 437 mutation in the pfdhps gene associated with 
resistance to sulphonamides did not change significantly during 
the study period in either arm of the study. For the SP treatment 
group, the prevalence was 49% (39/79) at the time of enrolment 
and 21% (3/14) in December (p = 0.1), and in the placebo group 
the prevalence was 48.5% (50/103) at the enrolment and 37% 
(11/30 (37%) in December (p = 0.35). The 540E allele in the dhps 
gene associated with sulphonamide resistance was not present in 
the study population. 

No severe skin reactions suggestive of the Stevens Johnson 
syndrome were seen. Minor symptoms recorded during the 30 
days after the administration of each treatment were similar in the 
SP and placebo groups (data not shown). No child was withdrawn 
from the study because of an adverse event due to SP. 


Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) was developed first as a 
strategy to control malaria in pregnancy and then adapted to 
malaria control in infants and older children. We have further 
extended this approach to anaemic children because this group 
represent a vulnerable group who could benefit from a highly 
effective malaria control strategy. 
We did not find that monthly treatment with SP had any 
significant 
impact on the prevalence of moderate or severe 
anaemia in previously anaemic children followed through a 
malaria transmission season, the primary endpoint for this trial. 
Less than 4% of children in either the intervention or the control 
group had a Hb concentration of less than 7 g/dL when seen at 
the end of 
the malaria transmission season. Children in the 
intervention group did have a higher mean haemoglobin 
concentration than the control children (10.8g/dL vs 10.6g/dL), 
a difference that is unlikely to be clinically important. Thus, in The 
Gambia, an area of moderate malaria endemicity and highly 
seasonal transmission, provision of oral iron supplementation for a 
four-week period and ready access to a health facility seem 
adequate to prevent previously anaemic children from relapsing. 
In our study, iron supplementation was given for only one month, 
a decision based in part on the result of a previous pilot trial 
carried out at RVTH, Banjul which showed that the mean PCV 
was significantly higher in children with severe anaemia who 
received one month of iron supplementation than in those treated 
by blood transfusion alone and that by the end of the malaria 
transmission season a majority of the children treated with iron 
had normal haemoglobin concentrations 
In an study 
undertaken in young children with anaemia in Tanzania, it was 
shown that children who received iron supplementation and 
monthly SP for three months had a lower prevalence of anaemia 
than those who received these interventions for only a month but 
the difference between groups was modest and interpretation of 
the results of this trial is complicated by differences in the duration 
of follow-up [23]. Sustaining compliance with iron supplementa- 
tion for three months would be difficult and there are concerns 
that iron supplementation may increase the risk of malaria in 
highly endemic areas [24].

55% (27%,73%) unadjusted.

moderate or severe malaria was much less than we had anticipated 
based on previous experience in The Gambia. This may be due to 
the fact that the incidence of malaria in The Gambia began to fall 
at about the time that this study was conducted [25] so that 
malaria has become a much less important cause of anaemia than 
was the case 10 or more years ago when earlier studies were done. 
If this is the case then SP would not be expected to have a 
significant effect on the prevalence of anaemia although remaining 
partially protective against malaria. 
We did not observe the high rate of recurrence of anaemia and 
the associated mortality observed in previous studies in Kenyan 
when children with severe anaemia were followed up following 
their discharge from hospital [11,12]. The mortality rate during a 
period of approximately 6 months following discharge from 
hospital was 1.1% in the SP group and 1.7% in the placebo group. 
This difference might be due in part to differences in enrolment 
criteria. In our study, children with moderate or severe anaemia 
(Hb,7g/dL were enrolled whilst the Kenyan trials enrolled only 
children with severe anaemia (Hb,5g/dl). Severe anaemia is 
associated with an increased risk of death [26] but there is less 
evidence of increased mortality associated with moderate anaemia 
[26,27]. Another important difference between the two study areas 
is the pattern of malaria transmission. In The Gambia, malaria is 
seasonal and most cases of anaemia occur towards the end of the 
malaria transmission season so that much of the follow-up period 
occurred during the period when very little malaria transmission 
was taking place. In contrast, malaria transmission is higher and 
in the area of Kenya where the previous 
more perennial 
observations were made. In The Gambia, the majority of the 
children with severe anaemia were treated with quinine and SP. 
Both these drugs remain effective and eliminated parasitaemia in 
nearly all cases. Studies in Kenya have shown that persistent 
parasitaemia at the time of discharge and during follow-up due to 
only partially effective antimalarial 
treatment are a strong 
predictor of post-discharge mortality [11,12,28]. All the children 
enrolled in the Gambian study had easy access to health care 
during the study period and this could also have contributed to the 
low mortality observed. 
Despite its lack of a significant impact on anaemia, IPT with SP 
was partially effective at protecting against clinical attacks of 
malaria with a protective efficacy of 56%. The fact that the 
protective efficacy was not higher should not be taken as an 
indicator of SP resistance as efficacy measurements included 
children who received no drug or who spent several months 
without drug cover. A formal analysis of day 28 parasite clearance 
rate following SP treatment would almost certainly have given a 
higher efficacy figure. Administration of a total of 1700 doses of SP 
to 546 children (on an average of 3.1 occasions per child) 
prevented 101 episodes of malaria during an average period of 
follow up of 2.7 months, a saving of 1 clinical episode of malaria 
for every 17 doses of SP given, a figure comparable to that seen in 
studies of IPTi. The reduction in the number of clinical episodes of 
malaria was associated with a 27% reduction in the overall 
number of clinic visits during the follow-up period and children 
who received SP were better nourished than those who received 
placebo, consistent with findings in other studies of IPT in children 
[29]. Deaths and hospital admissions were fewer in children who 
received SP than in those who received placebo but numbers of 
events are too small for conclusions to be drawn. 
The level of protection against clinical malaria episode observed 
in this study is similar to that observed in two other previous 
studies of IPT in Kenyan children with mild to moderate anaemia 
[30,31]. In the first study, conducted in 328 afebrile children aged 
2–36 months who had a haemoglobin concentration of between 




60 and 110 g/dl, administration of SP and SP plus iron decreased 
the number of attacks of clinical malaria (hazard ratios of 0.59 and 
0.76 respectively) but the number of episodes of malaria was small 
and this reduction was not statistically significant [31]. In a second 
trial conducted in 546 children aged 2–36 months who had a 
haemoglobin concentration of 70–110 g/dL were enrolled. 
Clinical attacks of malaria were again reduced by about a half 
in children who received SP alone (hazard ratio of 0.47) but the 
difference from the placebo group was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.07) [30]. Thus, 
showed similar point 
these two trials 
estimates of levels of protection with chemoprevention with SP 
to those observed in the Gambian study although the confidence 
intervals were wide. 
The possibility that large-scale drug administration on a regular 
basis will enhance the spread of drug resistance is a concern for 
malaria control by chemoprophylaxis or IPT but our study was 
not powered to address this issue, and so our results on the 
prevalence of markers of resistance must be interpreted with 
caution. Among the samples examined on enrolment there was a 
high prevalence of the triple mutation allele at codons 108, 51 and 
59 in the dhfr gene associated with pyrimethamine resistance in 
both the SP and control groups, and these frequencies increased 
during the malaria transmission season in both groups. The 437G 
allele in the pfdhps gene associated with resistance to sulphon- 
amides did not increase in frequency, and the 540E allele in the 
dhps gene was not present in this population. We cannot ascertain 
whether the increased in molecular markers of resistance to 
pyrimethamine was related to the intervention or an indication of 
a more general process taking place in the study area. 
Compliance was high among study subjects who were scheduled 
to take three or less doses of the trial medication. However, for study 
subjects who were scheduled to take more than three doses, 
compliance was initially high but decreased progressively with a 
tendency for this effect to be more marked in children in the SP 
group. However, overall there was no significant difference in 
compliance observed between the SP and placebo groups suggesting 
that SP did not induce any adverse effects that were of concern to 
the mother or guardian. During the study, treatment was available 
to study subjects free of charge and parents were provided with 
transport money so lack of funds was not the cause of the low 
compliance associated with increased doses taken. Distance from a 
health facility was also not a likely cause as most of the study area is 
urban/peri-urban with relatively good access to health facilities. It is 
more likely that the decrease in compliance seen with increased 
length of follow-up was due to general apathy towards the project. 
Before an intervention such as this could be implemented widely, 
issues relating to compliance need to be investigated and an 
extensive education programme would be needed. 


SP was well tolerated and no severe skin reactions or other 
treatment related adverse event was reported. These finding are 
encouraging and are similar to those previously reported on the 
safety of SP in African children when used for IPTi [32] or IPTc. 
Weaknesses of the study include the fact that majority of the 
study children received their treatment towards the end of the 
season so these children received only one or two doses of 
intermittent 
treatment decreasing our ability to discriminate 
between groups. In addition, a recent pharmacokinetic study 
suggests that current dosing of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in 
young children is inadequate and that children aged 2–5 years 
should be treated with 1 g sulphadoxine and 50 mg pyrimeth- 
amine to achieve drug concentrations equivalent to those needed 
in adults for treatment of uncomplicated malaria [33]. This could 
have resulted in some study children receiving lower than 
recommended doses of SP reducing the protective efficacy of 
IPTc. 
In The Gambia, intermittent administration of SP to children 
previously admitted to hospital with anaemia did not have a 
clinically important impact on their haemoglobin concentration by 
the end of the transmission season although it did protect against 
malaria. Different results may be obtained in areas where 
transmission of malaria is higher and perennial.
