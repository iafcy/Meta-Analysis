Abstract
Background:Inmalariaendemiccountries,childrenwhohaveexperiencedanepisodeofsevereanaemiaareatincreased
risk of a recurrence of anaemia. There is a need to find ways of protecting these at risk children from malaria and
chemopreventionoffers a potentialway ofachievingthis objective.
Methods:During the 2003 and 2004 malaria transmission seasons, 1200 Gambian children with moderate or severe
anaemia (Hb concentration ,7 g/dL) were randomised to receive either monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or
placebo until the end of the malaria transmission season in which they were enrolled, in a double-blind trial. All study
subjectsweretreatedwithoralironfor28daysandmorbiditywasmonitoredthroughsurveillanceathealthcentres.The
primaryendpointwastheproportionofchildrenwithmoderateorsevereanaemiaattheendofthetransmissionseason.
Secondary endpoints included the incidence of clinical episodes of malaria during the surveillance period, outpatient
attendances, the prevalence of parasitaemia and splenomegaly, nutritional status at the end of the malaria transmission
seasonand compliance with thetreatment regimen.
Results:TheproportionsofchildrenwithaHbconcentrationof,7 g/dLattheendofthemalariatransmissionseasonwere
similarinthetwostudygroups,14/464(3.0%)inchildrenwhoreceivedatleastonedoseofSPand16/471(3.4%)inthose
who received placebo, prevalence ratio 0.89 (0.44,1.8) P=0.742. The protective efficacy of SP against episodes of clinical
malariawas53%(95%CI37%,65%).TreatmentwithSPwassafeandwelltolerated;noseriousadverseeventsrelatedtoSP
administration were observed. Mortality following discharge from hospital was low among children who received SP or
placebo (6inthe SPgroup and 9inthe placebo group respectively).
Conclusions:IntermittenttreatmentwithSPdidnotreducetheproportionofpreviouslyanaemicchildrenwithmoderateor
severe anaemia at the end of the malaria season, although it prevented malaria. The combination of appropriate
antimalarial treatment plus one month of iron supplementation and good access to healthcare during follow-up proved
effective inrestoring haemoglobinto an acceptable levelinthe Gambiansetting.
