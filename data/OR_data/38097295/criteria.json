            "criteria": "We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating monthly post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children recovering from severe anaemia. The analysis followed the PRISMA-IPD statement.11 We identified eligible studies by performing a literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on Jan 31, 2022, and again on Aug 28, 2023, without date or language restrictions (appendix p 3). The following search terms were used in PubMed: (child OR childhood OR infant OR pediatric OR paediatric) AND (malaria OR plasmodium) AND (\u201csevere anaemia\u201d OR \u201csevere anemia\u201d OR transfusion) AND (recurrence OR discharge OR postdischarge OR post-discharge). In addition, we identified other relevant studies by scanning reference lists of all identified articles and searching in Google and Google Scholar. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if they compared monthly malaria chemoprevention regimens after discharge against a placebo or the current standard of post-discharge care in a malaria-endemic area of Africa among children younger than 15 years recently discharged after hospitalisation for severe anaemia. Trials using daily or weekly malaria prophylaxis were not eligible.",
