Abstract
Objectives: Physical activity and cognitive training are effective to enhance cognition in older patients with
mildcognitiveimpairment(MCI).Xbox360Kinectcognitivegamesareacombinationofphysicalactivityand
cognitive training. The objective of this study was to determine the short- and long-term effects of Xbox 360
Kinect cognitive games on slowness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive functions
in older subjects with MCI.
Materials and Methods: A clinical trial was conducted on 44 MCI subjects. Both males and females were
randomizedintoexperimentalgroup(participatedinXbox360Kinectcognitivegames)andcontrolgroup(range
ofmotionexercisesonlyandnoXbox360Kinectcognitivegames).Subjectswereassessedbeforeandafterone

Conclusion:Xbox 360Kinect games showedbeneficial effects after short- and long-term intervention on MCI
subjects. These games can serve as potential therapeutic candidates for MCI.
