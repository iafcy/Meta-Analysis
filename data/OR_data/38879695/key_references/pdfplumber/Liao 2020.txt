abstract
bacKGrouNd: a combination of physical and cognitive training appears to be the effective intervention to improve cognitive function
in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computing technology such as virtual reality (VR) may have the potential to assist
rehabilitation in shaping brain health. However, little is known about the potential of VR-based physical and cognitive training designed as an
intervention for cognition and brain activation in elderly patients with MCI. Moreover, whether a VR program designed around functional tasks
can improve their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) requires further investigation.
AIM: This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive function, brain activation and
IADL and compared the VR intervention with combined physical and cognitive training.
dEsiGN: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Communities and day care centers in Taipei, Taiwan.
POPULATION: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomized into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training
(VR) group or a combined physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assessed for their cog-
nitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex
activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating
pathway of the intervention. RESULTS: Both groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed
significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention.
The group × time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training
(P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural
efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: VR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: VR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.

consisted of nine two-character nouns presented over four
learning trials, with recall assessed immediately and after
10-minute delays. The examiner read the 9 words on the
list aloud at one-second intervals in a fixed order over four
learning trials. After each trial, the participant was asked
to recall as many words as he/she could, in any order. Af-
ter 10 minutes, the participant was again asked to recall
the list. We calculated the total number of nouns correctly
remembered to assess immediate recall and delayed recall.
The CVVLT was translated from the original English ver-
