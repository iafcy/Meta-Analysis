Abstract
Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related
cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily
living.Thisstudyaimedatevaluatingtheeffectivenessofavirtualreality(VR)-basedrehabilitationprogramon
cognitive functions in MCI.
Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the inter-
vention group (n=30; 70.12–2.57 years) or control (n=31; 70.30–2.73 years) group. The intervention group
receivedaVR(computer-generatedinteractiveenvironments)interventioninadditiontoaconventionalcognitive
rehabilitation(CR)intervention,whereasthecontrolgroupreceivedonlytheCRintervention.Cognitivefunctions
were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational
Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric.
Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial
perception,visuomotororganization,thinkingoperation,andattention/concentrationfunctionsintheVR group
than in the control group (P<0.001 for all).

Discussion
ThisstudyexaminedtheeffectofVR-basedrehabilitation
on cognitive functions in older adultswith MCI.According
to the results of our study, 12-week CR and CR+VR inter-
ventionshadpositiveeffectsoncognitivefunctions,butthe
CR+VR group showed greater improvement in the areas of
visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, orienta-
tion,thinkingoperation,andattention/concentrationthanthe
CRgroup.
Orientation involves multidimensional cognitive func-
tions and is the first affected in diseases such as MCI and
dementia.17 Kim et al.18 reported that orientation deterio-
ratedwithincreasingageintheelderlypopulation.Hofmann
etal.19showedthatorientationskillswereimpairedinolder
adults with Alzheimer’s disease and MCI and that 12 ses-
sionsofVR-basedapplications(involvingthereallocaland
socialenvironmentsoftheparticipantsandappliedwiththe
interface system) resulted in greater improvement in orien-
tationcomparedwiththecontrolgroup.Similartothisstudy,
wefoundthattheCR+VRgroupshowedmoreimprovement
inorientationskills thantheCRgroup.Apossibleexplana-
tion for this result is that VR settings may elicit orientation
functionsmorethanthenormalenvironmentforolderadults.
In a study investigating visual processing skills in MCI, Krajcovicova et al.20 detected impairments in the visual-
spatialperceptionandvisuomotortaskpathways,whichthey
interpreted as supporting the view that MCI is a transition
