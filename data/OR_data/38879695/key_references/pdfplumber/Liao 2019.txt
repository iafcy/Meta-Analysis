Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously
interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait
performance,canbeimprovedbycombinedphysicalandcognitivetraining.Virtualreality
