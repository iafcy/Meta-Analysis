The Effects of Virtual Kayak Paddling Exercise on Postural Balance,
Muscle Performance, and Cognitive Function in Older Adults with
Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial

(p<.05),andcognitivefunction(p<.05)weresignificantlyimprovedintheVKPgroupandweresuperiortothoseinthecontrol

function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
