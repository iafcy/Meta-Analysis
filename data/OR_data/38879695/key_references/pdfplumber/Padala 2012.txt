Our results are consistent with the published literature
about the impact of Wii-Fit exercises on balance and gait
in the elderly. In a previous study conducted in an elderly
population, improvement in balance (BBS score) and an
increase in walking speed were noted with the use of the
balancegamescomponentofWii-Fit[18].Inanotherstudy
conducted on nine elderly patients, an improvement in
balance as measured with the BBS was seen along with a
decreasedriskoffallsafterfive-weekuseofWii-Fit[19].Ina
studyconductedbyWilliamsetal.oncommunity-dwelling
fallers over 70 years, improvement in balance (BBS score)
was noted in the Wii-Fit group while no improvement in
balance scores was noted in the standard care group [20].
