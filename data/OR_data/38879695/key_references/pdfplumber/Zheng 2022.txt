Mental State Examination, Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease and Cornell Scale for Depression in
Dementia were used to measure the outcomes.
Results: The results showed that there was no significant improvement on the mean scores of Mini
Mental State Examination (P = .252), however, the active game play increased the mean score of
Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (P = .005), and reduced the mean score of Cornell Scale for
Depression in Dementia (P = .001) in comparison with the usual care group.
Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the active game play was effective in improving quality
of life and alleviating depression in older people with dementia.
Clinical Implications: Findings highlight the potential for gaming as a non-pharmacological
