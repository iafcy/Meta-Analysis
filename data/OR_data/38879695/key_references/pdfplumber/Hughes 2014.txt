Abstract
Objective—We evaluated the feasibility of a trial of Wii interactive video gaming, and its
potential efficacy at improving cognitive functioning compared to health education, in a
community sample of older adults with neuropsychologically defined mild cognitive impairment
(MCI).
Methods—Twenty older adults were equally randomized to either group-based interactive video
gaming or health education for 90 minutes each week for 24 weeks. Although the primary
outcomes were related to study feasibility, we also explored the effect of the intervention on
neuropsychological performance and other secondary outcomes.
Results—All 20 participants completed the intervention, and 18 attended at least 80% of the
sessions. The majority (80%) of participants were “very much” satisfied with the intervention.
Bowling was enjoyed by the most participants, and was also the rated highest among the games
for mental, social and physical stimulation. We observed medium effect sizes for cognitive and
physical functioning in favor of the interactive video gaming condition, but these effects were not
statistically significant in this small sample.

INTRODUCTION
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as an intermediate cognitive state between
normal aging and dementia. Those with MCI have an elevated risk of developing dementia
due to Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions (Petersen et al., 2009). They may already be
experiencing subtle difficulties in everyday functioning (Hughes et al., 2012), have
substantial depressive symptoms (Apostolova and Cummings, 2008), and impairments in
gait and balance (Montero-Odasso et al., 2012). MCI may provide an optimal window for
preventive interventions as previous research suggests the presence of cognitive plasticity,
and there are preliminary findings of cognitive benefit from cognitive interventions targeting
those with MCI (Simon et al., 2012).
A large body of evidence suggests that older adults who are more engaged in mentally and
socially stimulating leisure activities have better cognitive health compared to less engaged
peers (Hertzog et al., 2009). According to the engagement hypothesis, the “substantive
complexity” of engagement is characterized by a diversity of stimuli, large numbers of
decisions, multiple factors to be considered in making decisions, and ill-defined and
apparently contradictory contingencies resulting from decisions (Schooler, 1984). The
cognitive demand associated with engaging in complex activities may be neuroprotective by
decreasing neuronal loss, increasing synaptic connectivity, up-regulating neurotropic factors,
or modifying disease pathology (Valenzuela et al., 2007). These processes contribute to a
higher level of brain or cognitive reserve that may compensate for aging- or pathology-
related (e.g., vascular, neurodegeneration) brain changes so that cognitive abilities are
preserved (Stern, 2012).
Interactive video games are a novel tool to impart cognitive stimulation because they require
players to integrate multiple cognitive processes while navigating complex and variable
environments (Green and Bavelier, 2008). For example, attentional resources (visual,
switch, and divided), processing speed, visuospatial and visuo-motor abilities (Green and
Bavelier, 2004) are required to play video games in general, and additional cognitive
processes (e.g., executive functions) can be tapped for specific games. In addition,
interactive video games can be a source of social stimulation when played with others and
can also increase physical activity (Peng et al., 2011). The Nintendo Wii™ has the
advantages of being commercially available, older adult friendly, and accommodating to
those with mobility impairments. The Wii Sports game package, including bowling, golf,
tennis, baseball, and boxing, is particularly popular among older adults. The familiarity of
these sports games combined with novelty of the interactive video gaming experience may
be an ideal cognitive intervention for those with mild impairments in cognition. While there

are preliminary reports of gains in cognitive functioning among cognitively normal older
adults who have engaged in interactive video games (Jovancevic et al., 2012; Maillot et al.,
2012; Rosenberg et al., 2010), it is unclear whether those with MCI will be interested in,
capable of, or show cognitive benefit from interactive video gaming.
The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of a group-based interactive video
gaming randomized controlled trial (RCT) in older adults with MCI drawn from the
community. We also explored its potential efficacy to improve cognitive performance
compared to a health education condition that was matched for social interaction and served
as a source of passive cognitive stimulation. We hypothesized that (1) Wii gaming would be
feasible, and (2) there would be greater gains in the clinical outcomes in the Wii group,
compared to health education group, due to the novelty of the experience and the higher
cognitive demands required for playing the games.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from an ongoing population-based cohort study of MCI, entitled
the Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study, composed of older
adults originally recruited from the voter registration list. MYHAT participants undergo an
annual comprehensive in-home assessment that includes a neuropsychological assessment
battery sensitive to mild cognitive impairments and change in cognitive functioning over
time (Ganguli et al., 2009). In addition to the conventional MCI criteria, MYHAT also
applies a “Cognitive Classification,” (Ganguli et al., 2010a)) based on neuropsychological
test performance relative to MYHAT norms (Ganguli et al., 2010b)).
Potential participants were initially screened for eligibility using MYHAT study data. The
inclusion criterion for the pilot study was classification of MCI based on Cognitive
Classification at their most recent MYHAT assessment. Exclusion criteria were severe
vision, hearing and motor impairment; history of debilitating neurologic disorders (i.e.,
Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, or seizure disorder);
any use of psychotropic medications; consuming 2–3 alcoholic drinks or more per occasion.
Additional exclusion criteria assessed for the pilot study were having played the Nintendo
Wii ™ on three or more occasions in the past year, or unable to commit to attending 20/24
intervention sessions.
Participants were equally (i.e., 50/50 split) randomly assigned to either interactive video
gaming or health education using random numbers generated using Stata Version 11
(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). The protocol was approved by the University
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
Intervention
Participants met for 90 minutes once per week for 24 weeks for a total of 36 hours. Since the
primary aim was to examine intervention feasibility, this dosage was selected in order to
evaluate the acceptability of the intervention. Sessions took place at a centrally located

church within the study area. Transportation was provided as needed. Participants received
modest cash incentives for attending the sessions and assessments.
Interactive Video Games (Wii)
The Nintendo Wii™ gaming console was used for interactive video gaming. The Wii™ uses
a wireless remote device with motion-sensing capabilities. Players use their arms and/or
bodies to simulate actions required for each game (e.g., swinging a golf club, throwing a
bowling ball). Participants played the Wii™ in stable groups of 3 or 4 members. The Wii
Sports games, including bowling, golf, tennis, and baseball, comprised the “core” games of
each of the 24 sessions. Each weekly session followed a regular schedule of first briefly
(~10–15 minutes) discussing healthy aging topics, followed by interactive video gaming for
the remainder of the session. The first 6 weeks focused on training and developing
competence with the Wii system and the Wii Sports games. Beginning in week 7,
participants were introduced to new games (e.g., Boom Blox, Wii Play, Sports Resort) for
approximately the final 15–30 minutes of the session to provide novel gaming conditions
and to maintain motivation and interest. In weeks 10 and 20, the groups competed in a “Wii
tournament” to encourage enhanced effort and social interaction.
Healthy Aging Education Program (HAEP)
There is no consensus in the field regarding the appropriate control condition for cognitive
intervention trials (Park et al.2007). The HAEP was designed to provide a source of passive
cognitive stimulation in a socially-matched setting that would allow for the effect of novel
and cognitively engaging characteristics of the Wii condition to be isolated.
All ten participants met to learn about and discuss age-specific health-related topics with
professionals from the local academic and health care communities. Handouts were
distributed each week on the topics for further reading. Topics included the “10 Keys to
Healthy Aging” (Newman et al.2010), AARP® safe driving, medication management,
caregiving, healthy cooking, sleep hygiene, emergency preparedness, urinary incontinence,
dementia resources, and others. To promote social interaction similar to the Wii groups,
participants were divided into stable groups of 3 or 4 members for small group activities for
approximately the last 30 minutes of each session. These same groups also competed in a
Jeopardy® style tournament in weeks 10 and 20 to encourage retention of the health
information and to match the level of friendly competition in the Wii tournaments.
Outcome Measures
Feasibility—We calculated the proportion of participants completing the intervention.
Attendance was examined as the average number of sessions attended and the proportion of
those attending 20/24 sessions. At the end of the intervention period, all participants rated,
on a 5-point Likert Scale (not at all to very much), their level of satisfaction with the
program and how mentally and socially engaging they found it. At the 1- year follow-up
assessment, participants indicated their level of interest in future participation and whether
or not they would recommend the program to others. Additional measures were examined
for the Wii group only, including: satisfaction with the training and use of the gaming

technology, and the level of enjoyment in, and the mental, social, and physical stimulation
of, each of the Wii Sports games.
Clinical Outcomes
Assessments were performed in a fixed order within a 2-week window at baseline, post-
intervention, and 1 year. Each assessment lasted approximately 90 minutes. The primary
outcome was cognitive performance. Secondary outcomes included subjective cognitive
ability, mood/social functioning, performance-based instrumental activities of daily living,
and gait speed.
The Computerized Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI; Saxton et al., 2009)
was used to assess cognitive performance. CAMCI is a self-administered, computer-based
set of cognitive tests tapping the domains of attention, executive function, memory, and
processing speed. The total CAMCI score is age and education adjusted based on a
normative sample, and ranges between 0–51.4 with a score of 34.3 or higher representing
“normal” performance. Two tracking tasks requiring participants to (1) track numbers (from
24-1) in reverse order (Tracking A), and (2) months forward (January – December) and
numbers in reverse (Tracking B), were added to the CAMCI battery as measures of
psychomotor speed/attention and executive functioning, respectively. We calculated
connections per second for each tracking task. The Cognitive Self-Report Questionnaire-25
(CSRQ-25; Spina et al., 2006) was used to examine intervention-related improvements in
cognition and mood/social functioning. We reverse-coded scores for the cognition and social
functioning subscales so that higher scores represented better functioning. The Timed
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL; Owsley et al., 2002) was used to evaluate
speed and accuracy of completing everyday tasks with overall time to complete all 5 tasks as
the outcome. Finally, we measured time in seconds to complete a 6-meter walk (i.e., gait
speed) as a measure of physical functioning.
Statistical Analyses
All data were analyzed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). First, baseline demographic characteristics, MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) score, and
the number of prescription medications were compared between the Wii and HAEP groups.
Next, descriptive statistics were calculated to examine the feasibility of the study.
Comparisons were made using Wilcoxon Rank Sum for continuous variables and Fisher’s
Exact test for categorical variables. To describe the magnitude and direction of change in the
clinical outcomes between baseline and post-intervention (24 weeks) and baseline and the 1
year follow-up, Cohen’s d effect size estimates were calculated as the mean difference
between pre- and post-test scores divided by the sample standard deviation (SD) of the
change score. Overall effect sizes were calculated by subtracting the HAEP effect size from
Wii group effect size, so that positive effect sizes favor the Wii group while negative effect
sizes favor the HAEP group. Total IADL time and gait speed were scored such that higher
scores represent worse performance, so that positive overall effect sizes favor the HEAP
group and negative effect sizes favor the Wii group. Due to the small sample size, the signed
rank and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were run to explore any significant differences within
and between groups, respectively.

RESULTS
Feasibility Assessment
We received funding to enroll 20 participants for this trial. We first screened MYHAT
participants based on whether or not they would be interested in participating in a group
activity study comparing the potential health benefits of playing the Nintendo Wii™ and
discussing healthy aging topics. Among the 445 participants classified as MCI, 128 (28.7%)
expressed potential interest in the study and 91 (20.4%) were eligible to be contacted. They
were mailed brochures describing the study followed by a phone call by a MYHAT study
interviewer. Over a 4 week recruitment window, 37 were not interested, 14 could not be
contacted, 3 had played the Nintendo Wii ™ on three or more occasions in the past year,10
were unable to commit to attending 20/24 intervention sessions, 7 were interested but
unavailable at the required time, and 20 participants were enrolled (Figure 1). Those
enrolled had a mean age of 77.4 [SD 5.8] years, were 70% were female and 80% White; had
a mean education of 13.5 [SD 2.14] years and a mean MMSE score of 27.1 [SD 1.8], and
were taking an average of 4.2 [SD 3.4] prescription medications. There were no significant
differences between the Wii and HAEP intervention groups at baseline (Table 1).
All 20 participants completed the intervention and post-intervention assessments without
difficulty. Only one participant was unable to complete the CAMCI at post-intervention due
to transportation issues, and therefore did not receive a total score. Nineteen participants
completed the one year follow-up assessment, with 1 participant lost due to death. The Wii
group attended an average of 23.1 [SD 1.1, range 21–24] sessions compared to 21.8 [SD 3.3,
range 14–24] in the HAEP group; 18 participants attended at least 20/24 sessions; 9 attended
all sessions.
The majority of participants were “very much” satisfied with the intervention; with all being
at least “more or less” satisfied. The program was rated “very” mentally and socially
stimulating by more Wii than HAEP group participants. All indicated that they would
participate in the intervention again in the future, and nearly all would recommend it to
others. (Figure 2). The Wii and HAEP groups were not significantly different in any of the
feasibility measures examined (all p > 0.20).
Examining participants’ level of satisfaction with the training and equipment, we found that
the majority of participants were “very much” satisfied with the training provided and the
ease of playing the Wii games. Further, more than half were “very much” satisfied with
using the controller and the games selected. With regard to the level of enjoyment in and the
cognitive, social, and physical stimulation of each of the core Wii Sports games, bowling
was enjoyed most by the participants and was most frequently endorsed as providing “very
much” mental, social, and physical stimulation. Golf was the second most frequently
enjoyed game, and was also second with regard to level of mental, social, and physical
stimulation. Baseball and tennis were enjoyed by fewer participants, and were not
considered as mentally, socially, and physically stimulating as bowling or golf (Table 2).

Exploratory Assessment of Clinical Outcomes
Overall, neither condition significantly affected cognitive functioning or any secondary
outcome. Medium effect size estimates were found for the CAMCI total score, Tracking B
task, subjective cognition, and gait speed in favor of the Wii group (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The primary goal of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of an interactive video
gaming intervention in individuals with MCI. Results suggest that older adults with MCI are
capable of engaging in interactive video gaming over a period of 6 months. Although not
statistically significant, medium-sized effects were observed in favor of the Wii group,
compared to health education, for objective and subjective cognitive functioning as well as
physical functioning. These preliminary findings support a more intensive and adequately
powered trial to draw more definite conclusions.
By recruiting from an established cohort study of MCI we found that 29% of those with
MCI were interested in participating in the study. This is lower than MYHAT participants
classified as cognitively normal among whom 36% were potentially interested. These results
provide important information to guide recruitment efforts for behavioral intervention
studies targeting those with MCI. We were able to enroll 20 participants during a short
recruitment period. We may have reached our target of 30 if we had a longer recruitment
window and/or offered additional session meeting times. We had high levels of attendance
and retention at the sessions, and high interest in participating again if given the opportunity.
We speculate cautiously this was related to the following factors. First, we recruited
participants from a well-established cohort study using study interviewers with whom they
were already familiar. Second, we lessened the burden of study participation by arranging
transportation for those in need, and by choosing a familiar and easily accessible location
with ample parking and interior space for all study activities. We provided simple, healthy
snacks and a small incentive payment tracked using a wallet card; developed strong rapport
between the interventionists and participants; encouraged social cohesion among the
participants through small group discussions and activities; and held the intervention from
June – November to avoid inclement weather and major holidays.
Through this work we were also able to demonstrate that community-dwelling older adults
with MCI are capable of, enjoy, and are stimulated by interactive video games. We observed
that bowling was enjoyed most, followed by golf. These games were also perceived as
offering more mental, social, and physical stimulation. Although the self-perceived level of
stimulation may provide useful information, future work is needed to objectively measure
the level of mental, social, and physical stimulation provided by interactive video games.
Exploratory analyses of our pilot data did not reveal any significant changes on the clinical
outcomes. Due to the small sample, interpretation of the effect sizes should be made with
caution. We found a medium-sized improvement for global cognition, perceived cognitive
ability, and gait speed in favor of the Wii group after 36 hours of active intervention spread
over 6 months. This is promising given that other computer-based cognitive interventions,
including non-interactive video gaming, have produced effects sizes ranging between 0.09

and 1.70 for cognitive measures in cognitively normal older adults (Kuider et al., 2012), and
there is growing evidence that older adults with MCI can also benefit from cognitive
interventions across a number of cognitive domains as well as non-cognitive outcomes
(Belleville, 2008; Jean et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011). A future, adequately powered, trial
should examine whether a more intensive dosage would lead to significant improvement.
To include older adults with mobility impairments, we did not require participants to stand
to play any of the games and did not emphasize the physical nature of the gaming. However,
8/10 participants reported that Wii gaming was “very much” and the other 2 reported “quite”
physically stimulating, suggesting that even the minimal effort to play the games may have
provided more physical activity than participants typically engage in during their daily
routines. There is growing literature supporting the benefits of physical activity for cognitive
health (Erickson et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010) as well as physical functioning. Therefore;
the preliminary results here favoring the Wii group may be a due in part to increased
physical activity. Future work should examine the unique and combined influence of the
cognitive, social, and physical stimulation provided by interactive video games on cognitive
health.
Conduct of this pilot study highlighted the importance of social interaction among the group
members. There is wide variation across cognitive intervention studies in whether the format
is an individual or group setting. Evidence suggests that social relationships influence
cognitive functioning (Flatt and Hughes, 2013), possibly through the cognitive demand of
interacting with others in social situations. Social relationships are also related to a variety of
other health outcomes associated with cognitive functioning, such as cardiovascular disease
and depression (Cohen, 2004). In one intervention study, tai chi, walking, and social
interaction were evaluated for their effects on cognitive functioning and brain volume, as
compared to no intervention. The tai chi and social interaction conditions, but not walking,
led to improvement on select cognitive measures and increases in brain volume (Mortimer et
al., 2012). Social interaction may also be important for adherence to the intervention (Stathi
et al., 2010). At the exit interview, nearly all participants mentioned that they had decided to
join and/or remain in the study because they enjoyed interacting with other participants.
Future work should examine the extent that, and mechanism by which, social interaction
influences the efficacy of cognitive interventions.
“Brain games” are aggressively being marketed to older adults for their benefits to brain and
cognitive health (Fernandez, 2011). There is also a rapid growth in popularity of interactive
video games such as the Nintendo Wii among older adults (Moses, 2007). The scientific
community has an obligation to assess these games’ effectiveness using the same level of
scientific rigor demanded of pharmacological studies. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to examine interactive video gaming as a source of cognitive and social stimulation in
older adults with MCI. Since the primary aim was to examine the feasibility of the study
protocol, the sample was small and limited our ability to conduct reliable inferential
statistical analyses to test for significant changes in cognitive and other secondary outcomes.
Our neuropsychological definition of MCI may have led to heterogeneity in the sample in
terms of underlying etiology, and thus limited our ability to detect intervention effects. The

MYHAT sample of MCI is, however more representative of older adults in the community
with mild difficulties in cognitive functioning than clinic-based samples (Farias et al., 2009).
Conclusion
Interactive video games are potentially useful tools to increase cognitive, social, as well as
physical activity in older adults without requiring specialized settings or trained
professionals. They are relatively affordable, can be can be played at home alone or with
others, even virtually, and there are a wide array of game choices that give players a
“personalized” experience based on their preferences and abilities, which reduce barriers
and increase adherence to participation. These considerations, along with demonstration of
feasibility and preliminary gains in cognitive and physical functioning, support a larger,
adequately powered, trial in older adults with MCI.

Key Points
1. “Brain games” are aggressively being marketed to older adults for their benefits
to brain and cognitive health, and interactive video games such as the Nintendo
Wii are increasingly popular among older adults.
2. This pilot study demonstrated that interactive video gaming is feasible in
community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
3. Exploratory analyses did not reveal any statistically significant improvements,
although, medium effect sizes were found for objective and subjective cognitive
functioning and physical functioning in favor of interactive video gaming
compared to health education.
