revealed that the EXER-TC and TC groups performed better
than the control group in gait speed and DTC of speed during
cognitive dual-tasks after training (gait speed: EXER-TC vs.
control, p < 0.001, TC vs. control, p = 0.001; DTC of speed:
EXER-TCvs.control,p=0.002,TCvs.control,p=0.017).
DISCUSSION
We compared the effects of EXER-TC with those of TC and
control on cognitive function and dual-task gait performance.
First,boththeEXER-TCandTCgroupshadbetterperformance
than the control group in the executive function and attention
domains as measured by TMT, SCWT, and one-back test after
training, but only EXER-TC exerted a more beneficial effect
than the control for the global cognition (MOCA) and SCWT
number. Second, compared with the control group, both the
EXER-TC and TC groups experienced beneficial effects for gait
speed and DTC of speed during cognitive dual-task walking
after training. Finally, there were no significant between-group
differencesforEXER-TCvs.TCforcognitiveanddual-taskgait
performanceaftertraining. Both the TC and EXER-TC groups improved in cognitive
function in the executive function domain. The TMT, SCWT,
and one-back test are indicators of executive control abilities
associated with cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control and
working memory (Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). These results
were consistent with previous study, which found that TC
training improves TMT test scores (Sungkarat et al., 2017).
TMTArepresentsvisuoperceptualability,TMTBreflectsworking
memory and task-switching ability, and Delta TMT indicates
mental flexibility. Practicing TC requires use of a series
of cognitive activities, including movement recall, switching,
attention,inhibitorycontrolandvisuospatialorientationdevoted
to multisegmental movement. Study results suggest that TC
