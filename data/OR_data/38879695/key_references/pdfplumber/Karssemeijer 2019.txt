Abstract
Background: Exerciseisoftenproposedasanon-pharmacologicalinterventiontodelaycognitivedeclinein
peoplewith dementia, but evidence remains inconclusive. Previous studies suggest that combining physical
exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising
intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim
of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in
older adults with dementia.
Methods: A three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an
activecontrolinterventionconsistingofrelaxationandflexibilityexercises.Individualswithdementiawererandomized

Conclusions:Toourknowledge,thisisthefirstRCTevaluatingtheeffectsofexergametrainingandaerobictraining
on cognitive functioning in people with dementia. We found that both exergame training and aerobic training
improve psychomotor speed, compared to an active control group. This finding may be clinically relevant as
psychomotor speed is an important predictor for functional decline. No effects were found on executive function,
episodic memory and working memory.
