The Effects of Virtual Kayak Paddling Exercise on Postural Balance, 
Muscle Performance, and Cognitive Function in Older Adults with 
Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial 

Deterioration of physical and psychological health is an important issue in older adults aged 65 years or more. This study aimed to 
determine whether a virtual kayak paddling (VKP) exercise could improve postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive 
function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to the VKP (n = 30) or control 
group (n = 30). Participants in the VKP group performed the paddling exercise in a virtual environment for 60 min twice a week 
for 6 weeks, whereas those in the control group performed home exercises. Postural balance (p < .05), muscle performance 
(p < .05), and cognitive function (p < .05) were signiﬁcantly improved in the VKP group and were superior to those in the control 
group (p < .05). Thus, the ﬁndings indicate that VKP exercise improves postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive 
function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. 

Most older adults prefer participating in sedentary activities, 
rather than physical activities to maintain health because of age- 
related physiological changes and the external environment (Kim, 
1999). Deceased activity levels and social participation accelerate 
aging-related musculoskeletal, neurological, sensory, and cogni- 
tive system changes (Faulkner, Larkin, Claﬂin, & Brooks, 2007; 
Zawadka-Kunikowska et al., 2014). In older adults, regular physi- 
cal exercise training is important because exercise or leisure 
activities are recommended to delay or reverse age-related changes 
(Levin, Netz, & Ziv, 2017). 
Kayaking has been recently introduced among older adults as a 
leisure activity as it can be performed by anyone (Bjerkefors & 
Thorstensson, 2006). This exercise has various physical health 
advantages for older adults. Kayaking is an easily accessible sport 
used to improve postural control because the postural sway induced 
by the paddling movement must be compensated for, which 
constantly challenges the ability of participants to maintain their 
posture (Bjerkefors, Carpenter, & Thorstensson, 2007; Grigorenko 
et al., 2004). Individuals who perform kayaking have better 
mediolateral 
translation 
trunk stability in response to lateral 
(Bjerkefors et al., 2007). Hurt and Grabiner (2015) reported that 
age-related changes could hinder compensatory strategies that 
ensure stability while performing a lateral stepping and forward 
walking tasks in older adults. Therefore, kayak paddling movement 
in the sagittal planes could be emphasized to improve postural 
balance. 
Another positive effect of kayaking is that it increases upper 
extremity muscle strength and endurance at the same time without 
any upper extremity problems or overload (Bjerkefors, Jansson, & 
Thorstensson, 2006; Bjerkefors & Thorstensson, 2006). Handgrip 
strength is necessary for performing object-manipulating action, 
such as grasping, holding, and lifting. In addition, handgrip

University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Lee is also with the Department of Physical 
Therapy, Sahmyook University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Lee (swlee@syu.ac.kr)

strength reﬂects the overall muscle strength and functional condi- 
tions (Moy, Darus, & Hairi, 2015) and is widely used as a measure 
of general health in older adults (Savino et al., 2013). The handgrip 
strength test is an inexpensive and time-efﬁcient measurement 
procedure that can be easily performed. Sayer et al. (2006) found 
that people with low handgrip strength have decreased health- 
related quality of life. 
Handgrip strength is useful to monitor cognitive impairment 
and a higher handgrip strength seems to protect against cognitive 
decline (Fritz, McCarthy, & Adamo, 2017). Individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment suffer from a reduced memory span, execu- 
tive function impairments, and an inability to concentrate 
(Salloway & Correia, 2009). Executive function-related activities, 
such as multitasking and planning, have been linked to the ability 
of performing a series of movements (Gothe, Kramer, & McAuley, 
2014). Thus, executive dysfunction contributes to the restriction of 
instrumental activities of daily living (Marshall et al., 2011). 
Impairment of instrumental activities of daily living leads to early 
loss of social engagement and independence. Thus, improvement 
of muscle strength through the kayak paddling movement might 
help maintain or improve cognitive function and quality of life. 
Kayaking has the advantages of reducing age-related physical 
and cognitive deterioration, but it has a safety issue considering that 
it should be performed on water. Virtual reality is used to safely 
simulate natural motion (Bohil, Alicea, & Biocca, 2011), ensure 
consistent and planned application of standardized therapeutic 
protocols, and increase patient independence using a close simula- 
tion of the real-world environment (Cho & Lee, 2014). Virtual 
reality is a computer-simulated environment and interaction of 
computer-generated experience used to enhance physical or psy- 
chological function in another place (Banos et al., 2000). The 
limitation of kayaking may be overcome by performing the exer- 
cise in a virtual reality-aided environment. Virtual reality is often 
employed in exercise programs for older adults because of its 
unprecedented ability to stimulate visual and auditory sensations 
(Cherniack, 2011). Virtual reality allows for real-time feedback and 
extends the capabilities of home-bound participants (de Bruin, 



Schoene, Pichierri, & Smith, 2010). The use of virtual reality has 
reduced health costs and increased physical activities in a limited 
environment in the form of exergames. Furthermore, virtual reality 
has increased the motivation and participation rate of individuals 
compared with conventional nonvirtual reality exercise (Bryanton 
et al., 2006; de Bruin et al., 2010). 
In our previous study, the effects of ground kayak paddling 
exercise were demonstrated (Choi & Lee, 2018). Although the 
previous kayak paddling exercise study provided positive clinical 
evidence on the physical and cognitive function of older adults, it 
could not provide motivation and a sense of immersion such as that 
provided by kayaking. Recent virtual reality studies have presented 
new applications, such as video recording, which enable the use of 
different exercises in various environments. Therefore, the present 
study aimed to investigate the effects of a virtual kayak paddling 
(VKP) exercises using real-world video recording on postural 
control, muscle performance, and cognitive function in older adults 
with mild cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that participants 
who performed the VKP exercise would have improved postural 
control, muscle strength, and cognitive function. 


This randomized controlled trial was registered with the Interna- 
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform (KCT0002453). Partici- 
pants were recruited from a welfare center between January 10 and 
20, 2015, and the study was conducted from March to May 2015. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: community-dwelling older 
adults aged 65 years or older who scored <26 points on the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment, able to communicate, and commit 
to 6 weeks of intervention in this study. The exclusion criteria were 
as follows: individuals who had neurological, musculoskeletal, or 
upper extremity impairment; severe cognitive disorders such as 
dementia or depression; untreated medical conditions; visual def- 
icits; or individuals who were unable to maintain a sitting posture 
for at least 20 min. All participants were educated about the 
experimental protocol and provided written informed consent 
before enrollment. The study was approved by the Sahmyook 
University Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2015-004). 

A physical therapist of the welfare center promoted this study 
within the facility both verbally and through an advertisement 
posted on the bulletin board. Individuals who volunteered as 
participants were screened for compliance with the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Selected subjects were randomly assigned 
to the VKP (n = 30) or control (n = 30) group in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization was conducted using Random Allocation Software 
2.0 (Saghaei, 2004). The pretest evaluation of demographics, 
postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function 
was performed a week before study commencement. Participants 
in the VKP group exercised for 6 weeks. Exercise sessions were 
conducted by an instructor and assistants twice a week for 60 min. 
The VKP exercise included warm-up, main exercise, and cooldown 
periods and was implemented using a recorded video. Participants 
assigned to the control group did not participate in the exercise 
program; instead, they performed only home exercises. The post- 
test evaluation was conducted a week after the end of the exercise 
program in the same manner as the pretest evaluation. The data 
were then analyzed (Figure 1). 
VKP Exercise 
This exercise program was modiﬁed for kayaking and conducted as 
a group exercise. Each session consisted of a 10-min warm-up, 
40-min VKP exercise, and 10-min cooldown. The warm-up 
included massage with a sensory ball, gentle whole body stretch- 
ing, and deep breathing exercises with light music. The shoulders 
and trunk were stretched to increase muscle ﬂexibility and safety. 
During the VKP exercise, participants were seated on a chair 
while practicing the exercise, observing a video projected on a 
screen. One instructor demonstrated the exercise, and two assis- 
tants corrected the postures and movements of the participants. The 
exercise was introduced and practiced in the ﬁrst session. The 
participants were informed that the direction of the kayak boat 
movement displayed on the screen was opposite to the rowing 
direction. The recorded kayak boat movements included forward 
and backward motion, right and left turns, and a stationary position. 
An arrow was marked on the screen prior to the change of direction 
of the boat, and the participants rowed toward the direction in 
which the boat was moving. The weight of the paddle used in this 
exercise was 1 kg, and the length was 180 cm. A soft balance foam 
(TheraBand Exercise Station, Hadamar, Germany) was placed 
under the chairs to simulate the feeling of ﬂoating in the water. 
The video was ﬁlmed on a lake in South Korea, edited using a video 
editing software (Vegas Pro version 13; Sony, Tokyo, Japan), and 
projected onto a 100-in. screen (Model BX327; LG, Seoul, South 
Korea). To maximize the effect of the exercise, the assistants asked 
the participants to row with increased effort (Figure 2). In the 
middle of this exercise program, a 3-min walking break was 
included to prevent muscle fatigue. 
The cooldown after the main exercise was performed in the 
same manner as the warm-up to prevent muscle fatigue and sudden 
hypoglycemia, facilitate muscle relaxation, and normalize the heart 
and respiratory rates (Brouwer, Walker, Rydahl, & Culham, 2003). 

The physical therapist who had been working in the welfare center 
instructed home exercise to the control group during the ﬁrst, third, 
and ﬁfth week. The warm-up and cooldown exercises for the 
control group were the same as those for the VKP group. The 
home exercise program consisted of William ﬂexion exercises, 
curl-ups, sideways leg lifts, prone leg lifts, supine leg lifts, and 
prone trunk hyperextensions (Lee, Kim, & Lim, 2006). The 
participants were instructed to perform three sets of 10 repetitions 
for each home exercise during the ﬁrst week, adding 10 repetitions 
per set every 2 weeks. In the ﬁnal week, the participants performed 
three sets of 30 repetitions for each exercise. The home exercises 
were performed twice a week for 6 weeks, and the instructor 
conﬁrmed the performance of exercises weekly by phone. 

Demographics, static and dynamic postural balance, muscle per- 
formance, and cognitive function were assessed by six blinded 
examiners. 
Primary outcome measure. Static postural balance was assessed 
using the one-leg stance test (Jonsson, Seiger, & Hirschfeld, 2004) 
and the Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd., Jyväskylä, Finland; 
Choi, Lee, & Lee, 2015). The system consisted of a safety bar and 
an equilateral triangular force platform. It was connected to a laptop 
via Bluetooth technology at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz. 




The static postural balance using the Good Balance System was 
measured under two visual conditions, eyes open and eyes closed, 
for 30 s each while participants were seated on a chair on the 
platform. The participants were instructed to sit maintaining a 
forward gaze, feet not touching the ﬂoor, and arms folded across 
the chest. Static postural balance was assessed three times and 
averaged for data analysis. The test–retest reliability was .46 and .53 
with the eyes open and closed, respectively, in mean medial–lateral 
postural sway, and .69 with the eyes open or closed in anterior– 
posterior postural sway (Ceria-Ulep et al., 2010). Dynamic postural 
balance was assessed using the timed up and go test (intraclass 
correlation coefﬁcient [ICC] = .97; Steffen, Hacker, & Mollinger, 
2002); functional reach test (ICC = .92; Duncan, Weiner, Chandler, 
& Studenski, 1990; Granacher, Lacroix, Muehlbauer, Roettger, & 
Gollhofer, 2013); Berg Balance Scale (ICC = .98; Berg, Wood- 
Dauphinee, Williams, & Maki, 1992); and Four Square Step Test 
(ICC = .98; Dite & Temple, 2002). 
Secondary outcome measure. Arm curl test (Singh et al., 2014) 
and handgrip strength (Abizanda et al., 2012) were used to assess 
muscle performance. The arm curl test measured the maximum 
number of biceps curl repetitions performed with a 2-kg or 3-kg 
dumbbell in 30 s using the dominant arm of women or men, 
respectively. Participants sat upright maintaining the initial posture 
without bending the trunk forward. This test has shown good test– 
retest reliability, and the ICC was .96 (Miotto, Chodzko-Zajko, 
Reich, & Supleer, 1999). Handgrip strength was measured using a 
hand-held dynamometer (Medical Handgrip Dynamometer model 
DHS-88; DETECTO, Webb City, MO). While sitting, the parti- 
cipants were instructed to apply their maximum grip strength with 
the elbow joint at 90° ﬂexion. The peak value from three trials was 
used for data analysis. The ICC was .97, indicating the high 
accuracy of the measurement (Wang & Chen, 2010). 
Cognitive function was assessed using Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (Freitas, Simoes, Alves, & Santana, 2013) and General 
Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (Brodaty, Kemp, & Low, 
2004). Montreal Cognitive Assessment assesses various cognitive 
domains, such as attention and concentration, executive function, 
memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, 
calculations, and orientation. The test–retest reliability for this 
assessment was .75, and a good speciﬁcity of 84% and great 
sensitivity of 89% was shown for screening mild cognitive 
impairment (Lee et al., 2008). The General Practitioner Assessment 
of Cognition is a reliable and efﬁcient screening instrument for 
in the primary care setting. 
detecting dementia and is useful 
The General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition score is not 




inﬂuenced by the linguistic and cultural background of a subject, 
making it a useful screening tool in a multicultural patient setting. 
The test–retest reliability for this test was .87, and sensitivity and 
speciﬁcity were determined to be .85 and .86, respectively (Brodaty 
et al., 2002). 

SPSS statistical software (version 19.0; IBM, Chicago, IL) was 
used to perform the statistical analyses. All data were analyzed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle, and the results are 
presented as mean ± SD. Missing data were deﬁned as missing 
completely at random by missing data analysis and were substi- 
tuted by multiple imputation methods. The missing data were 
imputed by using Fully Conditional Speciﬁcation algorithm which 
is an iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Five imputed 
datasets were generated and then pooled outcomes were used for 
the intention-to-treat analysis. Prior to training, the normality of the 
data was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Chi-square analysis 
and independent samples t test were used to evaluate intergroup 
homogeneity. As all dependent variables were normally distrib- 
uted, separate 2 (Group) × 2 (Time) repeated-measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess VKP exercise over 
two-time points (pretest and 6 weeks posttest). The effect size 
(partial eta squared) was calculated as the ratio of the between- 
group sum of squares to the sum of the between-groups sum of 
squares and the error sum of squares. Eta squared of .02, .13, and 
.26 were interpreted as small, moderate, and large, respectively. 
Pearson correlations analysis was used to examine the associations 
between descriptive statistics. 
The sample size was estimated using the G*power software 
(version 3.1; HHU, Düsseldorf , Germany) based on the results 
of a previous study that reported a large effect size (.80; Karahan 
et al., 2015). In clinical trials, 80% power is typically required. The 
level of signiﬁcance was set to .05 (two-tailed). The minimum 
sample size was 26 individuals per group. Based on an anticipated 
dropout rate of 10%, 30 individuals were assigned to each group. 
The statistical signiﬁcance was set to .05 for all tests. 

Sample Description 
A total of 77 older adults (age range, 69–85 years) volunteered for 
this study; 17 did not meet the inclusion criteria as they had cardiac 
diseases (n = 2), severe cognitive disorder (n = 5), shoulder limited 
range of motion (n = 8), or stroke (n = 2). Thus, 60 subjects were 
randomly assigned to the VKP or control group. Three participants 
dropped out: one from the VKP group underwent operation 
because of an accident, and two from the control group did not 
participate in the posttest evaluation because of moving to other 
city. A total of 57 participants completed >80% of the exercises, but 
60 subjects were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat 
principle. There were no signiﬁcant 
intergroup differences at 
baseline for any parameter (p > .05) (Table 1). The attendance 
was 92% for the VKP group and 88% for the control group. 


Table 2 compares the pretest and posttest static and dynamic 
postural balance in the two groups. Two-way repeated-measures 
ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in medial–lateral postural 
sway with eyes open, F(1, 58) = 11.346, p = .001, η2 = .163; ante- 
rior–posterior postural sway with eyes open, F(1, 58) = 8.635, 
p = .005, η2 = .129; velocity moment with eyes open, F(1, 58) = 
4.155, p = .046, η2 = .066; medial–lateral postural sway with eyes 
closed, F(1, 58) = 7.683, p = .007, η2 = .117; anterior–posterior 
postural sway with eyes closed, F(1, 58) = 7.659, p = .008, η2 = 
.116; and velocity moment with eyes closed, F(1, 58) = 9.903, 
p = .003, η2 = .145, in the VKP group compared with those in the 
control group. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed that 
the one-leg stance test results for the right, F(1, 58) = 9.099, p = .004, 
η2 = .135, and left one-leg stance, F(1, 58) = 4.432, p = .040, 
η2 = .071, were signiﬁcantly higher in the VKP group.

than in the control group. 

The effects of the VKP exercise on muscle performance are 
presented in Table 3. The arm curl test, right handgrip strength, 
and left handgrip strength scores in the VKP group were higher 
by 29.70%, 14.69%, and 15.36%, respectively, than those in the 
control group. Group-by-time interaction effect was signiﬁcantly

This study proved that a virtual reality-based kayak paddling 
exercise effectively improves the physical and cognitive functions 
of 
adults with mild cognitive 
impairment. The ﬁndings of the present study show that VKP 

exercise induces signiﬁcant increases in both postural control and 
muscular strength and are consistent with previously published 
results on kayak ergometer training (Bjerkefors et al., 2007; 
Bjerkefors et al., 2006; Bjerkefors & Thorstensson, 2006). Previ- 
ous studies used higher kayak ergometer training intensities 
because participants were patients with spinal cord injury or elite 
kayakers and it may be inappropriate for older adults (Bjerkefors 
et al., 2007; Gomes et al., 2012). In addition, ergometer machines 
are expensive and require individual monitoring during training 
(Bjerkefors et al., 2007; Bjerkefors et al., 2006). On the contrary, 
this study used a VKP exercise protocol suitable for older adults 
and performed as a group exercise in a well-controlled virtual 
reality environment. The advantage of a group exercise is that it can 
be performed at a speciﬁc location and time in accordance with a 
schedule set in advance (King, 1994). The group setting also affects 
the compliance of subjects (Barnett, Smith, Lord, Williams, & 
Baumand, 2003). For example, it is likely that competition among 
the subjects could have contributed to the high participation rate 
seen in the present study. The unique advantages of VKP exercise 
are that it is a good balance exercise and makes participants think 
about the paddling direction during exercise because paddling 
direction is opposite to the kayak boat movement displayed to

the screen. This can stimulate more cognitive processing than 
simple repetitive movements. Another advantage is that VKP 
exercise has made it possible to make an outdoor activity like 
kayaking be exercised indoors using real-world video recording. 
VKP exercise signiﬁcantly increased the dynamic and static 
balance because it involved a consistent rotatory movement of the 
trunk. The movements during kayak paddling are performed in 
a diagonal direction, which stimulates the core muscles. From 
a functional viewpoint, core muscles support the connections of 
upper and lower limbs to the trunk through the pelvic and shoulder 
girdle muscles. Moreover, these muscles function to transmit angular 
momentum and torque while performing physical activities required 
for sports, leisure, ﬁtness, and daily life through kinetic chains 
(Behm, Drinkwater, Willardson, & Cowley, 2010). Poor core 
muscle recruitment makes it more difﬁcult to perform daily activities 
or movements (Ferreira et al., 2010). Hwang et al. (2008) reported 
that older adults show a delay in the paraspinal reﬂex latencies 
compared with younger adults and that the aging process is associ- 
ated with decreased spinal motor control (Hwang, Lee, Park, & 
Kwon, 2008). Older adults experience gradual muscle degeneration 
and a decrease in recruitment speed. Trunk stability is closely related 
to balance and co-activated prior to or upon the occurrence of 
external forces by anticipatory postural adjustments. Such feedfor- 
ward activation is based on experience, and trunk inactivity leads to 
poor motor control and loss of postural balance (Frank & Patla, 
2003). Suri et al. (2009) demonstrated the inﬂuence of the trunk 
muscles in mobility-limited older adults on balance and mobility 
performance. They reported that trunk endurance is related to Berg 
Balance Scale score and that trunk muscle strength is associated with 
the performance in the one-leg stance test (Suri, Kiely, Leveille, 
Frontera, & Bean, 2009). In this study, Berg Balance Scale score and 
one-leg stance time were signiﬁcantly increased in the VKP group, 
and this supports the fact that VKP exercise contributed to the 
improvement of trunk muscle strength and endurance. 
The VKP exercise was performed while sitting on a chair, which 
decreased the risk of falling. The use of the soft balance foam gave 
participants the feeling of actually being on the water and facilitated 
the external sway, exposing the participants to constant instability 
combined with the internal sway achieved by paddling (Srivastava, 
Taly, Gupta, Kumar, & Murali, 2009). This exercise was a modiﬁed 
form of kayaking, and the participants beneﬁtted from its signiﬁcant 
effect on postural balance and from the safety solution provided 
by the modiﬁcation for the problems associated with kayaking. 
Reduced proprioception is one of the causes of poor postural balance 
in older adults (Borel & Alescio-Lautier, 2014). Proprioception may 
have been stimulated in the participants because of the various trunk 
muscle length changes occurring owing to the postural sway expe- 
rienced during paddling movements. 
The VKP exercise is considered a resistance exercise as the 
combined effect of air and paddle weight provides resistance. Low 
resistance and a number of repetitive paddling motions may have 
contributed to the increase in muscle strength, as shown in the 
results of the present study. Moreover, kayak paddling requires fast 
and intensive movements of the upper limbs, which may have 
accelerated the improvement of upper limb strength. Van Roie, 
Delecluse, Coudyzer, Boonen, and Bautmans (2013) reported that 
low resistance training, such as 80 to 100 repetitions at 20% of one 
repetition maximum for a total of 36 sessions, resulted in muscle 
hypertrophy (Van Roie et al., 2013). Watanabe, Madarame, Oga- 
sawara, Nakazato, and Ishii (2014) reported that low-intensity 
exercise (30% of one repetition maximum) increased the muscle 
size and strength in older adults aged 60–77 years (Watanabe et al., 


2014). The exercise protocol comprised three sets of eight repeti- 
tions of an eccentric contraction for 3 s, a concentric contraction 
for 3 s, and an isometric contraction for 1 s, performed twice a week 
for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, cross-sectional magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed an increase in muscle size (p < .01) and strength 
(p < .05). This demonstrates that 
the total muscle contraction 
time and number of repetitions are related to muscle size and 
strength gain. 
In the present study, handgrip strength was signiﬁcantly 
increased after VKP exercise, and improvements in handgrip 
strength might contribute to improvements in functions such as 
postural balance and cognition. Handgrip strength represents the 
overall physical condition, and an increase in handgrip strength 
could be interpreted as a protective factor against multimorbidity of 
chronic diseases (Chen et al., 2012; Cheung, Nguyen, Au, Tan, & 
Kung, 2012). Garcia-Pena et al. (2013) reported that a 1 kg 
decrease in handgrip strength of 20.65 kg in a male corresponds 
to a functional decline by 14.9% (Garcia-Pena et al., 2013). Alfaro- 
Acha et al. (2006) observed that people with low handgrip strength 
displayed lower mini-mental state examination scores after 7 years 
of follow-up and that a low handgrip strength was signiﬁcantly 
related to decreased cognition (Alfaro-Acha et al., 2006). Based on 
the ﬁndings of previous studies, it is reasonable to assume that an 
increase in handgrip strength is involved in cognitive improve- 
ment. Furthermore, the fact that the participants were required to 
constantly coordinate paddling direction with the direction of the 
kayak boat could facilitate cognitive improvement. The correlation 
between physical and cognitive functions is noteworthy. The 
human frontal lobe gives commands for movement control, and 
the prefrontal areas perform executive function and mental proces- 
sing, which are deteriorated by aging (Berchicci, Lucci, & Di 
Russo, 2013). Fast and efﬁcient information processing increases 
cognitive function, which is affected by the integrity of the white 
brain matter (Penke et al., 2010). The VKP exercise required quick 
movement decisions such as changes in paddling direction and 
bimanual coordinated movement based on the situation. Neural 
processing through the cerebellum and basal ganglia is required to 
coordinate and perform the desired movements, and integration in 
the association area of the brain is required for changing the 
direction of rowing based on the arrows on the screen (Kandel 
et al., 2013). Bimanual coordinated movement generates stronger 
brain activation than unimanual movement (Swinnen, 2002). 
Cognitive decline is linked with cerebral blood ﬂow in older adults 
(Stoquart-ElSankari et al., 2007). Regular exercise can improve 
age-related cerebral perfusion by microvascular changes, resulting 
in an increase in cerebral blood oxygenation and brain activity 
(Villringer & Dirnagl, 1995). Therefore, VKP exercise might 
inﬂuence the integration of white brain matter and contribute to 
cognitive improvement by maintaining or increasing the brain 
volume of the participants. In older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment, improved executive function might be useful for 
performing high-level functional tasks of daily living. 
This study has some limitations. It is difﬁcult to generalize the 
effects of VKP exercise because this exercise was implemented for a 
short term in mostly older women with mild cognitive impairment. 
The supervision provided during the VKP exercise might have 
allowed the VKP group to focus more on intervention than the 
control group because the instructor may contribute to participant’s 
exercise enjoyment and the development of self-efﬁcacy during 
supervised exercise (Carrasco, Martinez-Rodriguez, Ortiz, & 
Fernandez-De-Larrinoa, 2012). The supervised exercise provides 
a limitation of the current study is that multiple tests within similar 



constructs (e.g., static balance eyes open, eyes closed) were applied. 
This increases the alpha-error probability and consequently the risk 
for Type I errors. Another limitation is the lack of brain activity 
scans. Thus, it is difﬁcult to directly determine how brain activity in 
older adults with mild cognitive impairment was facilitated. This 
study was implemented in a virtual environment to increase the sense 
of immersion of the participants, but it was not perfect because of the 
absence of screen movement and the fact that it was performed on a 
chair, which cannot completely mimic the actual kayak paddling 
posture. Finally, we did not assess exercise satisfaction in our 
participants. However, the participants showed interest in the exer- 
cise and maintained a high participation rate. 

This study investigated the effects of VKP exercise on postural 
balance, handgrip strength, and cognitive function in older adults 
with mild cognitive impairment. We found that VKP exercise was 
well designed to improve the physical and cognitive health of older 
adults with mild cognitive impairment. The virtual environment 
allowed the subjects to focus better on the exercise, which could 
be performed easily at home. Future research should employ 
immersive virtual reality that provides auditory cues according 
to the direction in which the kayak boat is moving and allows the 
subject to maintain a similar posture to that during actual kayak 
paddling.
