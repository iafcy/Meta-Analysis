Background: Exercise is often proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to delay cognitive decline in 
people with dementia, but evidence remains inconclusive. Previous studies suggest that combining physical 
exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising 
intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in 
older adults with dementia. 
Methods: A three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an 
active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized 
and individually trained three times a week during 12 weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 
12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive 
function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into 
standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of 
covariance. 
Results: Data from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age = 79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score = 22.9 
(3.4)) were analysed. There was a significant improvement in psychomotor speed in the aerobic and exergame groups 
compared to the active control group (mean difference domain score (95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.370 (0.103–0. 
637), p = 0.007; exergame versus control 0.326 (0.081–0.571), p = 0.009). The effect size was moderate (partial η2 = 0.102). 
No significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found for executive functioning, episodic 
memory and working memory.

Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effects of exergame training and aerobic training 
on cognitive functioning in people with dementia. We found that both exergame training and aerobic training 
improve psychomotor speed, compared to an active control group. This finding may be clinically relevant as 
psychomotor speed is an important predictor for functional decline. No effects were found on executive function, 
episodic memory and working memory.

Background 
The increasing prevalence of dementia greatly impacts 
healthcare and society, stressing the need for global action 
[1]. Since there is no cure or effective disease-modifying 
drug to treat the most common types of dementia to date 
[1], research should also focus on the development and 
implementation of non-pharmacological interventions as 
an alternative or add-on therapy [2]. Previous research has 
shown that physical exercise improves cognitive perform- 
ance in older adults without dementia [3], and that phys- 
ical 
inactivity during midlife attributes to the risk of 
dementia [4, 5]. However, research on cognitive effects of 
physical exercise in older adults with dementia has shown 
heterogeneous results [6, 7]. It seems that physical exer- 
cise alone may not be enough for older adults with de- 
mentia to alter or slow down cognitive decline. Previous 
studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cog- 
nitive stimulation may be a more successful strategy [8, 9]. 
Animal studies have shown that physical exercise can 
prime the hippocampus to increase neurogenesis elicited 
by cognitive stimuli [10, 11]. Furthermore, physical exer- 
cise combined with environmental enrichment positively 
affects hippocampal neurogenesis, possibly via separate 
pathways, with physical exercise influencing the prolifer- 
ation of neural precursor cells and environmental en- 
richment fostering survival of newborn neurons [10]. In 
line with this, a meta-analysis [12] showed significant 
benefits of combined cognitive and physical 
interven- 
tions on cognitive function in healthy older adults. 
These beneficial effects significantly exceeded the effects 
of physical exercise training alone [12]. In addition, we 
recently performed a meta-analysis in older adults with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia which 
showed that combined cognitive and physical exercise 
interventions improve global cognitive performance [13]. 
Thus, these studies illustrate the potential of combined 
interventions in delaying disease progression in persons 
with MCI or dementia. However, the superiority of com- 
bined interventions over single physical exercise and the 
effects on different cognitive domains in individuals with 
dementia remain unknown. Hence, 
the 
current study is to investigate the effects of combined 

cognitive and physical exercise training on different cog- 
nitive domains in people with dementia. 
Recent advances in technology present the opportun- 
ity to combine physical exercise with cognitively 
challenging tasks in a single session using exergames 
[14]. Exergaming is defined by “physical exercise inter- 
actively combined with cognitive stimulation in a 
virtual environment” [15]. Exergame training is a phys- 
ical–cognitive dual-task training, which requires the 
mental flexibility to switch between concurrent tasks. Men- 
tal flexibility is a core component of executive functioning, 
a set of higher-order cognitive processes also including 
cognitive inhibition, planning and problem-solving [16]. 
We therefore hypothesize that exergame training will spe- 
cifically benefit executive functioning. Previous research 
has already shown that exergames improve global cognitive 
function in healthy older adults and in a clinical population 
of patients with Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, mul- 
tiple sclerosis and MCI, compared to physical exercise 
training alone [17]. Moreover, older adults were found to 
enjoy participation in exergames, which may facilitate 
long-term activity participation [18]. There is also prelim- 
inary evidence that exergames are a feasible and enjoyable 
intervention for people with dementia [19, 20]. To our 
knowledge, no previous randomized controlled studies 
have investigated the effect of exergames on cognitive 
functioning, more specifically on executive functioning, in 
older adults with dementia. 
Previous studies suggest that the gene apolipoprotein 
E (APOE) may be a moderator in the effects of exercise 
on cognition [21, 22]. APOE is a cholesterol carrier and 
is important for lipid transport and injury repair in the 
brain [23]. There are three alleles of APOE: ε2, ε3 and 
ε4. Carrying the ε4 allele of APOE is a risk factor for 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and carrying the ε2 allele is 
protective for AD [1]. Results from cohort studies are 
contradictory, reporting that physical exercise is both 
protective for cognitive decline in APOE ε4 carriers [24, 
25] as well as lowering the risk of dementia in APOE ε4 
non-carriers [26]. Insight into this moderating relation- 
ship may contribute to identify people who will benefit 
most from our exergame intervention. 


The primary aim of the current study is to investigate 
the efficacy of a 12-week exergame training and aerobic 
training compared to a control group on executive func- 
tioning in older adults with dementia. We hypothesize 
that exergame training results in greater improvement 
on executive functioning than aerobic training. Second- 
ary aims are: to assess the feasibility of exergames; to 
compare effects of exergame training with single aerobic 
training on the cognitive domains of psychomotor speed, 
episodic memory and working memory; to measure the 
follow-up effects of exergame training and aerobic train- 
ing; and to determine whether the cognitive effects of 
training are modified by the APOE ε4 carrier state. 
Methods 
Study design 
The current study was a 12-week single-blind randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) with two experimental intervention 
groups and one active control group. Participants were in- 
cluded from January 2016 to September 2017. The Med- 
ical Ethics Committee of Radboud University Medical 
Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands approved the re- 
search protocol, which was published previously [27]. The 
study was conducted in compliance with Declaration of 
standards. Participants all verbally 
Helsinki ethical 
agreed to participate in the study and gave written in- 
formed consent. The trial 
is registered at the Dutch 
trial register (http://www.trialregister.nl) with identifi- 
cation number NTR5581. 
Participants and study procedures 
Participants were approached via the memory clinic of 
Radboudumc Alzheimer Center, day care centres for 
older adults with cognitive disorders, advertisement in 
local newspapers and word of mouth. Eligibility criteria 
for inclusion were: clinically confirmed diagnosis of de- 
mentia following the DSM-IV criteria [28] (vascular, 
Alzheimer or mixed type) with a Mini Mental Status 
Examination (MMSE) [29] score ≥ 17; aged 60 years or 
older; if using anti-dementia medication, a stable dose 
for at least 3 months before the start of the trial; and 
being capable of giving informed consent [30]. Exclu- 
sion criteria were: co-morbidity that limited exercising, 
including severe cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or 
neurological disease; diagnosis of a depression, bipolar 
disorder or psychotic disorder at the moment of inclu- 
sion; current drug or alcohol dependency; exercising 
more than five times per week for at least 30 min at a 
moderate intensity; wheelchair bound; and severe hear- 
ing or visual problems that could not be corrected with 
the use of hearing aids/glasses. When participants were 
recruited by newspaper advertisement or word of 
mouth, we confirmed the dementia diagnosis by inves- 
a 
tigating 


screening visit. The study was conducted in community 
centres in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Participants were 
randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups or 
the control group by an independent statistician. The 
minimization method [31] was used to balance groups 
for gender, severity of cognitive impairment (MMSE ≥ 
20 or < 20), use of medication for Alzheimer’s disease, 
training location and level of education. The Dutch 
classification of education levels [32] was used to clas- 
sify the educational attainment of participants as low 
(levels 1–3), average (levels 4–5) or high (levels 6–7). 
Interventions 
The study included three arms: exergame training, aer- 
obic training and active control. Participants in each 
arm received three training sessions per week for 12 
weeks. Training sessions were given on a one-on-one 
basis, and trained students or research assistants super- 
vised the participants. Adherence to the intervention 
was calculated by dividing the number of sessions the 
participant followed by the total number of sessions 
that were offered. 
The exergame training consisted of a combined cogni- 
tive–aerobic bicycle training developed by Bike Labyrinth 
(www.bikelabyrinth.com). The aerobic training compo- 
nent consisted of cycling on a stationary bike, 30–50 min 
per session. The aerobic exercise was tailored to an indi- 
vidual fitness level and health status, and aimed to achieve 
an intensity of 65–75% of heart rate reserve after 12 weeks 
of training [27]. For participants on medication that atten- 
uates heart rate (e.g. beta-blockers), the Borg Rating of 
Perceived Exertion (RPE) [33] was used to ensure that the 
intended training intensity was achieved. In addition, the 
stationary bike was connected to a video screen. Partici- 
pants followed a route through a digital environment and 
simultaneously performed cognitive tasks targeting re- 
sponse inhibition, task switching and processing speed. 
The exergame training consisted of seven different cog- 
nitive training levels. The difficulty of the cognitive 
tasks increased per level to ensure that the training 
remained cognitively challenging. The exergame train- 
ing and different training levels are described exten- 
sively in our protocol paper [27]. 
The single aerobic exercise group consisted of cycling 
on a stationary bike that was not connected to a video 
screen. The aerobic training was identical to the exer- 
game training already described. Participants in the ac- 
tive control group received training that consisted of 
relaxation and flexibility exercises with a duration of 
30 min and the same frequency as the training regimes 
of the intervention groups. The exercises required min- 
imal muscle strength and aerobic capacity and were 
easy to perform. The level of social engagement was 
similar to the intervention groups. 


Outcomes 
Full assessments were carried out before training (T0), 
after the 12-week training phase (T2) and 12 weeks 
thereafter at the 24-week follow-up (F1). Intermediate 
measurements were performed after 6 weeks of training 
(T1). Trained research assistants with a background in 
neuropsychology assessed cognitive performance using 
a test battery that was described previously [27], and 
they were blinded to group allocation. The primary out- 
come measure was objective executive functioning, 
which was measured by four neuropsychological tasks 
that were averaged into one domain score: a short form 
of the Trail Making Test part B [34], the abbreviated 
5-line Stroop Color Word Test interference score [35, 
36], Letter Fluency [37, 38], and the Rule Shift Cards 
Test [39]. All tests, except for letter fluency, were also 
administered after 6 weeks (T1). Secondarily, the fol- 
lowing cognitive domains were assessed: episodic mem- 
ory (Location Learning Test—Revised [40]), working 
memory (WAIS-III Digit Span [41] and WMS-III 
Spatial Span [42]), and psychomotor speed (short form 
of Trail Making Test part A [34] and the abbreviated 
Stroop Color Word Test parts I and II [35]). Only all 
psychomotor speed tests were also performed after 6 
weeks (T1). Tests were categorized into cognitive do- 
mains a priori using the conventional classification de- 
scribed by Lezak et al. 
In order to calculate 
[43]. 
domain scores, test scores were converted into z-scores 
based on the mean and standard deviation of the total 
sample at baseline [44]. Subsequently, these individual 
test z-scores were averaged per domain. 
After inclusion, saliva samples were taken with buccal 
swabs for APOE genotyping. Samples were stored at − 
20 °C and analysed using real-time polymerase chain re- 
action (PCR) [45]. This results in different APOE gene 
phenotypes: three homozygous (ε2/ε2, ε3/ε3, ε4/ε4) and 
three heterozygous (ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4) [45]. 

Statistical analysis 
Socio-demographic 
at 
and clinical 
baseline were presented using descriptive statistics. 
Feasibility measures (e.g. adherence to the exercise 
programme, measures of exercise intensity and rating 
of the exercise sessions) were compared between the 
groups with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and independent-sample t test. 
To assess the effect of training on cognitive perform- 
ance in each domain (i.e. executive function, episodic 
memory, working memory and psychomotor speed), 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with 
post-training cognitive domain z-scores as dependent 
variables, baseline z-scores as covariates and group 
(exergame training, aerobic training and active control) 
as between-subject factors. To specify significant group 

effects, Bonferroni-corrected 
tests were 
performed. To investigate follow-up effects of the inter- 
vention for each cognitive domain, we used mixed- 
model ANCOVA. Variables included in the model wer- 
ecognitive domain z-scores at T2 and F1 as dependent 
variables, group as between-subject 
time as 
within-subject factors, and the corresponding baseline 
measure as covariates. Additionally, a time × group 
interaction term was added as a fixed effect. To assess a 
moderating effect of APOE ε4, an interaction term be- 
tween APOE ε4 and group was added separately as a 
predictor. 



If a participant had missing data because he/she 
was cognitively incapable to perform a certain test, 
the worst possible score for this test was awarded. 
Afterwards, 
If 
there were missing data due to drop-out and the rea- 
son for missingness was at random, missing data were 
substituted using the multiple imputation method. 
Characteristic variables of the sample, cognitive do- 
main scores at baseline and training group were in- 
cluded in the 
following 
imputation settings were used: automatic model set- 
ting, 15 iterations and 5 imputations. If a participant 
had missing data due to drop-out because of cognitive 
decline, the criterion for missing at random was not 
fulfilled. Use of multiple imputation would in this case 
have been inappropriate as violation of the missing at 
random assumption biases the estimates [46]. We ex- 
pected that the cognitive decline would be larger in 
these participants than the mean decline in the entire 
group, as it was their reason for drop-out. We decided 
to use a single value imputation approach for these par- 
ticipants, in which we replaced the missing values by a 
single value, 
in our case the greatest decline in the 
group. To prevent imputing non-realistic values, the 
lowest possible score was used as a cut-off score. We 
performed additional 
to check 
whether this alternative method of dealing with missing 
data influenced our results. 

All statistical analyses were performed as intention-to- 
treat analyses, including all participants irrespective of 
adherence to intervention. Additionally, we performed 
per-protocol analyses including only those participants 
who successfully completed the intervention period and 
all measurements. SPSS 22 was used for all analyses with 
α set at 0.05. 
Results 
Patient flow and sample characteristics 
In total, 307 participants were screened for eligibility 
and 121 participants eventually enrolled in the study. 
Six participants refused to participate during baseline 
measurements and the remaining 115 participants 



were 
randomized. Fourteen participants did not 
complete the 12-week intervention (12%). The num- 
ber of drop-outs did not differ significantly between 
(p = 0.930). The enrolment, allocation 
the groups 
process and reasons for drop-out are presented in 
Fig. 1. Baseline characteristics for the randomized 
sample were well matched between the groups 
(Table 1). The included participants had a mean (SD) 
age of 79.9 (6.5) years and a mean (SD) MMSE score 
of 22.4 (3.2). There were no differences 
in age, 
MMSE score and Katz index between the different 
dementia types (see Additional file 1). 
Attendance, intensity and safety 
Table 2 presents the adherence per group; a trend was found 
towards higher adherence in the exergame group compared 
to the aerobic group (mean difference (95% CI) 6.85 (− 0.09 
to 13.79), p = 0.053). Participants rated both exercise inter- 
ventions and the active control group highly (see Table 2). 
Training duration, training load, heart rate and rate of per- 
ceived exertion did not differ between both intervention 
groups. The mean training intensity was light in both inter- 
vention groups with an average of 41.8% (SD = 13.3) and 
43.5% (SD = 18.2) of maximal heart rate in the exergame 
group and aerobic group respectively. For the exergame

training, the median (interquartile range) training level 
after 6 weeks was 5.0 (4.3–5.8), and after 12 weeks 5.5 
(5.0–6.0). After 6 weeks, 25% of 
the participants 
reached level 6 or 7, and 50% reached level 5. After 12 
weeks, 50% of the participants reached level 6 or 7, and 
40% reached level 5. This demonstrates that there were 
no floor effects for the cognitive stimulation activity 
and about half of the participants were able to complete 
the highest 
the exergame 
training was feasible and that adequate skill acquisition 
was present. No occurrence of serious adverse events 
(e.g. events leading to death, hospital admission or per- 
sistent disability) related to the exercise interventions 
were recorded. 


Missing data 
Missing data due to drop-out of participants was 0% at 
T0, 8.7% at T1, 9.6% at T2 and 17.5% at F1. Reasons for 
drop-out are described in Fig. 1. In a total of six cases, 
the reason for drop-out was refused participation (five 
out of six at follow-up measurements). Reason for re- 
fusal was cognitive decline, which led to caregivers’ with- 
drawal of consent. As explained in Methods, we used 
single-value imputation for substituting missing data not 
at random, and performed additional sensitivity analyses 
to check whether this influenced our results. Data for 
the remaining eight drop-outs were missing at random 
and were substituted using multiple imputation, as ex- 
plained in Methods.

Intention-to-treat analysis 
Figure 2 shows the performance on the four cognitive 
domains at each time point per treatment arm. No sig- 
nificant differences were found between the exergame 
group, aerobic group and control group on executive 
functioning after 12 weeks of training. Since after 6 
weeks (T1) letter fluency was not administered as an 
executive function test, we decided not to include T1 
data in our analyses. Significant improvement on the 
secondary measure psychomotor speed was found for 
both the aerobic and the exergame group compared to 
the controls after 12 weeks of training (mean difference 
domain score (95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.370 
(0.103–0.637), p = 0.007; exergame versus control 0.326 
(0.081–0.571), p = 0.009). The size of the effect was 
moderate (partial η2 = 0.102). This effect was not yet 
present at the intermediate measurements after 6 weeks 
(see Fig. 2). No significant differences were found be- 
tween the groups on the secondary measures of epi- 
sodic memory and working memory after the 12-week 
intervention period. An additional sensitivity analysis 
yielded similar results, which shows that our findings 
are robust. Follow-up analysis showed that the im- 
provement in psychomotor speed was maintained for 
both the aerobic group and the exergame group com- 
pared to the controls (mean difference domain score 
(95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.453 (0.185–0.722), p 
= 0.001; exergame versus control 0.326 (0.070–0.604), 
p = 0.014. There was no significant difference between 
the exergame and aerobic group (mean difference do- 
main score (95% CI) exergame versus aerobic − 0.116 
(0.399 to – 0.398), p = 0.399). We did not find any 
between-group differences in any of the other cognitive 
domains at follow-up. Sensitivity analysis pointed in the 
same direction, with a maintenance effect in the aerobic 
group compared to controls (mean difference domain 
score (95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.267 (0.048– 
0.486)), and no follow-up effect in any of the other cog- 
nitive domains. Moderator analysis showed that carry- 
ing APOE ε4 did not influence the relation between 
training and cognitive performance. z-scores of the dif- 
ferent cognitive domains per group and time point are 
presented in Additional file 2. Raw data of cognitive 
test scores are presented in Additional file 3. 
Per-protocol analysis 
n the per-protocol analyses, we excluded 14 participants who 
did not complete the 12-week intervention period. The 
remaining 101 participants were included in this analysis. 
The results of the per-protocol analyses were in line with the 
intention-to-treat analyses, with positive effects of exergame 
and aerobic training on psychomotor speed compared to 
controls (mean difference domain score (95% CI) aerobic 
versus control 0.322 (0.038–0.607), p = 0.021; exergame ver- 
sus control 0.283 (0.002–0.563), p = 0.047). As in the 
intention-to-treat analyses, no significant between-group dif- 
ferences were observed in the domains of executive function, 
memory and working memory. At follow-up there were nine 
additional drop-outs, which led to inclusion of 92 partici- 
pants in the follow-up analysis. We found that there was a 
trend for maintained improvement in psychomotor speed 
at 24-week follow-up in the aerobic group compared to

CI) aerobic versus control 0.267 (0.048–0.486), p = 0.057). 
No significant intervention effects were observed in any 
of the other domains. 
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized con- 
trolled trial to investigate the differential effect of exer- 
gaming versus aerobic training on cognitive functioning 
in people with dementia. We hypothesized that exer- 
game training would result in greater improvement on 
executive functioning than single aerobic training. Al- 
though we did not find an effect of exergame training 
or aerobic exercise on executive function after 12 
weeks, we found that psychomotor speed improved in 
both the exergame and the aerobic group compared to 
the 
active controls. This effect was maintained at 
24-week follow-up. We did not find an effect of both 
intervention groups in the cognitive domains of epi- 
sodic memory and working memory compared to the 
control group. Moderator analysis showed that APOE 
ε4 carriership did not influence the relation between 
training and cognitive function. Finally, we demon- 
strated that a newly developed exergame that comprises 
both physical and cognitive training elements is feasible 
for people with dementia. 
Interpretation of results and comparison with previous 
research 
Contrary to our hypothesis, the current results did not 
show a larger effect of exergame training compared to 
aerobic training on cognitive functioning. Comparable 
research on the differential effects of combined cogni- 
tive and physical training versus only cognitive or phys- 
ical 
interventions in people with dementia is scarce. 
There is one previously published paper reporting that 
neither a 12-week combined cognitive–aerobic training 
nor aerobic training only improved global cognitive 
function in a smaller sample of 80 individuals with AD 
[47]. However, the type of intervention and used out- 
come measures are incomparable to the current study. 
Research in individuals with MCI showed inconsistent 


findings regarding the cognitive benefits of combined 
interventions and its potential superiority compared to 
physical exercise or cognitive training alone [48]. In 
contrast, for older adults without cognitive impairment 
there is converging evidence that combined interven- 
tions (including exergames) are superior to physical or 
cognitive training alone [48], with larger effect sizes for 
interventions that are performed simultaneously com- 
pared to sequential interventions [12]. 
In healthy older adults, evidence for the efficacy of 
physical exercise and combined cognitive and physical 
interventions on executive functions [12, 49], memory 
[12, 49], working memory [12, 50] and attention [51] 
have been well established. In our current study, both 
exergame and aerobic-only training did not positively 
affect executive functions, working memory or episodic 
memory. This seems partly in line with previous re- 
search. A meta-analysis performed by our group [13] 
demonstrated positive effects of combined interventions 
on global cognitive function in older adults with MCI or 
dementia, but no effects in the domains of executive 
function and memory. In contrast, a recently published 
RCT showed that both a mentally challenging exergame 
and a passive exergame improve executive functioning 
in people with MCI [52]. However, the more challenging 
exergame only yielded significant effects after 6 months 
of training, while the passive exergame already produced 
gains after 3 months [52]. A possible explanation for this 
discrepancy is that participants in the mentally challen- 
ging exergame group needed more time to master the 
intervention, which may have delayed triggering the syn- 
ergistic effects of the combined intervention [52]. This 
might also explain the negative findings in our study, 
since a mentally challenging exergame was used for a 
relative short intervention period of 12 weeks. 
There is evidence that the severity of neurocognitive 
disorder has a moderating impact on the cognitive ef- 
fects of combined cognitive and physical training [53]. 
An increase in the severity of neurocognitive disorder 
may lead to a decrease of the intervention effect [53]. 
This could be explained by a reduced structural brain 
capacity (e.g. reduced number of neurons and synapses) 
in participants with more severe neurocognitive disorder, 
which may lead to limited resources necessary for 
training-induced gains [53]. Therefore, it may be more 
difficult to induce cognitive benefits in people with de- 
mentia compared to those with MCI or healthy older 
adults. Moreover, the complexity to obtain valid neuro- 
psychological outcomes that are sensitive to change in 
persons who already have severe cognitive deficits due 
to their dementia complicates the assessment of cogni- 
tive functioning in this group. Even though we carefully 
selected and adjusted tests for use in mild-to-moderate 
dementia, it is particularly challenging to assess executive 
functions in this group. Executive functions include 
higher-order processes such as inhibitory control, men- 
tal flexibility and planning, which are already affected 
in the early stages of dementia [54, 55]. Assessment of 
executive function in people with dementia may conse- 
quently result in floor effects or missing data, which 
make it difficult to measure change over time. 
In our study we found a moderate effect of exergame 
training and aerobic training on psychomotor speed 
after a 12-week training period in people with demen- 
tia. This effect was not yet present after 6 weeks of 
training. Firstly, this may imply that the improvement 
is due to the training and not due to non-specific treat- 
ment or practice effects. Secondly, this suggests that a 
longer training duration is necessary to improve psy- 
chomotor speed. Although still under debate, there is 
some evidence that physical exercise leads to improved 
cognitive function through promotion of hippocampal 
neurogenesis [56], brain angiogenesis [57] and synaptic 
plasticity [58] elicited by an increased expression of 
neurotrophic factors [59]. In cognitively healthy older 
adults, physical exercise interventions have the largest 
gains on executive control processes, psychomotor 
speed and attention [49, 51, 60, 61]. In people with de- 
mentia there is little research about the benefits for dif- 
ferent cognitive domains. From a neurobiological 
perspective, however, we do not have an explanation 
for why exercise would only improve psychomotor 
speed, but not the other cognitive skills assessed. We 
hypothesize, that only finding an effect on psychomotor 
speed, and not on executive functioning, may be related 
to domain-specific responsiveness of the selected out- 
come measures. Processing speed tests typically are 
continuous outcome measures without ceiling or floor 
effects that are highly sensitive [62], which may explain 
the sensitivity to change even in a dementia sample. In 
contrast, tests that measured executive functioning re- 
sulted in floor effects in our dementia sample, which 
made it difficult to measure change over time. Alterna- 
tively, one could also hypothesize that mood may be a 
mediating factor for improvement on speed measures, 
as previous research showed that exercise and exer- 
game training can reduce depressive symptoms in 
healthy older adults [63, 64]. The positive effect on psy- 
chomotor speed was consistent across the different 
neuropsychological tests used to measure psychomotor 
speed (short form of Trail Making Test part A and the 
abbreviated Stroop Color Word Test parts I and II), 
which shows that the effect was robust and reliable. Its 
moderate effect size is slightly larger than to the 
small-to-moderate effect 
sizes commonly found in 
studies examining the effects of cholinesterase inhibi- 
tors on cognitive function [65, 66]. Given that interven- 
tions to ameliorate cognitive decline of people with 


dementia are scarce, this effect size may be clinically 
relevant. Poor processing speed is a predictor of func- 
tional decline in basic and instrumental activities of 
daily living [67]. In addition, poor processing speed is 
reported to be a predictor for incident dementia [68] 
and was found to be associated with shorter survival 
among older adults in Japan [69]. Furthermore, late-life 
cognitive decline is attributable to slower processing speed 
[70]. Thus, the reported improvement in processing speed 
may be clinically relevant. 
The mean training intensity was light in both inter- 
vention groups, with an average of 41.8% (SD = 13.3) 
and 43.5% (SD = 18.2) of maximal heart rate in the 
exergame group and the aerobic group respectively. We 
expected that improved cardiorespiratory fitness would 
be a requirement to improve cognitive function [51], 
and therefore we aimed to achieve moderate exercise 
intensity (e.g. 65–75% of maximal heart rate) during 
the training sessions. However, the exercise training 
was tailored to an individual fitness level and health 
status, and most participants were not able to achieve a 
moderate training intensity. The recently published De- 
mentia and Physical Activity (DAPA) trial [71] showed 
that moderate to high-intensity aerobic and strength 
exercise training did not slow cognitive decline in 
people with mild to moderate dementia, and even 
worsened cognitive impairment in those who complied 
with the intervention, despite an improvement in phys- 
ical fitness. It is therefore unlikely that the light training 
intensity in our study limited the beneficial effects of 
exercise on cognitive functioning. 
Strengths and limitations 
The strengths of our study include the inclusion of a 
relatively large sample of people with dementia, a high 
adherence rate, 
the use of a comprehensive neuro- 
psychological assessment and follow-up measurement 
for long-term maintenance effects. However, some limi- 
tations need to be taken into account when interpreting 
our results. Firstly, only participants who were mobile 
and motivated enrolled in our study, which may limit 
the external validity of the current findings. Secondly, 
participants were not blinded to allocation, which is an 
unavoidable limitation of exercise studies. Outcome 
assessors were masked for 
intervention allocation. 
Thirdly, although we used adapted versions of executive 
tests, making administration in people with dementia 
more feasible, a floor performance was still found in a 
number of individuals. This may have reduced the sen- 
sitivity to measure change over time, obscuring poten- 
tial positive results. Fourthly, the intervention period 
was only 12 weeks, which may have been too short to 
show beneficial effects of exergames on executive func- 
tioning. Lastly, future studies should include measures 
of mood, since this might be a potential mediating fac- 
tor for the improvement in processing speed measures. 


Clinical relevance and feasibility 
Both exergame training and aerobic training improved 
psychomotor speed after 12 weeks, with a moderate ef- 
fect size. This finding may be clinically relevant as psy- 
for 
chomotor 
functional decline. In our study, exergame training was 
not superior to aerobic training. However, there was a 
trend for higher adherence in the exergame group 
compared to the aerobic group. Additionally, trainers 
who individually guided the training sessions reported 
that it was easier to motivate participants in the exer- 
game group and to increase duration of the training 
sessions. This was confirmed by our finding that no 
participants dropped out in the exergame group due to 
low motivation (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, exergaming 
seems 
an effective method to stimulate 
long-term physical activity participation in people with 
dementia. 

Future directions 
Future studies should examine whether certain individ- 
ual characteristics (e.g. type of dementia) moderate the 
effect of physical activity on cognition. Insight into 
these individual differences is important because it can 
determine which people are most likely to benefit from 
physical activity. It can also help to personalize inter- 
ventions, thereby stimulating physical activity. More- 
over, additional studies are needed to explore the 
optimal intervention design and dose–response for eli- 
citing beneficial cognitive effects in people with demen- 
tia. Future intervention trials should include measures 
of psychomotor speed as these can reliably and validly 
be assessed in people with dementia and are closely re- 
lated to everyday activities. Furthermore, studies should 
also focus on investigating neurophysiological mecha- 
nisms that underlie the cognitive effects of exercise, for 
example by including neuroimaging measures. 
Conclusions 
Exergaming is a feasible and highly appreciated exercise 
method to engage older adults with dementia in phys- 
ical exercise, mixed with cognitive stimulation. Both 
exergame training and aerobic training can improve 
psychomotor speed, which may be clinically relevant as 
psychomotor speed is an important predictor for func- 
tional decline. Although no effects were found on 
executive function, episodic memory and working 
memory, the potential broad range of effects of exer- 
games for older adults with dementia (e.g. physical 
functioning, quality of 
life, activities in daily living) 
should be studied in future RCTs.
