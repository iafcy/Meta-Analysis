Objectives: Physical activity and cognitive training are effective to enhance cognition in older patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games are a combination of physical activity and 
cognitive training. The objective of this study was to determine the short- and long-term effects of Xbox 360 
Kinect cognitive games on slowness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive functions 
in older subjects with MCI. 
Materials and Methods: A clinical trial was conducted on 44 MCI subjects. Both males and females were 
randomized into experimental group (participated in Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games) and control group (range 
of motion exercises only and no Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games). Subjects were assessed before and after one 
session of game intervention for short-term effects and after 6 weeks for long-term effects. The outcome measures 
were the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), trail making test 
(TMT) A and B, and slowness and complexity of EEG. 
Results: After one session of game intervention, delta (0.704 – 0.025; P = 0.013), theta (0.128 – 0.009; P = 0.00127) 
waves, and complexity of EEG (0.642 – 0.042; P = 0.008) signiﬁcantly improved, in eyes closed state. Whereas 
after 6 weeks intervention of games, delta (0.673 – 0.029; P = 0.013), theta (0.129 – 0.013; P = 0.002), beta2 waves 
(0.044 – 0.009; P = 0.046), complexity of EEG (0.051 – 0.042; P = 0.016), MMSE (26.25 – 0.347 vs. 23.722 – 0.731; 
P = 0.003), MoCA (25.65 – 0.310 vs. 22.00 – 0.504; P = 0.0001), TMT-A (1.429 – 0.234 vs. 2.225 – 0.259; P = 0.028), 
and TMT-B (2.393 – 0.201 vs. 3.780 – 0.195; P = 0.0001) improved signiﬁcantly. These changes were not observed in 
the control group. 
Conclusion: Xbox 360 Kinect games showed beneﬁcial effects after short- and long-term intervention on MCI 
subjects. These games can serve as potential therapeutic candidates for MCI.

rate from MCI to dementia is 5% to 15%.2,3 Clinical symptoms 
of MCI include gait and balance problems,4 mood variation5 
and problems in performing activities of daily living.6 MCI is 
an intermediate stage very suitable for curative, or at least 
preventive treatment, as it has been reported that cognitive 
interventions are helpful in MCI subjects.7 There are very

MCI. These pharmacological options provide only symp- 
tomatic treatment and their side effects are multiple. It is 
questionable whether these treatment options slow down the 
progression of disease or not. Other than pharmacological 
treatments, physical exercises8,9 and cognitive training are 
better options, which have shown signiﬁcant effects on sub- 
jects.10,11 However, there is also some evidence suggesting 
that there is no effect of cognitive training12,13 and physical 
activity14 on cognitive impairment. A careful consideration 
shows that a combination of aerobic exercises and cognitive 
training demonstrated better effects than pharmacological 
treatment alone in age-related cognitive impairment.15 These 
effects may be possible due to simultaneous increase of 
neurogenesis by aerobic exercise and cognitive training. 
Some animal studies showed that exercise increases the 
proliferation of neurons and task training helps in the survival 
of these newly proliferated cells.16 Fabel et al. also supported 
that the combination of both types of training (aerobic exer- 
cise and cognitive training) increases the number of neurons 
by 30%, compared with the task-based training alone.17 There 
is some evidence that exercise improves cognition by en- 
hancing neural plasticity.18,19 This has been shown to be 
modulated even by a single session of physical exercise.20 
Exergames are videogames that require subjects to be active 
through physical movements to play games and have to 
complete tasks in response to visual clues.21 Different termi- 
nologies are used for them, such as, active gaming and motion- 
based videogaming.22 Common games that are involved in this 
category are ‘‘Nintendo Wii’’ and ‘‘Microsoft Xbox 360 Ki- 
nect.’’ These games are used as a leisure activity in a large 
scale, but now there is growing evidence that this technology 
can be used for health beneﬁts.23–25 Knowing the fact that these 
games engage brain circuitry, it would be interesting to see 
their effects on brain. Particularly effects of exergames on MCI 
subjects have not been thoroughly investigated. The Xbox 360 
Kinect has the advantages of being easily available, user 
friendly for elderly people even in a home-based environment, 
and the risk of falling of elderly people is limited. Playing 
games while using the Xbox 360 Kinect system showed im- 
provement of cognitive abilities in healthy older adults as 
compared with those who played games by using sedentary 
platform (as in Wii ﬁt).26 The Xbox 360 console consists of a 
graphing processing unit, central processing unit, memory, and 
input/output. It is a low-price device and can be easily handled 
in clinical as well as in home-based rehabilitation.27 The Xbox 
360 gaming console is connected with Kinect (it is a motion- 
sensitive input device). It helps the subject to play a game using 
body movement or by gestures without touching the screen or 
game controller. It can work in normal room lighting condi- 
tions. Proper detection of all movements from head to feet 
requires the recommended distance of 1.8 meter from the 
sensor.28 The accuracy and precision of Kinect to detect 
movements of body, are higher than any other motion-tracking 
devices such as ‘‘Nintendo Wiimote.’’29 
Several studies have explored different electroencepha- 
lography (EEG) parameters to diagnose MCI and Alzhei- 
mer’s subjects. Three parameters are considered reliable and 
acceptable for the diagnosis of MCI/Alzheimer’s subjects, 
and these are: (1) Increases in low-frequency power band 
(delta and theta) and decrease in high-frequency power bands 
(alpha and beta).30,31 In early stage of dementia (MCI), 
‘‘slowing’’ of EEG has positive correlation and high sensi- 
tivity with progression of disease.32 In MCI subjects, low 
powered delta waves are increased, because there is degener- 
ation in corticocortical connectivity.33 (2) Decrease in com- 
plexity of EEG.31 Complexity or approximate entropy (ApEn) 
is a non-negative number,34 widely accepted parameter for the 
diagnosis of MCI subjects.35,36 MCI subjects have less com- 
plexity of EEG due to neuronal death and decrease in neuro- 
transmitter levels.37,38 (3) Decreased synchronization.39–41 
These above mentioned parameters are mostly observed in 
eyes-closed state, during resting EEG. 
The effect of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive game training on 
brain EEG rhythms in MCI subjects has not been studied up 
to our knowledge. The EEG may provide us with a better 
understanding of the mode of action of Xbox 360 Kinect 
cognitive games on brain. Due to all these above mentioned 
limitations and gaps, this study was planned to determine the 
short- and long-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive 
games on cognitive functions, slowness of EEG, and com- 
plexity or ApEn in MCI subjects. It was hypothesized that 
Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games would have positive ef- 
fects on MCI subjects. 


The design of the study is a randomized controlled trial. It 
was conducted at the Pakistan Railways General Hospital, 
in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from March 2016 to May 2017. All 
procedures were approved by the Internal Review Board 
(IRB) of Riphah College of Rehabilitation Sciences and 
Atta-ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences, National 
University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan 
(approval number IRB-67). 

Subjects who visit the hospital and were diagnosed as MCI 
patients were selected in this study. The subjects were excluded 
if they: (1) were on medications interfering with the cognition, 
(2) had any disease affecting the central nervous system (such 
as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson, stroke, thyroid disease, dia- 
betes, and hypertension). Moreover, the subjects had to be able 
to read and write their name in Urdu (local national language) 
and English. The ethics procedure was explained in Urdu to the 
subjects, and they gave their written informed consent before 
participation. Out of 83 subjects, 44 were eligible to participate 
in the study and screened on the basis of inclusion and exclu- 
sion criteria (Fig. 1). These subjects were randomly divided 
into an experimental group (Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
training, n = 22) and a control group (range of motion exercises, 
n = 22). During the study, four subjects from the control group 
and two from the experimental group were lost in the follow-up 
(Fig. 1). 

The EEG was measured before the start of treatment, after 
one session, and after 6 weeks of training with or without 
Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games. Neurocognitive tests were 
performed before the start of treatment and after 6 weeks of 
Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games training (Fig. 1).

Electroencephalography. EEG was recorded using the 
Emotiv Epoc with 14 channels. The channels were: AF3, F7, 
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 
according to the international 10–20 system. The channels 
were referenced at P3/P4 and sampled at 128 Hz. The im- 
pedance of the electrodes was below 10 kO in all recordings. 
The EEG was recorded for 2 minutes (in both cases, short 
term and long term), alternating between 30 seconds with 
closed eyes and 30 seconds with open eyes. The recordings 
were performed while the subject was seated, and before the 
recordings clear instructions were given that there should be 
no movements of the body. Verbal cues to the subject were 
given by the experimenter when the recordings of the eyes 
open/close were starting. During the recordings with open 
eyes, the subject was instructed to look at a focus point to 
reduce eye movements.42–45 
Equipment validation. To validate the EEG recordings 
from the Emotiv, two similar 2-minute recordings were 
performed with a 1 day break in between to test if there was 
any difference in terms of slowness and complexity of the 
EEG. The EEG recording protocol was the same as men- 
tioned above. It was also ensured that there should not be any 
type of intervention (exercise) between two recordings. 
Mini-mental state examination and Montreal cognitive as- 
sessment. To test the cognitive abilities of the subjects, the 
mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive 
assessment (MoCA) tests were performed. The testing procedure 
was the same as described previously46–48 with slight modiﬁ- 
cations, in which instructions were given in Urdu language 
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2; supplementary material are 
available online 
at https://www.liebertpub.com/suppl/doi/ 
10.1089/g4h.2018.0029). These tests were used as a screening of 
the MCI subjects (inclusion criteria) and at the end of treatment to 
compare cognitive performance. MMSE is used as a screening 
tool for MCI subjects and its speciﬁcity (65% to 90%) and sen- 
sitivity (40% to 60%) are quite reliable. This tool consists of 30 
different questions and tasks to assess different aspects of cog- 
nition.48 MoCA is also a sensitive (80% to 100%) and speciﬁc 
(56% to 76%) screening tool for MCI subjects.46 This tool con- 
sists of 30 different tasks and questions to assess cognition level. 
Trail making test A and B. These tests are used to de- 
termine the executive functions (processing speed and task 


switching), and the testing procedure was the same as de- 
scribed previously49,50 with slight modiﬁcations, that is, in- 
structions were given in Urdu language. The trail making test 
(TMT) is another psychomotor test to evaluate the cognitive 
abilities of MCI subjects. Before the test, the examiner ex- 
plained the task, and the subject practiced the test once or 
twice to become familiar with it. In TMT-A, the subject had 
to connect numeric digits without lifting the pen (Supple- 
mentary Fig. S3). In TMT-B, the same task was performed as 
in TMT-A, but in this test the subject had to connect letters 
and numbers with a line, alternatively (Supplementary Fig. 
S4). A stopwatch was used to record time in minutes to 
complete TMT-A and TMT-B. 
Cognitive training with Xbox 360 Kinect 
games–experimental group 
In the experimental group, a virtual reality-based Xbox 360 
Kinect platform was used with commercially available games 
(‘‘Body and Brain Exercises’’ by Dr. Kawashima). Every 
subject was treated individually in the rehabilitation depart- 
ment. The procedures were explained to the subjects, and a 
demonstration of games was given by the therapist before 
starting the intervention. Before the intervention, there was a 
5-minute warm-up time, and after the session there was also a 
5-minute cool-down time. The intervention time was 25 to 30 
minutes, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The subjects played the 
games in the hospital on an Xbox 360 with Kinect (China, 
2014; 015543340108) under the supervision of a therapist. 
The screen (CX54 L515; Ecostar) size was 54 inches, and it 
was made sure that there should be at least 1.8 meters of 
distance between the Kinect and subjects.28 
For cognitive training, there are ﬁve domains, such as logic, 
physical, memory, reﬂexes, and math. We included two games 
in four of the categories but only one in the math category due 
to the difﬁculty level for subjects. In the logic category we 
selected ‘‘Time a Bomb’’ and ‘‘Match Makers,’’ in the 
physical category we selected ‘‘Trafﬁc Control’’ and ‘‘Mouse 
Mayhem,’’ in the memory category we selected ‘‘Strike a 
Pose’’ and ‘‘Pizza Catch,’’ in the reﬂexes category we selected 
‘‘Flag Frenzy’’ and ‘‘Follow the Arrow,’’ and in the math 
category we selected ‘‘Which is Bigger.’’ 
In these games, by different visual cues, the subjects were 
asked for different tasks and they had to respond to it with dif- 
ferent physical movements. All subjects started at the same dif- 
ﬁculty level and with the same game. On each alternative session 
the subjects were rotated to another game in the same category to 
maintain the interest of the patient for a good follow-up. 

The subjects in the control group performed normal joint 
range of motion and stretching exercises of upper and lower 
limbs, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The session lasted 25 to 30 
minutes with 5 minutes of warm-up and 5 minutes of cool-down 
time. It was ensured that subjects in this group did not take part in 
any computer or digital games like in the experimental period. 

For analysis of slowness of EEG signals, the ﬁrst step was 
to visually inspect signals from all channels, followed by 
removing any artifacts in EEG signals that were visible. 
Next, all channels were subjected to preﬁltering using a 12th 
order bandpass, Butterworth Finite impulse response (FIR) 
ﬁlter 0.5–40 Hz. After visual inspection and ﬁltration of all 
channels, signals were divided into three epochs of 5 seconds 
each, from each eye close and eye open signal that is, six 
epochs for eyes open and six epochs for eyes closed. Then 
the average power of different frequency bands was calcu- 
lated (MATLAB(cid:2) 2015) in the following frequency ranges: 
Delta: 0.5–4 Hz, theta: 4–8 Hz, alpha1: 8–11 Hz, alpha2: 11– 
14 Hz, beta1: 14–25 Hz, and beta2: 25–35 Hz. For power 
calculations, we used a periodogram to determine the aver- 
age power (in each band range, like for the delta, average 
power was calculated in the range of 0.5–4 Hz after making 
fast Fourier transform, and average power is presented in the 
table). The power of each frequency band was normalized 
with the total signal power (over all frequency ranges). This 
resulted in relative power of each band of interest. 
For analysis of complexity of EEG signals, ApEn of both 
groups was estimated to distinguish data sets by a measure of 
regularity. ApEn is a nonlinear statistically valid formula tool 
that will quantify their regularity of time series. As suggested 
by Pincus,35 we have used Embedding dimension (m = 2) and 
tolerance (r = 0.2 · standard deviation of the original data). 
The results of the ApEn have been averaged based on all the 
epochs within the 2-minute period of EEG recordings. 

SPSS Version 21 for windows was used for analyses. 
Slowness and complexity of EEG were analyzed by two-way 
factorial repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 
factors are time [three levels: (1) before treatment, (2) after one 
session, and (3) after 6 weeks] and groups (experimental and 
control). Post hoc (Scheffe) was applied to determine changes 
within time and group factors. Neurocognitive assessment 
measures were analyzed by mixed factorial ANOVA, the 
factors were time (before treatment and after 6 weeks treat- 
ment) and group (experimental and control). Post hoc (Scheffe) 
was applied to determine changes within time and group fac- 
tors. For equipment validation, a paired t-test was applied 
on two consecutive EEG readings on two different days, to 
compare the slowness and complexity of EEG. The signiﬁ- 
cance level was P < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean – stan- 
dard error of mean (SEM). 


For MMSE there was a signiﬁcant interaction effect of 
factor ‘‘group’’ and ‘‘time’’ (F1,36 = 19.49; P < 0.001). For 
MoCA, there was also signiﬁcant interaction effect of factor 
group and time (F1,36 = 41.09; P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis 
showed that there was signiﬁcant improvement after 6 weeks 
in MMSE (26.250 – 0.347; P = 0.003; Fig. 2A) and MoCA 
(25.650 – 0.310; P = 0.0001; Fig. 2B) of the experimental 
group as compared with MMSE (23.722 – 0.731) and MoCA 
(22 – 0.504) of the control group (Fig. 2A, B). 
For TMT-A there was no signiﬁcant interaction effect of 
factor group and time (F1,36 = 0.398; P = 0.532). For TMT-B 
there was signiﬁcant interaction effect of factor group and 
time (F1,36 = 28.33; P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that 
there was signiﬁcant improvement after 6 weeks in TMT-A

(1.429 – 0.234; P = 0.028; Fig. 3A) and TMT-B (2.393 – 0.201; 
P = 0.0001; Fig. 3B) of the experimental group as compared 
with the TMT-A (2.225 – 0.259) and TMT-B (3.780 – 0.195) 
of the control group (Fig. 3A, B). 

For equipment validation two readings of EEG at two dif- 
ferent times were compared. Paired t-test showed that there was 
no signiﬁcant difference in the eyes closed state for the delta 
(0.782 – 0.029; P = 0.492) and theta (0.062 – 0.007; P = 0.256) 
waves as compared with delta (0.798 – 0.029) and theta 
(0.058 – 0.007) waves of the second reading. In eyes open state 
there was no signiﬁcant difference in delta (0.798 – 0.029; 
P = 0.913) and theta (0.052 – 0.006; P = 0.054) as compared 
with delta (0.800 – 0.035) and theta (0.044 – 0.006) waves of 
the second reading. 
The complexity, ApEn, of EEG revealed that there was 
no signiﬁcant change (0.515 – 0.020; P = 0.374) in the eyes 
closed state as compared with the complexity (0.535 – 0.027) 
of the second reading. In the case of eyes open state there was 
no signiﬁcant change in complexity (0.487 – 0.022; P = 0.210) 
as compared with complexity (0.452 – 0.016) of the second 
reading. 
Effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
on slowness of EEG 

For the delta waves in the eyes closed state, there was a 
signiﬁcant 
factor group and time 
(F2,120 = 3.314; P = 0.040). For the delta and theta waves in 
the eyes open state, there was signiﬁcant interaction effect 
of factor group and time (F2,120 = 3.909; P = 0.023) and

(F2,120 = 3.631; P = 0.029), respectively. There was no signif- 
icant interaction for alpha and beta waves (Table 1). 
Short-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games on 
slowness of EEG. After a single session of Xbox 360 Ki- 
nect cognitive games training, post hoc analysis revealed that 
in the eyes closed state a signiﬁcant effect was observed on 
delta (0.704 – 0.025; P = 0.013) and theta (0.128 – 0.009; 
P = 0.0001) waves, whereas alpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 
remained unaltered after one session of Xbox 360 Kinect 
cognitive games treatment (Table 1). 
In the eyes open state, there was signiﬁcant difference 
after one session in delta (0.724 – 0.025; P = 0.044) and theta 
(0.103 – 0.009; P = 0.003); whereas alpha1, alpha2, beta1, 
and beta2 remained unaltered after one session of Xbox 360 
Kinect cognitive games treatment (Table 2). 
Long-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
on slowness of EEG. After 6 weeks of Xbox 360 Kinect 
cognitive training, post hoc analysis revealed that in the eyes 
closed state, a signiﬁcant effect was observed on delta 
(0.673 – 0.029; P = 0.013), theta (0.129 – 0.013; P = 0.002), 
and beta2 (0.044 – 0.009; P = 0.046) waves; whereas alpha1, 
alpha2, and beta1 remained unaltered after 6 weeks of Xbox 
360 Kinect cognitive games treatment (Table 1). 
In the eyes open state, there was a signiﬁcant difference 
after 6 weeks in the delta (0.708 – 0.025; P = 0.006), theta 
(0.101 – 0.009; P = 0.003), and beta2 (0.040 – 0.007; P = 0.015) 
waves; whereas alpha1, alpha2, and beta1 remained unaltered 
after 6 weeks of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games treatment 
(Table 2).

For the EEG complexity, ApEn of the EEG in the eyes 
closed state, there was no signiﬁcant interaction effect of the 
factors time and group (F2,120 = 2.218; P = 0.113), but for the

that there was a signiﬁcant improvement (0.642 – 0.042; P = 
0.008) after one session of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
treatment as compared with the control group (0.498 – 0.028), 
in the eyes closed state (Fig. 4A). In the eyes open state, 
complexity was also signiﬁcantly improved (0.589 – 0.033; 
P = 0.002) after one session of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive 
games treatment as compared with complexity (0.486 – 0.029) 
of the control group (Fig. 4B). 
Long-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games on 
complexity of EEG. The complexity of the EEG revealed that 
there was signiﬁcant improvement (0.651 – 0.042; P = 0.016) 
after 6 weeks of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games treatment as 
compared with the control group (0.510 – 0.553), in the eyes 
closed sate (Fig. 4A). In the eyes open state, complexity was 
not signiﬁcantly improved (0.580 – 0.032; P = 0.063) after 6 
weeks of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games treatment as 
compared with complexity (0.487 – 0.026) of the control group 
(Fig. 4B). 

Exergames are emerging therapeutic candidates for dif- 
ferent 
types of disorders, especially, neurological disor- 
ders.10,51–53 Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games are the 
principal type of exergames, and their effects on MCI subjects 
are not explored. Especially effects of Xbox 360 Kinect 
cognitive games on slowness and complexity of EEG have not 
been studied. Based on this fact, we decided to study the effect 
of these games on slowness and complexity of EEG in MCI 
subjects. 
In the present study, MMSE, MoCA, TMT-A, and B were 
used to assess cognitive and executive functions, such as 
motor speed, task alteration, and visual search.46,47,49,50 
Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games signiﬁcantly improved 
MMSE and MoCA scores, and time to complete TMT-A and B.

pathways.57 Exercise or structured physical activity increases 
the concentration of neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) in 
the brain.58 As Xbox 360 Kinect games’ training also involve 
speciﬁc planned physical activity, this could be a cause of 
increase in the acetylcholine activity in these pathways and 
effect slowness of EEG. 
In the current study, Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
training increases ApEn, not only after one session of treatment 
but also after 6 weeks of training. Complexity or ApEn is a non- 
negative number, its high values represent more complexity or 
irregularity in EEG data.34 ApEn is a widely accepted measure 
for the diagnosis of MCI subjects.35,36 It has already been es- 
tablished that subjects with Alzheimer’s disease have less 
complex and more regular electrophysiological parameters in 
the cerebral cortex,36 may be due to decreased dynamic com- 
plexity of different parts of the brain. However, the exact 
mechanism involved in this regularity of signals is not clear.38 
Loss of connectivity of neural networks due to neuronal death 
and general effect on neurotransmitters’ activity, could be the 
reasons that cause more regularity and less complexity of 
EEG.37,38 Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games improved EEG 
indicators and cognitive functions probably through multiple 
mechanisms, such as, cognition improvement,15–17 increasing 
cerebral blood ﬂow,59 neural plasticity,60 activation of arousal 
system,61 neurotransmitters modulation,58 and probably for- 
mation of new spines, suggesting that multiple therapeutic 
mechanisms may be involved following treatment with cog- 
nitive games. 
If there is loss of function due to any injury or degeneration 
of neuronal cells or network, therapeutic strategies based on 
repetitions and increasing intensities of usage of that neuronal/ 
synaptic network can reactivate these neuronal pathways and 
circuits in the brain resulting in strengthening of neurons.62 
Exergaming follows this basic principles of task-based exer- 
cises, repetitions, and high intensities are also part of this type of 
treatment. Moreover, exergames provides sensory feedback 
through auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation63 and maintains 
motivation of the individuals.64 Based on these ﬁndings from 
our study, it is concluded that Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
improve conditions of MCI subjects by improving electro- 
physiological parameters and cognitive functions. Therefore, 
these games can serve as potential therapeutic options for old 
age MCI patients, and this can prevent transformation from 
MCI to demetia in most of these subjects. 

The Xbox 360 Kinect is a cheap equipment, easily avail- 
able, and can be installed at any place. It is also easy to use.65 
Our study has shown that Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games 
help MCI subjects to improve their cognitive abilities and vital 
electrophysiological parameters with no obvious side effects. 
Especially in third-world countries this type of equipment 
could be helpful to rehabilitate MCI subjects. 
The sample size of this study was small, so further studies 
with large sample size are required. Our study has shown huge 
potential of games which utilize brain along with physical 
activity. There is no major side effect associated with this in- 
tervention. Further studies with Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive 
game treatment and resulting detailed changes in brain can 
be helpful in understanding the progression from MCI to de- 
mentia, and help in therapeutic interventions.

These results are consistent with those from healthy and older 
adult population, in which exergames signiﬁcantly improved 
cognitive abilities.1,10,52 Previously one study examining the 
effects of exergames on cognitive levels of MCI subjects re- 
ported that there were medium-level effects in the favor of 
exergames group.51 The possible reason for this improvement 
of cognition is that, these games require the subjects to integrate 
attentional resources (visual, divided, and switch), visual–motor 
abilities, processing speed, and visuospatial54 and executive 
functions.55 
It was found that Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games showed 
improvement in slowness of EEG in delta, theta, and beta 
waves after one session and 6 weeks of treatment. Slowing 
of EEG is a well-established parameter to differentiate the 
healthy elderly population and MCI subjects. Slowing of EEG 
in the MCI subjects has positive correlation and high sensi- 
tivity with progression of disease.32 In MCI subjects, low- 
frequency delta wave power is increased because there is 
degeneration in the corticocortical connectivity.33 Theta 
waves, which are also low-frequency waves, increase in MCI 
subjects and it is believed that this is due to the slowing of 
subcortical axonal conduction time.56 In these subjects de- 
generation of the Perisylvian pathway and lateral capsular 
pathway, consisting of cholinergic neurons, causes the 
slowness of reactivity and loss of cortical connectivity. These 
pathways play critical roles in cortex-related activity (readi- 
ness), since the state of the cortex is mediated through these
