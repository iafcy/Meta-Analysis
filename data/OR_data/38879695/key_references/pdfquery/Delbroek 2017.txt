Abstract. 
alized older adults improves by a virtual reality dual task training. [Subjects and Methods] Randomized controlled 
trial; Twenty institutionalized older adults with mild cognitive impairment (13 female, 7 male; average age, 87.2 ± 
5.96 years) were randomized to the intervention (i.e. Virtual reality dual-task training using the BioRescue) or con- 
trol group (no additional training). The intervention group took part in a 6-week training program while the elderly 
in the control group maintained their daily activities. Balance was measured with the Instrumented Timed Up-and- 
Go Test with and without a cognitive task. The Observed Emotion Rating Scale and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory 
were administered to evaluate the emotions and motivation regarding the exergaming program. [Results] The in- 
tervention group improved significantly on the total Timed Up-and-Go duration and the turn-to-sit duration during 
single-task walking in comparison to the control group who received no additional training. Participants found the 
virtual reality dual task training pleasant and useful for their concentration, memory and balance. Pleasure and 
alertness were the two emotions which were mostly seen during the intervention. [Conclusion] The BioRescue is a 
pleasant and interesting treatment method, well suited for institutionalized older adults in need of lifelong physical 
therapy. 
Key words: Mild cognitive impairment, Balance, Dual task training 


Ageing is characterized by deterioration of vision, gait, muscle strength, balance and cognition1), which often results in a 
decrease of physical activity. This reduced physical activity leads to a vicious circle of further deconditioning2) including the 
emerge of balance disorders3). The risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults increases with balance disorders4). A 
fall is one of the most common accidents in older adults. Twenty-eight to 35% over the age of 65 fall at least once a year5). 
The number of falls in institutionalized older adults (rate: 0.6–3.6 per bed annually, mean 1.7) is higher than observed in 
community-dwelling healthy older adults (rate: 0.3–1.6 per person annually, mean 0.65). In addition, injuries are much more 
severe6).

Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are due to atrophy of the hippocampus, located in medial temporal lobes 
(MTL), and degradation of connections between the brain regions MTL and prefrontal cortex8). Mild cognitive impairment is 
defined as a state of cognition and functional ability between normal aging and very mild Alzheimer’s disease characterized 
by a decline in one or more cognitive domains, including working memory, central executive function and attentional re- 
sources9, 10) with still intact ADL-oriented actions11). Research suggests that during the MCI stage strengthening of executive 
function and reversing cognitive deficit is still largely possible12). 
Balance and cognition impairments are related and both contribute to an increased fall risk13). The cognitive input required 
for postural control depends on the task complexity and the abilities of the subject’s postural control system13). Postural 
control combined with a cognitive task, is called a cognitive-motor dual task. Specific brain regions related to dual task- 
ing include the precentral, postcentral, and lingual gyri14). To complete the secondary task, the older adult uses cognitive 
resources. This in turn leads to a weaker performance of the primary task and increases the fall risk in elderly with MCI. 
General training programs have a positive effect on balance in institutionalized older adults15). Last decade, the role of 
virtual reality in the domain of the physical therapy increased. Goble et al. showed that the ‘Wii Balance Board’ has a positive 
effect on balance in older adults16). Further, virtual reality interventions might be more attractive for older adults who need 
lifelong physical therapy. 
The BioRescue is a comparable form of virtual reality for cognitive-motor dual task training. It includes a platform (610 × 
580 × 10 mm3) equipped with 1,600 pressure sensors that measure vertical pressure fluctuations in both feet. It can be used as 
an assessment and intervention tool. The BioRescue might be more patient friendly and safer than the ‘Wii Fit’, as the surface 
of the BioRescue is bigger, more stable and lower to the ground, consequently decreasing the fall risk. During the exercises, 
the BioRescue gives the patients real-time feedback on the movement of the centre of pressure. Despite a good integration 
in clinical practice, there is only limited evidence on assessment and training with the BioRescue. Until now, the BioRescue 
has been reported in only 18 studies as an evaluation tool and in only one study as an intervention tool for stroke patients17). 
In this study, significant improvements in balance and cognition were found in comparison to baseline measurements in a 
group of sub-acute stroke patients. 
This study will examine the effect of dual task training with the BioRescue on cognition, balance and dual task performance 
in institutionalized older adults with MCI. In addition, the motivation and emotions experienced during the program will be 
monitored as this population needs lifelong physical therapy to reduce the risk of further motor and cognitive decline. We 
hypothesize that virtual reality dual task training with the BioRescue improves cognition, balance and dual task performance 
and is a pleasant alternative for traditional physical therapy resulting in positive emotions (i.e. pleasure and alertness) and 
more motivation towards the program. 

Twenty older adults, aged 75 and over, were recruited from the residential care center St. Elisabeth in Hasselt, Belgium 
after signing a written informed consent. The study received ethical approval by the local ethical committee of Hasselt 
University and the regional ethical committee of medical research, UZ KU Leuven on 23/09/2015. The register number is 
B322201525648. Participants were able to walk 10 meters repeatedly with walking aid, lived for at least 3 months at the 
residential care center and suffered from mild cognitive impairment (MoCa<26)18) Participants who were still rehabilitat- 
ing from a hospitalization (e.g., after a neurological disease or orthopedic surgery), had a diagnosis of dementia or major 
sensory or motor impairments of the upper or lower extremities which could interfere with the program were excluded. The 
participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The subjects in the control 
group continued their standard of usual care in the nursing home if applicable. 
The subjects assigned to the intervention group, followed a training program with the BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, France) 
combined with their standard of usual care. Training sessions were planned two times a week for six weeks. The duration of 
each session was gradually increased from 18 minutes in week 1 to 30 minutes in week 5. 
The BioRescue training was offered by a physical therapist. Participants were asked to stand on the platform located 
1.0–1.5 m away from a 55 inch TV-flat screen. A training session consisted of a number of 3 minute exercises. Table 1 de- 
scribes the nine exercises which were used to train balance, weight bearing, memory, attention and dual tasking. The degree 
of difficulty of each exercise was adjusted to the perceived skill level of each participant separately. If needed, the subjects 
could take a 90-second break for up to twice per session. 
Balance and gait performance was evaluated using the Tinetti-POMA scale (Performance-oriented Mobility Assess- 
ment)19) and the instrumented Timed Up and Go test (iTUG). Participants wore inertial measurement units (Opal™, APDM’s 
Mobility Lab™, APDM Inc, http://apdm.com) on the ankles, wrists and sternum while they were asked to stand up from a 
chair, walk 3 meters, turn 180°, walk 3 meters and sit down on the chair. Recorded data from total duration, step time before 
the turn, duration for sit-to-stand transition, turning and stand-to-sit transition were measured. Two measurements for every 
participant were averaged. This method is validated20) and has a high inter-rater reliability with video analysis for turning 
characteristics21). 
To evaluate the effect of the program on cognitive-motor dual tasking, the iTUG was combined with an extra visual task 
(iTUG+DT). A visual task was chosen for its similarity to the dual task training and for the high impact on gait performance

Rally 
The participant is required to memorize the 4 cards during 8 seconds where after the cards 
are turned back over. A fifth card, matching one of the other 4, is presented at the center of the 
monitor. The participant has to perform weight shifts on the BioRescue to move the cursor to the 
matching card. 
The participant is required to walk through a street without touching barriers by performing 
weight shifts to the right and left side at a specific moment. 
The participant must avoid the birds, hang-gliders, and other hot air balloons with the hot air 
balloon that he is flying by performing weight shifts. 
The participant must guide the movements of a sponge to wipe a blackboard clean. 
The participant controls a space shuttle and avoids the obstacles he encounters by performing 
weight shifts. 
The patient moves a dot (by performing weight shifts) in a maze viewed from above to search for 
the exit. 
Identical to the spaceshuttle. 
The participant must avoid the obstacles and the other cars with the rally car that he is driving 
(by performing weight shifts to the left and right side). 


The participant must avoid the various obstacles placed in his way. This exercise differs as 
participants have to retain the weight shift during a few seconds. 
in comparison to tasks which involve external interfering factors (e.g., reaction time tasks)22). For this dual task, six different 
images (e.g., glasses, a key and traffic lights) were displayed on a screen in a specific color in front of the participant. The six 
colors were then spoken in a random order at three-second intervals. Participants were instructed to name the matching image 
without further instructions regarding task prioritization. One practice session while sitting was allowed before implementa- 
tion during the iTUG. During every trial different images were used to avoid habituation effects. Dual task performance was 
measured as a percentage of wrong answers during the test. Two trials for each participant were averaged. 


The Dutch version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) was used to evaluate the motivation during the exercise 
program23). The IMI consists of 37 questions, divided over six subscales (i.e., interest/enjoyment, perceived choice, perceived 
competence, pressure/ tension, value/usefulness, effort). It was filled out after the last training session by the intervention 
group. 
To evaluate the participants’ emotions during the intervention, the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) was used24). 
The intervention group was recorded on videotape during a session in the fifth week of the program. The first 10 minutes 
of these recordings were screened for presence and duration of 5 affects (Pleasure, anger, anxiety/fear, sadness, general 
alertness). Additionally, participants of the intervention group were recorded during a standard physical therapy treatment (if 
applicable) to compare the two treatments. 
To standardize the protocol, identical footwear and walking aids were used during both pre- and post-testing. The assessor 
administrating the tinetti-POMA scale and MOCA was blinded to the treatment. For safety reasons, the blinded assessor was 
accompanied by the physical therapist during the iTUG with and without dual task. 
As the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric statistics was chosen for the data-analysis. Group differences 
at baseline were determined with the Mann-Whitney U test using JMP Pro 12.1.0. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test two-sided 
was used to compare each variable within-group before and after the program. The level of significance was set at p<0.05 
for all statistical analyses. 

The clinical characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table 2. The groups did not differ significantly at baseline 
for age, gender, height, cognition, Tinetti-POMA, the use of a walking aid and additional physical therapy at the nursing 
home. However, the control group tended to get more standard physical therapy than the intervention group (p=0.07). 
Two participants in the intervention group had to discontinue their training due to medical conditions not related to the 
program. The eight remaining participants were able to finish the six week intervention program without injuries or other 
inconvenience. Due to serious illness and hospitalization, one participant of the control group could not be retested, resulting 
in 17 subjects included for the analysis.

No changes were detected over time for either group with regards to the Tinetti-POMA or the MoCA (Table 3). 
The total time of the iTUG improved significantly after 6 weeks training in the intervention group (17.2 sec versus 
15.8 sec, p=0.02). The turn-to-sit transition improved in the intervention group by almost a second (p=0.02), whereas the 
sit-to-stand transition or turn duration did not improve. However, the step-time before the turn decreased significantly in the 
intervention group (0.7 sec versus 0.5 sec, p=0.02). 
All older adults were able to perform the visual task while sitting. However, difficulties were experienced when it was 
combined with the iTUG. The iTUG + DT proved to be very challenging, as only 41.2% of participants remembered to sit 
at the chair at the end of the TUG in combination with the dual task. As a result, the total duration and the parameters from 
turn to sit of the iTUG + DT were not analyzed. Instead, supplemental analysis showed that only 37.5% of participants in the 
intervention group remembered to sit down at the end of the TUG + DT at baseline in comparison to 75% after the interven- 
tion. No changes were seen in the control group. Further, the BioRescue training did not seem to have any effect on gait or 
dual task performance during the TUG + DT as the percentage of errors nor gait parameters improved. 
Interviews with participants from the intervention group showed that they found the program useful for their concentration, 
memory and balance, according to the results of the IMI, which resulted in a high compliance. They scored the program as 
very interesting and pleasant to do and perceived their performance of the different exercises as good to very good (Table 4). 
The emotions during the program are rated with the OERS and presented in Table 5A. Overall, sadness, anger and anxiety 
were almost never experienced during the training with the BioRescue. These emotions appeared only as a small reaction 
to the failure of an exercise. Especially alertness and pleasure were seen during the training. In comparison to the standard 
physical therapy in the residential care center, BioRescue exercises were associated with more pleasure in the two partici- 
pants who received both therapies (Table 5B and 5C).

This virtual reality training has a significant effect on dynamic balance during single task walking, as the total duration, 
turn-to-sit duration and step-time before the turn during the iTUG without dual task, improved only in the intervention 
group. This result shows that the intervention group improved functionality during transfers (i.e., turning and sitting down), 
in contrast to the control group. The fact that the iTUG improved after training with the BioRescue, is in line with the results 
of Rendon et al.25) who showed that the eight feet up and go improved significantly after six weeks of training with the Wii 
Fit. Further, Karaha et al. demonstrated a significant effect on balance, functional walking and quality of life after 6 weeks 
of virtual reality gaming using the Xbox KinectTM26). Results on the tinetti-POMA test did not improve in contrast to earlier 
published research on cognitive-motor dual task training using the Wii Fit. These studies however included significantly 
younger participants (average aged 75 to 80 years)27, 28) or had a significant higher training frequency28). In the present study, 
a training dosage of 2 days a week for 6 weeks with an increasing exercise duration up to 30 minutes was used, as suggested 
by the review of Goble et al16). Only turn-to-sit and total duration of the TUG improved. This can be explained by the fact 
that these parameters are specifically correlated to executive functions29) and virtual reality training can have a positive effect 
on executive function in elderly30). 
Cognition measured by the MoCA did not improve after 6 weeks of dual task training in contrast to the Biorescue training 
in the study of Choi et al17). However, Choi et al. included subacute stroke patients, while the present study included a more 
than 20 years older group of institutionalized older adults. The cognitive improvement was also seen in the control group, 
suggesting that the target group in the study of Choi et al. was more sensitive for cognitive improvements. However, previous 
study has shown that turn duration and turn-to-sit are correlated to executive functions29). In the present study, especially 
turn-to-sit and turn preparation improved after dual-task training. This is in line with previous study suggesting that executive 
functions improve with exergaming in institutionalized older adults31). Future studies on BioRescue training in elderly should 
therefore include a more extensive test battery for executive functions. 
The performance of the dual task did not improve in comparison to a control group who received no additional training. 
Improvements should be expected at the end of the TUG, which could not be analyzed due to missing data as almost 60% 
forgot to sit down on the chair. However, after the training only 25% of the intervention group still forgot to sit down on the 
chair while dual tasking in contrast to almost 60% in the control group. As a result, we can carefully suggest that dual-tasking 
seems to improve in the intervention group after the dual-task Biorescue training and secondary that the TUG with dual- 
tasking is a challenging test for elderly with MCI. In the present study, we have shown that the BioRescue training ensures 
enjoyment in a population of older adults living in a residential care center who are in need of lifelong physical therapy. 
Moreover, the participants felt that their performance of the different exercises was good to very good, proving that the 
BioRescue is also suited for this population and might improve patient compliance as a similar exergame training program 
has shown to do so in patients with multiple sclerosis32). 
The following strengths should be recognized in this study. The participants were allocated in random order to the inter- 
vention or control group. The two non-computerized tests (i.e., MoCa and Tinetti-POMA) were administered by a blinded 
assessor. Further, for every participant, the same footwear and walking aids were used during pre- and post-testing. There are 
some limitations in this RCT. Although, physical abilities, mental abilities and fatigue of institutionalized older adults can 
vary between and within days33), the timing during the day for pre- and post-assessment was not standardized. Even though, 

groups were randomized, the control group tended to receive more standard physical therapy than the intervention group as it 
was unethical to withhold the standard of usual care in this old population. Therefore, we can cautiously conclude that even 
though both groups had equal access to physical therapy, the BioRescue training was more effective in improving dynamic 
balance than the everyday physical therapy in a nursing home setting. Future studies should include a larger number of 
participants and a longer training duration to see if balance, cognition and dual task performance during walking effectively 
improve by training with the BioRescue. Further, a follow-up period is recommended to determine the extent to which 
improvements are retained over time. 
The results of this study suggest that the dynamic balance of institutionalized elderly improves by training with the 
BioRescue. It is a fun alternative exercise tool, well-suited for this population. More long-term studies are needed to see if 
cognition and dual task performance improve as well.
