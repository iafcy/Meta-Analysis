Objectives: Physical activity in people with dementia (PwD) may enhance physical and mental func- 
tioning. Exergaming, which combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a gaming envi- 
ronment, was developed to overcome barriers in performing physical activities. We evaluated the effects 
of exergaming in day care centers (DCCs) for PwD and informal caregivers (ICs). 
Design: A randomized controlled trial among 23 DCCs across the Netherlands randomized to exergaming 
(interactive cycling during 6 months) or a care-as-usual control group. 
Setting and Participants: A total of 112 (73 exergaming, 39 control) community-dwelling dyads (PwD, IC), 
with the PwD visiting a DCC at least twice per week. 
Methods: All outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires during interviews with PwD and 
ICs at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Primary outcomes: physical activity and mobility 
of the PwD. Secondary outcomes: physical, cognitive, emotional and social functioning, and quality of life 
for PwD. For ICs: experienced burden, quality of life, and positive care experiences. 
Results: Mixed-model analyses showed no statistically signiﬁcant effects on primary outcomes. There 
were statistically signiﬁcant positive effects on PwD’s secondary outcomes at T2 on cognition [Mini- 
Mental State Examination (MMSE): r ¼ 2.30, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.65, 3.96, P ¼ .007; and 
Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A): r ¼ (cid:2)28.98, 95% CI: (cid:2)54.89, (cid:2)3.08, P ¼ .029], social functioning 
(Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatrics subscale 1 (GIP): r ¼ (cid:2)1.86, 95% CI: (cid:2)3.56, 
(cid:2)0.17, P ¼ .031), and positive post-test effects in ICs on distress caused by the PwD’s neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (NPI-Q total distress: r ¼ (cid:2)3.30, 95% CI: (cid:2)6.57, (cid:2)0.03, P ¼ .048) and on sense of competence 
(SSCQ: r ¼ 2.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P ¼ .005). 
Conclusions and Implications: Exergaming appeared not effective on the primary outcomes. Despite the 
study being underpowered, we found positive effects on secondary outcomes for PwD and ICs, and no 
negative effects. We therefore recommend further study, dissemination, and implementation.

Being physically active not only beneﬁts physical functioning, but 
also cognitive, emotional, and social functioning and quality of life.1e3 
This also applies to people living with dementia (PwD).4e6 However, 
PwD may experience barriers being physically active, for example, 
because of impaired orientation abilities or risk of falling.7 Psycho- 
social issues may also play a role, such as a lack of conﬁdence in their 
ability to perform exercises and negative attitudes of the people 
around them toward physical activities.8 Other dementia-related 
symptoms may also impede being active, for example, a decrease of 
motivation and interest or an increase of apathy.9,10 In general, older 
people tend not to achieve the recommended amount of physical 
activity (30 minutes/day), and this worsens after admission into res- 
idential care.11e13 
Exergaming is an innovative form of physical exercise used for 
different target groups and for different aims, such as physical edu- 
cation for school children, rehabilitation for cancer patients, and 
cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurologic disorders (eg, 
dementia).14e16 It can be deﬁned as “physical exercise interactively 
combined with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment.”17 The 
movements of the participant are registered using sensors and inﬂu- 
ence a game on a screen.18 An example is interactive cycling. Partici- 
pants sit on a stationary bicycle and pick a route on a screen. The 
cycling pace determines the speed of the ﬁlm.17 
Exergaming can help PwD overcome barriers they experience with 
regard to physical exercise, for example, because they do not have to 
worry about wandering and getting lost or weather conditions. 
Exergaming can contribute to a decrease of apathy and promote social 
contact, because it is fun and one engages with others about the im- 
ages on the screen, which can motivate participation.18,19 This may add 
to a positive attitude toward exercise in those who are less interested 
in the physical activity itself. Their performance in the exergaming 
activity is something PwD can talk about with their informal care- 
givers (ICs), which can evoke positive feelings in both.20 Moreover, 
some studies among older people with and without dementia have 
shown that they enjoyed the exergaming activity and as a conse- 
quence wanted to exercise more often and longer.19,20 Interactive 
cycling, which also stimulates cognitive functioning, is a promising 
exergaming intervention, as evidenced by neurologic research in 
which older people participating in exergaming showed enhanced 
neuroplasticity and therefore a reduced risk of developing clinical 
Mild Cognitive Impairment compared to traditional exercise.21 This 
suggests that simultaneous cognitive and physical exercise has po- 
tential to prevent cognitive decline. 
There is some research available about the effects of exergaming 
for PwD. Two systematic literature reviews found effects on physical, 
cognitive, and emotional functioning, but the samples sizes of the 
included studies were small and their quality, on average, medi- 
ocre.14,17 Some studies also found improvements on (motor-)cognitive 
performance, psychomotor speed, activities of daily living, and quality 
of life.20,22e24 However, to corroborate these ﬁndings, more high- 
quality clinical trials with larger samples are required. 
Dementia also affects family or friends of PwD. They may become 
ICs, which can lead to stress-related symptoms, high burden, and 
reduced quality of life.25,26 Neuropsychiatric symptoms and behav- 
ioral problems of the PwD are (bidirectionally) related to caregiver 
burden.27,28 Exergaming by the IC can positively impact the quality of 
life of ICs, although the evidence to date is limited.20,29 There is no 
evidence yet whether exergaming by the PwD indirectly affects the ICs 
when they do not perform exergaming themselves.17 
The objective of this study was to investigate whether exergaming 
has positive effects on performance of physical activities, mobility, 
physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, and quality of 
life as compared to activities usually offered to community-dwelling 
PwD visiting psychogeriatric day care centers (DCCs). Additionally, 
for ICs, positive effects were examined on quality of life, burden 
experienced, and positive care experiences. This study is part of a 
larger study in which cost-effectiveness and implementation of 
exergaming for PwD in DCCs were also studied. 


We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial. Random 
allocation software was used by an independent researcher to 
randomize DCCs to the experimental (exergaming) or control (tradi- 
tional, nonexergaming activities) group.30 The DCC staff recruited 
dyads (PwD, IC) for the study. Measurements took place at baseline 
(T0) and after 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2). The study was registered at 
the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5537/NL5420) and approved by 
the Medical Ethics Committee (METc) of the Amsterdam University 
Medical Centers (UMC), location VU University medical center (VUmc; 
NL58227.029.16). All DCCs signed a declaration of participation. All 
PwD and ICs gave written informed consent. The study protocol was 
published elsewhere and is summarized here.31 

A convenience sample of psychogeriatric DCCs were recruited 
across the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria for PwD were as follows: all 
ages, community-dwelling, a diagnosis of any type of dementia, visits 
the DCC at least 2 days per week, has an IC willing to participate, and 
are not expected to be admitted into residential care in the coming 
6 months. Exclusion criteria were as follows: severe physical disorders 
or (terminal) diseases (other than dementia) that would make 
participation in an exergaming activity impossible (according to DCC 
staff). Figure 1 shows the enrollment and allocation process and rea- 
sons for dropout. 

The exergaming intervention was interactive cycling using a sta- 
tionary bicycle (ie, home trainer) connected to a screen. While cycling, 
the PwD sees a route on the screen. They can pick a route, and it 
mimics the experience of cycling outside, thus offering simultaneous 
physical and cognitive stimulation. For this study, DCCs had to buy or 
lease one of the following systems at a discount: DiFiets, Fietslabyrint, 
PraxFit, or SilverFit Mile.31 Various brands of equipment were used, 
but according to experts and care professionals involved in exer- 
gaming, these did not vary signiﬁcantly. The costs ranged from 1500 to 
4700 euros. 
The DCC staff were responsible for carrying out the intervention. In 
a 1-hour meeting with the investigator, they were instructed to offer 
exergaming 5 times per week as part of their regular activity program 
and to encourage research participants to take part at least twice per 
week for 6 months. They were also offered a free training about the 
use of the exergaming equipment by the provider of the chosen 
exergame(s). However, none of the DCCs made use of this offer. Apart 
from exergaming, PwD joined the regular activity program of the DCC. 

Psychogeriatric DCCs usually offer a varied activity program, for 
example, with arts and crafts, music, and physical exercise such as 
walking outdoors 5 days per week. In the control group, participants 
joined the regular activity program but were not offered exergaming. 




Primary outcomes were physical activity and mobility of the PwD. 
All physical activities were recorded (in minutes) at DCCs and at home 
during 7 days at each measurement (T0, T1, T2) by DCC staff and ICs 
using a speciﬁcally developed form. The time spent by PwD on exer- 
gaming was also recorded on this form. We used the total number of 
minutes per week (T0, T1, T2) for the analysis. To measure mobility, 
the interviewers administered the Short Physical Performance Battery 
at DCCs.32 The Short Physical Performance Battery evaluates lower 
extremity functioning, which is strongly correlated with a risk of 
mobility disability in older adults and consists of 3 subtests: balance, 
gait speed, and chair stands. Total scores range between 0 and 12, with 
the following categories: good functioning and no risk of developing 
mobility disability (10-12), elevated risk (4-9), and loss of mobility 
already being present (0-3).33 

Secondary outcomes for PwD were cognitive, emotional, and social 
functioning; quality of life; and other physical outcomes than the 
primary outcome. For ICs, we assessed the subjective caregivers

burden, quality of life, and positive care experiences. Background 
characteristics of all PwD and ICs were collected. See Tables 2 and 3 
and Supplementary Material 1 (Supplementary Tables 1-3) for a 
complete list of outcome measures. 

Data were collected from PwD via face-to-face interviews at the 
DCC, and ICs were interviewed by telephone at T0, T1, and T2. The 
interviewers were bachelor’s or master’s students of (applied) psy- 
chology or medicine, who received extensive training. 
PwD and 42 ICs participated at T2 in the exergaming group and 32 
PwD and 23 ICs in the control group. There were no signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences between PwD and ICs who dropped out and those who 
continued. 
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics. There were no statistically 
signiﬁcant differences between the groups. PwD in the exergaming 
group were more physically active than in the control group, but this 
difference was not signiﬁcant. In the exergaming group, the mean 
(standard deviation) of minutes of exergaming during 1 week by the 
PwD was 32.4 (39.2) at T0, 22.8 (24.7) at T1, and 29.8 (32.0) at T2. 


The required sample size was based on one of the secondary 
outcome measures for cognitive functioning [Mini-Mental State Ex- 
amination (MMSE)], because no high-quality studies investigating the 
effect of a similar intervention on the primary outcomes (physical 
activity and mobility) were available at that time. Assuming a power of 
80% and a difference of 2 points (standard deviation of 4.6) on the 
MMSE with an intracluster correlation coefﬁcient of 0.05 and an alpha 
of 0.05, we needed a sample size of 166 dyads. When adding the 
cluster effect of DCC (7 dyads per cluster) and dropout (4%), a total 
sample of 224 dyads was needed. 

Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM, 
Armonk, NY). To reveal any signiﬁcant differences in background 
characteristics and dropout between the exergaming and control 
groups, independent samples t and c2 tests were performed on 
baseline data for ordinal and nominal variables, respectively. Missing 
data of all outcome measures were imputed on item level according to 
the existing instructions. 
Mixed-model (intention-to-treat) analyses were conducted with 
time (3 and 6 months), intervention (exergaming vs control), and the 
interaction between intervention and time, to analyze the effects on 
all outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for the baseline value of the 
particular outcome. A 3-level structure (ie, repeated observations 
clustered within individuals and individuals clustered within DCC) 
was used. This method adjusts for the correlation between the 
repeated measurements within the individual. Additionally, dose- 
response relationships were analyzed with the same method, with 
exergaming as a continuous variable. Effects were considered statis- 
tically signiﬁcant if P (cid:3) .05. 
Based on previous research, all mixed-model analyses were 
adjusted for T0-MMSE as a potential confounder (T0-MMSE). Besides 
that, additional adjustments were made for body mass index (for the 
PwD), sex, age, and level of education (for both PwD and ICs).34e36 
Furthermore, effect sizes (Cohen d) were calculated, with d (cid:4) 0.20 
considered a small, d (cid:4) 0.40 a medium, and d (cid:4) 0.80 a large effect 
size.37 Additionally, d (cid:4) 0.24 was considered clinically relevant, as at 
this cutoff patients considered treatment clinically relevant.38 The 
sample size was too small to use the method of QUalitative INteraction 
Trees mentioned in the protocol.39 


Figure 1 shows the process of enrolment and allocation of DCCs 
and participants to the experimental and control groups, and the 
reasons for drop-out. Eleven DCCs participated in the exergaming and 
9 DCCs in the control group. In total, 112 PwD and their ICs (73 exer- 
gaming, 39 control) enrolled in the study. Because of drop-out, 52 
Table 2 shows there were no effects on the primary outcome 
measures for PwD. Effect sizes for mobility (Short Physical Perfor- 
mance Battery) were small (0.14 at T1; 0.11 at T2, corrected for T0- 
MMSE) and not clinically relevant. Adding other confounders hardly 
made any difference. The effect sizes for physical activity were also 
small, but clinically relevant (0.30 at T1; 0.28 at T2, corrected only for 
T0-MMSE, and 0.35 at T1; 0.37 at T2 with the other potential con- 
founders added). 
Regarding the secondary outcomes, 2 outcome measures for 
cognitive functioning showed positive effects of exergaming. For the 
MMSE, this was at T2 (r ¼ 2.30, 95% CI: 0.65, 3.96, P ¼ .007) with a 
small, but clinically relevant, effect size (d ¼ 0.36). Another effect was 
on the Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A) at T2 (r ¼ (cid:2)28.98, 95% 
CI: (cid:2)54.89, (cid:2)3.08, P ¼ .029) again with a small, but clinically relevant, 
effect size (d ¼ (cid:2)0.37). Both effects (MMSE and TMT-A scores) 
increased slightly when the other confounders were added. 
A third effect was found on the Behavior Observation Scale for 
Intramural Psychogeriatrics [Gedragsobservatieschaal voor de Intra- 
murale Psychogeriatrie (GIP)], subscale nonsocial behavior of the 
PwD. There was a positive effect of exergaming at T2 when corrected 
for T0-MMSE (r ¼ (cid:2)1.86, 95% CI: (cid:2)3.56, (cid:2)0.17, P ¼ .031) with an almost 
medium effect size (d ¼ (cid:2)0.49). With the other confounders added, 
the effect sizes remained small ((cid:2)0.26 at T1 and e0.34 at T2). 
A medium effect size ((cid:2)0.53) was found on the number of falls at 
T1 in favor of exergaming. Other clinically relevant effect sizes were on 
cognitive functioning [Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B)], motivation 
(IMI subscales: 1 interest/enjoyment, 4 perceived choice of physical 
exercise), physical activities (Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly), and 
quality of life both indicated by the PwD themselves and by the ICs 
about the PwD (EQ-5D-5L). 

Table 3 shows the effects for ICs. For distress experienced due to 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of the PwD (NPI-Q total distress) there 
was a statistically signiﬁcant positive effect at T1 when corrected for 
T0-MMSE (r ¼ (cid:2)3.30, 95% CI: (cid:2)6.57, (cid:2)0.03, P ¼ .048) with a small, but 
clinically relevant effect size (d ¼ (cid:2)0.38). This effect becomes 
nonsigniﬁcant when corrected for the other confounders, but the ef- 
fect size remains clinically relevant. No signiﬁcant effects were found 
on the NPI-Q total distress at T2, and the effect sizes remain small but 
clinically relevant. 
There was a positive effect of exergaming on the subjective burden 
and sense of competence (SSCQ) at T1 when corrected for T0-MMSE 
and the other confounders (r ¼ 2.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P ¼ .005) 
with a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.55). When only T0-MMSE of the PwD 
remained as a confounder, this effect size was still small and clinically 
relevant (d ¼ 0.35). This effect disappeared at T2.

*For people of 70 years or older, a body mass index between 22 and 27.9 is considered healthy. 
yScores on the Mini-Mental State Examination range from 0 (severe dementia) to 30 (no dementia). 

This study shows that exergaming had no effect on the primary 
outcomes. However, we did observe some small to moderate positive 
effects on cognitive and social functioning in PwD and small effects on 
distress and subjective burden and sense of competence of ICs. 
Furthermore, though not statistically signiﬁcant, we did observe 
clinically relevant effect sizes on physical activity of PwD, and their 
interest or enjoyment and perceived choice of physical exercise. These 
are important and promising results. This is the ﬁrst study to show 
that exergaming for PwD indirectly also has positive effects for the ICs, 
that is, while the ICs do not perform exergaming themselves. No im- 
provements were found on emotional functioning of PwD, quality of 
life of PwD and ICs, or positive care experiences of ICs. 
Previous research found positive effects of exergaming on physical 
activity, cognitive and social functioning, and interest or enjoyment in 
and perceived choice of physical exercise in PwD, which is in line with 
our ﬁndings.14,17,20,22,23 In contrast with previous studies, we did not 
ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant effects on physical and emotional func- 
tioning of the PwD.24,50 This may have been caused by differences in 
outcome measures. For example, we used single items of The Older 
Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey Minimum DataSet that

measures emotional functioning in general, whereas another study 
used more detailed and speciﬁc instruments to measure fear of falling 
and conﬁdence in balance.50 This may imply that the effect of exer- 
gaming on emotional functioning is closely related to improved 
physical functioning. In our study, we did not ﬁnd an effect on physical 
functioning, which may explain the absence of effect in emotional 
functioning. 
For several outcomes, we found clinically relevant effect sizes, 
although not statistically signiﬁcant. This may be explained by the 
small sample size, but also by the large variation in outcomes of 
physical activity and mobility, physical, cognitive, emotional and social 
functioning, and quality of life of the PwD. With a bigger sample size, 
we could have conducted subgroup analysis. Furthermore, perhaps 
the prescribed minimum of twice-per-week exergaming was too low 
to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant effects. 
Although there were no signiﬁcant differences in cycling experi- 
ence before the start of the study between the exergaming and control 
groups (see Table 1), PwD in the control group did tend to have more 
cycling experience (P ¼ .07). This may have inﬂuenced the outcomes. 

The fact that many DCCs participated, that there was a high uptake 
in study participants, and that they were enthusiastic about the 
exergaming intervention are strengths of this study. Our study 
showed that the implementation by the organization assigned to the 
intervention group was successful. As we will report in a separate 
article, they systematically applied strategies that positively inﬂuence 
implementation factors at the level of the intervention, the users (ie, 
professionals), organization, and environment (J. van Santen et al, 
unpublished data, 2020). 
However, this study also had several limitations. The recruitment 
process was complicated by many hindering factors, such as lack of 
money and time for DCCs to participate in the study, and ICs already 
feeling overburdened. This resulted in an underpowered sample size. 
Additionally, many statistical tests were performed, which could mean 
that some of the statistically signiﬁcant effects are a coincidence. We 
did not correct for multiple testing, because we did not focus solely on 
statistical signiﬁcance, and also found the clinical relevance of great 
importance.51 Nevertheless, to be able to generalize our ﬁndings to- 
ward a larger population, we think the statistically signiﬁcant effects 
and clinically relevant effect sizes found in this study should be 
conﬁrmed in a larger trial. Additionally, there was a large percentage 
of drop-out among DCCs, PwD, and ICs. 
No outcome data were collected about the staff of DCCs actually 
offering the intervention 5 times per week and encouraging research 
participants to take part at least twice per week for 6 months. Neither 
was the adherence rate of participants measured. Moreover, interac- 
tive cycling is only one type of exergaming and it is impossible to 
verify whether the results are generalizable to other types of exer- 
gaming. Another issue with generalizability is selection bias. Perhaps 
DCCs, PwD, and ICs who were interested in physical activities were 
more inclined to participate in the study. 
Some outcome measures may have been too complicated for 
(some) PwD. The IMI, for example, has many statements with a 7- 
point answering scale, which often confused PwD.44 Additionally, 
certain outcome measures proved to be challenging when people 
were illiterate, deaf, or not native Dutch speakers. Furthermore, the 
number of outcome measures caused lengthy interviews ((cid:4)1 hour), 
which was burdensome. Data were also collected by staff of DCCs and 
ICs using custom registration forms. This was regularly forgotten 
(despite reminders) and led to missing data or errors. For some out- 
comes, like the Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly, the reporting of 
the PwD and ICs differed, raising questions about reliability.

Despite a lack of power in our study, we would recommend (staff 
of) care organizations to offer exergaming to PwD. Ways to obtain 
funding for the equipment would need to be explored as this was 
sometimes a problem for DCCs. Our recommendation to offer exer- 
gaming is based on the positive effects on cognitive and social func- 
tioning of the PwD and on distress and sense of competence of their 
carers and the lack of adverse events. Communication of these results 
may encourage PwD to exercise more and to experience the beneﬁts. 
Based on this study, this can be expected to indirectly beneﬁt their 
carers’ sense of competence, subjective burden, and distress. Future 
studies with larger samples are recommended to conﬁrm our ﬁndings 
and to extend the knowledge about the effectiveness of different types 
of exergaming in different settings.
