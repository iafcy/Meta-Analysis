mately 15% to 20% of older adults aged 65 and over 
experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI),1, which rep- 
resents a transient state of cognitive decline seen in nor- 
mal aging and in those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dis- 
ease (AD).2 Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 
include activities of complex and intentional cognitive 
processes, such as shopping and managing money, and 
are critical for one to live independently in a community.3 
Researchers have found that older adults with MCI had

bacKGrouNd: a combination of physical and cognitive training appears to be the effective intervention to improve cognitive function 
in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computing technology such as virtual reality (VR) may have the potential to assist 
rehabilitation in shaping brain health. However, little is known about the potential of VR-based physical and cognitive training designed as an 
intervention for cognition and brain activation in elderly patients with MCI. Moreover, whether a VR program designed around functional tasks 
can improve their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) requires further investigation. 
AIM: This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive function, brain activation and 
IADL and compared the VR intervention with combined physical and cognitive training. 
dEsiGN: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. 
SETTING: Communities and day care centers in Taipei, Taiwan. 
POPULATION: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment. 
METHODS: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomized into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training 
(VR) group or a combined physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assessed for their cog- 
nitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex 
activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating 
pathway of the intervention. 
RESULTS: Both groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed 
significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention. 
The group × time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training 
(P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural 
efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects. 
CONCLUSIONS: VR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI. 
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: VR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.

lower IADL scores than their healthy counterparts.4 in ad- 
dition, compared to older adults with normal IADL, older 
adults with both MCI and IADL deficits are more likely to 
develop dementia5. Given the subsequent risk of MCI for 
developing dementia, interventions targeting Mci have 
great potential to preserve cognitive function as well as to 
maintain intact iadl. 
In a previous review study, cognitive training led to sig- 
nificant improvements in memory, executive function, pro- 
cessing speed, attention, fluid intelligence, and subjective 
evaluation of cognitive functioning among older adults 
with MCI.6 cognitive training not only improved cogni- 
tive functioning but also benefited functional performance 
that is fundamental to performing iadl.7, 8 similar to cog- 
nitive training, physical exercise has also been one of the 
interventions. Öhman et al. found that aerobic exercise, 
weight training, balance training, and tai chi were among 
the typical components of physical training programs for 
enhancing cognitive function in older adults with MCI, 
especially in the domains of executive functioning, atten- 
tion and delayed recall.9 recently, mounting evidence also 
pointed out that combining physical and cognitive training 
may strengthen the intervention effects on cognitive func- 
tion in older adults with MCI.10-13 For example, Barnes et 
al. stated that older adults with MCI who received both 
aerobic exercise and mental activity training showed im- 
provements in global cognitive function.14 Whereas the 
positive effects of combined physical and cognitive train- 
ing on cognitive functions have been robust in the litera- 
ture, most studies did not find that these training effects 
successfully transferred to iadl improvement.12 
Information and computer technology (ICT) has be- 
come a popular approach in assessing cognitive function- 
ing because it provides an ecologically valid treatment. 
A systematic review of ICT-based cognitive or physical 
training has shown the positive effects of these technol- 
ogy applications on attention, visual memory and verbal 
memory, as well as executive function of older adults with 
Mci.15 Virtual reality (VR), one of the most advanced 
ict technologies, provides an immersive, intuitive, mo- 
tivating, interactive and multisensory feedback context in 
which participants can practice customized activities of 
daily living in the virtual environment that conventional 
rehabilitative interventions could not offer.16, 17 However, 
most articles about Vr training are either physical or cog- 
nitive training.16 studies on the effects of combining both 
physical and cognitive training in the VR context are lack- 
ing. Moreover, these studies have not been intended for 
improving IADL. Given the fact that IADL require high 
demands in physical activity and cognitive resources, par- 
ticularly executive functioning and memory, the IADL- 
based cognitive and physical training programs in the Vr 
context may more likely transfer from the intervention ef- 
fect to their actual IADL. However, evidence for these in- 
novative interventions requires further investigation. 
Brain imaging techniques provide a more in-depth 
understanding of cognitive aging and the physiological 
mechanisms responsible for intervention efficacy. Near-in- 
frared spectroscopy (NIRS), an innovative neuroimaging 
technique, measures hemodynamic changes during brain 
activation. In comparison with fMRI, the advantages of 
NIRS include lower costs, portability, lower susceptibility 
to movement artifacts, and a high temporal sampling rate. 
compared to cognitively preserved counterparts, those 
with MCI showed higher activation in the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex during a memory task. This increased 
activity may reflect a compensatory mechanism enabling 
them to perform normally due to malfunctioning memory 
networks in subjects with MCI.18 However, previous find- 
ings have shown mixed patterns of post-training brain ac- 
tivation in subjects with MCI. Using fMRI, Belleville et 
al. found increased activation after memory training in the 
frontal, temporal and parietal areas in subjects with MCI.19 
However, Vermeij et al. did not find any working memory 
training-related changes in prefrontal activation.20 in ad- 
dition, studies applying Vr as an intervention strategy for 
brain activation in older adults with MCI are still lacking. 
Thus, the present study aimed at exploring the effects 
of Vr-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive 
functions, brain activation, and IADL, as well as compar- 
ing the Vr intervention to a traditional combined physical 
and cognitive training program. 


Participants were recruited from communities and day care 
centers in Taipei, Taiwan. All participants met the follow- 
ing inclusion criteria: 1) aged 65 years old and above; 2) 
able to walk more than 10 meters without walking aids; 
3) had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score 
greater than or equal to 24 and a Montreal Cognitive As- 
sessment (MoCA) score lower than 26;21 4) had self-report- 
ed memory complaints; 5) had the ability to perform ADLs. 
The exclusion criteria were: 1) a diagnosis of dementia; 2) 
a history of malignant tumors; 3) the presence of unstable 
neurological or orthopedic disease that would have inter- 





fered with participation in the study; 4) an education level 
less than six years (elementary school). The study protocol 
was approved by the Institutional Human Research Ethics 
committee of National yang-Ming university and has been 
registered at www.clinicaltrials.in.th (TCTR20181001001 
on october 1st, 2018). All participants provided signed 
informed consent before participation. G*power 3.0 was 
used to determine the sample size needed for the present 
study. Before starting the study, we could not find any ar- 
ticles using the same intervention (virtual reality) and the 
same primary outcome (MOCA). Therefore, our sample 
size calculation was conducted by Hwang et al.,22 which 
showed that the virtual reality training group had a greater 
improvement in the Visual span test after intervention. 
based on the calculated effect size for the Visual span test 
(Cohen’s d=0.357), we estimated the sample size for the 
current study to be 17 participants in each group. 

This study was a single-blinded (assessor) randomized 
controlled trial. Recruitment and screening were per- 
formed between October 2018 and January 2019. Re- 
cruitments were conducted in communities and day care 
centers in Taipei city by three assessors (physiothera- 
pists). Screening evaluations were performed during the 
same periods by the same assessors to confirm the MCI 
patients. Randomization was performed after eligible sub- 
jects signed the informed consent. Participants meeting the 
criteria were randomly assigned to either the VR group or 
the cpc group via a sealed envelope. participants in the 
Vr group participated in a 60-minute, Vr-based physi- 
cal and cognitive training session each visit, three times a 
week for 12 weeks. Those in the CPC group participated in 
combined physical and cognitive training program for 60 
minutes each visit, three times a week for 12 weeks. Ex- 
ercise training was conducted by an experienced physical 
therapist for both the Vr and cpc groups. in each com- 
munity, small group training (3-4 people in a group) was 
conducted instead of large group training (more than 10 
people in a group) because we wanted to control the qual- 
ity of intervention. The outcomes were measured at base- 
line and after completing 36 sessions by the same assessor 
who was always blinded to the group assignments. 

college of sports Medicine23 and consisted of resistance 
exercises, aerobic exercise, and balance exercises. During 
resistance exercise, Therabands were used on both upper 
and lower extremities. During aerobic exercise, a sequence 
of whole-body activities was performed, including step- 
ping exercises in seated and standing positions, stepping 
on and off of a stool, and standing up from and sitting in a 
chair, to allow participants to achieve 50-75% of the maxi- 
mal heart rate (HRmax = 220 − age). Perceived exertion was 
obtained using Borg’s scale (scores ranging from 6 to 20, 
where 6 means “no exertion at all” and 20 means “maximal 
exertion”), and the ideal observed effort was a score of 13 
to 14 (“somewhat hard”). Balance exercises included static 
and dynamic balance training. Functional tasks that can en- 
hance motor performance and simulate tasks of activity of 
daily living were also integrated into our physical training 
programs, for example, stair climbing, obstacle crossing, 
walking forward, backward and sideways, turning, ris- 
ing from a chair, and squatting when reaching for objects. 
The exercise progressions included adding more weights 
and increasing the number of repetitions during resistance 
exercise, increasing the difficulty of exercise, such as in- 
creasing the height of the stool during aerobic exercise, in- 
creasing the forward/sideward reaching distance during the 
balance exercise, and holding the squatting position for a 
longer duration during the squatting exercise. 
Cognitive training was simultaneously introduced dur- 
ing the exercise. A sample combined physical and cogni- 
tive exercise could include the following: walking and 
turning around while reciting poems, crossing obstacles 
of various heights while enumerating animals or flow- 
ers, strengthening lower extremity muscles while practic- 
ing math calculations, stepping in place with one or both 
hands drawing circles in the air in a clockwise or coun- 
terclockwise manner, drawing a clock with one hand in 
the air while practicing weight shifting, and looking for 
prefix/roots of a Chinese character while performing the 
sit-to-stand task. 

in each session, participants participated in Vr-based 
physical training for 40 minutes and cognitive training 
for 20 minutes. details on the physical and cognitive pro- 
grams in this group are as follows. 


The physical training program was based on exercise pro- 
grams suggested for elderly populations from the american 
The Kinect system (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 
WA, USA) was used for capturing and tracking changes in 





limb segment motions with infrared light. This system also 
created a full-body 3d virtual map. our Vr-based physi- 
cal training programs were developed by Tano and Long- 
Good. participants imitated the virtual characters and ad- 
justed their movements in real time according to the instan- 
taneous visual and auditory feedback. Exercises included 
simplified 24-form Yang-style tai chi, resistance exercises, 
aerobic exercises and functionally oriented tasks such as 
window cleaning, goldfish scooping, obstacle crossing, 
stair climbing and walking designed to improve upper and 
lower extremities, balance, stability, muscle strength, and 
endurance. 

The VIVE system developed by the HTC company was 
used for the present study. The station was placed on the 
diagonal of the activity space with a maximum sensing 
space of 4×3 meters. The participants wore VR glasses 
on their heads and had motor controllers in both hands 
during the training. Some VR games were invented by 
our laboratory, while others were derived from the com- 
mercially available software “Job Simulator” developed 
by Owlchemy Labs. The design concept of the VR games 
was based on actual IADL, such as shopping, food prepa- 
ration, handling finances, and transportation. The par- 
ticipants were guided by verbal instructions and asked to 
memorize the instructions and certain spatial characteris- 
tics. four games used in the current study are described as 
follows (Figure 1): 
• take mass rapid transit (MRT): the game was de- 
signed to mimic the environment of a Mrt station. Every 
MRT station was equipped with gates, ticket vending ma- 
chines, and ATMs. Participants were asked to follow the 
standard procedure of metro transit (e.g., find the designed 
station, gather an accurate amount of money based on the 
fare chart and obtain a ticket from a vending machine). A 
large red cross would show up as a notification if things 
were going wrong; 
• looking for a store: in this game, participants were 
asked to find stores marked on a map. The search should 
be completed in three minutes. if the participants had not 
found the store in the first two minutes, there would be 
direction marks in red to guide the way for the partici- 
pants; 
• kitchen chef: the kitchen was equipped with kitchen 
appliances such as a flow table, gas stove, refrigerator, 
etc., and there were some cooking tools in the closet. The 
game began with an order of a particular dish. Step-by- 
step instructions were available to complete the meal.

and performing VR tasks. 
Participants were required to memorize the recipe and 
preparation steps. Simple dishes were introduced first, and 
if successfully completed, orders of more complex dishes, 
which took more ingredients and cooking utensils, would 
follow; 
• convenience store clerk: the scene was a convenience 
store, including typical decorations (e.g., checkout coun- 
ters, cash registers, hot dog machines). The game began 
with a list of checkout items. Step-by-step instructions 
were also available for the participants to find these items, 
add to the shopping basket and complete the checkout. 
Similar to the kitchen chef game, not all the required tools 
were easily accessible. 

Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures (neuropsy- 
chological tasks, functional status and brain activation) 
were measured by the same assessor (a physiotherapist 
with 6 years of experience), who was blinded to the group 
assignments. 











ing food. responses to each of the eight items in the scale 
were coded as 0 (unable or partially able) or 1 (able). The 
summary score could range from 0 to 8, with higher scores 
indicating higher functional status and independence. the 
iadl scale can be used to differentially diagnose cog- 
nitively healthy aging and cognitive disorders in older 
adults. the reliability and validity have been established 
in Taiwan.29 

A 16-channel NIRS device (OEG-16, Spectratech Inc., 
Yokohama, Japan) containing two types of infrared light 
(770 nm and 840 nm) was used to measure brain activation 
simultaneously with the assessment of the MoCA during 
the pre- and postintervention periods. a head module con- 
sisted of two rows of photodiodes with three sources and 
three detectors in each row and was attached to each par- 
ticipant’s forehead using a headband to monitor the hemo- 
dynamics of the left, right and bilateral prefrontal cortex 
(PFC). The distance between the source and detector was 
3 cm, which enabled hemodynamic measurements 2-3 cm 
beneath the skin. The detection optodes were placed 25-30 
mm above the midpoint of the eyebrow at approximately 
FP1, and FP2 in the international 10/20 system standard 
for electroencephalography (Figure 2). Therefore, we de- 
fined CH4 and CH7 to represent the right PFC (EEG elec- 
trode site FP2) and CH10 and CH13 to represent the left 


The MoCA was used to assess global cognition. The 
MoCA was divided into seven subcategories: visuospatial/ 
executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstrac- 
tion, and orientation. the score ranged from 0 to 30, and 
a higher score indicated better global cognitive function. 
the Moca has been used as an effective screening and 
evaluation instrument for cognitive impairments, includ- 
ing Mci and alzheimer’s disease.24 

The Executive Interview 25 (EXIT-25) was developed by 
royall et al.25 The EXIT-25 consisted of 25 items assess- 
ing a broad array of executive functions, including num- 
ber/letter sequencing; word and design fluency; sentence 
repetition; thematic perception; memory with distraction; 
interference inhibition; grasp and snout reflexes; social 
habits; motor perseveration; finger-nose repetition; echo- 
praxia; complex hand sequences; complex commands; 
counting and serial order reversal; and automatic, utili- 
zation, and imitation behaviors. the total score ranged 
from 0 to 50, with a possible score on each item of 0 to 2. 
A higher score indicated poorer executive function. The 
EXIT-25 has demonstrated a moderate internal consisten- 
cy (α=0.66).26 

The Chinese version of the Verbal Learning Test (CVVLT) 
consisted of nine two-character nouns presented over four 
learning trials, with recall assessed immediately and after 
10-minute delays. The examiner read the 9 words on the 
list aloud at one-second intervals in a fixed order over four 
learning trials. After each trial, the participant was asked 
to recall as many words as he/she could, in any order. Af- 
ter 10 minutes, the participant was again asked to recall 
the list. We calculated the total number of nouns correctly 
remembered to assess immediate recall and delayed recall. 
The CVVLT was translated from the original English ver- 
sion and has demonstrated sound psychometric proper- 
ties.27 

Functional status was measured by the Lawton Instrumen- 
tal Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL).28 the iadl 
scale was composed of eight items to evaluate one’s abil- 
ity to perform tasks such as handling finances and prepar-

PFC (EEG electrode site FP1). The principle of NIRS is 
that near-infrared light penetrates the skull and is absorbed 
by the chromophores with different absorption spectra. 
The preprocessed signals were converted to concentration 
changes as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO), deoxygenated 
hemoglobin (HbD), and total hemoglobin (HbT).30, 31 the 
modified Beer-Lambert law was used for each source-de- 
tector channel.32 hbo has been considered to be a robust 
and reproducible change in regional cerebral blood flow. 
Studies have shown that the fMRI BOLD response is more 
strongly correlated with HbO than with HbD, which may 
be due to the higher signal-to-noise ratio in hbo.33 there- 
fore, only HbO-derived concentration changes (mM×mm) 
were used in the statistical analyses to evaluate brain ac- 
tivation. 


We performed per-protocol analysis in this study. all statis- 
tical analyses were performed using SPSS v. 20.0 software 
(SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were 
used to present the distribution of the variables as the mean 
and standard deviation or the number and proportion. in- 
dependent t-tests or Chi-square tests were used to detect 
the intergroup differences in baseline characteristics of the 
two groups. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
repeated measures was used to determine the effects of 
the Vr and cpc interventions on cognitive function and 
gait performance. The model effects included groups (VR, 
CPC), time (pre, post), and their interaction. We compared 
differences between groups as well as the changes with- 
in a group from the pre- to postintervention assessments. 
Tukey’s post-hoc tests were used for variables with group 
× time interaction effects. MATLAB software was used to 
analyze the NIRS data. The NIRS signals were bandpass 
filtered (a low-pass frequency of 0.01 Hz and a high-pass 
frequency of 0.1 Hz) to eliminate the effects of physiologi- 
cal spontaneous brain oscillations and to correct drift arti- 
facts over the whole experimental session. We defined the 
baseline period as the 20 seconds prior to the onset of the 
task and the activation period as the 10 seconds before and 
10 seconds after the peak HbO value during the MoCA task. 
Because our primary interest was to examine task-related 
changes in HbO, we defined the delta as the difference be- 
tween the average HbO value of the activation period and 
the baseline period. the averages of the delta of ch4 and 
CH7 (right PFC), of CH10 and CH13 (left PFC), and of 
CH4, CH7, CH10, and CH13 (bilateral PFC) were used for 
statistical analyses of the within- and between-group com- 
parisons. Statistical significance was set at P less than 0.05. 

As shown in the flow chart in Figure 3, we screened 110 
elderly individuals with the potential for mild cognitive 
impairment. A total of 68 elderly were excluded due to not 
meeting the inclusion criteria or declining to participate. 
We only retained the demographic data for the 42 eligible 
elderly individuals who signed the informed consent and 
were randomized. Of the enrolled individuals, 21 were 
randomly assigned to the VR group, and 21 were ran- 
domly assigned to the cpc group. in these 42 participants, 
three (one in the VR group and two in the CPC group) did 
not complete the study due to health problems unrelated 
to training and five (two in VR group and three in CPC 
group) dropped out due to low motivation. Therefore, a 
total of 34 participants (18 in the VR group and 16 in the 
CPC group) completed all the assessments, and their data 
were used in the final statistical analyses. None of the par- 
ticipants reported any adverse events. 
the demographic characteristics of the participants are 
shown in Table I. There were no significant differences in 
the demographic parameters of the two groups. Further- 
more, the differences between the two groups in all out- 
come measures at the preintervention assessment were not 
significant. 
the results for the primary outcome measures are 
shown in Table II. In the VR group, significant within- 
group effects were noted for the MoCA (P<0.001, ef- 
fect size=1.03), EXIT-25 (P=0.01, effect size=0.65), 
CVVLT immediate and delayed recall (P<0.001, effect 
size=0.64 and P=0.002, effect size=0.89 respectively), and

training program. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first training program using IADL-based VR as a means 
of intervention for MCI. First, we found that both groups 
improved their executive function and verbal memory 
(immediate recall). Second, significant improvements in 
MOCA and IADL were observed only after VR-based 
cognitive and physical training, while the dual physical 
and cognitive training group showed non-significant im- 
provements in Moca and iadl. finally, the improved 
global cognitive function in the VR group was coupled 
with simultaneous decreases in the brain activation of the 
prefrontal areas. 
The physiological effects of physical exercise on brain 
functioning include the release of the neurotrophic factor 
BDNF, increased blood flow, and beneficial metabolic ef- 
fects. these outcomes might facilitate neuroplastic poten- 
tials and enhance learning during cognitive training.34 our 
results of CPC training were somewhat consistent with the 
literature,11, 35 especially in terms of its positive effects on 
executive functions and memory. Executive functions re- 
fer to the higher-order cognitive abilities involved in plan- 
ning, initiating, monitoring, and inhibiting goal-oriented 
behaviors36 and are particularly critical to successfully 
executing IADL.37 Memory (immediate, short and long 
delay memory) deficits often lead to difficulty complet- 
ing iadl and accounted for much of the variance in func- 
tional impairment.38 However, as suggested by the recent 
literature,12 the significant improvement in executive func- 
tions and immediate memory after cpc training did not 
transfer to IADL. In fact, IADL require complex cognitive 
processing other than executive functions and immediate 
memory. Cognitive domains (such as visuospatial orienta- 
tion and attention), physical capacity (such as visual acu- 
ity) and neuropsychiatric factors (such as depression or 
apathy) are also critical to IADL.38, 39 it is also possible 
that the three-month cpc programs may be too short in 
duration to observe significant improvements in other cog- 
nitive functions and, thus, improvements in iadl. 
A previous study revealed that functional task training 
could improve cognitive functions in older adults with 
Mci.40 the advantage of the Vr intervention might be 
that our IADL-based functional tasks effectively facili- 
tated complex cognitive processing as participants repeti- 
tively practiced these functional tasks during the 12-week 
intervention. For example, “kitchen chef” was specifically 
designed to train for memory, visuospatial orientation and 
executive functioning, while participants prepared food as 
ordered with available kitchenware and ingredients. “Con- 
venience store clerk” trained for memory, orientation and 
executive function as the participants retrieved and calcu- 
lated the prices of the checkout items. Our program in- 
volved changes in cognitive load in the form of dual-task 
stimulation. Participants received immediate feedback and 
optimized their dual-task performances. We believe that 
dual-task stimulation with internalized feedback by VR 
may have effects on various cognitive functions. the other 
explanations are that VR provides a real-life scenario and 
coaching interactions tailored to individual performances. 
Therefore, the enjoyment and attractiveness of VR charac- 
teristics may increase their motivation and lead to exten- 
sive training effects resulting in cognitive improvement. 
Overall, these were the critical features that the combined 
physical and cognitive training program could not offer. 
A prior systematic review found that only two out of 
nine ict training studies reported improvements in iadl, 
and the effect size was relatively small for individu- 
als with MCI.41 However, our results showed significant 
within- and between-group differences in IADL after VR 
training. Compared to other ICT studies, our VR equip- 
ment provided the most immersive experience. In addi- 
tion, our VR program followed the principle of Robert et 
al.’s recommendations42 to emulate the activities of daily 
living. It is possible that the immersive experience in the 
IADL of our program facilitated the transfer of acquired 
functional capabilities into real-life iadl. as mentioned 
earlier, IADL required both cognitive and physical capac- 
ity. Apart from the IADL-based cognitive program we ad- 
opted, our physical training programs also contained many 
functional activities, such as stepping over obstacles, win- 
dow cleaning, lighting fireworks, and goldfish grasping. 
Participants are required to be attentive to verbal instruc- 
tions, and meanwhile, shift their weight, squat constantly, 
and reach toward a target at a given location as accurately 
and quickly as possible. These goal-directed actions not 
only improve physical capacities (e.g., muscle strength, 
balance and endurance) but also facilitate higher-ordered 
cognitive functions such as attention, visuospatial orienta- 
tion and executive function to integrate information. Our 
improved cognitive functions in the Vr group can illus- 
trate the generalized training effect to iadl. although the 
present VR program did not exactly mirror all the daily 
functional activities, the generalized effects on everyday 
problem-solving abilities found in the present study still 
support the idea that training effects can be transferred to 
untrained daily living activities. 
Age-related neural declines may lead to a reduced qual- 
ity of neural processing.43 different models have been pro- 
posed to explain the brain plasticity of the aging brain. The 





compensatory model suggests that the aging brain maintains 
optimal cognitive functions by relying on both increased 
activation of specialized areas and recruitment of addition- 
al brain networks.44 similar effects could be observed in el- 
derly people with MCI. For example, Belleville et al. found 
that MCI increased activations in a large network (frontal, 
temporal and parietal areas), including areas activated prior 
to training and new alternative areas activated following 
training, while healthy controls showed mostly decreased 
activation as the consequence of training.19 thus, broader 
activation has been suggested as a compensatory strategy 
for a demented brain to maintain intact cognitive func- 
tions measured by behavioral data. the present study only 
measured the frontal areas of the brain, and thus we could 
not determine if there was any compensatory activation in 
other undetected areas. However, decreased activation in 
the brain after training could be seen as training-induced 
increase in neural efficiency, as a lower amount of energy 
or fewer brain networks were needed to achieve similar 
levels of cognitive performance due to the intervention. 
The concept of neural efficiency has been used in previous 
studies, revealing decreased activation of frontal-parietal 
areas and increased cognitive performance in older adults 
after training.20, 45, 46 The present study extended the prior 
literature by showing that the brains of older adults with 
Mci, similar to healthy older adults, remain highly plastic. 
Previous findings showed that 12 weeks of treadmill ex- 
ercise decreases brain activation intensity during a semantic 
memory task and suggested that exercise may improve neu- 
ral efficiency and cognitive function in MCI.47 the cogni- 
tive improvement may be associated with the significantly 
decreased prefrontal hemodynamic response. in our cpc 
group, a marginal but nonsignificant decrease in the activa- 
tion of the bilateral PFC was noted. We may suggest that 
the training effect of the CPC group may not be as sufficient 
as the Vr group, and thus differences in pre- and posttrial 
hemodynamic response as well as global cognition were 
nonsignificant. In contrast, the VR group may benefit from 
the augmenting effect of our specific IADL-based training 
program in the VR context. Therefore, the improved neural 
efficiency of the bilateral PFC was noted after VR training. 

There are some limitations in the present study. First, with- 
out follow-up assessment, it remains unknown whether 
the available intervention effect has been sustained over 
long periods. Second, the hemodynamic response was as- 
sessed only in the prefrontal areas, and there may be some 
intervention-induced changes in other brain areas that we 
were unable to detect. Third, the drop-out rate (19%) in the 
present study was greater than that as recommended by the 
PEDro score (15%). Of the 8 drop-out subjects, 3 dropped 
out due to health problems unrelated to training (i.e., they 
needed to receive surgery or treatment in the hospital), and 
5 dropped out due to low motivation (one complained our 
program did not inspire their interests, and 4 told us they 
could not continue the exercises because they were busy 
and had other commitments scheduled). Some important 
variables, such as depression and comorbidities, which 
might contribute to the drop-out rate, should be measured 
when screening for eligibility. For example, the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS), a self-report assessment used to 
identify depression in the elderly, should be used to ex- 
clude depressive elderly, but we did not use this scale in 
the present study. Fourth, the Lawton IADL scale is a self- 
report measurement, though we checked with the caregiv- 
ers of most participants. More sensitive tools to assess 
IADL performances may be required in further studies. 
fifth, training intensity, such as the cognitive training pro- 
gram, is difficult to match. However, we monitored heart 
rate and perceived exertion and ensured that the session 
time of these two groups was equal. Finally, our VR pro- 
gram combined physical exercise and cognitive training 
sequentially, and the CPC program combined the physical 
exercise and cognitive training simultaneously. Although 
most articles have stated that simultaneous and sequential 
dual-task training programs were both effective in improv- 
ing cognition and led to similar effects,12, 48 the diverse 
treatment benefits could be attributed to different combi- 
nations of these methods and require further investigation. 

The present study showed that cognitive functions of older 
adults with MCI benefited from 12 weeks of the VR in- 
tervention. a decreased activation in the prefrontal areas, 
indicative of increased neural efficiency, was also found in 
the VR training subjects. Furthermore, VR-based physi- 
cal and cognitive training was superior in improving IADL 
compared to cpc training. the results support the use of 
Vr-based physical and cognitive training in older adults 
with MCI.
