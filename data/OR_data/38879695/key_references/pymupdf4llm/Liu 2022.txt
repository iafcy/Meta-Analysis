Background: Declined cognitive function interferes with dual-task walking ability and
may result in falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The mind-body
exercise, Tai Chi (TC), improves cognition and dual-task ability. Exergaming is low-cost,
safe, highly scalable, and feasible. Whether the effects of exergaming-based TC is
beneficial than traditional TC has not been investigated yet.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate effects of exergaming-based
TC on cognitive function and dual-task walking among older adults with MCI.

Methods: Fifty patients with MCI were randomly assigned to an exergaming-based
TC (EXER-TC) group, a traditional TC (TC) group, or a control group. The EXER-TC
and TC groups received 36 training sessions (three, 50-min sessions per week) during
a 12-week period. The control group received no intervention and were instructed to
maintain their usual daily physical activities. The outcome variables measured included
those related to cognitive function, dual-task cost (DTC), and gait performance.

Results: The EXER-TC and TC groups performed better than the control group on the
Chinese version of the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Trail Making Test Parts A and B,
the one-back test, gait speed, and DTC of gait speed in cognitive dual-task conditions
after training. However, there were no significant differences between the EXER-TC and
TC groups. Compared with the control group, only the EXER-TC group experienced
beneficial effects for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

Conclusion: EXER-TC was comparable to traditional TC for enhancement of dual-task
gait performance and executive function. These results suggested that the EXER-TC
approach has potential therapeutic use in older adults with MCI.

## INTRODUCTION

Gait control requires higher-level cognitive function, especially
executive function. Gait control shares common brain networks
with cognitive processes essential for planning and goal-directed
behaviors (Yogev-Seligmann et al., 2008). Dual-task walking
(i.e., walking while performing a cognitive task) can challenge
gait control, especially in with cognitive impairment. Slowing
dual-task gait velocities correlate with declines in executive
function, visual working memory, and processing speeds in
older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Doi et al.,
2014). Gait control declines in speed and variability are also
associated with greater injurious fall risk in older adults with
MCI (Pieruccini-Faria et al., 2020). This dual-task interference
or cost might represent a surrogate motor marker and be
associated with advancement toward dementia in older adults
with MCI (Sakurai et al., 2019). Reduced entorhinal cortex
volumes in older adults with MCI are linked to higher dualtask costs under subtracting serial sevens conditions (Sakurai
et al., 2019). Examination of dual-task gait performance can
provide evidence that gait control and cognitive performance are
linked (Hausdorff and Buchman, 2013). These gait parameters
may also be helpful for early diagnosis and intervention
in with MCI.
The mind-body exercise, Tai Chi (TC), has physical and
cognitive components. Used as an intervention, TC might
be an effective way to reduce rates of cognitive decline in
healthy and in cognitively impaired older adults. A systematic
review and meta-analyses found that TC has potential to
improve cognitive function in older adults, particularly in
executive function domain (Wayne et al., 2014). Evidence
for improvements in cognitive function after TC training
is supported by functional changes in cortical areas and in
physiological biomarkers such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) (Tao et al., 2016, 2017; Sungkarat et al., 2018).
TC is a multi-task with a high attention resource demand
(Li et al., 2014; Wayne et al., 2014). Practicing TC improves
dual-task gait variability in healthy older adults and patients
with Parkinson’s disease (Wayne et al., 2015; Vergara-Diaz
et al., 2018). However, evidence that TC improves dualtask walking ability in older adults with MCI has not been
investigated yet.
Exergaming is body movement-controlled computer gaming.
The exergaming device, Kinect, is low-cost, interactive, scalable,
and feasible for use in clinical populations (Barry et al., 2014).
Interactive exergaming effectively enhances cognitive function
in older adults in community settings, increases short-term
memory and executive function in healthy older adults, and
improves visuospatial perception in adults with neurological
disease (Monteiro-Junior et al., 2017; Mura et al., 2018; GallouGuyot et al., 2020). It remains unclear whether combining
interactive exergaming with TC benefits on cognitive function
and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI.
This study investigated effects of exergaming-based TC training
on cognitive function, dual-task cost, and gait performance,
compared with traditional TC and control groups in older
adults with MCI.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Participants
We recruited participants in communities of Taipei, Taiwan.
The inclusion criteria were: (1)≥65 years of age, (2) a diagnosis
of MCI based on Petersen’s criteria (Petersen, 2004), and (3)
physical ability sufficient to allow walking more than 10 m
independently. The exclusion criteria were: (1) a diagnosis of
dementia, (2) brain tumor, (3) any musculoskeletal problems
that would preclude exercise training, (4) diagnosis of hand
movement disorders, dysgraphia, or color vision deficiency,
and (5) education level < 6 years. Each participant provided
written informed consent before study enrollment. A power
of 80%, an effect size of 0.43, and an alpha level of 5%
were used for the sample size estimate of 45 participants (15
per group) for an ANCOVA model (Liao et al., 2019). We
recruited 54 participants (18 per group) to accommodate a
15% dropout rate.

## Study Design
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Human
Research Ethics Committee of Taipei City Hospital. This
single-blind (assessor), parallel, randomized controlled
[trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/ (TCTR](http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/)
TCTR20210530003). Each participant was randomly assigned
to the exergaming-based Tai Chi (EXER-TC), traditional Tai
Chi (TC), or control group via a sealed envelope. Another
blinded assessor performed the cognitive and gait assessments
(pre- and post-intervention) described in the Outcomes
Measures section.

## Intervention
Three, 50-min training sessions per week were performed by the
EXER-TC and TC group participants. An experienced certified
TC coach supervised all training in small group settings of
three to four participants. Participant in the EXER-TC and TC
groups wore smartwatch to observe heart rate during training.
The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were also set at 12-14
(somewhat hard) during training to ensure the training intensity
was consistant between these two groups.

## Tai Chi Group
Participants were taught Yang Style TC for 12 weeks. Simplified
24 form Yang Style TC was taught because it required less time
and consisted of fewer postures. This TC type is appropriate
for older adults with MCI because it is easier to learn and
remember. The “warm-up” was the first part of each threepart TC session. The warm-up consisted of simple motions
to help participants learn to relax muscles and joints. The
second part of the session consisted of “TC instruction.” The
entire set of unique Yang style simple form movements was
taught to each group. The coach taught the participants to
move in low-speed circular motions and to focus on breathing
and muscle coordination. Each session ended with a “cooldown,” which included activities that ended the TC and
rested the body.


-----

## Each Participant Was Randomly Assigned to the Exergaming-Based Tai Chi Group
EXER-TC group participants performed 50 min of TC training
during exergaming. The infrared light component of the Kinect
system (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States)
was used to capture and track changes in limb segment
motion. The system was then used to create a virtual fullbody 3D map. During the TC exergames (LongGood software,
Taiwan), participants imitated a virtually-presented TC coach
and responded to instant feedback by real-time adjustments in
movement. The EXER-TC program is also modified from Yang
Style TC which includes changing standing from wide to narrow
base, body mass weight shifting, squats, and slow symmetrical
to diagonal coordination arm-leg movements. Therefore, the
programs in TC and EXER-TC are similar. Movement accuracy
scores for each participant were presented simultaneously on the
monitor while TC was in progress. Each session consists of 10 min
warm-up, 35 min main exercise, and a 5 min cool-down.

## Control Group
Control group participants were instructed to maintain their
usual daily physical activities. No exercises or specific behavioral
management training were assigned to this group.

## Outcome Measures
Cognitive Function
**_Global Cognition_**
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an effective
cognitive impairment screening instrument for MCI subjects
(Nasreddine et al., 2005). A good reliability and validity
were proved between MoCA scores and Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) scores. A higher score in the 0 to 30
score range indicates better global cognitive function. The MoCA
Taiwanese version has a reliability of 0.88 and a validity of 0.86
(Tsai et al., 2012).

**_Executive Function_**
Executive function was represented using the Trail Making
Test (TMT). The TMTA consisted of 25 encircles randomly
distributed on a paper. Participants connect the 25 serial numbers
ascendingly and quickly. For the Chinese version of the TMTB,
participants draw a line continually connecting 12 encircled
numbers and Chinese animal zodiac in alternating order. The
score on each part is the time (seconds) required to complete the
task. Delta TMT (the difference between TMT B and TMT A) was
also recorded as our TMT outcome.

**_Verbal Memory_**
The Chinese version of California Verbal Learning Test (CCVLT)
was used to assess immediate recall and recall after a 10min delay. Participants are required to recall 9 two-character
nouns over 4 repeating assessment. The sensitivity of this
test is 0.852 (Chang et al., 2010).Verbal memory and delayed
recall were assessed by calculating the total number of nouns
accurately recalled.


**_Attention_**
Selective attention and inhibition were assessed using the
Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), Chinese version. In the
incongruous condition, the character of color was printed in a
different color. Participants were asked to indicate the color of
the ink rather than the word/character. The outcomes were the
number of correct answers given in 45 s (SCWT number) and
time taken to name 45 characters (SCWT seconds).

**_Working Memory_**
The spatial n-back task test was utilized to assess working
memory. This test is frequently used in neuroimaging and
neuropsychology research. Spatial n-back test position matching
consisted of one-back and two-back tasks. Test-retest reliability is
0.71 for the one-back test and 0.82 for the two-back test (Soveri
et al., 2018). A square was shown in nine possible locations
in a 3 × 3 grid randomly. Participants determine whether the
presented square appeared in the same location as the previous
square (the one-back task) and the square two positions ago
(the two-back task). Twenty-one trials were used for the oneback tests. Twenty-four trials were used for the two-back tests.
The total number of correctly answered trials was calculated for
each participant.

## Gait Performances and Dual-Task Costs
Gait performances were evaluated by the wearable GAIT Up
system (Gait Up, Lausanne, Switzerland). This inertial sensor
device has high agreement and consistency with the pressure
sensing system (Rudisch et al., 2021). During the experiment, we
fixed two wearable sensors on the dorsal side of the participant’s
left and right shoes. Each participant walked three trials under
the following condition: (1) a single task condition: walking at
their usual speed, (2) a cognitive dual-task condition: walking
while performing serial-3-subtractions task from a random
number between 90 and 100 (3) a motor dual-task condition:
walking while carrying a tray with glasses of water. The sensors
recorded gait speed (cm/s), stride length (cm), and cadence
(step/min) during single and dual task walking. The mean values
of three trials in each condition were used for the statistical
analysis. Dual-task interference was quantified using dual-task
cost (DTC), which was calculated as: DTC [%] = 100 x (single task
performance – dual task performance)/single-task performance
(Muir et al., 2012).

## Data Analysis
Sociodemographic, neuropsychological, and gait data analyses
were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
United States). Descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation
values or as numbers) were generated for all variables. Oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the
three groups with respect to continuous variables in baseline
demographic characteristics (e.g., age, weight, height, body
weight and MMSE). Chi-square test was used to compare the
categorical variables such as sex. In cognition and gait outcome
measures, the influence of pre-intervention values was adjusted
as the covariate, and the corrected post-intervention values


-----

were generated after analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Oneway ANCOVA was used to compare corrected post-intervention
values between the three groups at the end of the trial. Bonferroni
correction was used in post hoc comparisons among three groups,
and the adjusted significance level was set at p < 0.017. Etasquared (η2) was calculated to indicate the effect size.

## RESULTS

One-hundred individuals were screened, and 54 were enrolled
and randomly assigned to the EXER-TC, TC, or control group
in this study (Figure 1). Four participants did not complete
the study. One participant in the EXER-TC group, one in the
TC group, and one in the control group withdrew due to low
motivation. One participant in the EXER-TC group withdrew due
to scheduling conflicts. A total of 50 participants (n = 16 in the
EXER-TC group, n = 17 in the TC group, and n = 17 in the control
group) completed all interventions and assessments; these data
were used in the final statistical analysis. Adverse events were
not reported by any participants. The results for demographic
characteristics are presented in Table 1; there were no significant
between-group differences.

## Cognitive Performances
The results for cognitive performance, before and after
intervention, are presented in Table 2. The ANCOVA results
indicated significant group effects for the MoCA, TMTA, TMTB,
Delta TMT, SCWT number, SCWT seconds, and one-back test.
_Post hoc analysis found that both the EXER-TC and TC groups_


performed better than the control group for the TMTA, TMTB,
Delta TMT, SCWT seconds, and one-back test after training
(TMTA: EXER-TC vs. control, p < 0.001, TC vs. control,

control, p = 0.001, TC vs. control, p = 0.005). Post hoc analysis
also revealed that after training, only the EXER-TC group had a
significantly higher mean score for MoCA and SCWT number
compared with the control group (MoCA: EXER-TC vs. control,
_p = 0.008; SCWT number: EXER-TC vs. control, p = 0.001)._

## Gait Performances
The results for gait performance before and after intervention are
presented in Table 3. The ANCOVA results indicated significant
group effects for gait speed (p < 0.001) and cadence (p = 0.022),

during cognitive dual-task performance. The post hoc analysis
revealed that the EXER-TC and TC groups performed better
than the control group in gait speed and DTC of speed during
cognitive dual-tasks after training (gait speed: EXER-TC vs.
control, p < 0.001, TC vs. control, p = 0.001; DTC of speed:
EXER-TC vs. control, p = 0.002, TC vs. control, p = 0.017).

## DISCUSSION


We compared the effects of EXER-TC with those of TC and
control on cognitive function and dual-task gait performance.
First, both the EXER-TC and TC groups had better performance
than the control group in the executive function and attention
domains as measured by TMT, SCWT, and one-back test after
training, but only EXER-TC exerted a more beneficial effect
than the control for the global cognition (MOCA) and SCWT
number. Second, compared with the control group, both the
EXER-TC and TC groups experienced beneficial effects for gait
speed and DTC of speed during cognitive dual-task walking
after training. Finally, there were no significant between-group
differences for EXER-TC vs. TC for cognitive and dual-task gait
performance after training.
Both the TC and EXER-TC groups improved in cognitive
function in the executive function domain. The TMT, SCWT,
and one-back test are indicators of executive control abilities
associated with cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control and
working memory (Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). These results
were consistent with previous study, which found that TC
training improves TMT test scores (Sungkarat et al., 2017).
TMTA represents visuoperceptual ability, TMTB reflects working
memory and task-switching ability, and Delta TMT indicates
mental flexibility. Practicing TC requires use of a series
of cognitive activities, including movement recall, switching,
attention, inhibitory control and visuospatial orientation devoted
to multisegmental movement. Study results suggest that TC
practice may activate the prefrontal cortex and improve working
memory, attentional focus, and processing speed through
concurrent physical and mental activity (Wayne et al., 2014; Kim
et al., 2016; Tsang et al., 2019). Therefore, we suggest practicing
the TC program in a real or virtual scenario effectively facilitated
complex executive function as reflected in the TMT, SCWT, and
one-back test improvements.
The beneficial effect on the MoCA score implies that EXERTC may lead to a variety of cognitive improvements. The
possible explanation is the interactive advantage of exergaming.
Participants are required to be alert to contextual feedbacks,
recruit cognitive resources, and adjust body posture according to
the command of the virtual coach. In addition, the advantage of
enjoyment and attractiveness in the environment of exergaming
may further augment the training effect of TC and lead to
improvement in cognitive dual-task performance. Frontal and
subcortical-frontal cortex volumes are associated with single
and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI (Doi
et al., 2017; Allali et al., 2019; Beauchet et al., 2019). Previous
studies have shown evidence that VR and exergaming improve

brain activation (Liao et al., 2020, 2021). Although we did not
measure brain function, we suggest that EXER-TC improved
brain plasticity in older adults with MCI. Therefore, beneficial
transfer effects to global cognitive function and dual-task walking
ability may result from the consolidation of the neural circuit
provided by exergaming.
The advantage of TC on enhanced dual-task walking capacity
in older adults at high risk of falling has been reported (Li
et al., 2019). The benefit of exergaming on enhanced dual-task
walking performance in community-dwelling older adults has
also been stated (Wang et al., 2021). This study is the first to
investigate either with traditional or exergaming-based TC in
older adults with MCI. Executive function correlated highly with
gait speed and variability in dual-task walking (Hausdorff et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2021). Both TMT and Stroop performance are
tasks of executive function linked to cognitive flexibility, divided
attention, and inhibitory control in older adults (Hobert et al.,
2011; Ikeda et al., 2014; Wollesen et al., 2016). Dealing with
different stimuli simultaneously and reacting to surroundings
are essential parts of cognitive dual-task gait performance. We
suggest that the improvements in executive function (TMT and
Stroop test) contribute to gains of gait speed during cognitive
dual-task waking in both the TC and EXER-TC groups.
Older adults with MCI may be easily affected by dualtask interference due to lesser neural network available for
concurrent action on secondary tasks. The DTC presents the
interference in dual-task performance compared to the singletask performance. In this study, the DTC of speed during
cognitive dual-task performance reduced 17% after TC training
and 22% after EXER-TC training. Based on the bottleneck
and capacity-sharing theories (Tombu and Jolicoeur, 2003), we
suggest that both traditional and interactive exergaming TC
increases cognitive capacity, improves processing speed, and
reduces interference between cognitive dual-task walking tasks
(Redfern et al., 2002). A cognitive DTC ≥ 20% can destabilize
gait and increase fall risk (Hollman et al., 2007). Likewise, a
DTC > 20% is associated with progression to dementia in older
adults with MCI (Montero-Odasso et al., 2017). In this study,
the cognitive DTC of speed for the TC and EXER-TC groups
were > 20% before and after training. This result suggested
that the routine TC training programs were required for the
study participants, even though they had much improvement
after intervention.
Improvements in gait performance and DTC were only
apparent for the cognitive dual-task, not the motor dual-task.
One possible reason for this difference is that our motor task
is not as challenging as our cognitive task to cause dual-task
interference; therefore, the training improvements were not
significant. The previous finding supports this explanation that
older adults with MCI showed more apparent gait deviations
in walking while doing serial subtraction than walking while
carrying a glass of water on a tray (Hunter et al., 2018). Another
reason is that the task of TC resembled the cognitive dual-task
because performing TC requires concurrent physical and mental
activity. Therefore, the practicing effects of both TC and EXERTC were more easily transferred to cognitive dual-tasks rather
than motor dual-tasks.


As far as we know, this is the first study to validate
the influence of exergaming-based TC intervention on dualtask walking costs in older adults with MCI. Limitations
of this study include the long-term effects of EXER-TC on
cognitive and dual-task performance remain unknown due
to lack of follow-up assessment. Second, there is limited
physiological evidence to support the training-induced cognitive
improvements. Use of brain imaging and measurement of
physiological factors such as BDNF may be included in a
future study. Third, training intensities were difficult to match.
However, we monitored heart rates and perceived exertion, and
ensured that the session times of the two groups were equal.
Fourth, the learning effect may affect performance in the postintervention improvement for most tasks. However, we assume
that the learning effect was negligible because of the long preto-post assessment interval of 3 months. Fifth, the control
group had no intervention and probably less contact with the
study personally.

## CONCLUSION

This study found that the benefits of EXER-TC were equal
to traditional TC for the executive function domain, gait
speed, and DTC of speed during cognitive dual-task walking
in older adults with MCI. The benefit in global cognitive
function were found only after EXER-TC group. These results
support the hypothesis that exergaming facilitates positive
effects of TC and has potential therapeutic use in older
adults with MCI.
