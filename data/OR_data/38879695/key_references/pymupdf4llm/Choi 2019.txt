# The Effects of Virtual Kayak Paddling Exercise on Postural Balance, Muscle Performance, and Cognitive Function in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial

### Wonjae Choi and Seungwon Lee

Deterioration of physical and psychological health is an important issue in older adults aged 65 years or more. This study aimed to
determine whether a virtual kayak paddling (VKP) exercise could improve postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive
function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to the VKP (n = 30) or control
group (n = 30). Participants in the VKP group performed the paddling exercise in a virtual environment for 60 min twice a week
for 6 weeks, whereas those in the control group performed home exercises. Postural balance (p < .05), muscle performance
(p < .05), and cognitive function (p < .05) were significantly improved in the VKP group and were superior to those in the control
group (p < .05). Thus, the findings indicate that VKP exercise improves postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive
function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

Most older adults prefer participating in sedentary activities,
rather than physical activities to maintain health because of agerelated physiological changes and the external environment (Kim,
1999). Deceased activity levels and social participation accelerate
aging-related musculoskeletal, neurological, sensory, and cognitive system changes (Faulkner, Larkin, Claflin, & Brooks, 2007;
Zawadka-Kunikowska et al., 2014). In older adults, regular physical exercise training is important because exercise or leisure
activities are recommended to delay or reverse age-related changes
(Levin, Netz, & Ziv, 2017).
Kayaking has been recently introduced among older adults as a
leisure activity as it can be performed by anyone (Bjerkefors &
Thorstensson, 2006). This exercise has various physical health
advantages for older adults. Kayaking is an easily accessible sport
used to improve postural control because the postural sway induced
by the paddling movement must be compensated for, which
constantly challenges the ability of participants to maintain their
posture (Bjerkefors, Carpenter, & Thorstensson, 2007; Grigorenko
et al., 2004). Individuals who perform kayaking have better
mediolateral trunk stability in response to lateral translation
(Bjerkefors et al., 2007). Hurt and Grabiner (2015) reported that
age-related changes could hinder compensatory strategies that
ensure stability while performing a lateral stepping and forward
walking tasks in older adults. Therefore, kayak paddling movement
in the sagittal planes could be emphasized to improve postural
balance.
Another positive effect of kayaking is that it increases upper
extremity muscle strength and endurance at the same time without
any upper extremity problems or overload (Bjerkefors, Jansson, &
Thorstensson, 2006; Bjerkefors & Thorstensson, 2006). Handgrip
strength is necessary for performing object-manipulating action,
such as grasping, holding, and lifting. In addition, handgrip

[Therapy, Sahmyook University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Lee (swlee@syu.ac.kr)](mailto:swlee@syu.ac.kr)


strength reflects the overall muscle strength and functional conditions (Moy, Darus, & Hairi, 2015) and is widely used as a measure
of general health in older adults (Savino et al., 2013). The handgrip
strength test is an inexpensive and time-efficient measurement
procedure that can be easily performed. Sayer et al. (2006) found
that people with low handgrip strength have decreased healthrelated quality of life.
Handgrip strength is useful to monitor cognitive impairment
and a higher handgrip strength seems to protect against cognitive
decline (Fritz, McCarthy, & Adamo, 2017). Individuals with mild
cognitive impairment suffer from a reduced memory span, executive function impairments, and an inability to concentrate
(Salloway & Correia, 2009). Executive function-related activities,
such as multitasking and planning, have been linked to the ability
of performing a series of movements (Gothe, Kramer, & McAuley,
2014). Thus, executive dysfunction contributes to the restriction of
instrumental activities of daily living (Marshall et al., 2011).
Impairment of instrumental activities of daily living leads to early
loss of social engagement and independence. Thus, improvement
of muscle strength through the kayak paddling movement might
help maintain or improve cognitive function and quality of life.
Kayaking has the advantages of reducing age-related physical
and cognitive deterioration, but it has a safety issue considering that
it should be performed on water. Virtual reality is used to safely
simulate natural motion (Bohil, Alicea, & Biocca, 2011), ensure
consistent and planned application of standardized therapeutic
protocols, and increase patient independence using a close simulation of the real-world environment (Cho & Lee, 2014). Virtual
reality is a computer-simulated environment and interaction of
computer-generated experience used to enhance physical or psychological function in another place (Banos et al., 2000). The
limitation of kayaking may be overcome by performing the exercise in a virtual reality-aided environment. Virtual reality is often
employed in exercise programs for older adults because of its
unprecedented ability to stimulate visual and auditory sensations
(Cherniack, 2011). Virtual reality allows for real-time feedback and

Schoene, Pichierri, & Smith, 2010). The use of virtual reality has
reduced health costs and increased physical activities in a limited
environment in the form of exergames. Furthermore, virtual reality
has increased the motivation and participation rate of individuals
compared with conventional nonvirtual reality exercise (Bryanton
et al., 2006; de Bruin et al., 2010).
In our previous study, the effects of ground kayak paddling
exercise were demonstrated (Choi & Lee, 2018). Although the
previous kayak paddling exercise study provided positive clinical
evidence on the physical and cognitive function of older adults, it
could not provide motivation and a sense of immersion such as that
provided by kayaking. Recent virtual reality studies have presented
new applications, such as video recording, which enable the use of
different exercises in various environments. Therefore, the present
study aimed to investigate the effects of a virtual kayak paddling
(VKP) exercises using real-world video recording on postural
control, muscle performance, and cognitive function in older adults
with mild cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that participants
who performed the VKP exercise would have improved postural
control, muscle strength, and cognitive function.

## Methods


### Participants

This randomized controlled trial was registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (KCT0002453). Participants were recruited from a welfare center between January 10 and
20, 2015, and the study was conducted from March to May 2015.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: community-dwelling older
adults aged 65 years or older who scored <26 points on the
Montreal Cognitive Assessment, able to communicate, and commit
to 6 weeks of intervention in this study. The exclusion criteria were
as follows: individuals who had neurological, musculoskeletal, or
upper extremity impairment; severe cognitive disorders such as
dementia or depression; untreated medical conditions; visual deficits; or individuals who were unable to maintain a sitting posture
for at least 20 min. All participants were educated about the
experimental protocol and provided written informed consent
before enrollment. The study was approved by the Sahmyook
University Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2015-004).


### VKP Exercise

This exercise program was modified for kayaking and conducted as
a group exercise. Each session consisted of a 10-min warm-up,
40-min VKP exercise, and 10-min cooldown. The warm-up
included massage with a sensory ball, gentle whole body stretching, and deep breathing exercises with light music. The shoulders
and trunk were stretched to increase muscle flexibility and safety.
During the VKP exercise, participants were seated on a chair
while practicing the exercise, observing a video projected on a
screen. One instructor demonstrated the exercise, and two assistants corrected the postures and movements of the participants. The
exercise was introduced and practiced in the first session. The
participants were informed that the direction of the kayak boat
movement displayed on the screen was opposite to the rowing
direction. The recorded kayak boat movements included forward
and backward motion, right and left turns, and a stationary position.
An arrow was marked on the screen prior to the change of direction
of the boat, and the participants rowed toward the direction in
which the boat was moving. The weight of the paddle used in this
exercise was 1 kg, and the length was 180 cm. A soft balance foam
(TheraBand Exercise Station, Hadamar, Germany) was placed
under the chairs to simulate the feeling of floating in the water.
The video was filmed on a lake in South Korea, edited using a video
editing software (Vegas Pro version 13; Sony, Tokyo, Japan), and
projected onto a 100-in. screen (Model BX327; LG, Seoul, South
Korea). To maximize the effect of the exercise, the assistants asked
the participants to row with increased effort (Figure 2). In the
middle of this exercise program, a 3-min walking break was
included to prevent muscle fatigue.
The cooldown after the main exercise was performed in the
same manner as the warm-up to prevent muscle fatigue and sudden
hypoglycemia, facilitate muscle relaxation, and normalize the heart
and respiratory rates (Brouwer, Walker, Rydahl, & Culham, 2003).


### Experimental Procedure

A physical therapist of the welfare center promoted this study
within the facility both verbally and through an advertisement
posted on the bulletin board. Individuals who volunteered as
participants were screened for compliance with the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Selected subjects were randomly assigned
to the VKP (n = 30) or control (n = 30) group in a 1:1 ratio.
Randomization was conducted using Random Allocation Software
2.0 (Saghaei, 2004). The pretest evaluation of demographics,
postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function
was performed a week before study commencement. Participants
in the VKP group exercised for 6 weeks. Exercise sessions were
conducted by an instructor and assistants twice a week for 60 min.
The VKP exercise included warm-up, main exercise, and cooldown
periods and was implemented using a recorded video. Participants
assigned to the control group did not participate in the exercise
program; instead, they performed only home exercises. The posttest evaluation was conducted a week after the end of the exercise
program in the same manner as the pretest evaluation. The data


### Home Exercise Education

The physical therapist who had been working in the welfare center
instructed home exercise to the control group during the first, third,
and fifth week. The warm-up and cooldown exercises for the
control group were the same as those for the VKP group. The
home exercise program consisted of William flexion exercises,
curl-ups, sideways leg lifts, prone leg lifts, supine leg lifts, and
prone trunk hyperextensions (Lee, Kim, & Lim, 2006). The
participants were instructed to perform three sets of 10 repetitions
for each home exercise during the first week, adding 10 repetitions
per set every 2 weeks. In the final week, the participants performed
three sets of 30 repetitions for each exercise. The home exercises
were performed twice a week for 6 weeks, and the instructor
confirmed the performance of exercises weekly by phone.


### Outcome Measurements

Demographics, static and dynamic postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function were assessed by six blinded
examiners.

Primary outcome measure. Static postural balance was assessed
using the one-leg stance test (Jonsson, Seiger, & Hirschfeld, 2004)
and the Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd., JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland;
Choi, Lee, & Lee, 2015). The system consisted of a safety bar and
an equilateral triangular force platform. It was connected to a laptop

The static postural balance using the Good Balance System was
measured under two visual conditions, eyes open and eyes closed,
for 30 s each while participants were seated on a chair on the
platform. The participants were instructed to sit maintaining a
forward gaze, feet not touching the floor, and arms folded across
the chest. Static postural balance was assessed three times and
averaged for data analysis. The testâretest reliability was .46 and .53
with the eyes open and closed, respectively, in mean medialâlateral
postural sway, and .69 with the eyes open or closed in anteriorâ
posterior postural sway (Ceria-Ulep et al., 2010). Dynamic postural
balance was assessed using the timed up and go test (intraclass
correlation coefficient [ICC] = .97; Steffen, Hacker, & Mollinger,
2002); functional reach test (ICC = .92; Duncan, Weiner, Chandler,
& Studenski, 1990; Granacher, Lacroix, Muehlbauer, Roettger, &
Gollhofer, 2013); Berg Balance Scale (ICC = .98; Berg, WoodDauphinee, Williams, & Maki, 1992); and Four Square Step Test
(ICC = .98; Dite & Temple, 2002).

Secondary outcome measure. Arm curl test (Singh et al., 2014)
and handgrip strength (Abizanda et al., 2012) were used to assess
muscle performance. The arm curl test measured the maximum
number of biceps curl repetitions performed with a 2-kg or 3-kg


respectively. Participants sat upright maintaining the initial posture
without bending the trunk forward. This test has shown good testâ
retest reliability, and the ICC was .96 (Miotto, Chodzko-Zajko,
Reich, & Supleer, 1999). Handgrip strength was measured using a
hand-held dynamometer (Medical Handgrip Dynamometer model
DHS-88; DETECTO, Webb City, MO). While sitting, the participants were instructed to apply their maximum grip strength with
the elbow joint at 90Â° flexion. The peak value from three trials was
used for data analysis. The ICC was .97, indicating the high
accuracy of the measurement (Wang & Chen, 2010).
Cognitive function was assessed using Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (Freitas, Simoes, Alves, & Santana, 2013) and General
Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (Brodaty, Kemp, & Low,
2004). Montreal Cognitive Assessment assesses various cognitive
domains, such as attention and concentration, executive function,
memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking,
calculations, and orientation. The testâretest reliability for this
assessment was .75, and a good specificity of 84% and great
sensitivity of 89% was shown for screening mild cognitive
impairment (Lee et al., 2008). The General Practitioner Assessment
of Cognition is a reliable and efficient screening instrument for
detecting dementia and is useful in the primary care setting.

influenced by the linguistic and cultural background of a subject,
making it a useful screening tool in a multicultural patient setting.
The testâretest reliability for this test was .87, and sensitivity and
specificity were determined to be .85 and .86, respectively (Brodaty
et al., 2002).


### Statistical Analyses

SPSS statistical software (version 19.0; IBM, Chicago, IL) was
used to perform the statistical analyses. All data were analyzed
according to the intention-to-treat principle, and the results are
presented as mean Â± SD. Missing data were defined as missing
completely at random by missing data analysis and were substituted by multiple imputation methods. The missing data were
imputed by using Fully Conditional Specification algorithm which
is an iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Five imputed
datasets were generated and then pooled outcomes were used for
the intention-to-treat analysis. Prior to training, the normality of the
data was assessed using the ShapiroâWilk test. Chi-square analysis
and independent samples t test were used to evaluate intergroup
homogeneity. As all dependent variables were normally distributed, separate 2 (Group) Ã 2 (Time) repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess VKP exercise over
two-time points (pretest and 6 weeks posttest). The effect size
(partial eta squared) was calculated as the ratio of the betweengroup sum of squares to the sum of the between-groups sum of
squares and the error sum of squares. Eta squared of .02, .13, and


Pearson correlations analysis was used to examine the associations
between descriptive statistics.
The sample size was estimated using the G*power software
(version 3.1; HHU, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany) based on the results
of a previous study that reported a large effect size (.80; Karahan
et al., 2015). In clinical trials, 80% power is typically required. The
level of significance was set to .05 (two-tailed). The minimum
sample size was 26 individuals per group. Based on an anticipated
dropout rate of 10%, 30 individuals were assigned to each group.
The statistical significance was set to .05 for all tests.

## Results


### Sample Description

A total of 77 older adults (age range, 69â85 years) volunteered for
this study; 17 did not meet the inclusion criteria as they had cardiac
diseases (n = 2), severe cognitive disorder (n = 5), shoulder limited
range of motion (n = 8), or stroke (n = 2). Thus, 60 subjects were
randomly assigned to the VKP or control group. Three participants
dropped out: one from the VKP group underwent operation
because of an accident, and two from the control group did not
participate in the posttest evaluation because of moving to other
city. A total of 57 participants completed >80% of the exercises, but
60 subjects were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat
principle. There were no significant intergroup differences at
baseline for any parameter (p > .05) (Table 1). The attendance

### Changes in Static and Dynamic Postural Balance

Table 2 compares the pretest and posttest static and dynamic
postural balance in the two groups. Two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in medialâlateral postural
sway with eyes open, F(1, 58) = 11.346, p = .001, Î·[2] = .163; anteriorâposterior postural sway with eyes open, F(1, 58) = 8.635,
p = .005, Î·[2] = .129; velocity moment with eyes open, F(1, 58) =
4.155, p = .046, Î·[2] = .066; medialâlateral postural sway with eyes
closed, F(1, 58) = 7.683, p = .007, Î·[2] = .117; anteriorâposterior
postural sway with eyes closed, F(1, 58) = 7.659, p = .008, Î·[2] =
.116; and velocity moment with eyes closed, F(1, 58) = 9.903,
p = .003, Î·[2] = .145, in the VKP group compared with those in the
control group. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed that
the one-leg stance test results for the right, F(1, 58) = 9.099, p = .004,
Î·[2] = .135, and left one-leg stance, F(1, 58) = 4.432, p = .040,
Î·[2] = .071, were significantly higher in the VKP group.
In dynamic postural balance, two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA showed significantly faster timed up and go test,


F(1, 58) = 26.662, p < .001, Î·[2] = .314; greater functional reach test,
F(1, 58) = 9.344, p = .003, Î·[2] = .138; higher Berg Balance Scale,
F(1, 58) = 23.190, p < .001, Î·[2] = .285; and faster four square
step test, F(1, 58) = 16.187, p < .001, Î·[2] = .218, in the VKP group
than in the control group.

### Change in Muscle Performance


The effects of the VKP exercise on muscle performance are
presented in Table 3. The arm curl test, right handgrip strength,
and left handgrip strength scores in the VKP group were higher
by 29.70%, 14.69%, and 15.36%, respectively, than those in the
control group. Group-by-time interaction effect was significantly
different for arm curl test, F(1, 58) = 40.771, p < .001, Î·[2] = .412;
right handgrip strength, F(1, 58) = 14.439, p < .001, Î·[2] = .199; and
left handgrip strength scores, F(1, 58) = 4.016, p = .050, Î·[2] = .064,
between the two groups.

## Discussion


This study proved that a virtual reality-based kayak paddling
exercise effectively improves the physical and cognitive functions
of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive
impairment. The findings of the present study show that VKP


exercise induces significant increases in both postural control and
muscular strength and are consistent with previously published
results on kayak ergometer training (Bjerkefors et al., 2007;
Bjerkefors et al., 2006; Bjerkefors & Thorstensson, 2006). Previous studies used higher kayak ergometer training intensities
because participants were patients with spinal cord injury or elite
kayakers and it may be inappropriate for older adults (Bjerkefors
et al., 2007; Gomes et al., 2012). In addition, ergometer machines
are expensive and require individual monitoring during training
(Bjerkefors et al., 2007; Bjerkefors et al., 2006). On the contrary,
this study used a VKP exercise protocol suitable for older adults
and performed as a group exercise in a well-controlled virtual
reality environment. The advantage of a group exercise is that it can
be performed at a specific location and time in accordance with a
schedule set in advance (King, 1994). The group setting also affects
the compliance of subjects (Barnett, Smith, Lord, Williams, &
Baumand, 2003). For example, it is likely that competition among
the subjects could have contributed to the high participation rate
seen in the present study. The unique advantages of VKP exercise
are that it is a good balance exercise and makes participants think
about the paddling direction during exercise because paddling
direction is opposite to the kayak boat movement displayed to

the screen. This can stimulate more cognitive processing than
simple repetitive movements. Another advantage is that VKP
exercise has made it possible to make an outdoor activity like
kayaking be exercised indoors using real-world video recording.
VKP exercise significantly increased the dynamic and static
balance because it involved a consistent rotatory movement of the
trunk. The movements during kayak paddling are performed in
a diagonal direction, which stimulates the core muscles. From
a functional viewpoint, core muscles support the connections of
upper and lower limbs to the trunk through the pelvic and shoulder
girdle muscles. Moreover, these muscles function to transmit angular
momentum and torque while performing physical activities required
for sports, leisure, fitness, and daily life through kinetic chains
(Behm, Drinkwater, Willardson, & Cowley, 2010). Poor core
muscle recruitment makes it more difficult to perform daily activities
or movements (Ferreira et al., 2010). Hwang et al. (2008) reported
that older adults show a delay in the paraspinal reflex latencies
compared with younger adults and that the aging process is associated with decreased spinal motor control (Hwang, Lee, Park, &
Kwon, 2008). Older adults experience gradual muscle degeneration
and a decrease in recruitment speed. Trunk stability is closely related
to balance and co-activated prior to or upon the occurrence of
external forces by anticipatory postural adjustments. Such feedforward activation is based on experience, and trunk inactivity leads to
poor motor control and loss of postural balance (Frank & Patla,
2003). Suri et al. (2009) demonstrated the influence of the trunk
muscles in mobility-limited older adults on balance and mobility
performance. They reported that trunk endurance is related to Berg
Balance Scale score and that trunk muscle strength is associated with
the performance in the one-leg stance test (Suri, Kiely, Leveille,
Frontera, & Bean, 2009). In this study, Berg Balance Scale score and
one-leg stance time were significantly increased in the VKP group,
and this supports the fact that VKP exercise contributed to the
improvement of trunk muscle strength and endurance.
The VKP exercise was performed while sitting on a chair, which
decreased the risk of falling. The use of the soft balance foam gave
participants the feeling of actually being on the water and facilitated
the external sway, exposing the participants to constant instability
combined with the internal sway achieved by paddling (Srivastava,
Taly, Gupta, Kumar, & Murali, 2009). This exercise was a modified
form of kayaking, and the participants benefitted from its significant
effect on postural balance and from the safety solution provided
by the modification for the problems associated with kayaking.
Reduced proprioception is one of the causes of poor postural balance
in older adults (Borel & Alescio-Lautier, 2014). Proprioception may
have been stimulated in the participants because of the various trunk
muscle length changes occurring owing to the postural sway experienced during paddling movements.
The VKP exercise is considered a resistance exercise as the
combined effect of air and paddle weight provides resistance. Low
resistance and a number of repetitive paddling motions may have
contributed to the increase in muscle strength, as shown in the
results of the present study. Moreover, kayak paddling requires fast
and intensive movements of the upper limbs, which may have
accelerated the improvement of upper limb strength. Van Roie,
Delecluse, Coudyzer, Boonen, and Bautmans (2013) reported that
low resistance training, such as 80 to 100 repetitions at 20% of one
repetition maximum for a total of 36 sessions, resulted in muscle
hypertrophy (Van Roie et al., 2013). Watanabe, Madarame, Ogasawara, Nakazato, and Ishii (2014) reported that low-intensity
exercise (30% of one repetition maximum) increased the muscle


2014). The exercise protocol comprised three sets of eight repetitions of an eccentric contraction for 3 s, a concentric contraction
for 3 s, and an isometric contraction for 1 s, performed twice a week
for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, cross-sectional magnetic resonance
imaging revealed an increase in muscle size (p < .01) and strength
(p < .05). This demonstrates that the total muscle contraction
time and number of repetitions are related to muscle size and
strength gain.
In the present study, handgrip strength was significantly
increased after VKP exercise, and improvements in handgrip
strength might contribute to improvements in functions such as
postural balance and cognition. Handgrip strength represents the
overall physical condition, and an increase in handgrip strength
could be interpreted as a protective factor against multimorbidity of
chronic diseases (Chen et al., 2012; Cheung, Nguyen, Au, Tan, &
Kung, 2012). Garcia-Pena et al. (2013) reported that a 1 kg
decrease in handgrip strength of 20.65 kg in a male corresponds
to a functional decline by 14.9% (Garcia-Pena et al., 2013). AlfaroAcha et al. (2006) observed that people with low handgrip strength
displayed lower mini-mental state examination scores after 7 years
of follow-up and that a low handgrip strength was significantly
related to decreased cognition (Alfaro-Acha et al., 2006). Based on
the findings of previous studies, it is reasonable to assume that an
increase in handgrip strength is involved in cognitive improvement. Furthermore, the fact that the participants were required to
constantly coordinate paddling direction with the direction of the
kayak boat could facilitate cognitive improvement. The correlation
between physical and cognitive functions is noteworthy. The
human frontal lobe gives commands for movement control, and
the prefrontal areas perform executive function and mental processing, which are deteriorated by aging (Berchicci, Lucci, & Di
Russo, 2013). Fast and efficient information processing increases
cognitive function, which is affected by the integrity of the white
brain matter (Penke et al., 2010). The VKP exercise required quick
movement decisions such as changes in paddling direction and
bimanual coordinated movement based on the situation. Neural
processing through the cerebellum and basal ganglia is required to
coordinate and perform the desired movements, and integration in
the association area of the brain is required for changing the
direction of rowing based on the arrows on the screen (Kandel
et al., 2013). Bimanual coordinated movement generates stronger
brain activation than unimanual movement (Swinnen, 2002).
Cognitive decline is linked with cerebral blood flow in older adults
(Stoquart-ElSankari et al., 2007). Regular exercise can improve
age-related cerebral perfusion by microvascular changes, resulting
in an increase in cerebral blood oxygenation and brain activity
(Villringer & Dirnagl, 1995). Therefore, VKP exercise might
influence the integration of white brain matter and contribute to
cognitive improvement by maintaining or increasing the brain
volume of the participants. In older adults with mild cognitive
impairment, improved executive function might be useful for
performing high-level functional tasks of daily living.
This study has some limitations. It is difficult to generalize the
effects of VKP exercise because this exercise was implemented for a
short term in mostly older women with mild cognitive impairment.
The supervision provided during the VKP exercise might have
allowed the VKP group to focus more on intervention than the
control group because the instructor may contribute to participantâs
exercise enjoyment and the development of self-efficacy during
supervised exercise (Carrasco, Martinez-Rodriguez, Ortiz, &
Fernandez-De-Larrinoa, 2012). The supervised exercise provides

constructs (e.g., static balance eyes open, eyes closed) were applied.
This increases the alpha-error probability and consequently the risk
for Type I errors. Another limitation is the lack of brain activity
scans. Thus, it is difficult to directly determine how brain activity in
older adults with mild cognitive impairment was facilitated. This
study was implemented in a virtual environment to increase the sense
of immersion of the participants, but it was not perfect because of the
absence of screen movement and the fact that it was performed on a
chair, which cannot completely mimic the actual kayak paddling
posture. Finally, we did not assess exercise satisfaction in our
participants. However, the participants showed interest in the exercise and maintained a high participation rate.

## Conclusion


This study investigated the effects of VKP exercise on postural
balance, handgrip strength, and cognitive function in older adults
with mild cognitive impairment. We found that VKP exercise was
well designed to improve the physical and cognitive health of older
adults with mild cognitive impairment. The virtual environment
allowed the subjects to focus better on the exercise, which could
be performed easily at home. Future research should employ
immersive virtual reality that provides auditory cues according
to the direction in which the kayak boat is moving and allows the
subject to maintain a similar posture to that during actual kayak
paddling.
