BACKGROUND: A combination of physical and cognitive training appears to be the effective intervention to improve cognitive function
in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computing technology such as virtual reality (VR) may have the potential to assist
rehabilitation in shaping brain health. However, little is known about the potential of VR-based physical and cognitive training designed as an
intervention for cognition and brain activation in elderly patients with MCI. Moreover, whether a VR program designed around functional tasks
can improve their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) requires further investigation.
AIM: This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive function, brain activation and
IADL and compared the VR intervention with combined physical and cognitive training.
DESIGN: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Communities and day care centers in Taipei, Taiwan.
POPULATION: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomized into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training
(VR) group or a combined physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assessed for their cog­
nitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex
activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating
pathway of the intervention.
RESULTS: Both groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed
significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention.
The group × time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training
(P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural
efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: VR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: VR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.

experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI),[1], which rep­
resents a transient state of cognitive decline seen in nor­
mal aging and in those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dis­


ease (AD).[2] Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)
include activities of complex and intentional cognitive
processes, such as shopping and managing money, and
are critical for one to live independently in a community.[3]
Researchers have found that older adults with MCI had

lower IADL scores than their healthy counterparts.[4] In ad­
dition, compared to older adults with normal IADL, older
adults with both MCI and IADL deficits are more likely to
develop dementia[5]. Given the subsequent risk of MCI for
developing dementia, interventions targeting MCI have
great potential to preserve cognitive function as well as to
maintain intact IADL.

In a previous review study, cognitive training led to sig­
nificant improvements in memory, executive function, pro­
cessing speed, attention, fluid intelligence, and subjective
evaluation of cognitive functioning among older adults
with MCI.[6] Cognitive training not only improved cogni­
tive functioning but also benefited functional performance
that is fundamental to performing IADL.[7, 8] Similar to cog­
nitive training, physical exercise has also been one of the
interventions. Öhman _et al. found that aerobic exercise,_
weight training, balance training, and tai chi were among
the typical components of physical training programs for
enhancing cognitive function in older adults with MCI,
especially in the domains of executive functioning, atten­
tion and delayed recall.[9] Recently, mounting evidence also
pointed out that combining physical and cognitive training
may strengthen the intervention effects on cognitive func­
tion in older adults with MCI.[10-13] For example, Barnes et
_al. stated that older adults with MCI who received both_
aerobic exercise and mental activity training showed im­
provements in global cognitive function.[14] Whereas the
positive effects of combined physical and cognitive train­
ing on cognitive functions have been robust in the litera­
ture, most studies did not find that these training effects
successfully transferred to IADL improvement.[12]

Information and computer technology (ICT) has be­
come a popular approach in assessing cognitive function­
ing because it provides an ecologically valid treatment.
A systematic review of ICT-based cognitive or physical
training has shown the positive effects of these technol­
ogy applications on attention, visual memory and verbal
memory, as well as executive function of older adults with
MCI.[15] Virtual reality (VR), one of the most advanced
ICT technologies, provides an immersive, intuitive, mo­
tivating, interactive and multisensory feedback context in
which participants can practice customized activities of
daily living in the virtual environment that conventional
rehabilitative interventions could not offer.[16, 17] However,
most articles about VR training are either physical or cog­
nitive training.[16] Studies on the effects of combining both
physical and cognitive training in the VR context are lack­
ing. Moreover, these studies have not been intended for
improving IADL. Given the fact that IADL require high


demands in physical activity and cognitive resources, par­
ticularly executive functioning and memory, the IADLbased cognitive and physical training programs in the VR
context may more likely transfer from the intervention ef­
fect to their actual IADL. However, evidence for these in­
novative interventions requires further investigation.

Brain imaging techniques provide a more in-depth
understanding of cognitive aging and the physiological
mechanisms responsible for intervention efficacy. Near-in­
frared spectroscopy (NIRS), an innovative neuroimaging
technique, measures hemodynamic changes during brain
activation. In comparison with fMRI, the advantages of
NIRS include lower costs, portability, lower susceptibility
to movement artifacts, and a high temporal sampling rate.
Compared to cognitively preserved counterparts, those
with MCI showed higher activation in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex during a memory task. This increased
activity may reflect a compensatory mechanism enabling
them to perform normally due to malfunctioning memory
networks in subjects with MCI.[18] However, previous find­
ings have shown mixed patterns of post-training brain ac­
tivation in subjects with MCI. Using fMRI, Belleville et
_al. found increased activation after memory training in the_
frontal, temporal and parietal areas in subjects with MCI.[19]
However, Vermeij et al. did not find any working memory
training-related changes in prefrontal activation.[20] In ad­
dition, studies applying VR as an intervention strategy for
brain activation in older adults with MCI are still lacking.

Thus, the present study aimed at exploring the effects
of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive
functions, brain activation, and IADL, as well as compar­
ing the VR intervention to a traditional combined physical
and cognitive training program.

#### Materials and methods


**Participants**

Participants were recruited from communities and day care
centers in Taipei, Taiwan. All participants met the follow­
ing inclusion criteria: 1) aged 65 years old and above; 2)
able to walk more than 10 meters without walking aids;
3) had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score
greater than or equal to 24 and a Montreal Cognitive As­
sessment (MoCA) score lower than 26;[21] 4) had self-report­
ed memory complaints; 5) had the ability to perform ADLs.
The exclusion criteria were: 1) a diagnosis of dementia; 2)
a history of malignant tumors; 3) the presence of unstable
neurological or orthopedic disease that would have inter­

fered with participation in the study; 4) an education level
less than six years (elementary school). The study protocol
was approved by the Institutional Human Research Ethics
Committee of National Yang-Ming University and has been
registered at www.clinicaltrials.in.th (TCTR20181001001
on October 1[st], 2018). All participants provided signed
informed consent before participation. G*power 3.0 was
used to determine the sample size needed for the present
study. Before starting the study, we could not find any ar­
ticles using the same intervention (virtual reality) and the
same primary outcome (MOCA). Therefore, our sample
size calculation was conducted by Hwang _et al.,[22] which_
showed that the virtual reality training group had a greater
improvement in the Visual Span Test after intervention.
Based on the calculated effect size for the Visual Span Test
(Cohen’s d=0.357), we estimated the sample size for the
current study to be 17 participants in each group.

**Study design**


This study was a single-blinded (assessor) randomized
controlled trial. Recruitment and screening were per­
formed between October 2018 and January 2019. Re­
cruitments were conducted in communities and day care
centers in Taipei city by three assessors (physiothera­
pists). Screening evaluations were performed during the
same periods by the same assessors to confirm the MCI
patients. Randomization was performed after eligible sub­
jects signed the informed consent. Participants meeting the
criteria were randomly assigned to either the VR group or
the CPC group via a sealed envelope. Participants in the
VR group participated in a 60-minute, VR-based physi­
cal and cognitive training session each visit, three times a
week for 12 weeks. Those in the CPC group participated in
combined physical and cognitive training program for 60
minutes each visit, three times a week for 12 weeks. Ex­
ercise training was conducted by an experienced physical
therapist for both the VR and CPC groups. In each com­
munity, small group training (3-4 people in a group) was
conducted instead of large group training (more than 10
people in a group) because we wanted to control the qual­
ity of intervention. The outcomes were measured at base­
line and after completing 36 sessions by the same assessor
who was always blinded to the group assignments.

**Intervention**


College of Sports Medicine[23] and consisted of resistance
exercises, aerobic exercise, and balance exercises. During
resistance exercise, Therabands were used on both upper
and lower extremities. During aerobic exercise, a sequence
of whole-body activities was performed, including step­
ping exercises in seated and standing positions, stepping
on and off of a stool, and standing up from and sitting in a
chair, to allow participants to achieve 50-75% of the maxi­
mal heart rate (HRmax = 220 − age). Perceived exertion was
obtained using Borg’s scale (scores ranging from 6 to 20,
where 6 means “no exertion at all” and 20 means “maximal
exertion”), and the ideal observed effort was a score of 13
to 14 (“somewhat hard”). Balance exercises included static
and dynamic balance training. Functional tasks that can en­
hance motor performance and simulate tasks of activity of
daily living were also integrated into our physical training
programs, for example, stair climbing, obstacle crossing,
walking forward, backward and sideways, turning, ris­
ing from a chair, and squatting when reaching for objects.
The exercise progressions included adding more weights
and increasing the number of repetitions during resistance
exercise, increasing the difficulty of exercise, such as in­
creasing the height of the stool during aerobic exercise, in­
creasing the forward/sideward reaching distance during the
balance exercise, and holding the squatting position for a
longer duration during the squatting exercise.

Cognitive training was simultaneously introduced dur­
ing the exercise. A sample combined physical and cogni­
tive exercise could include the following: walking and
turning around while reciting poems, crossing obstacles
of various heights while enumerating animals or flow­
ers, strengthening lower extremity muscles while practic­
ing math calculations, stepping in place with one or both
hands drawing circles in the air in a clockwise or coun­
terclockwise manner, drawing a clock with one hand in
the air while practicing weight shifting, and looking for
prefix/roots of a Chinese character while performing the
sit-to-stand task.

limb segment motions with infrared light. This system also
created a full-body 3D virtual map. Our VR-based physi­
cal training programs were developed by Tano and Long­
Good. Participants imitated the virtual characters and ad­
justed their movements in real time according to the instan­
taneous visual and auditory feedback. Exercises included
simplified 24-form Yang-style tai chi, resistance exercises, A B C
aerobic exercises and functionally oriented tasks such as
window cleaning, goldfish scooping, obstacle crossing,
stair climbing and walking designed to improve upper and
lower extremities, balance, stability, muscle strength, and
endurance.


VR-based cognitive training program

The VIVE system developed by the HTC company was
used for the present study. The station was placed on the
diagonal of the activity space with a maximum sensing
space of 4×3 meters. The participants wore VR glasses
on their heads and had motor controllers in both hands
during the training. Some VR games were invented by
our laboratory, while others were derived from the com­
mercially available software “Job Simulator” developed
by Owlchemy Labs. The design concept of the VR games
was based on actual IADL, such as shopping, food prepa­
ration, handling finances, and transportation. The par­
ticipants were guided by verbal instructions and asked to
memorize the instructions and certain spatial characteris­
tics. Four games used in the current study are described as
follows (Figure 1):

 - take mass rapid transit (MRT): the game was de­
signed to mimic the environment of a MRT station. Every
MRT station was equipped with gates, ticket vending ma­
chines, and ATMs. Participants were asked to follow the
standard procedure of metro transit (e.g., find the designed
station, gather an accurate amount of money based on the
fare chart and obtain a ticket from a vending machine). A
large red cross would show up as a notification if things
were going wrong;

  - looking for a store: in this game, participants were
asked to find stores marked on a map. The search should
be completed in three minutes. If the participants had not
found the store in the first two minutes, there would be
direction marks in red to guide the way for the partici­
pants;

 - kitchen chef: the kitchen was equipped with kitchen
appliances such as a flow table, gas stove, refrigerator,
etc., and there were some cooking tools in the closet. The
game began with an order of a particular dish. Step-bystep instructions were available to complete the meal.

Participants were required to memorize the recipe and
preparation steps. Simple dishes were introduced first, and
if successfully completed, orders of more complex dishes,
which took more ingredients and cooking utensils, would
follow;

  - convenience store clerk: the scene was a convenience
store, including typical decorations (e.g., checkout coun­
ters, cash registers, hot dog machines). The game began
with a list of checkout items. Step-by-step instructions
were also available for the participants to find these items,
add to the shopping basket and complete the checkout.
Similar to the kitchen chef game, not all the required tools
were easily accessible.


**Outcome measures**

Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures (neuropsy­
chological tasks, functional status and brain activation)
were measured by the same assessor (a physiotherapist
with 6 years of experience), who was blinded to the group
assignments.

VR TRAINING FOR COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN ELDERLY LIAO


_Neuropsychological tasks_

Global cognition


The MoCA was used to assess global cognition. The
MoCA was divided into seven subcategories: visuospatial/
executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstrac­
tion, and orientation. The score ranged from 0 to 30, and
a higher score indicated better global cognitive function.
The MoCA has been used as an effective screening and
evaluation instrument for cognitive impairments, includ­
ing MCI and Alzheimer’s disease.[24]

Executive function


ing food. Responses to each of the eight items in the scale
were coded as 0 (unable or partially able) or 1 (able). The
summary score could range from 0 to 8, with higher scores
indicating higher functional status and independence. The
IADL scale can be used to differentially diagnose cog­
nitively healthy aging and cognitive disorders in older
adults. The reliability and validity have been established
in Taiwan.[29]

_Brain activation_


The Executive Interview 25 (EXIT-25) was developed by
Royall et al.[25] The EXIT-25 consisted of 25 items assess­
ing a broad array of executive functions, including num­
ber/letter sequencing; word and design fluency; sentence
repetition; thematic perception; memory with distraction;
interference inhibition; grasp and snout reflexes; social
habits; motor perseveration; finger-nose repetition; echo­
praxia; complex hand sequences; complex commands;
counting and serial order reversal; and automatic, utili­
zation, and imitation behaviors. The total score ranged
from 0 to 50, with a possible score on each item of 0 to 2.
A higher score indicated poorer executive function. The
EXIT-25 has demonstrated a moderate internal consisten­
cy (α=0.66).[26]

Verbal memory


The Chinese version of the Verbal Learning Test (CVVLT)
consisted of nine two-character nouns presented over four
learning trials, with recall assessed immediately and after
10-minute delays. The examiner read the 9 words on the
list aloud at one-second intervals in a fixed order over four
learning trials. After each trial, the participant was asked
to recall as many words as he/she could, in any order. Af­
ter 10 minutes, the participant was again asked to recall
the list. We calculated the total number of nouns correctly
remembered to assess immediate recall and delayed recall.
The CVVLT was translated from the original English ver­
sion and has demonstrated sound psychometric proper­
ties.[27]

Functional status


Functional status was measured by the Lawton Instrumen­
tal Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL).[28] The IADL
scale was composed of eight items to evaluate one’s abil­
ity to perform tasks such as handling finances and prepar­


A 16-channel NIRS device (OEG-16, Spectratech Inc.,
Yokohama, Japan) containing two types of infrared light
(770 nm and 840 nm) was used to measure brain activation
simultaneously with the assessment of the MoCA during
the pre- and postintervention periods. A head module con­
sisted of two rows of photodiodes with three sources and
three detectors in each row and was attached to each par­
ticipant’s forehead using a headband to monitor the hemo­
dynamics of the left, right and bilateral prefrontal cortex
(PFC). The distance between the source and detector was
3 cm, which enabled hemodynamic measurements 2-3 cm
beneath the skin. The detection optodes were placed 25-30
mm above the midpoint of the eyebrow at approximately
FP1, and FP2 in the international 10/20 system standard
for electroencephalography (Figure 2). Therefore, we de­
fined CH4 and CH7 to represent the right PFC (EEG elec­
trode site FP2) and CH10 and CH13 to represent the left

Figure 2.—Diagram of the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)

cortex.

PFC (EEG electrode site FP1). The principle of NIRS is
that near-infrared light penetrates the skull and is absorbed
by the chromophores with different absorption spectra.
The preprocessed signals were converted to concentration
changes as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO), deoxygenated
hemoglobin (HbD), and total hemoglobin (HbT).[30, 31] The
modified Beer-Lambert law was used for each source-de­
tector channel.[32] HbO has been considered to be a robust
and reproducible change in regional cerebral blood flow.
Studies have shown that the fMRI BOLD response is more
strongly correlated with HbO than with HbD, which may
be due to the higher signal-to-noise ratio in HbO.[33] There­
fore, only HbO-derived concentration changes (mM×mm)
were used in the statistical analyses to evaluate brain ac­
tivation.

Post-training assessment (N.=18) Post-training assessment (N.=16)


We performed per-protocol analysis in this study. All statis­
tical analyses were performed using SPSS v. 20.0 software
(SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were
used to present the distribution of the variables as the mean
and standard deviation or the number and proportion. In­
dependent _t-tests or Chi-square tests were used to detect_
the intergroup differences in baseline characteristics of the
two groups. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
repeated measures was used to determine the effects of
the VR and CPC interventions on cognitive function and
gait performance. The model effects included groups (VR,
CPC), time (pre, post), and their interaction. We compared
differences between groups as well as the changes with­
in a group from the pre- to postintervention assessments.
Tukey’s post-hoc tests were used for variables with group
× time interaction effects. MATLAB software was used to
analyze the NIRS data. The NIRS signals were bandpass
filtered (a low-pass frequency of 0.01 Hz and a high-pass
frequency of 0.1 Hz) to eliminate the effects of physiologi­
cal spontaneous brain oscillations and to correct drift arti­
facts over the whole experimental session. We defined the
baseline period as the 20 seconds prior to the onset of the
task and the activation period as the 10 seconds before and
10 seconds after the peak HbO value during the MoCA task.
Because our primary interest was to examine task-related
changes in HbO, we defined the delta as the difference be­
tween the average HbO value of the activation period and
the baseline period. The averages of the delta of CH4 and
CH7 (right PFC), of CH10 and CH13 (left PFC), and of
CH4, CH7, CH10, and CH13 (bilateral PFC) were used for
statistical analyses of the within- and between-group com­
parisons. Statistical significance was set at P less than 0.05.


Figure 3.—Flow chart of this study.

#### Results


As shown in the flow chart in Figure 3, we screened 110
elderly individuals with the potential for mild cognitive
impairment. A total of 68 elderly were excluded due to not
meeting the inclusion criteria or declining to participate.
We only retained the demographic data for the 42 eligible
elderly individuals who signed the informed consent and
were randomized. Of the enrolled individuals, 21 were
randomly assigned to the VR group, and 21 were ran­
domly assigned to the CPC group. In these 42 participants,
three (one in the VR group and two in the CPC group) did
not complete the study due to health problems unrelated
to training and five (two in VR group and three in CPC
group) dropped out due to low motivation. Therefore, a
total of 34 participants (18 in the VR group and 16 in the
CPC group) completed all the assessments, and their data
were used in the final statistical analyses. None of the par­
ticipants reported any adverse events.

The demographic characteristics of the participants are
shown in Table I. There were no significant differences in
the demographic parameters of the two groups. Further­
more, the differences between the two groups in all out­
come measures at the preintervention assessment were not
significant.

The results for the primary outcome measures are
shown in Table II. In the VR group, significant withingroup effects were noted for the MoCA (P<0.001, ef­
fect size=1.03), EXIT-25 (P=0.01, effect size=0.65),
CVVLT immediate and delayed recall (P<0.001, effect
size=0.64 and P=0.002, effect size=0.89 respectively), and

training program. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first training program using IADL-based VR as a means
of intervention for MCI. First, we found that both groups
improved their executive function and verbal memory
(immediate recall). Second, significant improvements in
MOCA and IADL were observed only after VR-based
cognitive and physical training, while the dual physical
and cognitive training group showed non-significant im­
provements in MOCA and IADL. Finally, the improved
global cognitive function in the VR group was coupled
with simultaneous decreases in the brain activation of the
prefrontal areas.

The physiological effects of physical exercise on brain
functioning include the release of the neurotrophic factor
BDNF, increased blood flow, and beneficial metabolic ef­
fects. These outcomes might facilitate neuroplastic poten­
tials and enhance learning during cognitive training.[34] Our
results of CPC training were somewhat consistent with the
literature,[11, 35] especially in terms of its positive effects on
executive functions and memory. Executive functions re­
fer to the higher-order cognitive abilities involved in plan­
ning, initiating, monitoring, and inhibiting goal-oriented
behaviors[36] and are particularly critical to successfully
executing IADL.[37] Memory (immediate, short and long
delay memory) deficits often lead to difficulty complet­
ing IADL and accounted for much of the variance in func­
tional impairment.[38] However, as suggested by the recent
literature,[12] the significant improvement in executive func­
tions and immediate memory after CPC training did not
transfer to IADL. In fact, IADL require complex cognitive
processing other than executive functions and immediate
memory. Cognitive domains (such as visuospatial orienta­
tion and attention), physical capacity (such as visual acu­
ity) and neuropsychiatric factors (such as depression or
apathy) are also critical to IADL.[38, 39] It is also possible
that the three-month CPC programs may be too short in
duration to observe significant improvements in other cog­
nitive functions and, thus, improvements in IADL.

A previous study revealed that functional task training
could improve cognitive functions in older adults with
MCI.[40] The advantage of the VR intervention might be
that our IADL-based functional tasks effectively facili­
tated complex cognitive processing as participants repeti­
tively practiced these functional tasks during the 12-week
intervention. For example, “kitchen chef” was specifically
designed to train for memory, visuospatial orientation and
executive functioning, while participants prepared food as
ordered with available kitchenware and ingredients. “Con­
venience store clerk” trained for memory, orientation and


executive function as the participants retrieved and calcu­
lated the prices of the checkout items. Our program in­
volved changes in cognitive load in the form of dual-task
stimulation. Participants received immediate feedback and
optimized their dual-task performances. We believe that
dual-task stimulation with internalized feedback by VR
may have effects on various cognitive functions. The other
explanations are that VR provides a real-life scenario and
coaching interactions tailored to individual performances.
Therefore, the enjoyment and attractiveness of VR charac­
teristics may increase their motivation and lead to exten­
sive training effects resulting in cognitive improvement.
Overall, these were the critical features that the combined
physical and cognitive training program could not offer.

A prior systematic review found that only two out of
nine ICT training studies reported improvements in IADL,
and the effect size was relatively small for individu­
als with MCI.[41] However, our results showed significant
within- and between-group differences in IADL after VR
training. Compared to other ICT studies, our VR equip­
ment provided the most immersive experience. In addi­
tion, our VR program followed the principle of Robert et
_al.’s recommendations[42] to emulate the activities of daily_
living. It is possible that the immersive experience in the
IADL of our program facilitated the transfer of acquired
functional capabilities into real-life IADL. As mentioned
earlier, IADL required both cognitive and physical capac­
ity. Apart from the IADL-based cognitive program we ad­
opted, our physical training programs also contained many
functional activities, such as stepping over obstacles, win­
dow cleaning, lighting fireworks, and goldfish grasping.
Participants are required to be attentive to verbal instruc­
tions, and meanwhile, shift their weight, squat constantly,
and reach toward a target at a given location as accurately
and quickly as possible. These goal-directed actions not
only improve physical capacities (e.g., muscle strength,
balance and endurance) but also facilitate higher-ordered
cognitive functions such as attention, visuospatial orienta­
tion and executive function to integrate information. Our
improved cognitive functions in the VR group can illus­
trate the generalized training effect to IADL. Although the
present VR program did not exactly mirror all the daily
functional activities, the generalized effects on everyday
problem-solving abilities found in the present study still
support the idea that training effects can be transferred to
untrained daily living activities.

Age-related neural declines may lead to a reduced qual­
ity of neural processing.[43] Different models have been pro­
posed to explain the brain plasticity of the aging brain. The

compensatory model suggests that the aging brain maintains
optimal cognitive functions by relying on both increased
activation of specialized areas and recruitment of addition­
al brain networks.[44] Similar effects could be observed in el­
derly people with MCI. For example, Belleville et al. found
that MCI increased activations in a large network (frontal,
temporal and parietal areas), including areas activated prior
to training and new alternative areas activated following
training, while healthy controls showed mostly decreased
activation as the consequence of training.[19] Thus, broader
activation has been suggested as a compensatory strategy
for a demented brain to maintain intact cognitive func­
tions measured by behavioral data. The present study only
measured the frontal areas of the brain, and thus we could
not determine if there was any compensatory activation in
other undetected areas. However, decreased activation in
the brain after training could be seen as training-induced
increase in neural efficiency, as a lower amount of energy
or fewer brain networks were needed to achieve similar
levels of cognitive performance due to the intervention.
The concept of neural efficiency has been used in previous
studies, revealing decreased activation of frontal-parietal
areas and increased cognitive performance in older adults
after training.[20, 45, 46] The present study extended the prior
literature by showing that the brains of older adults with
MCI, similar to healthy older adults, remain highly plastic.

Previous findings showed that 12 weeks of treadmill ex­
ercise decreases brain activation intensity during a semantic
memory task and suggested that exercise may improve neu­
ral efficiency and cognitive function in MCI.[47] The cogni­
tive improvement may be associated with the significantly
decreased prefrontal hemodynamic response. In our CPC
group, a marginal but nonsignificant decrease in the activa­
tion of the bilateral PFC was noted. We may suggest that
the training effect of the CPC group may not be as sufficient
as the VR group, and thus differences in pre- and posttrial
hemodynamic response as well as global cognition were
nonsignificant. In contrast, the VR group may benefit from
the augmenting effect of our specific IADL-based training
program in the VR context. Therefore, the improved neural
efficiency of the bilateral PFC was noted after VR training.

**Limitations of the study**


were unable to detect. Third, the drop-out rate (19%) in the
present study was greater than that as recommended by the
PEDro score (15%). Of the 8 drop-out subjects, 3 dropped
out due to health problems unrelated to training (i.e., they
needed to receive surgery or treatment in the hospital), and
5 dropped out due to low motivation (one complained our
program did not inspire their interests, and 4 told us they
could not continue the exercises because they were busy
and had other commitments scheduled). Some important
variables, such as depression and comorbidities, which
might contribute to the drop-out rate, should be measured
when screening for eligibility. For example, the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS), a self-report assessment used to
identify depression in the elderly, should be used to ex­
clude depressive elderly, but we did not use this scale in
the present study. Fourth, the Lawton IADL scale is a selfreport measurement, though we checked with the caregiv­
ers of most participants. More sensitive tools to assess
IADL performances may be required in further studies.
Fifth, training intensity, such as the cognitive training pro­
gram, is difficult to match. However, we monitored heart
rate and perceived exertion and ensured that the session
time of these two groups was equal. Finally, our VR pro­
gram combined physical exercise and cognitive training
sequentially, and the CPC program combined the physical
exercise and cognitive training simultaneously. Although
most articles have stated that simultaneous and sequential
dual-task training programs were both effective in improv­
ing cognition and led to similar effects,[12, 48] the diverse
treatment benefits could be attributed to different combi­
nations of these methods and require further investigation.

#### Conclusions


There are some limitations in the present study. First, with­
out follow-up assessment, it remains unknown whether
the available intervention effect has been sustained over
long periods. Second, the hemodynamic response was as­
sessed only in the prefrontal areas, and there may be some
intervention-induced changes in other brain areas that we


The present study showed that cognitive functions of older
adults with MCI benefited from 12 weeks of the VR in­
tervention. A decreased activation in the prefrontal areas,
indicative of increased neural efficiency, was also found in
the VR training subjects. Furthermore, VR-based physi­
cal and cognitive training was superior in improving IADL
compared to CPC training. The results support the use of
VR-based physical and cognitive training in older adults
with MCI.
