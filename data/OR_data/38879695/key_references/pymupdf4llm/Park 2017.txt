**Abstract**
**Objective:** The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between non-specific computer
training (NCT) and cognition-specific computer training (CCT).
**Design: Randomized controlled experimental study.**
**Setting: Local community welfare center.**
**Subjects: A total of 78 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to the**
NCT (n = 39) or CCT group (n = 39).
**Intervention: The NCT group underwent NCT using Nintendo Wii for improving functional performance,**
while the CCT group underwent CCT using CoTras for improving function of the cognitive domain
specifically. Subjects in both groups received 30-minute intervention three times a week for 10 weeks.
**Main measures: To identify effects on cognitive function, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)**
digit span subtests, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail Making Test–Part B (TMT-B),
Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and Modified Taylor Complex Figure (MTCF) were used. Healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Short-Form 36-item questionnaire.
**Results:** After 10 weeks, the WAIS subtests (digit span forward: 0.48 ± 0.08 vs. 0.12 ± 0.04; digit span
backward: 0.46 ± 0.09 vs. 0.11 ± 0.04) and HRQoL (vitality: 9.05 ± 1.17 vs. 2.69 ± 1.67; role-emotional:
8.31 ± 1.20 vs. 4.15 ± 0.71; mental health: 11.62 ± 1.63 vs. 6.95 ± 1.75; bodily pain: 4.21 ± 2.17 vs. 0.10 ± 0.38)
were significantly higher in the NCT group (P < 0.05).
**Conclusion: NCT was superior to CCT for improving cognitive function and HRQoL of elderly adults**
with MCI.

## Introduction

Since the early 1980s, with the development of
computers, cognition-specific computer training
(CCT) after mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has
been conducted.[1–5] CCT allows patients to use a
computer as a treatment tool and provides simultaneous feedback to individual responses through an
input device such as a touch screen or joystick.[6]
In previous studies, CCT has been proven to be
effective in preventing cognitive decline and in
improving cognitive function of elderly adults with
MCI.[7–12] However, most of these previous studies
either did not include a treatment control group[7,8]
or utilized a wait-list control group.[9–12] In addition,
there is no evidence that the effects of CCT transfer
to untrained tasks.[13–15]
Therefore, non-specific computer training
(NCT) focused on functional aspects has been
developed to prevent effects from being confined
to a specific cognitive area.[16] NCT is an approach
that uses an interactive simulation system created
by computer hardware and software with threedimensional environment that mimic reality and
enable users to be engaged in activities regardless
of their physical disabilities.[16,17]
It has been reported that the effects of NCT can
be similar to those of CCT. In addition, when conducting NCT, elderly adults use physical movement to perform functional tasks. As physical
movement helps to improve the cognitive function
of elderly adults, previous NCT studies found
improvements in cognitive as well as physical
function.[18–20]
However, there remains controversy concerning
the different effects of non-specific and CCT.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need to verify if
there is any difference in effects of the two different forms of computer training.
The purpose of this study was to investigate
differences between non-specific and CCT group
after a 10-week intervention for elderly people
with MCI. We hypothesized that the NCT group
would improve more in cognitive function and
quality of life as compared with the CCT group
after a 10-week intervention for elderly adults
with MCI.


## Subjects and methods

This study was conducted from October to
December 2015, and recruitment took place from
October 5 to 16. This was a single-blind study,
and subjects were allocated randomly to the nonspecific or CCT group using a random number
generated by computer software. The assignment
was stored in number-sealed envelopes and
opened by one occupational therapist who was
not involved in subject recruitment. All assessors
were blinded to group allocation. This study was
conducted for 10 weeks, and subjects were
assessed before and after the intervention. This
study was registered at the Thai Clinical Trials
Registry ID: TCTR20160916001 after approval
by the local research ethics committee. All subjects provided informed consent before study
inclusion according to the Declaration of Helsinki
(2004).
Elderly people over 60 years old with amnestic
MCI were recruited from a local community welfare center in Korea. They were screened by a
blinded assessor. The inclusion criteria were
derived from a previous CCT study[21] and were as
follows: (1) subjective memory complaint, (2)
objective memory impairment defined by score on
the Placing Test < 13,[22] (3) intact general cognitive
function as determined by score on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 24,[23]
and (4) intact activities of daily living as determined by score on the Seoul instrumental activities
of daily living score ≥ 8.[24] Exclusion criteria were
as follows: (1) neurological, psychiatric, or medical disorders; (2) moderate or severe depressive
symptom as determined by score on the Korean
version of the Geriatric Depression Scale > 19;[25]
(3) presence of auditory, visual, motor, or language
impairments that would hinder use of a computer;
and (4) participation in cognitive training within
three months.
Sample size estimation was conducted using
G*Power 3.1 (Informer Technologies, Dusseldorf,
Germany).[26] According to a previous study,[27] the
effect size (ES) was set at 0.90, the α error at a
probability of 0.05, and the power at 0.95. A minimum of 34 subjects was required in each group.


-----

All sessions were conducted by one occupational therapist with six years of clinical experience. All subjects performed a total of 30 sessions,
three days a week for 10 weeks. The two interventions were similar in that they were computerized
and performed on a computer screen with the subject seated. The difficulty levels of training were
adjusted during the sessions depending on each
subject’s performance.
To conduct the NCT, the Nintendo Wii
(Nintendo, Japan) was used. It introduced a new
style of virtual reality using a wireless controller
that interacts with the player through an avatar and
a motion detection system. The controller uses
embedded acceleration sensors responsive to
changes in acceleration, direction, and speed that
enable subjects to interact with the games. A
2-point infrared light sensor, mounted on top of a
television, captures and reproduces on the screen
the movement from the controller as performed by
subjects. In this study, three sports games (table
tennis, sword play, and archery) that affect cognitive function from Wii Sports Resorts were used in
accordance with a previous study.[27] In each session, the subjects played each game for 10 minutes.
[Detailed descriptions are presented at http://wiis-](http://wiisportsresort.com/)

The CoTras program (Netblue, Korea) made for
Korean was used for the CCT. CoTras consists of
various training programs including attention,
memory, and visual spatial abilities. This program
was designed for patients with cognitive impairment in order to improve cognitive function. The
CoTras panel with large buttons makes the training
easy for subjects who are unfamiliar with computers.[28] In this study, attention (sustained and selective attention), memory (working memory), and
visual spatial ability (visual discrimination and
visual constancy) were trained for 10 minutes with
each of the three trainings. None of the subjects
showed adverse effects in using the computer during the sessions.
The assessments were performed before and after
the intervention. Two occupational therapists with
more than three years of experience conducted all
the assessments in a fixed order. Neuropsychological
assessments were performed to assess attention,


memory, executive function, and visual spatial
abilities.
Attention was measured using the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) digit span subtest
according to a previous study.[29] It consists of two
separate tasks (digit span forward and digit span
backward), which require subjects to listen to a
string of digits and repeat back the numbers in the
same or reverse order.[30]
The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
(RAVLT) and Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
were used to measure memory. The RAVLT is
word list memory test in which the test assessor
read aloud a list of 15 nouns for five consecutive
trials and each trial is followed by a free recall
test.[31] It has several different word lists. In order to
reduce practice effects, a different list of nouns was
used at each assessment.
The Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
involves the subject copying a complex figure and
then drawing it from memory.[31] Visual spatial ability was measured using the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test. It
requires that colored blocks be arranged so as to
duplicate a maximum of 10 target patterns presented in order of ascending difficulty. The subjects were required to arrange a set of nine blocks
to duplicate a presented pattern, within 120 seconds. Scores can range from 0 to 48, with higher
scores reflecting better visual spatial ability.[32]
Executive function was measured using the
Trail Making Test–Part B (TMT-B) and the Stroop
Color-Word Test. The TMT-B consists of 25 circles
distributed over a sheet of paper. The circles
include both numbers (1–13) and letters (A-L). The
subjects were asked to connect the circles in
ascending order with the added task of alternating
between numbers and letters as quickly as possible.[33] The Stroop Color-Word Test consists of three
subtasks. The first subtask shows color words
(blue, green, red, and yellow) in random order
printed in black ink. The second subtask shows
solid color patches in each of these four colors. The
third subtask includes color words printed in an
incongruous ink color (e.g. the word blue printed in
green ink). The subjects were asked to read the
words, name the color, and finally, name the ink


-----

color of the words as quickly and accurately as
possible.[34]
To measure health-related quality of life, the
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used. It
consists of 36 items and 8 subscales: (1) physical
functioning, (2) role-physical, (3) bodily pain, (4)
general health, (5) vitality, (6) social functioning,
(7) role-emotional, and (8) mental health.[35] The
score of each subscale ranges from 0 to 100, and
higher scores indicate better health.
All data analyses were conducted using SPSS
version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Means
and standard deviations for subject characteristics
of the two groups were calculated. To compare
subject characteristics between the two groups,
independent-sample _t-tests and chi-square tests_
were used. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to
determine the normal distribution of all outcome
measurements.
In the main analysis, we examined the gap at
baseline. After 10-week intervention, we checked
the difference between groups. A 2 × 2 mixed
model repeated-measures analysis of covariance
with time (pre- and post-intervention) as the
within-group variable and training (cognitionspecific and non-specific) as the between-subject
variable. The ES of each intervention group was
calculated using partial _η[2]. Partial_ _η[2]_ ≥0.14 was
considered a large effect, between ≥0.06 and <0.14
was considered a moderate effect, and between
≥0.01 and <0.06 was considered a small effect.[36]
Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

## Results

A total of 89 elderly people with cognitive impairment were selected from 186 elderly people in a
local community welfare center.[37] Among them, 78
were selected finally according to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria (Figure 1). The subjects were
randomly allocated to groups of 39.
There were no significant differences between
groups in terms of gender, age, years of education,
or score on the Korea version of Mini-Mental State
Examination at baseline (Table 1). When comparing the differences in outcome measures before and
after the intervention within each group, cognitive


function (attention, memory, and visual spatial
ability) showed a significant increase in both
groups (P < 0.05), as did the mental components of
health-related quality of life (P < 0.05), except for
social functioning (P > 0.05). In the physical components of health-related quality of life, bodily
pain improved significantly increased in the NCT
group (see Tables 2 and 3).
There were significant differences in outcome
measures, with greater improvement in the NCT
group for attention (P < 0.05; _η[2] = 0.835–0.876),_
vitality (P < 0.05; _η[2] = 0.833),_ role-emotional
(P < 0.05; _η[2] = 0.821), mental health (P < 0.05;_
_η[2] = 0.662), and bodily pain (P < 0.05;_ _η[2] = 0.641;_
Tables 2 and 3). The NCT group achieved clinical
improvement in cognitive function and healthrelated quality of life compared with the CCT
group. There was no significant difference between
groups in the incidence of adverse effects or in the
number of subjects who stopped performing computer training.

## Discussion

After a 10-week intervention, significant differences in attention and self-efficacy were observed
between the NCT group and the CCT group. These
results supported the hypothesis that NCT has positive effects on improving cognitive function and
health-related quality of life, which is consistent
with the results of previous studies.[27]
Cognitive function can be improved by enhancing the ability to learn new tasks.[16] In this study, the
NCT group continued adapting to new tasks, which
has positive effects on attention. Several studies
have indicated that video games might improve
attention compared with training that is specific to
cognitive function.[27,38] NCT can facilitate the training in a fun manner through an avatar and virtual
reality environment. Thus, NCT might motivate
subjects to participate more efficiently as compared to CCT. Furthermore, it has been reported
that higher motivation is associated with better
intervention outcomes, which may decrease issues
with intervention compliance.[39] Those who
received NCT had no experience playing Wii
before this study and showed interest in it.

In addition, the NCT group received game-based
cognitive training with additional physical exercise.
Several studies have suggested that physical exercise has positive effects on cognitive function
among elderly people with dementia as well as


healthy elderly people.[18–20] A number of studies on
aging, cognition, and physical exercise have suggested that adequate physical exercise results in
increased ability of the heart to deliver oxygen to
working muscles.[18] These improvements are related

to changes in physiological mechanism such as cerebral blood flow and brain-induced neurotrophic
factors that have been shown to be associated with
cognitive function.[40,41] Therefore, physical exercises have had an additional positive effect on cognitive function in the NCT group.
The finding of this study indicated that NCT
was superior to CCT in some respects. Green and
Bavelier[16] reported cognition-specific training is
task-specific, and its effects are scarcely transferred to other tasks. In previous studies, elderly
adults who received cognitive training that was
focused on specific cognitive function (planning,
problem solving, and reasoning) showed significant improvements in the specifically trained tasks
but not in other cognitive functions.[22,42] In this
study, there was no improvement of executive
function, which was not trained in either group,
which is consistent with previous studies.[22,42] In
conclusion, this study suggested that CCT may be
more appropriate for cognitive training in patients
with a specific cognitive impairment, while NCT is
more appropriate for elderly adults with multiple
cognitive impairments such as MCI.
Regarding health-related quality of life, the
NCT group showed more improvement in vitality,
role-emotional, and mental health compared with
the CCT group. The NCT group was trained with a
three-dimensional avatar of the subject and soft
music and received auditory and visual feedback.
The characteristics of NCT might have positive
effects on subjects’ mental health. Sudenski et al.[43]
indicated that elderly people who were trained with
virtual reality game showed gains in mental health


compared with elderly people who were not. In
another study, it was reported that NCT promotes
mental health among elderly adults with depression.[44] However, in this study, there was no significant difference in social functioning between the
groups, as both training groups only received training individually, without opportunity for social
interaction. Thus, it is necessary to develop a NCT
system to supplement social health.
In terms of physical components, there were no
significant differences between groups except for
bodily pain. This is likely because most subjects
were already healthy before participating in the
intervention. Hence, a ceiling effect may have been
at play, as most questions were related to basic
activities of daily living. Furthermore, the training
contents could have limited an improvement in
physical components. Sartor-Glittenberg et al.[45]
showed that lower extremity function is the primary factor influencing physical components.
However, in this study, neither NCT nor CCT
focused on lower extremity function.
Meanwhile, the NCT group showed more
improvement in bodily pain than did the cognitionspecific group. A previous study suggested that
NCT could accelerate relaxation and reduce pain
via auditory and visual feedback for patients with
arthritis,[46] which is consistent with the results of
this study.
Compared with CCT, NCT has some advantages in terms of motivation through virtual reality
environmental stimulation. As a result, NCT
appears to be superior to CCT in improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life

among elderly adults with MCI. NCT is an entertaining alternative to CCT. Moreover, NCT can be
performed easily at home, helping to improve or
maintain cognitive functions and quality of life
among elderly adults with MCI who cannot go the
medical facility.[16,17]
This study, however, has several limitations.
First, the long-term effects of the NCT and CCT
were not confirmed. Second, the sample size in this
study was relatively small. Therefore, in the future,
studies with a larger sample size and a follow-up
assessment are needed to clarify the robustness of
the present findings.


**Clinical Messages**

- Non-specific computer training (NCT)
produced more significant improvements
in cognitive function and health-related
quality of life than did cognition-specific
computer training (CCT) in elderly adults
with MCI.

- NCT appears to be an entertaining alternative to CCT.
