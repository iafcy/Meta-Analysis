Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously
### interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training.

Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned
### into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100
∗ (single-task gait parameters dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters.
### −

Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task
### and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances.


-----

### Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.

## INTRODUCTION

Performing activities of daily living (ADLs) requires the ability
to perform multiple cognitive and physical tasks simultaneously.
Dual tasking destabilizes gait performance, especially for those
with impaired cognitive function, which may lead to falls
(Springer et al., 2006). A previous study reported that older
adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) showed significant
decreases in gait velocity, increases in stride time and increases
in stride time variability when changing from a single to a
dual task (Muir et al., 2012). Meta-analysis has also revealed
some differences between MCI patients and cognitively normal
controls in several gait parameters, including velocity, stride
length and stride time, during either a single or dual task
(Bahureksa et al., 2017). In addition, dual-task gait performance
has been associated with progression to dementia in patients
with MCI. Dual-task gait testing may be used by clinicians to
assess the risk of cognitive decline (Montero-Odasso et al., 2017;
Rosso et al., 2019).
Executive function is defined as a set of cognitive skills
necessary for planning, monitoring and executing a sequence
of goal-directed complex actions (Diamond, 2013). Executive
dysfunction, such as inadequate divided attention and selective
attention, are more pronounced in older adults with MCI than
in controls (Johns et al., 2012; Kirova et al., 2015). Executive
function can modulate competition interference between two
attention-demanding tasks and has been suggested to be
associated with spatial and temporal characteristics of dual-task
gait performance (Woollacott and Shumway-Cook, 2002; de
Bruin and Schmidt, 2010). For example, Doi et al.’s (2014) study
showed significant correlation between executive function and
dual task gait speed in 389 older adults with MCI. Consequently,
individuals with poor executive function have reduced gait speed
and higher levels of fall risk and functional disability (Johnson
et al., 2007; Herman et al., 2010). Improving executive function
and minimizing dual-task interference may, therefore, have
clinical utility in avoiding falls occurring in older adults with MCI
(Bahureksa et al., 2017).
Either cognitive or physical training has proven to be an
effective intervention in enhancing cognitive functions in older
adults with MCI (Simon et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2012, 2013).
Therefore, some studies have investigated the combined effects
of physical and cognitive training (Barnes et al., 2013; AndersonHanley et al., 2018; Damirchi et al., 2018). Studies have found that
older adults with MCI showed greater improvements in various
cognitive functions after receiving combined therapy than after
receiving cognitive or physical therapy alone (Barnes et al.,
2013). In addition to improved cognitive function, dual-task gait
interference may be decreased through the repeated practice of
dual tasking (i.e., combined physical and cognitive interventions)


in accordance with the principles of task-specific training
(Plummer et al., 2015). However, the amount of evidence on
the effects of combined physical and cognitive exercises on
dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI is limited.
Tay et al.’s (2016) finding showed that combined physical and
cognitive training improved dual-task walking performance.
More evidence is required to investigate the training effects in
older adults with MCI.
Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated technology that
enables interactions between the user and virtual environments.
The advantages of using VR interventions include enhancing
accessibility and cost-effectiveness, creating an immersive
experience, and providing immediate feedback based on an
individual’s performance. Previous articles have shown positive
effects of these VR interventions on attention and visual and
verbal memory, as well as executive functioning, in older adults
with MCI (Coyle et al., 2015; Mrakic-Sposta et al., 2018). Due
to the advantages of VR, integrating physical and cognitive
training into VR appears to be a good intervention approach.
However, most articles using VR training include either physical
or cognitive training (García-Betances et al., 2015). Studies on
the effects of combining both physical and cognitive training
in the VR context are lacking. In addition, instrumental ADLs
(IADLs) comprise many dual-task activities and require high
demands on executive functioning. Integrating IADL tasks into
the VR context represents an innovative approach to improve
executive function in older adults with MCI. Whether these
innovative interventions can reduce dual-task interference and
transfer to improvements in dual-task gait performance requires
investigation. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was
to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training
on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older
adults with MCI, as well as compare the VR-based physical
and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and
cognitive training.

## METHODS

 Study Design and Protocol
This study was a single-blinded (assessor) randomized controlled
trial. Participants were randomly assigned to either the VR
training group or the combined physical and cognitive training
(CPC) group via a sealed envelope. Subjects in the VR group
participated in a 60-min, VR-based physical and cognitive
training each visit, three times a week for 12 weeks. Those in
the CPC group participated in combined physical and cognitive
training for 60 min each visit, three times a week for 12 weeks.
An experienced physical therapist supervised exercise training in
a small group for both the VR and CPC groups. The assessor,
who was always blinded to the group assignments, measured the


-----

outcomes at baseline and after completing the 36 sessions. This
trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National
Yang-Ming University, and consent forms were obtained from
all participants at the beginning of the experimental procedures.
The trial was registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry[1], and
the approval number is ‘‘TCTR20180531001.’’

## Participants
All participants were recruited from communities and day care
centers of Taipei, Taiwan. The inclusion criteria were: (1) aged
65 years and over; (2) able to walk more than 10 m without
walking aids; (3) had a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
score lower than 26 (Tsai et al., 2012); (4) had self-reported
memory complaints; and (5) had the ability to perform ADLs.
The exclusion criteria included: (1) dementia; (2) a history
of malignant tumors with life expectancy less than 3 months;
(3) the presence of an unstable neurological or orthopedic disease
interfering with participation in the study; and (4) an education
level less than 6 years (elementary school).

## Intervention
### Combined Physical and Cognitive Training (CPC) Group
Our CPC program contains both physical and cognitive elements
of training. The physical training regimen comprised resistance,
aerobic and balance exercises that meet the standards of the
American College of Sports Medicine for seniors (ChodzkoZajko et al., 2009; Garber et al., 2011). Our physical training
was set to reach 50%–75% of the maximal heart rate (calculated
as 220- age) with the exertion perceived by the participants
as ‘‘somewhat hard’’ (scored 13–14). Specifically, Therabands
were applied to assist the training of both the upper and lower
extremities during the resistance exercise. A series of whole-body
aerobic exercises, for example, stepping while in the seated
and standing positions, as well as on and off of a stool, was
performed. Balance exercises included standing on a steady foam
mat in various postures and walking forward and backward
with eyes open and closed. Other functional tasks simulated
ADLs and were designed to enhance motor performance and
were integrated into the CPC program. Samples of functional
tasks included asking participants to climb stairs, cross obstacles
while reaching for objects, and turning and rising from a
chair. In addition to the functional tasks, training that targeted
cognitive abilities was also integrated into the physical training
program. Training scenarios included walking while reciting
poems, naming flowers and animals while crossing obstacles,
solving math questions during the resistance training, drawing
a circle in the air in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction
with the right or left hand, respectively, and searching for the
prefix and roots of a Chinese character at moments when they
repetitively stand up from a chair.

### Virtual Reality-Based Physical and Cognitive Training (VR) Group
Scenes from the VR-based physical and cognitive training
program are shown in Figure 1.

[1http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/](http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/)


### VR-Based Physical Exercise Program
We used the Kinect system (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,
WA, USA) to capture the limb motions and create a full-body
3D virtual map. The physical elements of the VR training
were developed by the well-established and widely used Tano
and LongGood programs. We adopted programs, including
a simplified 24-form Yang-style Tai Chi, resistance exercise,
aerobic exercise, and functional tasks in the forms of window
cleaning, goldfish scooping and other tasks relevant to daily
activities, to improve upper and lower extremity balance,
stability, strength and endurance (Figures 1D,E). In the VR
context, participants would imitate the virtual character and
adjust their movements based on the simultaneous visual and
auditory feedback.

### VR-Based Cognitive Training Program
The cognitive training required wearing the VR glasses on their
heads with a motor controller in both hands to execute the
training tasks (Figure 1F). Our laboratory invented most of
the cognitive training VR games, while others were derived from
the ‘‘Job Simulator’’ software developed by Owlchemy Labs. The
concept of the cognitive programs was inspired by simulated
IADL tasks. For example, in the taking mass rapid transit (MRT)
game, participants took the MRT in a familiar VR context where
station gates, ticket vending machines, and ATMs were located
in the usual places. To complete the task, a participant needed
to be aware of their present location and the designated stations.
They also needed to gather enough coins based on the fare chart
to obtain a ticket. In the store finder game, a big red cross sign


-----

appeared as an indicator when something was going wrong. A
participant needed to virtually walk to the store noted on a map
in less than 3 min. If the participants failed to get closer to
the targeted store in 2 min, directional marks in red popped
up to guide their way. In the kitchen chef game, a participant
found herself/himself in a well-equipped kitchen surrounded
by numerous utensils available for use to prepare an ordered
dish. Once he or she was able to complete a simple meal, a
more complicated dish requiring more ingredients and utensils
to complete followed. The last game was convenience store clerk;
participants were responsible for gathering items from the to-do
list and checking them out. Some of the listed items were easy to
find, while others could not be located as easily (Figures 1A–C).

## Outcome Measures
These outcomes were all secondary outcomes of our project. We
wanted to explore how our secondary outcomes are responded
to the intervention. Therefore, this is an exploratory study
of mechanisms.

## Executive Function

### Trail Making Test (TMT)
The TMT has been hypothesized to reflect components
of executive function, such as visual attention and task
switching (Arnett and Labovitz, 1995). The current study
used TMT-A and the Chinese version of TMT-B (Wang
et al., 2018b). The TMT-A was composed of 25 consecutive
Arabic numbers, and participants connected the numbers while
following the numerical sequence. The TMT-B was composed
of 12 consecutive Arabic numbers and 12 Chinese characters
that represented a Chinese zodiac sign. Participants drew lines
to connect the circles in ascending order while following an
additional rule of alternating between numbers and animal signs
(i.e., 1 - rat - 2 - ox - 3 - tiger, etc.). The time to complete each
test was recorded. Delta TMT (TMT B subtract TMT A) was also
recorded as our TMT outcome.

### Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT)
The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) has been used to
assess the ability of inhibition in executive function (Scarpina
and Tagini, 2017). The current study used the Chinese version
of the Stroop (Wang et al., 2018b), which was composed of four
characters and four colors. The incongruous conditions were
used in the present study. In this condition, the colors of the
characters were printed in an inconsistent color ink (e.g., the
character ‘‘blue’’ in red ink). Participants had to name the color
of the ink rather than state the word/character as quickly as they
could in a limited time. The number of correct answers in 45 s
(SCWT number) and time to name 45 characters (SCWT time)
were our outcomes.

## Gait Performance
Gait performance was measured in three conditions: (1) walking
at their preferred walking speed (single task); (2) walking
while executing a serial subtraction by three task, starting from
a randomized 3-digit number (e.g., 100, 97, 94. . .; cognitive
dual task); and (3) walking while carrying a tray with glasses
of water (motor dual task). Our primary task is waking,


and the secondary tasks are executing a serial subtraction or
carrying a tray. Participants were asked to focus on their
walking task and walk three trials under each condition. The
trial intervals were 1 min. Data were averaged from the
three trials.
The GAIT Up system (Gait Up, Lausanne, Switzerland), a
wearable device with good validity and reliability, was used
to evaluate gait parameters for the above testing conditions
(Mariani et al., 2010; Dadashi et al., 2014). The dimensions of
the GAIT UP sensors were 50 mm × 40 mm × 16 mm, and
the weight was 36 g. Two wireless inertial sensors with tri-axial
accelerometers were fixed on the upper part of the shoe with
an elastic strap. In the present study, spatiotemporal parameters
recorded during each trial included speed (m/s), stride length
(cm) and cadence (step/min). Dual-task interference was
quantified by calculating the dual-task costs (DTCs) according
to the customary formula (McDowd, 1986). For example,
DTC-speed [%] = 100 [∗] (single-task walking speed − dual-task
walking speed)/single-task walking speed.

## Data Analysis
Demographic and behavioral data analyses were performed using
SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive
statistics were generated for all variables, and the distributions
of the variables were expressed as the means ± standard
deviations or as the numbers (%). Intergroup differences in the
baseline characteristics were analyzed using independent t-tests
or chi-square tests. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measures was used to determine the effects of the
intervention on executive function and gait performance. The
model effects were the groups (VR and CPC), the times (pre
and post), and their interaction. The intergroup comparison was
across groups, and the intragroup comparison was the change
over time. A post hoc Tukey’s test was used for variables with
group × time interaction effects.

## RESULTS

As shown in the flowchart, 42 participants were recruited and
randomly assigned to either the VR group (n = 21) or the
CPC group (n = 21). Three participants in the VR group and
five participants in the CPC group dropped out due to low
motivation. A total of 34 participants (18 in the VR group
and 16 in the CPC group) completed all the assessments
(Figure 2). No adverse events were reported throughout the
study period. Participant characteristics are shown in Tables 1–3.
Baseline demographic characteristics and outcome measures at
the pre-intervention are similar between two groups.
The results of the executive function assessments are shown
in Table 2. Of the six within group p-values for the TMT, VR
group shows two significant values (TMT-B. delta TMT). None
of the outcomes of TMT were found to have group × time
interactions except for the TMT-B (a borderline significant
_p = 0.032). Of the four within group p-values for SCWT,_
both VR and CPC are significant (SWCT-numbers, SWCTtime); neither interaction is significant. The results of the single
and dual task gait performance are shown in Table 3. For

single-task gait, both groups have two significant p-values of
12 within group p-values (VR group: gait speed, stride length;
CPC group: gait speed, cadence) and no interaction for between
groups. For motor dual task gait, VR group has two significant

has three significant within group p-values (gait speed, stride
length, cadence) of the 12 within group p-values, and none
of the six interactions are significant. For cognitive dual task,
VR group has three significant p-values of the 12 within
group p-values (gait speed, stride length, DTCs of cadence),
CPC group has no significant within group p-value. None of
the single and dual task gait outcomes were found to have
group × time interactions except for the cognitive DTCs of
cadence (a borderline significant p = 0.018).

## DISCUSSION

The goal of the current study was to assess the effects of
VR-based cognitive and physical training on executive function
and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI,
as well as compare VR training with CPC training. In this
study, we found significant improvements in executive function
(SCWT), single-task gait performance and motor dual-task gait
performance in both groups. However, only the VR group
showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance

and the DTC of cadence after training. Moreover, the VR group
showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B
and cognitive DTC of cadence.
In our present study, the SCWT was used to assess
selective attention or inhibition. Selective attention (inhibition)
is the ability to control/inhibit impulsive responses and create
responses by using attention and reasoning. This cognitive
ability is one of our executive functions and contributes to
anticipation, planning, and goal setting. Therefore, the stronger
the inhibition ability is, the less interference will be produced
by a new stimulus (Stroop, 1935). Falbo et al. (2016) state that
physical and cognitive dual-task training effectively increased
inhibitory performance in older adults. In the present dual-task
intervention, subjects in both groups learned how to complete
the task with multiple stimuli under the mutual interference
of the cognitive and physical training. After repetitive practice,
interference from new stimuli can be reduced, as reflected
by improvements in inhibition shown by the SCWT in
both groups.
The TMT-B assesses divided attention, which is the ability
to attend to two different stimuli at the same time and
respond to the multiple demands of the surroundings. The
delta TMT assesses cognitive flexibility, which is an important
aspect for dual tasking and prioritization during gait (Hobert
et al., 2011, 2017). Divided attention and cognitive flexibility
are also aspects of executive function, which allow us to process
information from different sources and successfully carry out
multiple tasks at a time. The effect of VR-based training on
enhancing divided attention assessed via the TMT had been
proved in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (Mirelman et al.,
2011). In the present study, significant within- and betweengroup differences on the TMT-B were observed in older adults
individuals with MCI who received VR training. We suggest
that the improvements on the TMT-B might be attributed
to the interaction of the VR programs. Our IADL-based VR
programs effectively facilitated complex executive function,
especially visual attention, as participants repetitively practiced
these functional tasks during the 12-week intervention. For
example, the kitchen chef game was specifically designed
to train for planning and task switching, while participants
prepared food as ordered with available kitchenware and
ingredients. The convenience store clerk game trained for
working memory, orientation and attention as the participants
retrieved and calculated the prices of the checkout items. To
optimize their performance, participants needed to increase both
motor and cognitive capacity. We believe performing these
functional tasks with internalized real-time feedback by VR may
have a greater effect on various executive functions. Another
explanation is that the enjoyment and attractiveness of the
VR characteristics may have increased motivation and led to
more extensive training effects on executive function in the VR
group than the CPC group. Overall, the traditional combined
physical and cognitive training program could not offer these
critical features.
Both groups showed similar time effects on gait speed and
stride length in the single-task and motor dual-task gait tests.
These improvements imply the nonspecific exercise benefits


of these two different interventions (Liberman et al., 2017).
However, only the VR group showed an improvement in
cognitive dual-task gait performance after the intervention. This
gait improvement may have transferred from improvements in
executive functions; in particular, we observed between-group
differences in the TMT-B improvement, which represents visual
attention and task switching. In fact, the role of executive
function in walking when combined with a secondary task
has been previously shown (Hausdorff et al., 2005; Schweiger
et al., 2008). Furthermore, Parikh and Shah (2017) showed a
relationship between the TMT-B and dual-task gait performance
among older adults. Older adults with MCI have an increased
fall risk compared to cognitively normal older adults (LiuAmbrose et al., 2008). A gait velocity less than 1.0 m/s
has also been associated with an increased fall risk among
community-dwelling older adults (Abellan van Kan et al.,
2009). Although both of our groups had improved cognitive
and motor dual-task gait velocities after the intervention,
the post-intervention gait velocities were still below 1.0 m/s
in both cognitive and motor dual-task walking conditions.
We suggest that sustained cognitive and physical training
and fall prevention education are required in routine daily
treatment programs.
The DTC quantifies dual-task interference, which is the
relative change in performance associated with dual tasking.
Individuals with cognitive deficits may be particularly susceptible
to dual-task interference because there are fewer attentional
resources available for the simultaneous performance of
secondary tasks. We observed intragroup and intergroup
improvements in the cognitive DTC of cadence after our VR
training. The main cause may have been a specific effect of VR.
VR not only provides a more complex environment but also
creates many opportunities to train visual attention. From the
concept of capacity-sharing theory, if two attention-demanding
tasks are performed at the same time in a condition of limited
attentional resources, performance of at least one of the tasks will
deteriorate (Ruthruff et al., 2001; Yogev-Seligmann et al., 2008).
We speculate that our VR training, including many IADL-based
cognitive training components in augmented scenarios, might
have improved cognitive capacity and reduced the attention
needed to perform the cognitive task, thereby permitting greater
attention to be shifted toward performing another concurrent
task (e.g., walking). Therefore, the DTC of cadence were reduced
from 11% to 6% after training.
Previous studies have stated that normal older adults
can improve their cognitive dual-task gait performance after
combined physical and cognitive training (Eggenberger et al.,
2015; Falbo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a). Contrary to our
expectations, our CPC group showed no time effect on the
cognitive dual-task walking performance. We suggest that for
older adults with MCI, improvements in SCWT can transfer
to improvements in motor dual-task performance but are
not strong enough to transfer to improvements in cognitive
dual-task performance (walking during serial subtraction).
In fact, walking while doing serial subtraction is a highly
demanding task that requires alternating momentary processing
capacity and filtering out all signals that are irrelevant to


-----

counting itself. Hunter et al. (2018) proposed a framework
for the secondary gait testing incorporating cognitive and
motor tasks in older adults with MCI. According to this
framework, the difficulty level of the cognitive dual task (serial
subtractions) is higher than that of the motor dual task
(carrying glass of water on tray) and more easily increases the
cognitive costs in older adults with MCI (Hunter et al., 2018).
Makizako et al. (2012) stated that applying multicomponent
exercises had no significant effect on cognitive dual-task gait
performance in older adults with MCI. Our findings are in
agreement with these findings, although we added cognitive
training to the physical exercise program. A higher intensity,
duration and challenge might be required to transfer the
cognitive dual-task skills to the gait performance in our
CPC group.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects
of IADL-based VR training on dual-task gait performance in
older adults with MCI. Limitations of this study include the
lack of an actual control group such as placebo treatment or
no intervention at all, which made the mechanisms underlying
our results unclear. Second, the motor task we chose was
too simple to create a challenging dual-task condition, so the
training effects of the motor dual-task gait were similar to the
single-task gait in both groups. Third, more gait parameters,
such as gait variability and stride time, may be required in
future studies, which might help us to clarify the mechanism
of the improvements. Fourth, the dual-task program in the VR
group was performed sequentially, and the dual-task program in
the CPC group was performed simultaneously. Although most
articles have stated that simultaneous and sequential dual-task
training were both effective in improving cognition and led to
similar effects (Strouwen et al., 2017; Bruderer-Hofstetter et al.,
2018), whether a different combination of methods leads to
different training intensities may require further investigation.
Fifth, because of the large number of statistical tests and the small
sample, the p-values cannot be interpreted in conventional terms
as estimates of Type I and TYpe II error probability. They should
be confirmed in a subsequent properly powered trial.

## CONCLUSION

The current results suggest that executive function and motor
dual-task performance could benefit from both VR-based and
traditional combined physical and cognitive training in older
adults with MCI. However, VR-based physical and cognitive
training showed more improvements in divided attention and the
cognitive DTC than traditional combined physical and cognitive
training. Our physical and cognitive program, derived from
IADLs, may constitute a reference for the VR training effect in
older adults with MCI.
