###### Background: Dementia cases may reach 100 million by 2050. Interventions are sought to curb or
prevent cognitive decline. Exercise yields cognitive benefıts, but few older adults exercise. Virtual
reality–enhanced exercise or “exergames” may elicit greater participation.

###### Purpose: Totestthefollowinghypotheses:(1)stationarycyclingwithvirtualrealitytours(“cybercycle”)
will enhance executive function and clinical status more than traditional exercise; (2) exercise effort will
explain improvement; and (3) brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) will increase.

###### Design: Multi-site cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the impact of 3 months of cybercycling
versus traditional exercise, on cognitive function in older adults. Data were collected in 2008–2010;
analyses were conducted in 2010–2011.

###### Setting/participants: 102 older adults from eight retirement communities enrolled; 79 were
randomized and 63 completed.

###### Interventions: A recumbent stationary ergometer was utilized; virtual reality tours and competitors were enabled on the cybercycle.

###### Main outcome measures: Executive function (Color Trails Difference, Stroop C, Digits Backward); clinical status (mild cognitive impairment; MCI); exercise effort/fıtness; and plasma BDNF.

###### Results: Intent-to-treat analyses, controlling for age, education, and cluster randomization, revealed a signifıcant group X time interaction for composite executive function (p�0.002). Cybercycling yielded a medium effect over traditional exercise (d�0.50). Cybercyclists had a 23% relative
risk reduction in clinical progression to MCI. Exercise effort and fıtness were comparable, suggesting
another underlying mechanism. A signifıcant group X time interaction for BDNF (p�0.05) indicated
enhanced neuroplasticity among cybercyclists.

###### Conclusions: Cybercycling older adults achieved better cognitive function than traditional exercisers, for the same effort, suggesting that simultaneous cognitive and physical exercise has greater
potential for preventing cognitive decline.

###### Trial registration: This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01167400.

do not interfere with daily living and yet may be a precursor to dementia.
Further, evidence is accumulating that cognitive benefıts may be achieved by way of improved neuronal functions, including neurogenesis, shown by concomitant
structural and functional changes in the brain,[13–17] impacts on biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease,[18,19] and increases in brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor
(BDNF).[10,14,19,20] Cognitive benefıt from exercise is
found primarily in executive control and frontal lobe
functions, such as planning, divided attention, and inhibition of responses.[8,21,22] These abilities are often impaired in dementia and are key to maintaining independence and delaying institutionalization.
The demonstrated cognitive and health benefıts of exercise are such that the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association
(AHA) upgraded recommended daily exercise.[23] Yet data
from the CDC Healthy People 2010 Database indicate
that only 14% of adults aged 65–74 years and 7% of
those aged �75 years reported regular exercise. Physician prescription of exercise[24] has not been shown to
substantially increase participation; �4% of patients in
one study complied.[25] These data suggest the need for
more-compelling interventions to increase the motivation of older adults to exercise, as well as multimodal
interventions that address the multiple defıcits from
physical inactivity.[26]

Virtual reality–enhanced exercise or “exergames”
combine physical exercise with computer-simulated environments and interactive videogame features and have
become popular as a means to promote healthy behaviors[27] and increase the appeal of exercise (e.g., the Wii Fit
and PlayStation Move).[28] Exergames have the potential
to increase exercise by shifting attention away from aversive aspects and toward motivating features such as competition and three-dimensional (3D) scenery. Participation in exergaming compared with traditional exercise
can lead to greater frequency and intensity[29] and enhanced health outcomes.[28,30,31] A recent study[32] reported
that compared with traditional stationary cycling, older
adults preferred cycling with interactive gaming.
Although promising, there are limited published data
on whether interactive exergaming technologies are reliably associated with enhanced physical and cognitive
health outcomes, and more-controlled research on the
effects of health games is needed.[27,33] One early study[34]

investigated virtual reality–enhanced stationary cycling
using virtual tours and on-screen competition (referred
to here as “cybercycling”) and found cognitive improvement in patients with traumatic brain injury. However,
without a traditional exercise control group, it is unclear


whether cybercycling yielded cognitive benefıt beyond
physical exercise alone.
While there are reports of the psychological benefıts of
cybercycling,[29,30,35] no previous randomized clinical trial
(RCT) has evaluated the cognitive benefıts of virtual
reality–enhanced exercise. Presented herein are results of
the Cybercycle Study, a multi-site cluster RCT in which
the cognitive benefıt of cybercycling was compared with
traditional stationary cycling, for older adults living independently. On the basis of prior research[8,21,22] showing
primarily executive function gains from exercise, it was
hypothesized that cybercycling would yield greater executive function. Further, it was hypothesized that any
change would be due to increased exercise effort spurred
on by engaging interactive virtual tours, competition, and
added mental challenge. Secondary analyses examined
change in BDNF as a biomarker indicating possible neuroplasticity, which has been implicated as a mechanism of
change linking exercise to cognition.[10,14,18–20]

#### Methods

###### Design

This cluster RCT (2008–2010) compared the impact on executive
function of two exercise interventions: physical exercise alone and
physical plus mental challenge as combined in an exergame.

###### Setting and Participants

Participants were recruited by fliers and information sessions at
eight independent living facilities. The facilities were chosen because of proximity to investigator institutions; similarity in size
(average 100–200 residents); and presence of contiguous living
areas to ensure indoor access to a study bike (to minimize barriers
associated with travel). Participants volunteered based on demonstrations of cybercycle functionality, not knowing which condition
they would be randomized to, but aware that all could use the
cybercycle after the 3-month intervention. Volunteers aged �55
years were screened; exclusion criteria were known neurologic
disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s) and functional disabilities that would substantially restrict participation in cognitive
testing or exercise. Written physician approval was required.
Union and Skidmore Colleges’ IRBs approved the study; participants provided written informed consent. A priori sample size
estimates were calculated based on published effect sizes for cognitive (d�0.48)[8] and physiologic (d�0.41)[36] outcomes from physical
exercise. An a priori power analysis had found that in a 2 � 2
(group � time) design, a sample of 100 would achieve 0.82 power
to detect a signifıcant effect (p�0.05). However, for logistic reasons, the study design was changed from individual to cluster
randomization. Post hoc statistical power is reported in the Results
section.

###### Interventions

Participants in the cybercycle and control conditions rode identical
recumbent stationary bikes, except for the virtual reality display
that was enabled on the cybercycle (Appendixes A and B, available
[online at www.ajpmonline.org). Participants were trained in the](http://www.ajpmonline.org)


-----

_nderson_ _anley et al /_ _m J rev_ _ed 0_ _;_ _( ): 09_ _9_


use of the bike, log-in procedures, and paper log for recording ride
statistics as a backup to the computer. Participants were given a
target heart rate range to maintain during exercise using the Heart
Rate Reserve (HRR) method[23]; mid-intervention adjustments were
made to maintain a relative HRR of 60%.
A 1-month familiarization period allowed participants to learn
to attend to continuous biofeedback information for safety (e.g.,
heart rate), before introducing distracting virtual tours in the cybercycle condition. Participants were instructed to gradually increase exercise frequency to 45 minutes per session fıve times per
week consistent with the ACSM and AHA recommendations.[23]

Individual progress reports and leaderboards were posted weekly
to control goal-setting and competition across interventions. Participants were asked to hold constant other lifestyle factors (e.g.,
diet and other physical activity) during their study participation to
isolate the effect of the interventions. The minimum threshold for
“completers” was 25 rides during the intervention period; thus
“completers” rode an average of three rides per week minus 2
weeks’ allowance for illness, holidays, or equipment repair.

Cybercycle group. After 1 month of familiarization, cybercycle
participants experienced 3D tours and competed with their own
“ghost” rider (last best ride). During Month 3, participants were
instructed to outpace on-screen riders.

Control group. After 1 month of familiarization, controls continued to ride the traditional stationary bike viewing biofeedback
information (e.g., heart rate and mileage). Each month, placebo
training (e.g., hydration and stretching) matched the attention
given to the cybercycle group.

Randomization. A priori plans were for individual random
assignment through software controls, but equipment problems,
combined with limited funding and space, led to cluster assignment in order to limit cross-condition contamination. Sites were
selected by random draw. Cluster random assignment achieved
similar levels of cognitive function and physiologic status at pretest, although the groups differed in age and education, which were
entered as covariates in analyses (p�0.002 and p�0.001, respectively; Table 1).

###### Main Outcome Measures

Cognitive assessment. Cognitive testing was done at enrollment (baseline), 1 month later (pre-intervention), and 3 months
later (post-intervention). Analyses were conducted using pre- and
post-scores. Baseline testing minimized the impact of practice and
learning effects associated with serial assessments and provided a
more stringent test of the main hypothesis.[37] Blinded ratings were
achieved in most cases. The primary cognitive outcome of interest,
executive function, was assessed via Color Trails 2-1 difference
score (time to connect alternating color and number dots, minus
time to connect only numbered dots)[38]; Stroop C (time to name
color of ink of contrasting color word)[39]; and Digit Span Backwards (number of correct trials repeating a string of numbers in
reverse order).[40]

To reduce the number of statistical comparisons, an executive
function composite score was obtained by converting raw scores
on each test to z-scores using the grand mean and SD across both
groups for each time point, then averaging the three measures
(Cronbach’s ��0.67). Timed tasks were reversed; a positive value
on the composite indicates a score above the mean. Secondary

cognitive outcomes were included to characterize the sample (e.g.,
clinical status below); no changes were expected on these tests
[(Appendix C, available online at www.ajpmonline.org). At the](http://www.ajpmonline.org)
completion of the study, participants’ clinical status pre- and postintervention was classifıed according to “typical” diagnostic criteria[41,42] for mild cognitive impairment (MCI; performance �1.5 SD
on at least one subtest in the domains of executive function, verbal
fluency, verbal memory, visuospatial skill, and visuospatial memory compared to normative data).[40] MCI incidence was comparable to prior research (Table 1).[43]

###### Physiologic Assessment

Baseline and post-exercise measurements included: weight (kilograms); height (centimeters); BMI; total and abdominal body composition (fat and lean mass) using the iDXA (GE Lunar, Inc.);
muscle strength of quadriceps and hamstrings using the HUMAC
Cybex Dynamometer (CSMI Solutions, Inc.); and insulin and glucose (Millipore, Inc.).

###### Assessment of Exercise Behavior

During the fırst year, daily physical activity (kilocalories) was
measured using the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study Physical Activity Questionnaire (ACLS-PAQ).[44] METs were used to
compute energy expended in activities. In the second year,
additional resources allowed measurement of daily physical
activity (kilocalories) using an accelerometer (Actical; Phillips
Respironics, Inc). Ride behaviors (frequency, intensity, and duration) were recorded on the bike computer and by participants
in a paper log.


###### Neuroplasticity Assessment

Fasting morning plasma samples were collected during pre- and
post-evaluations, not after exercise. Brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) levels were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Chemicon, Millipore, Billerica, MA; see
[Appendix D, available online at www.ajpmonline.org).](http://www.ajpmonline.org)

###### Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 19.0. For normally distributed continuous variables, arithmetic Ms and SDs were calculated.
For comparisons between groups of categoric baseline data, chisquare analyses were conducted. For comparisons of continuously
distributed baseline and demographic variables, t tests were performed. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using the last observation carried forward (LOCF). Four analytic strategies were
employed to examine between-group changes in outcomes: intent
to treat, complete case, age matched, and comparison of completers and noncompleters.
Mixed linear modeling, including fıxed and random effects,
estimated the impact of the interventions on executive function
composite scores, when adjusted for age, education, and nested
variability in clusters (eight sites). A likelihood ratio test was conducted to compare the full and restricted models, with and without
sites nested. Follow-up repeated measures general linear models
(GLMs) examined the group X time interaction effect, fırst by
examining the multivariate omnibus test (to control Type I error),
then examining the univariate results for the three executive function measures. To test whether between-group differences in cognitive outcomes were due to differential exercise effort, t-tests were
used. Effect sizes were computed using Cohen’s d formula with
pooled SDs. Tests of signifıcance used a two-sided alpha of p�0.05.

#### Results

A CONSORT flow chart (Figure 1) shows that 102 independent-living, older adults from eight retirement communities met criteria and consented to participate; 79
began exercise training and were randomized by site (average cluster n�10, SD�3.6; Figure 1). Sixty-three older
adults, ranging in age from 58 to 99 years, completed the
study (80% of randomized).

##### Effect of the Intervention on Cognitive Function, Physical Health, and Exercise Behaviors
The group X time interaction effects for executive
function of the full and restricted mixed linear models
were highly similar (F[1, 51.8]�10.4, p�0.002; F[1,
76.2]�10.4, p�0.002, with and without sites nested,
respectively; Figure 2). There was no benefıt of adding
the cluster random effect (LR �[2][1]�3.16, p�0.93); thus,
in order to maximize df in this relatively small sample, the
least-restrictive fıtting model was selected and subsequent parsimonious analyses were chosen. A difference
between groups in change in executive function over 3
months was indicated by a group X time interaction in a

and revealing a large effect (F[3, 62]�5.50, p�0.002,
�p2�0.21, power�0.93). Given the signifıcant omnibus

test, univariate group X time interactions were examined
and found signifıcant for all three measures of executive
function (Table 2).
Planned simple effects analyses controlled for age, education, and cognitive performance at baseline and revealed an increase in performance on the Color Trails
Difference (p�0.01) and Stroop C (p�0.05) tests for cybercyclists, with no change for controls. Cybercyclists
maintained a steady performance on Digits Backward,
whereas the control group declined (p�0.01). No interaction effects were found on physiologic or secondary
cognitive outcomes (Table 2). Analyses were repeated
using age-matched and complete-case subsamples and
results were similar (Appendixes E–H, available online at
[www.ajpmonline.org). No differences in exercise fre-](http://www.ajpmonline.org)
quency, intensity, or duration were found between the
cybercyclists and controls (Table 3). While the average
energy expended was relatively low (approximately 100
calories/ride), research has shown that even low-intensity


Cybercycling yielded a medium average effect size for
executive function that was over and above the average
effect for traditional exercise (d�0.50), contrasted with
prior research that showed a small effect size for aerobic
exercise over and above nonaerobically exercising controls (d�[0.48–0.16]�0.32).[51] Cybercyclists experienced a 23% reduction in risk of clinical progression to
MCI compared with traditional exercisers (nine controls
versus three cybercyclists converted to MCI). That is,
using the “typical” diagnostic criteria for MCI,[41,42] these
participants began the trial with performances in the
normal range, but experienced a decline to �1.5 SD below normative data on at least one test within those
domains.
Adherence to prescribed exercise (79.7%) was comparable with prior research (78.2%).[12] Consistent with
CONSORT standards, a comparison of study completers
and noncompleters is reported. Similar rates on noncompletion were found in both conditions; at baseline, noncompleters were more compromised than completers on
some cognitive and physiologic measures that may have
led to greater diffıculty completing the study (Appendix G,
[available online at www.ajpmonline.org). Appendix I](http://www.ajpmonline.org)
[(available online at www.ajpmonline.org) shows the 13](http://www.ajpmonline.org)
adverse events in the study.

#### Discussion

This cluster RCT provides preliminary evidence that exergaming can yield greater cognitive benefıt, buffering
against decline, more so than traditional exercise alone.
Older adults in an independent-living facility who exercised on a virtual reality–enhanced cybercycle for
3 months had signifıcantly better executive function than
those expending similar effort on a traditional stationary
bike. In contrast with prior research showing a small
effect of exercise over and above controls,[8] cybercycling
produced a medium effect that was over and above traditional exercise, with average improvements in performance of one half SD. Additionally, fewer cybercyclists
converted to MCI, suggesting a reduction in risk of
progression to MCI; however, the incidence and rate of
conversion to MCI herein might be higher than in a
community-dwelling sample, and further research is
needed to establish replicability and generalizability.
Contrary to expectations, effort and fıtness did not
appear to be the factors behind differential cognitive benefıts found in the cybercycle group. Perhaps because this
was a prescriptive intervention, most participants across
both groups were compliant with the regimen, and further research is needed to evaluate whether naturalistic
use would lead to greater effort by cybercyclists. These


fındings are consistent with some assertions in the literature that the cognitive benefıt derived from exercise is not
necessarily tied to fıtness outcomes, although the debate
continues.[46,47]

Future research will be needed to tease apart the contributions of a variety of factors in the cybercycling condition. Consistency across conditions for goal setting and
competition suggests virtual reality imagery and interactive decision making might be the potent factors of the
cybercycle. Exit interviews provided anecdotal evidence
of the value of these unique features. Participants commented on their enjoyment of visual stimulation and the
challenge of outpacing avatars. One woman, aged
86 years, noted that she felt healthier and attributed this
to actively maneuvering to “compete with that fellow
ahead of me!” Cybercycling provides a different experience than other cognitive stimulation such as TV, because it is interactive.
One explanation for the greater cognitive benefıt found
with cybercycling compared with traditional cycling
could be that the effect is due directly to the added mental
exercise required. Given that both exercise intervention
samples exerted similar effort over 3 months, the main
difference between the two interventions was the virtual
reality experience. Navigating a 3D landscape, anticipating turns and competing with others, requires additional
focus, expanded divided attention, and enhanced decision making. These are activities that depend in part on
executive function, which was signifıcantly affected. A
direct impact of cognitive stimulation herein does resonate with a growing, but formative literature on the ef

fects of cognitive training.[48] While research is mixed and
transfer is debatable, some research supports the utility of
mental exercise to facilitate cognitive health in older
adults.[49–52] Future research should measure the amount
of cognitive stimulation participants engage in during the
period of an exercise intervention to clarify the potential
added benefıt of activities beyond physical exercise.
Another explanation for the greater cognitive benefıt
found for cybercycling could be that the effect is due to
the interactive nature of combined physical and cognitive exercise. Perhaps cybercyclists benefıt from a dualexercise experience, accruing the positive effects of intertwined cognitive and physical exercise. When comparing
average effect sizes in the literature,[51] controls demonstrate test–retest growth (0.16), cognitive stimulation
aloneyieldsacomparablenegligibleeffect(0.13),physical
exercise yields a small effect over and above controls
(0.32), while combined cognitive and physical exercise
herein produced a medium effect beyond that traditionally found for exercising controls (0.50). It is interesting
that the combined effect of cognitive and physical exercise exceeds the sum of effects noted in the literature
above, perhaps indicating a compounding or synergistic
effect of cybercycling. Future research could evaluate this
by comparing cognitive stimulation alone, physical exercise alone, and the combination of the two.
Compounding cognitive benefıt from a combined task
does fıt with the evolving understanding of the mechanisms of brain plasticity and the role of exercise and
enriched environments in inducing angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and other changes that foster neurovascular integrity.[15,53] A combined effect would be consistent with
the animal literature, where cognitive benefıt from physical exercise and mental stimulation has been found to
occur by different mechanisms (cell proliferation and cell
survival, respectively).[53–55] This combined-effect hypothesis expands on prior research in humans, which has
found enhanced cognitive benefıts of physical and cognitive exercise interventions administered in tandem.[56,57]

Similarly, these fındings fıt with prior research that indicates cognitive benefıt beyond that from traditional exercise, when physical exercise is cognitively challenging
(e.g., Tai Chi or dancing).[58–60]

To further illuminate possible mechanisms linking exercise to cognitive change, alternative measures of intermediary physiologic or brain “fıtness” (e.g., neurotrophic
growth factors), may be needed beyond cardiovascular
fıtness outcomes typically assessed.[61] In this study, it was
found that cybercyclists experienced a signifıcantly
greater increase in BDNF than traditional exercisers, suggesting that exercise may lead to cognitive benefıts by way
of biomarkers linked to neurotrophic effects. The literature on BDNF change with physical exercise is mixed,


and researchers continue to evaluate possible moderators
such as age, gender, and type of exercise.[10,14,20] Cybercyclists exhibited a signifıcant change in BDNF, which
does fıt with research that has shown a signifıcant increase in BDNF after computerized cognitive training.[62]

Compared with prior research on the effects of physical exercise alone, the effect of the cybercycle intervention
adds to the growing consensus that exercise has a consistent effect on executive functions.[8,21,22] However, the
control group herein was also an exercising group (consistent with recommendations),[63] but did not show preto post-test improvement on executive function. It appears the added rigor of using an additional pre-test for
familiarization did “wash-out” practice advantages[37] evident in prior studies. While traditional exercise did not
yield “improvement” in cognition, it may have slowed
decline, which would be consistent with some prior research which found that in a similarly aged sample, the
control group declined on cognitive function.[64]

Limitations of this study include unequal representation
of age and education in the groups despite randomization,
and while statistical controls were used and age- and education-matched post hoc analyses were conducted, future
research could prospectively match on these variables.
Also, participants had a relatively high level of education,
and ethnic variability was limited; additional research is
needed to test generalizability. Noncompleters performed worse on some cognitive and physiologic measures; thus, screening for minimum levels of function
may be advisable.
Several strengths of this study are noteworthy. This
study addresses a gap in the literature as no prior RCT has
compared cognitive benefıts for older adults of virtual
reality–enhanced exercise with traditional exercise. The
observed effect exceeds that typically reported in traditional exercise research. The intervention should be applicable to a wide range of older adults in an independent
living context given the ease of using a recumbent bike
and increasing availability of exergaming technologies.
The fınding that cognitive outcomes could be improved
with cybercycling over and above those from traditional
exercising is surprising in light of similar exercise effort,
but this also provides an intriguing issue to explore in
future research.
Follow-up studies could aim to replicate prior research
by using neuroimaging to examine the impact of exergaming on the brain for further evidence of neuroplasticity.[13–16] With a refıned experimental design, future research could clarify if cognitive exercise alone is suffıcient
to produce the observed cognitive change, or if exergaming leads to added benefıt by synergistic neurophysiologic
advantages when mental challenges are linked to physiologic movements. Future research could compare out

door street-cycling with cybercycling, since the natural
world, street obstacles, other cyclists, and way-fınding
would similarly create cognitive challenge. It would also
be interesting to evaluate biophilia factors, degree of cognitive stimulation, and social presence. Additionally,
some labs have full-surround audio-visual virtual reality
environments, that could allow controlled testing of “outdoor” factors while ensuring safety.[65] Last, a cost–benefıt
analysis would be useful, in light of reports that physical
activity interventions for inactive older adults can be cost
effective.[66]

In summary, this cluster RCT indicates that for older
adults, virtual reality–enhanced interactive exercise or
“cybercycling” two to three times per week for 3 months
yielded greater cognitive benefıt and possibly added protection from progression to MCI, compared with a similar dose of traditional exercise. Additional research is
needed to examine the cause of this curious fınding,
which may be due to the presence of unique mental
stimulation in virtual reality, or the interactive combination of cognitive and physical challenges wielding dual
impacts, perhaps promoting neuroplasticity via multiple
pathways.[53,54] The implication is that older adults who
choose exergaming with interactive physical and cognitive exercise, over traditional exercise, may garner added
cognitive benefıt and perhaps prevent decline, all for the
same exercise effort.
