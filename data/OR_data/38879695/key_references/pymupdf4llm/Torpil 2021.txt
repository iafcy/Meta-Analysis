Abstract

#### Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily living. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the inter- vention group (n = 30; 70.12 – 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 – 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our results showed that 12 weeks of VR-based rehabilitation enhanced cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Using VR applications in CR is recommended to improve cognitive functions of older adults with MCI.

Introduction

he older people are growing worldwide, leading to
increases in the incidence of chronic diseases such as
# T
neurological, orthopedic, psychiatric, and cognitive impairments.[1] Recent studies have shown that cognitive functions
are significantly affected in middle age and early old age.[2]

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), also referred to as the predementia stage, is one of the most common cognitive dysfunctions seen in the elderly population.[3] It is also a predictor
of numerous types of dementia. It was reported that 10%–15%
of older adults with MCI develop dementia every year.[4] The
prevention of MCI and dementia is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to develop rehabilitation approaches for
these disorders in the elderly population and to apply them,


especially in the early period, to protect and maintain independence in activities of daily living.[5]

Various rehabilitation approaches for cognitive dysfunction in older people with MCI have been described in the
literature, including focused restorative cognitive training,
focused compensatory cognitive training, comprehensive interventions that focus either on memory alone or on multiple domains, focused lifestyle interventions, and focused
activity-based interventions.[6] In addition to these approaches,
recent technological advances have enabled the use of interactive and immersive virtual reality (VR) applications in cognitive rehabilitation (CR).[7]

Introduced in the 1980s, VR is a simulation system in which
a sense of reality is created with a multisensory (visual, vestibular, etc.) effect via a human-machine interface system.[8,9]

Because motivation can wane in conventional rehabilitation
interventions, VR-based rehabilitation approaches may increase patients’ active participation and motivation during the
treatment process.[7] VR technology also offers therapists and
researchers benefits in terms of evaluation and research.[10] In
addition, the simulated environment of VR avoids adverse
events that may occur in the real environment, such as falls and
injury.[11] Thus, Larson et al.[12] stated that using VR in CR
processes is more effective than conventional evaluation and
interventions. A recent review evaluating VR-based interventions emphasized the need for further studies on the impact of
these interventions on cognitive functions.[7] Therefore, the aim
of this current study was to examine the effect of VR-based CR
on the cognitive functions of older adults with MCI.

Materials and Methods


This single-blinded, randomized controlled study investigated changes in the cognitive functions of older adults with
MCI after CR interventions with and without a VR component. The protocol used in this study was approved by the
University Ethics Boards and Commissions (permission
number: GO19/406). Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants before the study.

Participants


2020 were screened. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age between
65 and 75 years; (2) MCI diagnosis; and (3) ability to understand and follow verbal instructions. Exclusion criteria
were: (1) secondary chronic disease that may affect cognitive
functioning; (2) auditory and visual problems that may affect
rehabilitation implementation and communication; and (3)
attending any rehabilitation program (physiotherapy, speech
therapy, psychotherapy, etc.) during the study period. Based
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two subjects were
excluded due to participation in another rehabilitation program. The remaining 64 participants were randomized to
either the CR group (control) or the CR+VR group by using a
computer-generated randomization technique. The allocation process was carried out by the third author of this study
(S.P.). Two participants from the CR+VR group and one
participant from the control group were excluded from the
study, because they could not adhere to the frequency of the
study intervention. Therefore, the study was completed with
a sample of 61 older adults (Fig. 1).

Measurement


Sixty-six older adults who presented to the occupational
therapy department of a public university between 2019 and


Demographic information of the participants was collected, including their age, sex, education level, and marital
status. All participants underwent cognitive function assessment by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric (LOTCA-G) twice, once before
the intervention and again after the 12-week intervention.
These evaluations were done by the second author (S.Sx.), who

was blinded to the group allocation process and did not know
that VR intervention was performed in the study.

The LOTCA-G


The LOTCA-G is a cognitive assessment tool adapted for
the older population.[13] This 24-item test is widely used by
occupational therapists and evaluates 8 cognitive areas: orientation, visual perception, spatial perception, motor praxis,
visuomotor organization, thinking operation, memory, and
attention/concentration. Items in each subtest are assessed on
an ordinal scale from 1 to 4 except for the orientation items,
which are evaluated from 1 to 8. A higher score indicates
better cognitive performance. The LOTCA-G discriminates
between healthy older adults and those with dementia and
MCI. It is sensitive to levels of dementia and identifies
changes over time.[14]

Interventions


The recommended duration for VR and CR interventions
is 10–12 weeks, administered two or three times a week.[6,7,15]

According to this information, we planned both interventions
in this study to be performed in 45-minute sessions twice a
week for 12 weeks. Both the CR and VR programs were
carried out by the first author of the study (B.T.).

CR intervention


2. Jet Run is a racing game in which the player’s avatar
is controlled by jumping and body movements. The game
requires attention/concentration, visual-spatial perception,
visuomotor organization, reaction time, and orientation.
3. Superkick is a penalty shootout game that requires orientation, attention/concentration, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, contralateral perception,
cognitive time management (racing against time), and
reaction time.
4. Air Challenge is a skydiving game in which the player
passes through checkpoints and circles. The player controls the game in which the avatar moves in the opposite
direction with body and shoulder movements (participant
moves his arm to the right, the avatar goes to the left,
etc.). In addition to the similar requirements listed for the
other games, this game also requires mirroring.

As all the games involved similar cognitive function requirements, they were all offered to the participants to encourage motivation and participation.


Based on the eight cognitive subtests in the LOTCA-G, the
authors designed a CR intervention procedure consisting of
two parts.
Week 1–8: Each of the first 8 weeks featured interventions for one of the cognitive domains of the LOTCA-G
(attention/concentration, memory, orientation, visual perception, spatial perception, visuomotor organization, praxis, and
thinking operation).
Week 9–12: The last 4 weeks of the CR program included
interventions involving all of the cognitive functions.

VR intervention


Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with SPSS version 22.0 statistical software package program. Data are presented as mean – standard
deviation. Normality of the data was analyzed by using
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between groups were
analyzed with chi-square test for nominal data. Comparisons
between the groups were conducted by using Mann–Whitney U
test. Pre- to post-intervention changes within the groups were
analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Significance was
evaluated at levels of 0.05. Effect size was calculated by using
the means and standard deviations of the groups. Effect size
benchmarks were determined as <0.30, 0.30–0.80, and >0.80
and considered small, moderate, and strong, respectively.[16]


The Microsoft Kinect for PC program without immersion
was used in the VR-based intervention. Kinect has a system
that detects the 3D movements of the participants. The interventions were carried out in a 20-m[2] room with the participants 1.5 m from the viewer (65-inch flat-screen LED
screen television). During VR activities, the floors were
padded to prevent injuries as the participants were standing.
The intervention involved four different games that can be
played with Kinect and purchased commercially in the online
system. First, all authors except the second author independently observed each game to determine what cognitive functions were required to execute the games successfully. After this
evaluation, meetings were held to discuss and reach a consensus
regarding these requirements. The cognitive function requirements of the four games were determined as follows:

1. Boxing Trainer is a game in which the player that controls
two boxing gloves punches pads at different sides of the
screen and requires orientation, attention/concentration,
visual-spatial perception, reaction time, visuomotor organization, visual and spatial perception, and cognitive
time management (racing against time).


Results

Mean ages of the CR group (n = 31) and CR+VR group
(n = 30) were 70.30 – 2.73 years (range 5–7 years) and
70.12 – 2.57 years (range 66–74 years), respectively (P > 0.05).

Discussion

This study examined the effect of VR-based rehabilitation
on cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. According
to the results of our study, 12-week CR and CR+VR interventions had positive effects on cognitive functions, but the
CR+VR group showed greater improvement in the areas of
visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, orientation, thinking operation, and attention/concentration than the
CR group.
Orientation involves multidimensional cognitive functions and is the first affected in diseases such as MCI and
dementia.[17] Kim et al.[18] reported that orientation deteriorated with increasing age in the elderly population. Hofmann
et al.[19] showed that orientation skills were impaired in older
adults with Alzheimer’s disease and MCI and that 12 sessions of VR-based applications (involving the real local and
social environments of the participants and applied with the
interface system) resulted in greater improvement in orientation compared with the control group. Similar to this study,
we found that the CR+VR group showed more improvement
in orientation skills than the CR group. A possible explanation for this result is that VR settings may elicit orientation
functions more than the normal environment for older adults.
In a study investigating visual processing skills in MCI,
Krajcovicova et al.[20] detected impairments in the visualspatial perception and visuomotor task pathways, which they
interpreted as supporting the view that MCI is a transition
stage before Alzheimer’s disease. They also emphasized that


-----

these connection changes are task specific; that is, they are
located in the regions that were activated during the execution
of a visual task. Haque et al.[21] stated that visual-spatial perception and visuomotor functions are worse in older adults
with MCI compared with their healthy peers, and likewise
stated that many areas in the brain actively work together for
these functions. In their mini-review, D’Cunha et al.[7] emphasized that VR-based interventions have positive effects on
cognitive functions. They stated that VR applications actively
engage visual functions due to the intensity of the simulation
and have an immersive effect. In this study, the CR+VR group
showed better performance in visual-spatial perception and
visuomotor functions after the intervention. This may be a
result of the intense visual stimuli in VR applications and the
integration of visual and motor functions in the VR setting.
Apraxia is caused not only by poor motor execution skills
but also by the loss of information about the correct use of
objects.[22–25] Shaver[26] showed that praxis skills gradually
deteriorated in individuals aged 65 and older and demonstrated the necessity of well-designed and effective rehabilitation programs for the protection of praxis. The researcher
also noted that praxis skills have varying activations in
the frontal, premotor, and parietal cortex, suggesting that it
would be beneficial to create more personalized and effective
rehabilitation programs.[26] Although an increment in motor
praxis skills was observed in both groups in our study, the
CR group showed more improvement in praxis compared
with the CR+VR group. The reason for this may be that the
VR setting used in our study did not include motor imitation,
utilization of objects, or symbolic action sections, which are
under motor praxis. We believe that VR scenarios that include these sections should be developed for use in rehabilitation interventions.
Petersen[3] reported that one of the first cognitive components they looked at when diagnosing elderly people with
MCI was memory and that most elderly individuals’ complaints consisted of forgetfulness, confusing names, and
forgetting their address. The researchers showed the importance of implementing VR-based CR intervention approaches for improving memory in people with MCI.[27,28]

Contrary to these results, our findings did not support the
superiority of VR-based CR over standard CR techniques.
Again, this may be attributed to the VR scenarios used in this
study, which did not include memory-related parameters. In
contrast, the VR-based interventions mentioned earlier involved scenarios focused on memory.[27,28] Therefore, we think
that in VR-based interventions, adapting the presented scenarios according to the affected cognitive function of the participant will provide a greater therapeutic effect.
Andersen defined the executive function areas as attention control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and information processing.[29] The thinking operation domain of the
LOTCA-G evaluates this executive function. AndersonHanley et al. showed that cognitive training on a tablet while
cycling on a stationary bike (Neuro-exergaming) supports
executive function.[30] Similarly, we observed better performance in this area in our CR+VR group. The VR setting
that we implemented included ranking, categorizing, planning,
attention/concentration, maintaining and completing the game,
visual-spatial perception, and visuomotor skills. This may explain the greater improvement in the CR+VR group compared
with the CR group.


The LOTCA-G also has an attention/concentration section.
Petersen[3] reported that cognitive functions such as executive
attention/concentration, visual-spatial perception, and executive function are frequently affected in older adults with
MCI. Manera et al.[31] showed that attention/concentration
areas were affected in these patients, and there was more improvement in the attention/concentration skill in the VR group
with randomized controlled immerse cognitive training. In
our study, there was an increase in attention/concentration
scores in both groups, but the CR+VR group improved more
compared with the CR group. We believe that this difference
occurred, because the games in our VR-based intervention
focused heavily on attention and concentration. We are of the
opinion that games that enhance attention/concentration
functions can be used to effectively promote cognitive functions in older adults.
There are several limitations to this study that deserve
comment. First, although the cognitive test we used included
many cognitive parameters, the lack of cut-off value required
us to interpret the participants’ cognitive function levels. The
second limitation is that the VR setting is standard and could
not be graded for the individual subjects. We recommend
further studies to compare games with different challenge
levels and scenarios. Despite these limitations, older adults
with MCI who completed 12 weeks of VR-based CR showed
greater improvement in orientation, visual perception, spatial perception, visuomotor skills, thinking operation, and
attention/concentration scores when compared with the nonVR CR group. The VR-based rehabilitation approach provides support for CR interventions in older adults with MCI,
and it is appropriate for research and clinical interventions
targeting cognitive functions in this population.
