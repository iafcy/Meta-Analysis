**ABSTRACT**
**Objectives: This pilot study was intended to evaluate the effects of active game play on cognition,**
quality of life, and depression for older people with dementia.
**Methods: Thirty-eight older people with dementia were recruited. Eighteen people received eight-**
week active game play using Xbox 360 Kinect. Twenty people received their usual care. The Mini
Mental State Examination, Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease and Cornell Scale for Depression in
Dementia were used to measure the outcomes.
**Results: The results showed that there was no significant improvement on the mean scores of Mini**
Mental State Examination (P = .252), however, the active game play increased the mean score of
Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (P = .005), and reduced the mean score of Cornell Scale for
Depression in Dementia (P = .001) in comparison with the usual care group.
**Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the active game play was effective in improving quality**
of life and alleviating depression in older people with dementia.
**Clinical Implications:** Findings highlight the potential for gaming as a non-pharmacological
interventions for older people with dementia.

**Background**

Dementia represents a collection of symptoms that
are caused by brain disorders. It is usually chronic and
involves progressive deterioration in cognitive and
daily functions (“2019 Alzheimer’s disease facts and
figures,” 2019). Dementia does not only cause diffi­
culty in performing activities of daily living, such as
eating, dressing, and toileting (Cornelis, Gorus, Van
Schelvergem, & De Vriendt, 2019), but also has a
significant impact on the quality of life (Kisvetrová
et al., 2021). Behavioral and psychological symptoms
of dementia (BPSD) and depression can cause rapid
decline in function, earlier institutionalization and
increasing mortality (Khundakar & Thomas, 2015).
Managing dementia requires substantial amount of
human and economic resources worldwide, including
medical and nursing care, pharmacological manage­
ment, and informal daily living care by family mem­
bers. These impose substantial societal and economic
costs (Cantarero-Prieto, Leon, Blazquez-Fernandez,


Juan, & Cobo, 2019). Therefore, dementia is a grow­
ing public health concern associated with the aging
population.

As there is no medical cure to stop or reverse the
progress of functional decline in dementia, an
increasing scientific and community interest has
been focused on non-pharmacological interven­
tions to improve or at least to maintain cognition
and quality of life for people with dementia
(Cabrera et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015).
Neuroplasticity is the ability of the human brain
to adapt to environmental changes by modifying
neural connectivity and brain function (Knaepen,
Goekint, Heyman, & Meeusen, 2010). Studies have
indicated that even older people with dementia still
maintain a certain level of neural plasticity
(Spironelli, Bergamaschi, Mondini, Villani, &
Angrilli, 2013). This provides hope to improve
their cognition through rehabilitation training
(Spironelli et al., 2013).

Because playing games requires mental concen­
tration, intelligence, memory, and quick reaction
(Cohen, Firth, Biddle, Lewis, & Simmens, 2009;
Fenney & Lee, 2010), Anguera et al. (2013) suggest
that games can be used for cognitive training of
people with dementia. Games, in general, are fun
and delightful. They can reduce loneliness, invoke a
sense of accomplishment, and cultivate positive
mood (Lin, Cao, & Gao, 2015; Manera et al.,
2015). Recently, there is increasing use of active
game play to provide various therapies in virtual
environments under simulating conditions. These
therapies take the advantages of active games in
combining the fun of gameplay with physical exer­
cise (Ackerman, Kanfer, & Calderwood, 2010;
Saenz-de-Urturi, Garcia-Zapirain, & Zorrilla,
2014), physical exercise has a therapeutic effect on
cognition by delaying hippocampal neurodegen­
eration in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
(Huttenrauch et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2014).
Moreover, active games provide immediate perfor­
mance feedback, such as encouragement com­
ments, bonuses; and music, which is interactive
and motivational, and active games have the flex­
ibility to offer various activity levels, and allow
playing in different postures, either standing, or
sitting (Chao, Scherer, & Montgomery, 2015).
These make active games suitable for players with
different levels of game play experience and physi­
cal condition.

There are some pioneer experiments with active
game play for people with dementia. For example,
Dove et al. (2019) used Xbox Kinect as a group
activity for people with dementia, this qualitative
study found that people with dementia can learn to
play active games and enjoy doing so. Yamaguchi
(2011) examined the effects of video-sports games
on cognition, visuospatial and constructive func­
tions, and behavior in people with dementia (n = 9).
Two types of games were used in their program:
one working on the upper limb, another working
on the lower limb. The former required a player to
catch coins which appeared to be flying out of the
screen. The later required a player to move legs to
the music rhythm. The gaming was provided once a
week for 10 weeks. It was shown that the active
game play can lead to improvement in the partici­
pant’s cognition, visuospatial, and constructive
functions. While, the sample size of this study was


small (n = 9), the duration of the game session and
the baseline characteristics of the participants have
not been reported. Swinnen et al. (2021) explored
the physical, mental, and cognitive effects of an
active game with “Dividat Senso” device in com­
parison with watching preferred music videos (con­
trol group) for people with major neurocognitive
disorder living in long-term care facilities. For the
experiment period was 8 weeks. The gaming group
had improvement in depression than the control
group as measured by Cornell Scale for Depression
in Dementia (CSDD). Their quality of life was also
improved despite the changes did not reach statis­
tically significant level in comparison with the con­
trol group as measured by Dementia Quality of Life
questionnaire.

Due to poor study design and small sample size
in the aforementioned studies, to date, there is a
lack of sound evidence to support the positive
effects of active game play on cognition, quality of
life, and depression for older people with dementia.
Therefore, this study aims to close this knowl­
edge gap.

We will test the following hypotheses:

H1: The active game play will result in higher Mini
Mental State Examination scores compared to the
control group and baseline after 8 weeks.

H2: The active game play will result in lower
Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia scores
compared to the control group and baseline after
8 weeks.

H3: The active game play will result in higher
Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease scores com­
pared to the control group and baseline after 8
weeks.

**Methods**

**_Study design and setting_**

An eight-week pilot/trial was conducted with
randomized, comparative design. Participants
were randomly allocated to a gaming (exercise)
group and a usual-care (control) group (see
Figure 1). This trial was conducted at Huafeng

community, in Hangzhou city, P.R.China. The
study site was selected for prior knowledge
with the study population and rapport with the
management team from a well-established,
ongoing research collaboration (Zheng & Chen,
2017).

**_Ethics and consent_**

Ethics approval was acquired from the Hangzhou
Normal University Ethics Committee (reference
number: +86-0579-28,865,576). The study aim,
plan, methods and communication of results
were presented to and approved by the manage­
ment of the participating organization.

Written informed consent was obtained from
the participants and/or their primary caregivers
prior to their inclusion in the study. For those
participants who had lost the capacity to provide
written consent, the process model of consent
was applied (Dewing, 2007). This included iden­
tifying a representative, usually a relative or pri­
mary caregiver, for consent. Further information
was gathered about the participant’s possible
means of signaling consent (e.g. personal beha­
vior). The presence or absence of such signals
was monitored during training to gauge the per­
son’s consent.


**_Sample size_**

The sample size was calculated based on the results
of a previous study conducted in the same popula­
tion with the same outcome measures reporting the
average difference in a participant’s Mini Mental
State Examination (MMSE) score to be 2.75 with a
standard deviation (SD) of 2.175 (Chen, 2013). We
added 20% of allowance for dropouts (Tarraga et al.,
2006; Zhuang et al., 2013). With the significance level
(α) set at 0.05 and test power (1-β) at 0.80 (onesided), the minimum sample size should be 31 peo­
ple (Friedman, Furberg, & DeMets, 2010). Finally,
we recruited 48 people allowing for attrition.

**_Participants_**

The criteria for inclusion were aged over 60 years,
with medical diagnosis of dementia by a qualified
specialist in geriatric medicine or psychiatry; hav­
ing basic listening and comprehension ability;
CSDD score below 8 (Ru-Jing & Gang, _2008) and_
giving written consent for participation in the study
by themselves or their primary caregivers.

The criteria for exclusion were bedridden, severe
hearing or visual impairment to impede basic com­
munication, having acute delirium or confusion,
terminal illness, or other disease known to affect
the brain function or cognitive function, such as


-----

Parkinson’s disease or brain tumor, or were cur­
rently participating in another clinical trial or
gaming.

**_Recruitment strategies_**

The Huafeng community runs a senior day care
center and a nursing home, which was owned by
the municipality government. Day care center
offers care and supervision for older people during
day time. As the study was conducted at these two
sites in the same community, we sent fliers and
advertised the study and recruitment process in
press releases, as well as requesting referral by
health care providers in the day care center. 19
people were recruited 9 consented via proxy. The
study participants in the nursing home were
referred by the nursing manager. With the approval
of the management, the researcher sought further
consent from the family member and the older
people. Only after written consent was provided
by the family member and oral consent was given
by the older person, did the project proceed further,
with 29 people recruited from the nursing home, 7
of them consenting via proxy.

We interviewed each participant using the
MMSE and health history form under the compa­
nion of the family caregiver. If the person’s MMSE
score was below 26, and had a medical diagnosis of
dementia from a medical doctor, the person would
be considered as study participant. However, only
after further screening using the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, would the person be formally
recruited into the pilot trial.

**_Method of randomization_**

Each eligible person was randomly assigned to
either exercise or the control group according to a
random number list. The list was generated with
SPSS 19.0 by a statistician who was not directly
involved in the study.

**_Blinding_**

After completing the baseline data collection, each
old person was randomized into the exercise group
or the control group. To avoid allocation bias, the
research staff conducting the outcome assessment


was blind to the allocation of the participant group.
All participants were informed that they would
have the opportunity to play the game; the control
group could play the game after the intervention
was completed.

**_Intervention_**

The length of intervention in the previous studies
ranged from 1 day to 10 weeks, the duration of
gaming varied from 5 min to an hour (Zheng,
Chen, & Yu, 2017). The optimal efficacy was 8
week intervention period. Therefore, we designed
the gaming to be offered 1 h/day, 5 days/week for
8 weeks. The box Kinect system was selected for the
active game as it was considered feasible for use by
this population. The game system consists of a
Kinect sensor and a console. The console controls
the game. First, a participant was asked to sit in a
chair that was located 1 to 1.5 m away from the
Kinect sensor. The position of the sensor was
adjusted to ensure optimal capture of the person’s
position and motion by the infrared camera in the
sensor (Park, Lee, Lee, & Lee, 2017). The training
was provided by a nursing researcher in a group of
five to six participants. After the initial training, the
participants started to play. Each participant played
the game for 10 minutes each time.

The Kinect game Fruit Ninja was selected as the
exercise intervention to train the person’s hand-eye
coordination and motor skills. In the game, a player
was faced with a variety of fruits flying in all direc­
tions on the screen. The task for the player was to
use their upper arm as an imaginary sword to cut
the fruits before they dropped to the bottom of the
screen. This required the player to focus attention
on the fruits amidst distractors, and act rapidly
upon viewing the targets. Points were awarded for
each successful cut. Bonus points were given if
several fruits were cut with one slashing motion.
To standardize the length of play, the game was set
to last 1 min before a bomb was exploded. A pome­
granate would appear at the end of each game. The
player could slash it multiple times to win bonus
points. If the sword touched the bomb, the player
would be penalized 10 points.

In each session of the game, a researcher accom­
panied a participant to record the person’s score
and playing time. Motivational suggestions were


-----

given, such as paying attention to the score of the
last game, trying to beat it and to achieve a personal
best. The participants also talked and joked with
each other, sharing experiences of playing and
achievements in scores, and competing with each
other in a joyful environment. Upon the appear­
ance of any sign of fatigue, or any abnormalities in
breathing, the game play was immediately stopped.
To prevent a fall in the process of play, a participant
could choose to take the standing position or sitting
in chair.

The study did not interfere with the participants
existing pharmacological treatment or nursing care.
The participants in both groups received their usual
care.

**_Outcome measures_**

The assessment scores on cognition, quality of life,
and depression for a participant were measured
before and after 8 weeks of intervention. All mea­
surements were performed by one third-year uni­
versity nursing student who received training on
these tasks.

Cognition was measured by Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE). MMSE (Folstein, Folstein,
& McHugh, 1975) is the most widely used clinical
assessment of cognitive function. The Chinese ver­
sion has been translated, modified and validated by
Katzman and colleges (1988), and it has been tested
in a Chinese population (Li, Jia, Yang, & Moreau,
2016; Yu et al., 1989) and found to have excellent
reliability and validity (test re-test was 0.91, α was
0.99) (Katzman et al., 1988). The Chinese version of
the MMSE consists of 30 questions in six domains,
including orientation, registration (repeating
named prompts), attention and calculation, recall,
language skills, and visuospatial construction.
MMSE is scored from 0 to 30. The higher score
indicates better cognition. The test for the MMSE
indicated a good overall alpha (0.73).

Quality of life was measured by the Quality of
Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD) (Legouverneur,
Pino, Boulay, & Rigaud, 2011). QoL-AD has 13 items
covering the domains of physical health, energy,
mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage,
friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around


the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and
life as a whole. QoL-AD is scored from 13 to 52; the
higher score indicates better QoL.

Depression was measured by the Cornell Scale
for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) (Chen, 2013).
CSDD is designed for assessment of depressive
symptoms in older people with dementia. It con­
sists of questions on mood-related signs, behavioral
disturbance, physical signs, cyclic functions, and
ideational disturbance. Items are rated from 0
(absent) to 2 (severe) or symptom not possible to
evaluate. A higher overall score indicates severe
symptoms. The reliability of the Chinese version
of CSDD was validated with Cronbach’s alpha
being 0.81 (Ru-Jing & Gang, 2008).

**_Data analysis_**

The data included in the analysis were collected
from the participants who completed both preand post-intervention measurements. All statistical
analyses were performed in SPSS19.0. As the data
for age, MMSE, QoL-AD, and CSDD were contin­
uous data, a t-test was used for within-group ana­
lysis and between-group analysis if the data was
normally distributed. Otherwise a Mann–Whitney
u-test was conducted. If the baseline data were
categorical data, i.e., male and female, χ[2 ] test was
used for comparison. Difference was considered as
significant if _p_ < .05. The sizes of within-group
differences and between-group differences were
measured by calculating effect size (Cohen’s _d)_
and the following intervals were applied for inter­
pretations: 0.2–0.5 representing a small effect size;
0.5–0.8 representing a medium effect size; and 0.8
and higher representing a large effect size (Cohen,
1988; Morris & Deshon, 2002).

**Results**

**_Participant flow_**

Eighteen out of 24 participants in the exercise
group completed the study. Six people dropped
out; three suffered from poor physical health, one
had no time to continue, and two did not give a
reason. The daily attendance rate of the 18 partici­
pants in the exercise group was 100%. Twenty

participants in the usual care group completed the
study; four dropped out without explanation. There
were no study-related adverse events reported by
the participants, nor observed by the research team.
There were no significant between-group differ­
ences in demographic variables and the MMSE,
QoL-AD, and CSDD scores at the baseline (see
Table 1).

**_Effectiveness of intervention on outcomes_**

Pre- and post-intervention comparisons of each
group, between groups comparisons are shown in
Table 2. After the intervention no significant
between-group differences were found for the
overall MMSE score (P = .252). The MMSE
score of the exercise group showed a positive
trend of improvement after the intervention,
while did not reach statistically significant (P =
.247). Therefore, hypothesis H1 was not sup­
ported. However, the exercise group had signifi­
cantly higher levels of quality of life (P = .023)
and lower levels of depression (P = .000) after the
intervention. There was no within-group differ­
ence in the control group. A statistically signifi­
cant difference between groups was found on
quality of life (P = .005) and lower levels of
depression (P = .001) after intervention.
Therefore, hypothesis H2 and H3 were supported.


**Discussion**

The effects of active game play on older people with
dementia was evaluated in this study. After receiv­
ing eight-week gaming, no significant change in
overall cognition was found. This was different
from a previous meta-analysis finding that video
gaming can improve several dimensions of cogni­
tion in healthy older people, i.e., improving reac­
tion time, attention and memory (Toril, Reales, &
Ballesteros, 2014). This might be because the eightweek training period was not long enough, or the
intensity level of exercise was not high enough.
Another explanation may be that the MMSE mea­
surement may not be sensitive enough in detecting
changes in cognition in a short eight week period,
although it has been widely used to effectively test
the intervention effect on cognition for detecting
dementia (Creavin et al., 2016). Cheung et al.
(2019) administered a Cognitive Stimulating Play
intervention on people with dementia for 8 weeks.
Their intervention included batting a balloon, mak­
ing handicrafts and card games. The intervention
improved cognition as measured by Montreal
Cognitive Assessment. In contrast to Cheung et al.
(2019), we only provided one type of game; there­
fore, the outcome may not be as effective.

Significant improvement in quality of life and
depression were achieved in the exercise group.
Therefore, the positive effects of active game play
on quality of life and depression in older people
with dementia was validated in this study. This
contributes much needed knowledge to support
the potential inclusion of active game play into
the non-pharmacological rehabilitation treatment
for people with dementia.

QoL-AD measurement has been reported to be
very useful for assessing quality of life for older
people with dementia (Li et al., 2016). In the train­
ing group, the QoL-AD score was significantly
improved after the intervention, and in comparison
with the control group. This may be attributed to
the active game play incorporating both socially
and cognitively pleasant, competitive activities
with physical activities. These can increase social
interaction and improve mood for older people
with dementia (Chiang, Tsai, & Chen, 2012), as
seen in a significant improvement in the mood

score. Similarly, Yoon et al. (2013) found that an
intervention combining cognitive training with
active physical exercise can improve QoL of older
people with dementia. Cahill and Diaz-Ponce
(2011) suggest that social contact and pleasurable
activity have significant positive impacts on
patients’ QoL as the game creates a distraction
from the mind on illness, thus can block the dete­
rioration of QoL in older people with dementia
(Castro-Monteiro et al., 2016). Furthermore, the
process of participating in the game provided the
older people with a sense of self-achievement.
These may have all accounted to the significant
improvement in overall QoL-AD score, and in par­
ticular the scores for mood and friends after the
eight-week gaming, as well as in comparison with
the usual care group.

Depression is common among older people with
dementia. It is associated with rapid cognitive and
functional decline and increased caregiver burden.
To date there is a lack of attention and strategy to
manage this unavoidable symptom of dementia.
Swinnen et al. (2021) found that an exergaming
program can reduce depression of people with
major neurocognitive disorder. Loneliness and
lack of social support are associated with depres­
sion (Hermida, McDonald, Steenland, & Levey,
2012; Santini et al., 2016). Situating in a group
setting undoubtedly increased social interaction
for the participants who were in the gaming.
Motivational feedback such as the encouraging
remarks made by the group members and the sup­
porting researcher could make the participants feel
respected, boost self-esteem, and gain a sense of


identity. The real-time, visual, and audio emotional
support and performance feedback from the game
were also fun and appealing, evoking a sense of
meaning and self-actualization. There is no doubt
that the game was effective in relieving depression
for these older people with dementia.

**Limitations**

Four limitations are identified for this study. The
first is the convenience sampling and confined sam­
ple size that may reduce generalizability. Due to a
lack of rigorous prior research for this study to refer
to, the sample size calculation was based on a small
study conducted with similar participants but with
different MMSE score. This may lead to the sample
size calculation being less accurate. Second, most of
the participants were receiving drug treatment and it
was not appropriate to ask them to quit since the
study was performed in a naturalistic setting; there­
fore, the finding could be compounded by dementiarelated medications. As the participants were accom­
panied by a researcher in the entire process gaming
process, the effect of the amenable social interactions
with a young, friendly female nurse cannot be
ignored in explaining the findings. Third, the study
was limited to one community in Hangzhou which
may limit generalizability to other groups and as the
gaming was situated in a group setting, it is also
possible that the improvements in quality of life
and depression in acquired in our study was attrib­
uted to social interaction. Fourth, further follow-up
assessment, outcome assessment after a longer per­
iod, i.e., half or one-year intervention, may increase


-----

the rigor of the findings. Further comparative study
between gaming and other group intervention are
needed to investigate the impact of the social factor.

**Clinical implications**

The eight-week group active game play led to
improvements in quality of life and reduction in
depression for the older people with dementia. This
supports its potential inclusion into the non-phar­
macological interventions for older people with
dementia.

**Achnowledgements**

We would like to thank all participants and their career for
their dedication to this project. We are grateful for the support
and help provided by the facility management and staff for the
conduct of this project.
