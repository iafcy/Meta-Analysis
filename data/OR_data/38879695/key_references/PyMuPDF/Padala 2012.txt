Objectives. To determine the eﬀects on balance and gait of a Wii-Fit program compared to a walking program in subjects with mild
Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Methods. A prospective randomized (1 : 1) pilot study with two intervention arms was conducted
in an assisted living facility with twenty-two mild AD subjects. In both groups the intervention occurred under supervision for
30 minutes daily, ﬁve times a week for eight weeks. Repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests were used to analyze changes.
Results. Both groups showed improvement in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti Test (TT) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) over 8
weeks. However, there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups over time. Intragroup analysis in the Wii-Fit
group showed signiﬁcant improvement on BBS (P = 0.003), and TT (P = 0.013). The walking group showed a trend towards
improvement on BBS (P = 0.06) and TUG (P = 0.07) and signiﬁcant improvement in TT (P = 0.06). Conclusion. This pilot study
demonstrates the safety and eﬃcacy of Wii-Fit in an assisted living facility in subjects with mild AD. Use of Wii-Fit resulted in
signiﬁcant improvements in balance and gait comparable to those in the robust monitored walking program. These results need
to be conﬁrmed in a larger, methodologically sound study.
1. Introduction
Falls are common in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) and lead
to signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality [1]. Compared to
cognitively intact older adults, patients with AD have a
threefold increase in falls causing fractures, hospitalization,
and increased rate of institutionalization [2]. Poor balance
and gait abnormalities seen in AD such as shortened step
length, increased stride length variability, and decreased gait
speed are risk factors for falls [3, 4].
Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in the
elderly [5, 6]. Even low-intensity exercises are useful in im-
proving balance and gait in deconditioned elders [7]. How-
ever, it is diﬃcult to engage patients with AD in long-term
exercise programs. Barriers to exercise programs include
but are not limited to lack of motivation, limited access to
exercise facilities, and high cost of exercise programs [8].
Exercise programs are most eﬀective if they are easy to access
and perform. Walking, for example, is a popular activity and
the most commonly recommended home-based exercise for
the elderly [9]. Likewise use of readily available technologies
might enhance exercise adherence because of their easy
access, user friendly interface, and ability to provide high
level of engagement at an aﬀordable price. While oﬀ-the-
shelf gaming technologies lack speciﬁcity, they have the
advantage of mass accessibility, broad aﬀordability, and the
potential for in-home use. Wii-Fit, a Nintendo gaming
console, is one such ready-to-use technology that provides

self-directed activity through a TV [10]. The components
include yoga, strength training, aerobics, and balance games.
Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while
tracking their progress and providing visual and auditory
feedback.
The primary goal of our study was to compare the eﬀect
of the Wii-Fit program to a walking program on balance and
gait in subjects with mild Alzheimer’s dementia living in an
assisted living facility. To our knowledge there are no such
previous studies.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design, Setting, and Participants. A prospective
randomized study with two intervention groups was con-
ducted in an assisted living facility after obtaining approval
from Institutional Review Board (IRB). All subjects signed
a written assent while their legal surrogates signed a written
informed consent. Subjects aged 60 years and older residing
in an assisted living facility with a medical chart document-
ing a history of mild AD along with a Mini Mental State
Examination score ≥18 (upper limit 29) were included in the
study. Individuals were excluded for the following medical
problems: myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack
or stroke in the previous 6 months, serious mental illness
which impacted memory, active cancer diagnosis with the
exception of skin cancer, poor prognosis for survival (e.g.,
severe congestive heart failure), severe sensory (visual or
auditory) or musculoskeletal impairments, or a required use
of a wheel-chair for ambulation. However, subjects using
canes or walkers were included in the study. The walkers
wrap around the Wii balance board so they used the walker
while exercising.
2.2. Study Intervention. Subjects were randomized using a
random number generator to either the Wii-Fit intervention
group or the walking group. The goal was for subjects in both
groups to participate in the activity for 30 minutes daily, ﬁve
times a week, for 8 weeks. The Nintendo Wii-Fit console was
connected to a mobile television unit which was transported
daily to the exercise area of the assisted living facility.
Research personnel set up and navigated the Wii-Fit console
and software, and the subjects performed the exercises. All
subjects walked down from their rooms to the exercise area to
do Wii-Fit and walked back to their rooms after the exercise.
This walk from and to the room was included as a warm-up
and cool-down exercise. Similarly, the walking group walked
to the start point to begin their walking exercise and the walk
from and to their room was included as warm-up and cool-
down exercise.
Based on the physical therapists recommendation, we
encouraged patients to do exercises from each group of
the Wii-Fit program that included strength training, yoga,
and balance games. The Yoga exercises included the half-
moon, warrior pose, chair, and sun salutation. Strength
training included single leg extensions, lunges, and torso
twists. Balance exercises included soccer heading, ski slalom,
ski jump, table tilt, balance bubble, and penguin slide. Since
one third of the participants used some kind of assistive
device, the aerobic exercise such as the running and step
activity of the Wii-Fit were not used per recommendation
of the physical therapist. The Wii-Fit intervention was an
individual exercise program wherein subjects exercised one
on one with help from research personnel. In the Wii-Fit
group, all subjects spent 10 minutes on yoga, 10 minutes
on strength training, and 10 minutes on the balance games.
This was standardized across all the participants. They were
allowed to rest only if they became unduly fatigued. The
walking arm walked at their own pace as a group of 3 or
4 subjects at any given time with research personnel. Again
subjects were allowed to rest if they became unduely fatigued.
All walking was done indoors. Subjects in both groups
were monitored closely during participation to ensure their
safety.
2.3. Outcome Measures. Demographic and anthropometric
data were recorded. The primary outcome measure was the
Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Tinetti Test (TT) and the Timed
Up and Go (TUG) were also measured. The BBS [11] is
a valid and reliable measure used to assess balance impair-
ments in elderly, either statically or while performing various
functional movements in a clinical setting. The BBS consists
of 14 subsets of tasks with each task scored on a ﬁve-
point scale (0–4) according to the quality or the time of
the performance. A score of “0” indicates the lowest level of
function while “4” indicates the highest level of function. The
maximum score is 56, and a score of less than 45 is predictive
of falls. The TT [12] is scored on the patient’s ability to
perform speciﬁc tasks. Scoring is done on a three-point
ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2. The individual scores
are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait
assessment score, an overall balance assessment score, and a
gait and balance score. The TUG [13] test is widely employed
in the examination of elders as a basic test for functional
mobility. The TUG score measures speed and represents the
time taken to rise from the chair, walk 3 meters, turn, walk
back, and sit down. The BBS, TT, and TUG were performed
by the same physical therapist.
The secondary outcome measures measured were func-
tional ability, quality of life, and cognition. Functional ability
was measured by activities of daily living (ADL) [14], and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) [15]. ADL
assesses a subject’s independence in performing basic tasks of
daily living such as bathing, eating, and toileting, while IADL
assesses the subject’s independence in performing hierarchi-
cal activities, such as preparing meals, handling ﬁnances, and
using telephone. The higher the score of ADL and IADL,
the better the functional state of the subject. Quality of life
was measured by the Quality of Life-AD (QOL-AD) [16].
The QOL-AD is a 13-item scale which assesses patient’s
physical condition, mood, interpersonal relationships, ability
to participate in meaningful activities, ﬁnancial situation,
and overall assessment of self and quality of life as a
whole. Cognition was measured by the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) [17].
2.4. Statistical Analysis. The data were analyzed using SPSS
(version 17.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Each variable was analyzed and was found to have a normal
distribution. Demographics and comorbidities were pre-
sented using descriptive statistics. Independent sample t-
tests were used to test for intergroup diﬀerences at baseline.
In the primary analyses, repeated measures analyses of
variance (RM-ANOVA) were used to determine if there was a
signiﬁcant group by time interaction for any outcome when
comparing the Wii-Fit and the walking groups over the three
time points of the study, baseline and weeks 4 and 8. An
alpha value of 0.5 was used to indicate signiﬁcance. Post-hoc
analyses using paired t-tests were performed on each group
to determine within subject changes between the baseline
and postintervention values. Data were analyzed with intent-
to-treat analyses. For subjects who did not complete the
study, the last data were carried forward to week 8.
3. Results
After completing the baseline assessments, subjects (N = 22)
were randomly assigned to either the Wii-Fit Intervention or
the walking group (N = 11 each). Study recruitment and
participation are illustrated in Figure 1. One subject in each
group completed just 4 weeks of the study. The subject in the
Wii-Fit group voluntarily withdrew while the subject in the
walking group was discharged from the facility to his home.
There were no adverse events related to the study. However,
unrelated adverse events occurred for several subjects. Two
subjects’ sustained falls (one from each arm), but these
events did not occur during the intervention and did not
require an emergency room visit or hospitalization. They
continued to exercise without any diﬃculty. One subject was
hospitalized for small bowel obstruction which resulted in
the subject being much weaker and requiring the use of a
walker upon return to the study. Two subjects (one from each
arm) developed viral gastroenteritis and were quarantined
for a total of four days, two days of which were their
exercise participation days during which time they could not
participate in the exercise activities.

between these groups for any of the variables listed. There
were also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups for the
number of comorbidities present, medications prescribed, or
for the need of assistive walking devices. About a third of the
subjects used an assistive walking device. The total time of
participation in the study interventions (used as an indicator
of compliance) was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the
Wii-Fit and walking groups (Table 1). The Wii-Fit and walk-
ing were well accepted by the participants. They reported
enjoying Wii-Fit exercises. The most common reasons for
not participating in exercise activities included other sched-
uled activities such as ﬁeld trips, bus rides, crafts and deco-
rations, family visits, and doctor’s appointments.
The mean BBS score in both groups was less than 45
indicating that the subjects were at high risk for falls. The
mean BBS score improved to more than 45 in both groups
with intervention. BBS improved signiﬁcantly over time for
both groups (P = 0.0001). However, there were no signif-
icant group-by-time interactions on the measures of BBS
(P = 0.56). There was also no signiﬁcant group-by-time
interactions on the measures of TT (P = 0.97) and TUG
(P = 0.52) (Table 2). Intragroup analysis of the Wii-Fit
group showed signiﬁcant improvement on measures of BBS
(average improvement 6.27 ± 5.27, P = 0.003), and TT
(average improvement 1.82 ± 2.04, P = 0.013) (Table 2).
Scores on TUG improved with Wii-Fit but did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance (average improvement −0.82 ± 2.56,
P
= 0.31) (Table 2). Intragroup analysis of the walking
group showed a trend towards improvement on the BBS
(average improvement 5.27 ± 7.36, P = 0.06) and TUG
(average improvement −2.1±3.45, P = 0.07) and signiﬁcant
improvement on TT (average improvement 2.0 ± 1.89, P =
0.006) (Table 2). The mean BBS improved nonsigniﬁcantly
over the ﬁrst 4 weeks in both groups, however the walking
group plateaued from week 4 to 8 while the Wii-Fit group
continued to improve (Figure 2). There was no signiﬁcant
group-by-time interaction on measures of functional state,

4. Discussion
This study shows that the use of Wii-Fit is feasible in an
assisted living environment in elderly patients with mild
dementia. Those in the Wii-Fit group readily accepted and
enjoyed participating in the exercise program. The mean
baseline BBS score in both groups was less than 45 indicating
that all the subjects were at high risk for falls. There were
no study-related adverse events reported during the interven-
tion. Thus the use of Wii-Fit was also safe and feasible in sub-
jects at high risk for falls. The mean BBS score improved to
more than 45 in both groups with intervention. These results
demonstrated that the Wii-Fit program was as eﬀective as the
robust monitored walking program in improving balance,
gait, and physical performance in subjects with mild AD.
Our results are consistent with the published literature
about the impact of Wii-Fit exercises on balance and gait
in the elderly. In a previous study conducted in an elderly
population, improvement in balance (BBS score) and an
increase in walking speed were noted with the use of the
balance games component of Wii-Fit [18]. In another study
conducted on nine elderly patients, an improvement in
balance as measured with the BBS was seen along with a
decreased risk of falls after ﬁve-week use of Wii-Fit [19]. In a
study conducted by Williams et al. on community-dwelling
fallers over 70 years, improvement in balance (BBS score)
was noted in the Wii-Fit group while no improvement in
balance scores was noted in the standard care group [20].

In a study conducted in long-term care, residents reported
positive experiences playing Wii and rated Wii bowling as
a favorite recreational activity [21]. In a small study of 7
patients with AD, Yamaguchi et al. found that use of Video
games was beneﬁcial on cognitive and behavioral scales [22].
Our study is diﬀerent from the above-mentioned studies
in that we had a robust arm of a monitored walking program.
A typical drawback to walking interventions is the lack of
compliance with the recommendation. We overcame that by
having the participants walk as a group with research person-
nel. This ensured that they walked regularly. On average, the
walking group had greater exercise compliance (i.e., walked

Journal of Aging Research
5
longer than the Wii-Fit intervention time) although this
diﬀerence in time did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. This
could explain why the Wii-Fit intervention in our study failed
to separate from the walking arm. Nonetheless, subjects in
the Wii-Fit arm improved as well as the walking arm. People
may adhere more to the Wii-Fit intervention since it has been
engineered to be socially engaging and entertaining. Wii-Fit
is enjoyable, easily accessible, and is not limited by a safe place
to walk. One technical diﬃculty was encountered while using
the Wii-Fit that might have reduced the eﬀectiveness of the
intervention. In the version of the Wii-Fit used in this study,
the actual time spent on exercising was less than the half hour
allotted because switching between the exercises consumed
time. On an average, only about 22 of the 30 minutes were
spent exercising. An upgrade in the newer software, Wii-
Fit Plus [23], helps subjects customize and personalize a
workout to suit their own needs. They can create their own
routine exercises and save them in “my routine exercise”
folder which can be accessed in sequence, thus saving time.
Future studies will need to determine if this new system
improves outcomes.
Unlike the aforementioned studies, we utilized multiple
components of the Wii-Fit program such as yoga, strength-
ening, and balance games in the current study. This approach
is supported by ﬁndings from a recent Cochrane review [5].
It found that exercise interventions resulted in statistically
signiﬁcantly greater improvements in balance compared to
usual activity. Furthermore, interventions involving multiple
domains such as gait, balance, coordination and functional
exercises, muscle strengthening, and multiple exercise types
appeared to have the greatest impact on indirect measures
of balance [5]. In another study, gait exercises resulted in
improved dynamic balance and gait function [6]. Since our
primary outcome measure was that of balance (BBS), a better
outcome may be obtained if we speciﬁcally targeted balance
exercises.
The major strength of the study is the study design, a
randomized trial comparing the widely available video game
to walking, the most commonly used exercise strategy in the
elderly. Limitations of the study include, but are not limited
to, the small sample size and inclusion of the BBS as the
primary outcome measure which is prone to a ceiling eﬀect,
particularly in subjects with higher levels of balance. Other
limitations include nonblinded assessors, lack of a usual care
control group, and failure to strictly control the intensity
of the exercises in each group. The study intervention was
also highly monitored and facilitated by the research staﬀ.
Having the groups led by peers or having the subjects exercise
independently might make the results more translatable to
clinical practice.
Future studies could control for the intensity of the exer-
cise by measuring perceived level of exertion, total number
of exercises conducted or distance traveled per session, or
other parameters. Inclusion of more sophisticated methods
for testing balance and gait such as biomechanical assessment
might help avoid the ceiling eﬀect of the BBS [24]. The newer
version of the Wii-Fit, the Wii-Fit Plus, may be a better tool
given its wider variety of exercises and the ability to program
the amount of time spent in exercising. Using Wii-Fit in a
group setting might have social beneﬁts, which could result
in greater improvement in quality of life measures.
5. Conclusion
This pilot study demonstrates the safety and eﬃcacy of using
Wii-Fit in an assisted living facility in subjects with mild
AD. Use of Wii-Fit resulted in signiﬁcant improvements in
balance and gait, and these beneﬁts were comparable to
those experienced by the subjects who participated in the
robust monitored walking program. These results need to
be conﬁrmed in a larger, methodologically sound study.
Such a study should probably employ peer-led, family-led,
or independently conducted exercise interventions, more
sophisticated methods of testing for gait and balance and
valid techniques to control the intensity of the interventions.
