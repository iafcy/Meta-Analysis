Abstract
Background: Despite increasing interest in the effects of exergaming on cognitive function, little is known about its effects on
older adults with dementia.
Objective: The purpose of this is to investigate the effects of exergaming on executive and physical functions in older adults
with dementia compared to regular aerobic exercise.
Methods: In total, 24 older adults with moderate dementia participated in the study. Participants were randomized into either
the exergame group (EXG, n=13, 54%) or the aerobic exercise group (AEG, n=11, 46%). For 12 weeks, EXG engaged in a
running-based exergame and AEG performed a cycling exercise. At baseline and postintervention, participants underwent the
Ericksen flanker test (accuracy % and response time [RT]) while recording event-related potentials (ERPs) that included the N2
and P3b potentials. Participants also underwent the senior fitness test (SFT) and the body composition test pre- and postintervention.
Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to assess the effects of time (pre- vs postintervention), group (EXG vs AEG), and
group×time interactions.
Results: Compared to AEG, EXG demonstrated greater improvements in the SFT (F1.22=7.434, P=.01), reduction in body fat
(F1.22=6.476, P=.02), and increase in skeletal mass (F1.22=4.525, P=.05), fat-free mass (F1.22=6.103, P=.02), and muscle mass
(F1.22=6.636, P=.02). Although there was a significantly shorter RT in EXG postintervention (congruent P=.03, 95% CI
13.581-260.419, incongruent P=.04, 95% CI 14.621-408.917), no changes occurred in AEG. EXG also yielded a shorter N2
latency for central (Cz) cortices during both congruent conditions compared to AEG (F1.22=4.281, P=.05). Lastly, EXG presented
a significantly increased P3b amplitude compared to AEG during the Ericksen flanker test (congruent: frontal [Fz] F1.22=6.546,
P=.02; Cz F1.22=5.963, P=.23; parietal [Pz] F1.22=4.302, P=.05; incongruent: Fz F1.22=8.302, P=.01; Cz F1.22=15.199, P=.001;
Pz F1.22=13.774, P=.001).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that exergaming may be associated with greater improvements in brain neuronal activity and
enhanced executive function task performance than regular aerobic exercise. Exergaming characterized by both aerobic exercise
and cognitive stimulation can be used as an effective intervention to improve cognitive and physical functions in older adults
with dementia.

Introduction
Executive function is a family of at least 3 different functions
that include the maintenance and execution of target tasks by
suppressing interference factors during information processing
[1]. Execution function is not a single structure but can be
divided into (1) a core (inhibition, renewal/working memory,
and conversion) and (2) a higher level (planning/solving
problems) that depends heavily on the frontal lobes [2,3].
Executive dysfunction often represents age-related cognitive
decline and dementia, which are also associated with a declining
ability to independently maintain activities of daily living [4-6].
Indeed, dementia-related deficits in executive function cause
fatal impairment in activities in daily living in older adults [7,8].
Neural activity during executive function tasks can be measured
using electroencephalography (EEG) to record event-related
potentials (ERPs) during neuropsychological task performance.
The Eriksen flanker test, the Stroop task, the Go/No-go task,
and Trail Making Test B are commonly used in
neuropsychological test batteries to assess executive function.
In the ERP component, N2 is a negative potential that appears
200 ms after stimulation, while P3b is a positive potential that
appears 300-600 ms after stimulation [9,10]. N2 is a negative
peak before P3b and is related to the measurement of executive
function and attention [11]. P3b reflects the update of working
memory [12]. It has been known that older adults with dementia
have a smaller N2 amplitude [11], a longer N2 latent period
[13], and a smaller P3b amplitude, as well as a longer P3b latent
phase [14,15], compared to their cognitively intact counterparts.
Previous studies have reported that cognitive training and
exercise have salutary effects on the improvement of executive
function [16-19]. For example, cognitive training promotes
enhanced executive function, learning ability, and memory [20].
In addition, both acute and chronic exercises have beneficial
effects on executive function and neural efficiency in older
adults [19,21-23]. Despite evidence linking cognitive and
exercise training with neurocognitive health, few studies have
evaluated the joint effects of cognitive and exercise training in
older individuals with dementia. Exergaming has the
characteristics of both cognitive (ie, auditory and visual
stimulation) and exercise training (ie, motor-sensory stimulation)
[24,25]. However, the effects of exercise on cognitive and brain
function have been mainly tested in older adults with intact
cognition. Thus, little is known about the effects manifested by
exergaming on older adults with dementia.
In addition, previous studies using exergaming have shown that
exergaming not only improves executive function and cognitive
processing but also reduces the risk of falls in older adults
[26-30]. Nevertheless, previous findings focused on older adults
with intact cognition; thus, the effects of exergaming on older
adults with dementia remain largely unexplored. Moreover,
little is known about the effects of exergaming on the neural
responses during executive function in older adults with
dementia. Evidence suggests that virtual reality–based exercise
intervention increases P3 and N2 amplitudes and decreases N2
latency, suggesting improvement in cognitive processing in
older adults [31]. Furthermore, exercise provides beneficial
effects in reducing the risk of decreased physical function, such
as balance [32-34], gait [34], and mobility [35], and poor
muscular power and functional capacity [32,36]. Given the
exercise training component of exergaming (ie, aerobic and
strength capacities), we postulated that exergaming may be
effective in not only cognitive function but also in physical
function. Hence, this study investigated the effects of
exergaming on cognitive and physical functions in older adults
with dementia. We also compared the effects of exergaming
and traditional forms of aerobic exercise on cognitive and
physical functions.
Methods
Participants
We recruited 52 sedentary older male and female adults with
mild or moderate dementia from 2 daycare centers in Busan,
South Korea. All participants were diagnosed with dementia
determined by their primary care physician and had
comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, prior to
participating in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) age≥65 years, (2) Korean Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE-K) score=15-23, (3) diagnosis of probable dementia
based on comprehensive neuropsychological testing (Korean
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
[CERAD-K] test battery), and (4) ability to perform physical
exercise and daily life (Korean Activity of Daily Living
[K-ADL]).
Sample Size
Initially, the study population comprised 52 participants, who
were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the exergame group (EXG,
n=26, 50%) and the aerobic exercise group (AEG, n=26, 50%);
see Figure 1. However, 13 (50%) EXG participants were lost
to follow-up at 4 weeks (2, 15%, hospitalizations; 8, 62%, moves
to other daycare centers; and 3, 23%, refusals to exercise). From
AEG, 15 (58%) participants dropped out during the intervention
(3, 20%, hospitalizations; 1, 7%, fall; and 11, 73%, refusals to
exercise). Therefore, the data of 13 (50%) EXG participants
and 11 (42%) AEG participants, who completed the 12-week
exercise program, were included in the data analysis for this
study.
The sample size was calculated using a sample size calculation
software program (G*Power version 3.1.9.2 for Windows), with
an effect size of 0.58, a statistical power of 0.80, and a statistical
level of significance of .05. The effect size was calculated from
previous studies [37]. As a result, the sample size for each group

was established at 20 patients, so we decided to recruit 52
patients for each group, considering a potential 30% dropout
rate.

Ethical Considerations
All participants completed a written informed consent form
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National
University (PNU IRB/2018_59_HR).
Design
This study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial, which
was conducted at 2 daycare centers in Busan, South Korea.
Randomization was administered by a person who was not
involved in this study using computer-generated random
numbers. Outcome measurements were performed pre- and
postintervention by a blinded assessor with 3 months of clinical
experience.
Exercise Training Interventions
All participants in both EXG and AGE underwent 2 weeks of
a familiarization period before starting the 12-week intervention.
The frequency of both exergaming and aerobic exercise was 3
days/week. The intensity of both groups was 60%-70% of the
heart rate reserved (HRR) and was gradually increased (ie, 30
minutes for weeks 1-2, 35 minutes for week 3, 40 minutes for
weeks 4-5, 45 minutes for weeks 6-7, and 50 minutes for weeks
8-12). Table 1 presents the details of the exercise protocol. All
participants’ heart rates (HRs) were measured during exercise
using HR monitors (Polar RS400sd, Madison Height, MI, USA).
The HRR was calculated using the Karvonen formula [38]. EXG
performed aerobic exercise using ExerHeart devices (D&J
Humancare, 
Busan, 
South 
Korea) 
equipped 
with 
a
running/jumping mat (950 width × 1300 depth × 1700 height);
see Figure 2A. ExerHeart is an intelligent exercise management
service developed by experts in medical and exercise science.
We used a game called Alchemist's Treasure, which is a running
game based on the Talesrunner IP co-developed with ExerHeart
(Figure 2B). During the game, players run with the avatar,
avoiding obstacles, and win items while running or jumping at
speed on the mat (Multimedia Appendix 1).
AEG performed a cycling exercise using the commercial
recumbent cycle EGOJIN 704 (China). The initial bicycle
resistance was 0 Kp, and the exercise intensity was increased
by 1 Kp every 5 minutes. Different resistance values were used
for males and females during exercise to account for the
sex-related difference in cardiorespiratory fitness and lower
body strength (eg, males: weeks 1-3 up to 3 Kp, weeks 4-12 up
to 4 Kp; females: weeks 1-3 up to 2 Kp, weeks 4-12 up to 3
Kp).

Outcome Measures
Eriksen Flanker Test
A modified version of the Eriksen flanker test was used to assess
executive function [39]. We used the computerized Eriksen
flanker test using the built-in software of the EEG analyzer
(Telescan). Participants were positioned about 1 m in front of
the computer screen. Each trial began with a 1500-9500 ms
fixation blank screen, followed by a precue (500 ms) consisting
of dashed lines to indicate that the stimulus was about to appear.
Each flanker stimulus was presented for 500 ms, followed by
a 1500 ms response window. In each trial, participants were
instructed to press buttons with the left or right index finger in
the direction of a centrally positioned target arrow as quickly
and accurately as possible. The central arrow (called the target)
was always flanked by a set of 2 irrelevant arrows on each side
(called the flankers); the target and flankers pointed either in
the same direction (congruent signal, “< < < < <” or “> > > >
>”) or in opposite directions (incongruent signal, “> > < > >”
or “< < > < <”). A total of 280 targets consisting of 140
interstimulus intervals, 80 congruent signals, and 60 incongruent
signals were presented to each participant. The Eriksen flanker
test was conducted before and after the 12-week exercise
intervention.
Electroencephalographic Measurements
EEG activity was recorded during the modified Eriksen flanker
test using a computerized polygraph system with a 31-channel
Poly G-A (LAXTHA, Daejeon, South Korea). Ag-AgCl
electrodes were placed on frontal (Fz), central (Cz), and parietal
(Pz) cortex areas, according to the International 10-20 system.
Midline locations were referenced to link earlobe electrodes.
Horizontal and vertical electrooculograms were monitored by
electrodes placed above and below the left eye and at the outer
canthus of both eyes, respectively. The impedance of all
electrodes was maintained below 10 kΩ. The bandpass filter of
the amplifier was 0.3-30 Hz, the sampling rate was 1000 Hz,
and a notch filter was at 60 Hz.
The stimulus-locked epochs acquired for the Eriksen flanker
test were extracted offline from 200 ms before and ending 1500
ms after the stimulus onset, and the period from –100 to 0 ms
before stimuli onset was used as the baseline. Peak amplitudes
and latencies were measured automatically. The N2 and P3b
peak amplitudes and latencies were measured in the difference
waves of the attended condition. The N2 component was defined
as the largest positive peak occurring between 180 and 315 ms
after stimuli, and the P3b component was defined as the largest
positive peak occurring between 300 and 600 ms after stimuli.
EEG data were collected before and after the 12-week exercise
intervention.
Senior Fitness Test
The senior fitness test (SFT) consists of 5 items: (1) upper and
(2) lower body muscle strength test (arm curl test/30-second
chair stand test), (3) upper and (4) lower body flexibility test
(back 
scratch 
test/chair 
sit-and-reach 
test), 
and 
(5)
cardiopulmonary endurance test (2-minute step-in-place test).
The SFT items used in this study were as follows:
•
Arm curl test: counting the number of full curls in 30
seconds, holding a 3.6 kg weight on the hand for men and
2.3 kg for women
•
30-second chair stand test: counting the number of full
stands in 30 seconds with arms folded across the chest
•
Back scratch test: assessing whether one hand can reach
over the shoulder and the other hand in the middle of the
back and measuring the distance in centimeters (+ or –)
between extended middle fingers
•
Chair sit-and-reach test: performing a sitting pose in front
of a chair, with 1 leg extended and hands reaching as far
as possible toward the toes, and measuring the distance in
centimeters (+ or –) between extended fingers and the tips
of the toes
•
2-minute step-in-place test: standing up straight next to a
wall, while a mark is placed on the wall at a level
corresponding to midway between the patella (knee cap)
and iliac crest (top of the hip bone), marching in place for
2 minutes by lifting the knees to the height of the mark on
the wall and counting the total number of times the right
knee reaches the tape level.
The SFT was administered before and after the 12-week exercise
intervention to examine physical fitness.
Body Composition
The body composition in terms of the BMI, percentage of body
fat, bone mass, fat-free mass, and muscle mass was measured
using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) system InBody
S10 (Seoul Biospace Ltd., Korea). These measurements were
performed after participants rested in the supine position for 10
minutes. All participants did not eat or exercise for 3 hours
before the test and did not drink alcohol or caffeine for 24 hours.
Statistical Analysis
We performed per protocol analyses using linear random effects
models for each outcome measure. We performed the
Shapiro-Wilk test to assess whether the data were normally
distributed. The Eriksen flanker test (ie, accuracy rate and
response time [RT]) and ERP (ie, N2, P3b amplitudes) data
were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA to determine
group (EXG vs AEG) × time (pre- vs postintervention)
interactions. We also used the paired t test (or Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) to examine the changes of each dependent
variable after the intervention within each group. Bonferroni
post hoc analyses were performed when there was a significant
difference. Partial η2
p was used to assess the effect size. The
statistical significance was set at α=.05. All statistical tests were
conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24.0).
Results
Participants
Of 52 participants, 13 (25%) patients in EXG (n=5, 38%, males
and n=8, 62%, females) and 11 (21%) patients in AEG (n=3,
27%, males and n=8, 73%, females) completed the 12-week
exercise program. Demographic and physical characteristics of
all subjects are provided in Table 2. Although there was a
significantly greater body fat percentage in AEG compared to

Eriksen Flanker Test Performance
There was no significant group×time interaction in the Eriksen
flanker test congruent and incongruent accuracy and RT.
However, EXG had a significantly shortened congruent RT
postintervention (mean 1602.6 ms, SD 433.8 ms, vs mean
1465.6 ms, SD 412.5 ms, t12=2.419, P=.03, 95% CI
13.581-260.419), while the RT for AEG did not change (mean
1454.6 ms, SD 550.0 ms, vs mean 1311.9 ms, SD 402.4 ms,
t12=2.340, P=.31, 95% CI –151.794 to 437.067); see Figure 3A.
Similarly, the incongruent RT was significantly shortened in
EXG (mean 1675.4 ms, SD 511.3 ms, vs mean 1463.6 ms, SD
331.4 ms, t10=1.079, P=.04, 95% CI 14.621-408.917) but not
in AEG (mean 1506.5 ms, SD 578.3 ms, vs mean 1275.6 ms,
SD 407.7 ms, t10=1.525, P=.16, 95% CI –106.529 to 568.347);

Event-Related Potential Data
N2 Component
Tables 3 and 4 show congruent and incongruent N2 amplitude
and latency data, respectively. Figure 4 shows the waveforms
of congruent and incongruent N2 amplitudes pre- and
postintervention. There was no significant group×time
interaction in congruent and incongruent N2 amplitudes in Fz,
Cz, and Pz cortices. However, EXG had a significantly increased
congruent N2 amplitude in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices
postintervention, whereas AEG showed no significant changes.
For the incongruent N2 amplitude in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices,
there were no significant changes in both EXG and AEG.
However, there was a significant group×time interaction in
congruent N2 latency in the Cz cortex but not in Fz and Pz
cortices. EXG showed a significantly shortened congruent N2
latency in the Cz cortex postintervention, but AEG did not. Both
EXG and AEG demonstrated no significant changes in
congruent N2 latency in Fz and Pz cortices postintervention.
For incongruent N2 latency in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices, there
was no significant group×time interaction. In addition, both
EXG and AEG did not show a significant change in incongruent
N2 latency in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices postintervention.

P3b Component
As shown in Tables 3 and 4, there were significant group×time
interaction effects in both congruent and incongruent P3b
amplitudes in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices. EXG showed a
significantly increased congruent P3b amplitude in Fz and Cz
cortices postintervention but not in the Pz cortex. However,
there was no significant change in the congruent P3b amplitude
in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices in AEG postintervention. Similarly,
EXG showed a significantly increased incongruent P3b
amplitude in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices postintervention, but AEG
did not. However, there were no significant group×time
interaction effects in both congruent and incongruent P3b
latency in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices. In addition, both EXG and
AEG did not show a significant change in incongruent P3b
latency in Fz, Cz, and Pz cortices postintervention. The
waveforms of congruent and incongruent P3b amplitudes in Fz,
Cz, and Pz cortices for EXG and AEG pre- and postintervention
are shown in Figure 4.
Senior Fitness Test
The results of SFT in EXG and AEG postintervention are shown
in Figure 5. There were significant group×time interaction
effects on cardiopulmonary endurance (F1.22=7.434, P=.01,

2-minute steps postintervention (mean 52.6, SD 5.5 times/2
minutes, vs mean 73.8, SD 15.8 times/2 minutes, t12=–4.791,
P=.001, 95% CI –30.775 to –11.533), but AEG did not show a
significantly change. Similarly, there were significant
group×time interaction effects in lower body strength
(F1.22=6.451, P=.02, η2
p=0.227). EXG showed a significant
increase in the number of full stands 30 seconds postintervention
(mean 10.5, SD 1.6 stands/30 seconds, vs mean 14.2, SD 3.6
stands/30 seconds, t12=–4.688, P=.001, 95% CI –5.408 to
–1.976), whereas AEG showed no significant change. For lower
body flexibility, there was no significant group×time interaction,
but EXG showed a significantly reduced distance between
extended fingers and the toes postintervention (mean –3.5, SD
3.6 cm, vs mean 0.4, SD 3.7 cm, t12=–4.391, P=.01, 95% CI

distance (mean –2.4, SD 4.2 cm, vs mean 1.5, SD 3.7 cm,
t10=–3.341, P=.01, 95% CI –6.364 to –1.272). For upper body
strength and flexibility, the group×time interaction was not
significant, and neither EXG nor AEG showed a significant
change.

Discussion
Principal Findings
This study investigated the effects of an exergame and aerobic
cycling on executive and physical functions in older adults with
dementia. We found a significantly shorter Ericksen flanker test
congruent and incongruent RT in the response to exergame
training. Moreover, exergaming generally yielded larger
increases in neural activities that are related to attention and
working memory and greater enhancement in lower body muscle
strength and cardiorespiratory endurance compared to aerobic
exercise.
A shorter Ericksen flanker test RT following exergame training
in both congruent and incongruent signals in the study indicates
the greater facilitation of executive function. In our previous
findings, both exergaming and treadmill exercise resulted in a
significantly shorter Stroop task RT in patients with metabolic
syndrome through improvements in basic information processing
and executive function suppression control [40]. Another study
reported that combining physical and cognitive stimulation in
8 weeks of multimodal exercise substantially improves
information processing speed in older adults [41]. Collectively,
participating in aerobic exercise training improves information
processing speed in older adults regardless of the exercise
intensity and type. Consistent with the results of these previous
studies, the results of this study showed that exergame training
results in a significant improvement in information processing
speed, suggesting that auditory, visual, and motor sensory
stimulation during exergaming may accelerate information
processing speed in older adults with dementia. Although there
was no significant interaction between the group and the
intervention in this study, there was no significant change in
the Ericksen flanker test RT for AEG. Thus, we cannot rule out
the possibility that exergaming has greater beneficial effects on
information processing speed than general aerobic exercise,
which should be further clarified in future longitudinal studies
with a larger sample size.
In this study, exergame training significantly increased the
congruent N2 amplitude in Fz and Cz cortices and reduced
latency in the Cz cortex. Distinguishing stimulus and cognitive
processes are closely related to attention during the tasks [42].
Hwang et al found reduced N2 activation in the central lobe and
occipital cortex after acute aerobic exercise [43]. Similarly, a
decreased N2 amplitude and longer N2 latency were observed
during exercise [44]. We previously reported an increased N2
amplitude in response to exergame training, suggesting that
exergaming effectively increases selective attention by
regulating the activities of the central and occipital cortices [40].
Performing exercise in a virtual environment also increases the
N2 amplitude and reduces latency [31]. These changes in brain

activity indicate that exercise with extra-environmental
stimulation may promote better decision-making (frontal and
central areas) and visual perception (occipital areas). In this
context, using cognition-stimulating games may facilitate the
ability to clearly distinguish stimuli by activating the cerebral
cortex with visual and auditory stimuli, thereby promoting
cognitive processes. Therefore, our findings suggest that
exergaming improves attention by effectively promoting
neuronal activity in older individuals with dementia.
Furthermore, considering that the N2 latency after exergaming
was shorter than that after aerobic exercise, and the congruent
N2 amplitude and latency did not change with aerobic exercise,
it is still possible that exergaming may have a greater effect on
neural activity related to executive function and attention
compared to a simple form of aerobic exercise.
We also found a greater increase in congruent and incongruent
P3b amplitudes after the exergame than after aerobic exercise
in the study. This suggests that exergaming may yield greater
effects on working memory than a simple mode of aerobic
exercise. Tsai et al reported that performing resistance training
for 12 months is associated with maintaining the capacities for
allocating attention, as measured by the P3b amplitude in healthy
older males [45]. Our previous investigation also found that
aerobic exercise and resistance exercise have positive effects
on neuronal activation, especially on the P3b amplitude in young
adults [46]. Additionally, exergaming improves categorization
of the incoming information and updating the context of working
memory, as measured by the P300 amplitude in patients with
metabolic syndrome [40]. Taken together, both exercise and
exergaming induce brain activity through visual perceptual
stimuli and activate nerve cells in the brain to promote
information processing related to stimuli judgment and
decision-making. Together, our findings elucidate that
exergaming can be a more effective intervention in improving
the classification of input information and working memory in
the elderly with dementia compared to general aerobic exercise.
A recent meta-analysis showed that interventions combining
both physical and cognitive training improve cognitive function
than physical training alone [47], and our previous study
supports the results of the meta-analysis [40]. In turn, better
executive function is thought to be supported by healthy lifestyle
interventions, including physical activity [48]. It is also
important to note that exergaming showed greater improvements
in lower body muscle strength and cardiorespiratory endurance
compared to aerobic exercise. During the Alchemist Treasure
game in the ExerHeart device used in this study, participants
had to continuously walk or adjust their body position. These
constant body movements throughout the game may also have
resulted in improvements in their cardiorespiratory endurance.
Our results are consistent with a previous study showing that
the exergame program effectively improves cardiopulmonary
endurance and leg muscle strength in healthy middle-aged and
older adults [49]. In addition, lower body strength is closely
related to cardiopulmonary endurance [50], and aerobic exercise
improves repetitive muscle contraction and cardiopulmonary
endurance and enhances everyday abilities, such as climbing
stairs or sitting and standing up from a chair [51]. Therefore,
exergaming may be an effective exercise for improving the
lower body muscle strength and cardiorespiratory endurance of
older adults.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is the first to address the neuropsychological effects
of exergaming in older adults with dementia. Meanwhile, the
12-week well-supervised exergame program effectively
increased executive and physical functions in older adults with
dementia. Therefore, our intervention protocol can be used in
hospital settings or regional dementia centers to improve
physical and cognitive functions in older individuals with
dementia.
The study also had a few limitations. First, our study did not
have a nonexercise control group, warranting some caution in
the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, pre-post test
designs are commonly used to assess the effectiveness of
intervention over time, and our results are consistent with other
exercise intervention studies that have shown significant
interventional effects in older adults with dementia. Thus, it is
not likely that our results simply reflect the passage of time or
other nonspecific intervention effects. Second, we had a
relatively small number of participants (N=24) and
homogeneous characteristics (eg, all Asians). As a result, the
statistical power may be lower in this study, but at least to
compensate for this problem, the effect sizes were calculated
as references. Third, the MMSE score was measured only at
baseline and was missing postintervention. Finally, since our
study was limited to using only a single exergame, it is necessary
to verify the effectiveness of other games. Therefore, these
limitations may need to be supplemented in future studies.
Conclusion
This study shows that exergaming is an effective approach to
improve executive and physical functions in older adults with
dementia. Therefore, regular participation in exergaming can
be suggested as an effective alternative to aerobic exercise for
treatment and early prevention of dementia in older adults.
Future studies need to replicate our results using a nonexercise
control group and a large number of participants.
