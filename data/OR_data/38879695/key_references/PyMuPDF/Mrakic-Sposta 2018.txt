The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and
the efﬁcacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive
stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative
stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement
of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of
a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive
training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged
73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4)
were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or
control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive proﬁle, by a neuropsychological tests
battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before
and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients’ opinions
toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed
a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and
visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater
improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal ﬂuency.
No statistical signiﬁcance was obtained when comparing within and between both
the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which ampliﬁes the
effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening
of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real
life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS
(i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA)
decreased resulting in signiﬁcantly (range p < 0.05–0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group.
Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and
suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, a dramatic increase of the incidence of age-related
disorders due to the rise in average life-span has been recorded.
One of the most common age-related pathologies is Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which often represents a transition
from healthy aging to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a devastating
neurodegenerative disorder so far without a cure.
MCI patients report a cognitive decline characterized by
symptoms such as impaired memory, attention, orientation and
executive functions, which however do not interfere remarkably
with daily life activities.
Recently
developed
brain
plasticity
theories
and
findings about the cellular synapses reconstruction ability
of
nervous
system
due
to
interaction
with
enriched
environments have spurred new researches. As a consequence,
cognitive rehabilitation interventions adopting non-invasive
non-pharmacological
treatments
have
gained
growing
attention (Ferrucci et al., 2008; Cotelli et al., 2012; Kim
et al., 2016; Marceglia et al., 2016; Chiu et al., 2017). The
therapeutic goal of cognitive training is oriented to stimulate,
restore or re-train the cognitive processes implied in the
initiation, planning and execution of activities of daily living
(ADLs), in order to reduce the side effects, maximize the
patient’s ecological autonomy and quality of life. Cognitive
training in MCI may stimulate pre-existing neural circuits
or prompt the recruitment of alternate neural pathways
prompting
neuroplastic
re-organization.
According
to
a
recent
meta-analysis
(Sherman
et
al.,
2017)
cognitive
interventions
adopting
memory-based
strategies,
targeting
multiple cognitive domains or using a multi-componential
approach
(i.e.,
targeting
lifestyles)
proved
effective
to
improve performances on cognitive outcomes for people
with MCI.
Besides, Alzheimer’s Association, based on a perspective
population-based study, has established that one of the strategies
to reduce cognitive decline risk and dementia development is
regular physical exercise (Baumgart et al., 2015). Improvements
in tests of executive function (Symbol Digit Modalities, Verbal
Fluency and Stroop) were shown in a large randomized trial on
aerobic exercise in MCI patients (Baker et al., 2010).
Furthermore, according to a recent systematic review
(Cammisuli et al., 2017) there are evidences that aerobic
exercise in MCI patients improves global cognition, logical
memory, inhibitory control and divided attention. Decrease in
oxidative stress (OxS) and increase in antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory capacity are some of the molecular mechanisms
underlining the beneficial effect of regular physical activity.
Indeed, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role by
means of detrimental effects linked to increased uncontrolled
production, evident in the development of neurodegenerative
diseases and particularly in AD (Tönnies and Trushina, 2017)
vs. essential neuroprotective cellular mechanisms based on the
concept of mitohormesis. The latter suggests that an exposure
to intermittent sub-lethal doses of ROS generated by exercise
could lead to a mitochondrial adaptation inducing mitochondrial
biogenesis and an antioxidant response. The development of
strategies to mitigate OxS in neurodegenerative diseases should
carefully consider these aspects.
One
major
issue
regarding
usual
neuro-rehabilitation
programs is represented by the transferability in real life of
the benefits obtained in the conventional therapeutic setting.
In recent years, ICT technologies, such as virtual reality (VR),
has become an increasingly used approach in neuroscience to
provide an ecologically valid treatment (Coyle et al., 2015). The
major features of VR are aimed at providing easy and intuitive
interaction and multidimensional sensory feedback, offering
the patient an opportunity to practice activities of daily living
that cannot occur in conventional rehabilitation programs,
through motivational activities facilitating treatment compliance
and customizable on the patient’s characteristics (Rizzo and
Kim, 2005; García-Betances et al., 2015b). Therefore, research
on VR applied to neurorehabilitation has recently flourished,
with increasing evidence of efficacy (Rizzo and Kim, 2005;
Serino et al., 2017; Anderson-Hanley et al., 2018; Tieri et al.,
2018).
Currently, there is limited but promising evidence on the
application of VR technologies in subjects with MCI or mild
dementia (Coyle et al., 2015).
In neuroscience, the computerized approach provided by
VR is used in order to allow interventions in a controlled
environment, able to monitor movement, cognitive and other
variables (García-Betances et al., 2015a). Recently, the attention
of clinicians and researchers in the field of MCI has been
attracted by motor and cognitive training based on VR, which
has emerged as an encouraging tool in many therapeutic and
rehabilitative domains (Rizzo and Kim, 2005; García-Betances
et al., 2015b). In a randomized controlled trial, Talassi et al.
(2007) compared the effectiveness of a computerized training
specifically developed to address different cognitive domains,
with respect to physical activity in a sample of patients with
MCI and mild dementia. Authors reported that significant
improvements of the patients’ cognitive and affective status
were obtained only in the group undertaking the computerized
program, indicating that non-punctual stimulation is not able to
elicit any effect.
This pilot study aims to evaluate the impact of an innovative
combined physical activity and cognitive training based on VR,
in MCI patients. The two main fields of investigation of this
multi-domain assessment are: (1) the effects of this intervention
on cognitive impairment and on OxS, assessed as indicator
of the disease progression and (2) the evaluation of the user

acceptability, with the final goal of verifying the potentialities of
this kind of approach in counteracting MCI evolution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Session
A controlled pilot study was carried out in 10 patients—4 males
(M) and 6 females (F)—aged ≥65 years, with: (a) one or more
test scores indicating a compromise of visuospatial abilities,
(b) one or more test scores indicating mild-moderate cognitive
impairment according to Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) criteria (Folstein et al., 1975; Magni et al., 1996a,b).
Exclusion criteria adopted were: cognitive and/or functional
impairment affecting the ability to participate in the study;
cardiovascular pathologies advising the undergoing a minimal
physical training; acute pain of lower back or extremities;
peripheral neuropathy; rheumatic and orthopedic diseases;
inability to provide informed consent. Moreover, each subject
who could potentially be enrolled had first to undergo
an assessment of risk factors (cardiovascular pathologies
and other co-morbidities) and an effort electrocardiogram
(ECG) to exclude pathologies that may cause harm to the
patients during the physical exercise. All decisions about
eligibility were made before the block-randomization, and
performed on the basis of cognitive decline and assessed
through psychometric tests. Participants were randomized to
an intervention (EXP) group (n = 5, 2M/3F) which underwent
the intervention or to a control (CTR) group (n = 5,
2M/3F), who received no treatment. Three MCI patients
and two patients with mild dementia (i.e., an impairment
of cognition that significantly affected instrumental skills
of daily life) were included in each experimental group.
Individuals participating in the study provided informed written
consent. This study was carried out in accordance with GCP
recommendations of the Ethical Committee of IRCCS Santa
Lucia Foundation, which approved the protocol (Protocol
Number: CE/PROG.524, 28/09/2015). All subjects gave written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
In order to verify the effects of the training, evaluations
were performed before (PRE) and at the end (POST) of
the experimental 6 weeks (see Figure 1). At these time
points, anthropometric measures, cognitive profile and collection
of blood and urine samples were carried out in both the
experimental and the control group. Moreover, at the same time
points, questionnaires to evaluate the treatment acceptability
were administered to the subjects in the intervention group.
Equipment
The implemented system was designed to allow MCI patients
to both perform physical exercise and train their cognitive
abilities while being supported by VR means. The three

virtual environments (VEs) developed enable to emulate the
performance of three activities of daily living (see Figure 2).
This choice has the aim of facilitating the comprehension
of the tasks for patients and of enhancing the transfer of
the acquired capabilities into real life. The three VEs thus
represented the following scenarios: (1) riding a bike in
a park, (2) crossing roads—avoiding cars and (3) grocery
shopping in a supermarket. The first scenario is dedicated
to the accomplishment of the physical exercise, whereas
scenarios (2) and (3) are designed to provide the cognitive
training. They all were developed using Unity3D. The hardware
devices composing the training system are a cycle-ergometer
(Cosmed EuroBike 320), a smart garment (Wearable Wellness
System, Smartex), for a real time measure of heart rate
(HR), a finger touch projector (EB-1430WI, Epson) and
a PlayStation controller anchored on the cycle-ergometer
handlebars (Sony).
VE developed in the first scenario (1) represents a trail in
a park in which the user can navigate by pedalling on the
cycle-ergometer. The path to follow is predefined to avoid the
user from getting lost or reaching the edges of the designed
scene; bends and slopes are smooth and have a large curvature
to reduce the occurrence of sickness as much as possible. To
increase the user’s presence in the VE, the realism of the
scene requires that the visual flow is synchronized with the
cycling velocity in real-time, when the wind is blowing the
tree leaves and grass move, wild animals appear on the trail
sides or in the sky. Realistic 3D sounds reproducing birds’
chirp and the wind have been are added to the scene too.
Indicators showing the bike velocity and revolutions-per-minute,
the user’s HR (measured thanks to the smart garment) and
the elapsed time are shown as on-screen text to provide the
patients with general information about the exercise and to
help them to maintain the right cycling speed (see Training
Protocol).
The second virtual environment (2) represents an urban
scenario that the patient is supposed to reach after the physical
activity performed in the park. In this scenario, the user—on the
cycle-ergometer—has to cross several traffic-congested crosses
by stopping on the edge of the sidewalk and checking if the
route is safe from moving cars. Cars are generated randomly and
move at different velocities. 3D sounds simulating an accident are
reproduced if a car hits the user while he/she is crossing. After
the accident, the user is brought in a safe-position and can restart
to pedal after a few seconds, when the cars disappear from the
cross. To brake and to turn the point of view, the patient has to
use the PlayStation controller: respectively, the X button and the
right joystick; to move toward the other side, he/she has to restart
cycling.
The third virtual environment (3) represents a supermarket.
Before entering, the user is shown a list of five grocery items
that he/she has to buy by touching the projected screen to make
his/her selection. The purchase of each item is performed by
completing two tasks: (3.1) selecting the right aisle and then (3.2)
picking the right product from the shelves. Five different levels
of difficulty were implemented for both tasks. The increase in
difficulty is obtained mainly by the increase of distractors and
of their similarity and by their position on the shelf. For the
aisle task, a further stimulus to promote language and attentional
training is obtained by the introduction of a word that is
orthographically or semantically similar to the target object name
(from Level #3). For the shelf task, higher levels are characterized
by the presence of different formats (Level #4) and discounted
versions of the same product (Level #5), so that the attentional
and visuospatial demands are increased.
The system intervenes if the user commits an error or does
not interact with the VE for more than 20 s (latency) and gives
him/her a hint to help in proceeding to the next task.
Training Protocol
The intervention group performed the physical and cognitive
training for 6 weeks, 3 sessions/week (18 sessions total). The
structure of VR-based training session, carried out in a quiet
room, was the same for each participant and lasted approximately
40–45 min long: 15 (for the first 3 weeks) or 20 min of cycling
in the virtual park, about 5 min to perform five crossroads
passing and 20 min of shopping at the supermarket. Before the
beginning of the training program, the participants were assisted
in a preliminary session so that they could familiarize with VR
technologies and learn how to interact within the three virtual
environments.

Rehabilitation in MCI
Cycling exercise intensity was set as to correspond to about
65%–70% of individual maximal HR, calculated on the basis of
the age-predicted value. During the training session, the patients
were instructed to keep the cycling velocity between 60 and
70 revolutions per minute; the cycle-ergometer workload was
continuously adjusted (thanks to a digital controller based on
a proportional-integral feedback mechanism) with the aim of
maintaining the target HR at a constant frequency.
Dealing with the supermarket scenario (3), after having
completed three subsequent shopping sessions making one
error at the most (or waiting once for more than 20 s),
the subject could move to the next level of difficulty. When
patients completed Level #5 for three times without committing
errors or latencies, the training was restarted from the first
level in which until he/she failed for the first time with the
list displayed on the screen. During this second cycle, the
shopping list was kept hidden with the aim of training patients’
memory too.
Assessment of Cognitive Response
An in-depth cognitive assessment was performed by a trained
neuropsychologist at PRE and POST intervention. Each subject
was assessed by the same evaluator at PRE and POST, in order to
avoid inter-rater variability effects.
The entire neuropsychological battery was composed by an
initial screening test for cognitive abilities (MMSE, Magni et al.,
1996a,b) and a subsequent extensive battery of specific scales for
each cognitive domain.
Episodic verbal memory was evaluated by Immediate Recall
and Delayed of Rey Auditory (RAVLT_I and RAVLT_D,
Carlesimo et al., 1996): in the RAVLT_I, a list of 15 words is
presented to the subject, which he/she has to memorize and
repeat. The task is repeated five times and the number of words
correctly recalled is recorded. The RAVLT_D requires the recall,
after 15 min, of the same words.
Visuo-spatial functions were assessed with the Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test (ROCFT; Caffarra et al., 2002), the
Attentional Matrices Test (AM; Spinnler and Tognoni, 1987),
and the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A, Giovagnoli et al., 1996).
The ROCFT is commonly used for the evaluation of constructive
apraxia, and requires to copy a geometric drawing composed
of 18 sub-elements: the correct execution and collocation of
the sub-elements are both criteria for scoring. AM inquires
selective visuo-spatial attention and requires to delete, as quickly
as possible, all the numbers identical to the targets among
distractors. In the TMT-A, the subject must perform a visuo-
spatial search to connect in ascending order, with a stroke of pen,
a series of 25 numbers presented in a random distribution on a
sheet.
The executive functions were investigated with the Frontal
Assessment Battery (FAB, Appollonio et al., 2005) which
evaluates categorization, planning, inhibition, sensitivity to
interference and environmental autonomy and with the Trail
Making Test B (TMT-B, Giovagnoli et al., 1996) which requires
to combine alternatively numerical and alphabetical stimuli,
in order to explore visual-motor coordination, set-shifting and
mental flexibility.
Lexical finding skills were assessed with the Verbal Fluency
test (VF, Novelli et al., 1986), in which the subject must name the
greatest possible number of words belonging to a given semantic
category in a minute.
Finally, the subject’s independency in daily life activities
was inquired with the caregiver, using the Functional Activity
Questionnaire (FAQ).
Assessment of Oxidative Stress
ROS Determination
ROS production rate was determined adopting a recently
developed

mini-invasive
method
(Mrakic-Sposta
et
al.,
2012,
2014,
2015, 2017), using 50 µL of capillary blood taken from the
fingertip and immediately treated with CMH (1-hydroxy-
3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine)
probe
solution (1:1). For data acquisition 50 µL of the obtained
solution was put in a glass EPR capillary tube (Noxygen Science
Transfer & Diagnostics, Germany) placed inside the cavity of
a X-band EPR instrument (E-Scan-Bruker BioSpin, Billerica,
MA, USA). Acquisition parameters were determined previously
(Mrakic-Sposta et al., 2012). A Temperature and Gas Controller
‘‘Bio III’’ unit, interfaced to the spectrometer, was used in
order to stabilize sample temperature at 37◦C. Absolute ROS
production rate (µmol.min−1) was obtained converting relative
quantitative determination, allowed by EPR measurements, by
adopting the stable radical CP• (3-Carboxy2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-
1-pyrrolidinyloxy) as external reference. The software supplied
by Bruker (Win EPR System, V. 2.11) was adopted for acquisition
parameters and spectra handling.
Antioxidant Capacity
A capillary blood sample (10 µL) was used in order to
assess Blood Reducing Capacity by mean of a commercial
EDEL potentiostat electrochemical analyzer (Edel Therapeutics,
Switzerland) equipped with a redox sensor in a three-electrode
arrangement able to respond to all water-soluble compounds in
biological fluids, which can be oxidized within a defined potential
range (Liu et al., 2005, 2006). The blood sample was loaded onto
a chip and the result was then pseudo-titrated to account for the
most biologically relevant antioxidants (Tacchini et al., 2013).
Data were expressed in nW.
Enzymatic Assays
Urine samples were collected in a sterile container and stored in
multiple aliquots at −80◦C until assessment performed within
2 weeks from collection.
8-hydroxy-2-deoxy Guanosine (8-OH-dG), as a marker of
oxidative DNA damage, and 8-isoprostane (8-iso), an established
marker of lipid peroxidation, were assessed by commercially
enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). The procedures described in detail by the manufacturer
were followed.
As the collection of the 24 h urine was not possible,
urinary parameters were standardized based on the amount
of the excreted creatinine, in order to avoid the well-known
considerable changes occurring over time. Indeed, the excretion

Rehabilitation in MCI
rate of creatinine keeps relatively constant in the absence of renal
disease. Creatinine concentration was assessed by commercial
enzymatic assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The procedures described in detail by the manufacturer were
performed.
Assessment of the Treatment Acceptability
Acceptability is defined as the degree to which non-professional
stakeholders found an intervention to be fair, reasonable,
intrusive and consistent with treatment expectations (Wolf,
1978; Kazdin, 1980). It refers to the overall evaluation of the
applied procedures and constitutes an important dimension
of the treatment evaluation, besides treatment efficacy and
effectiveness (Kazdin, 1980). In this study, the assessment of the
patients’ opinions toward the intervention was made through a
semi-structured interview administered at the beginning of the
training program and at the end of week 6 by a psychologist and
a biomedical engineer. In particular, closed questions were used
to enable the collection of precise information about a specific
topic (i.e., ‘‘was the smart garment comfortable?’’), whereas the
open ones had the goal of better exploring patients’ subjective
perceptions and feelings. Indeed, open questions constituted as
a ‘‘topic guide’’ to ensure the completeness and comparison
between different responses, but a high level of flexibility was
kept to indulge each participant’s attitude. Before starting the
questionnaire administration, the purpose of the interview and
the assurance that all opinions were valuable and confidential
were disclosed to the patients to encourage honest feedback.
Answers were transcribed by one of the administrators during
the interview. Descriptive statistics (median and interquartile
ranges) were used to provide a summary of the data gathered
through closed questions. Thematic analysis was subsequently
performed to further investigate patients’ subjective perceptions,
gathered through open questions and free comments.
Statistical Analysis
For
the
purpose
of
comparability
between
different
neuropsychological tools, the scores of all the administered
tests were standardized according to their normative mean
scores and standard deviations (Novelli et al., 1986; Spinnler and
Tognoni, 1987; Carlesimo et al., 1995; Giovagnoli et al., 1996;
Magni et al., 1996a,b; Caffarra et al., 2002; Appollonio et al.,
2005). Only three participants, in PRE, were able to complete
the TMT-B, so, this scale was excluded from subsequent
comparisons.
GraphPad Prism package (GraphPad Prism 7, GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical
analysis.
All
statistical
analyses
were
performed
using
non-parametric tests, due to the small sample size. The effect of
the combined physical and cognitive VR-based training on the
neuropsychological assessments and the OxS levels between the
CTR and the EXP groups were compared using Mann Whitney
U-test for independent samples. In detail, such test was used to
compare the scores at PRE and POST conditions for OxS, and
the change in the scale scores from PRE to POST conditions for
psychometric tests, between EXP and CTR groups.

RESULTS
The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the
sample are substantially comparable to those used to assess
the effectiveness of interventions aimed at slowing down
cognitive decline (mean age = 73.3 ± 5.6 years, mean
schooling = 7.6 ± 4.4 years, mean MMSE = 23.0 ± 3.4).
A drop out of one patient both in EXP and CTR group
was recorded for reasons independent from the intervention.
Adherence, for the remaining patients in the EXP group, was
judged good (more than 75%, reaching 89% in two cases) for
three of them, and partial (more than 50% and less than 75%)
for one patient (67%).

characteristics
and

two groups examined at baseline were found.
Assessment of Cognitive Response
The sample was composed of subjects with a mild deterioration
of global cognition that is classifiable as mild (mean MMSE
score = 23.0 ± 3.4).
The subjects globally presented a slight impairment in all
the investigated cognitive domains (Table 2) and a moderate
impairment in the visuo-constructive and executive functions
(ROCFT standardized scores were −2.15 ± 2.85 in EXP
and −2.71 ± 2.45 in CTR; FAB standardized scores were
−1.66 ± 1.49 in EXP and −2.29 ± 2.59 in CTR). A mild
functional impairment was observed in both groups (FAQ scores
8.80 ± 7.19 for EXP and 10.60 ± 8.08 for CTR). No statistically
significant differences were observed between the scores obtained
by the EXP and CTR group in any of the scales administered at
PRE.

Mean standardized scores at the baseline (PRE) for the experimental (EXP) and control (CTR) groups and mean change in standardized scores between the baseline and
the end of experimental phase calculated as delta scores (POST—PRE; except for Trail Making Test A that implies decreasing scores in relation to better performance, for
which the changes were calculated as PRE—POST). MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; RAVLT_I, Immediate Recall of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; RAVLT_D,

At POST, EXP showed a slight improvement in MMSE,
ROCFT, FAB and AM, while CTR worsened. Both groups
showed improvement over time in memory tests and word
finding for EXP the improvement was higher, but not statistically
different from that of CTR. In the TMT-A, EXP and CTR resulted
substantially stable in time (Table 2).
Both groups showed a deterioration of ADLs between PRE
and POST. For the EXP this deterioration was more pronounced
(1.80 ± 4.60 at the FAQ) than that of the CTR (1.00 ± 1.73).
However, this variation has been heavily influenced by the
performance of a single subject belonging to the EXP, who lost 10
FAQ-points due to a marked deterioration of global health. The
same subject was re-evaluated within the Cognitive Disorders
Center 3 months after POST and showed an improvement in
the FAQ scores of 6 points, compared to the PRE. Excluding
that subject as an outlier, EXP obtained a slight improvement of
0.25 ± 0.5 in FAQ scores.
None of the comparisons within and between groups reached
statistical significance at the Wilcoxon Matched Pair Test and
at the Mann-Whitney U-Test, reasonably due to small sample
size, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in
scores between subjects, even if a weak effect of the treatment
on global cognition, on visuo-constructive abilities, on visuo-
spatial attention and, in particular, on executive functions was
observed.
Assessment of Oxidative Stress
Comparing every baseline value of the examined biological
parameters, no significant difference between EXP and CTR
group was recorded.
As previously reported (Marzorati et al., 2016), an increase
(+8%) in ROS production was recorded at POST in the CTR
group; on the contrary in the EXP group a decrease (−4%) was
observed. Comparing the two experimental groups at POST, ROS
production rate resulted statistically (p < 0.05) lower in EXP vs.
CTR (2.03 ± 0.23 vs. 2.58 ± 0.33 µmol · min−1, respectively
Figure 3A).
A similar trend was observed in 8-iso concentration:
compared to CTR, in the EXP group after training intervention
8-iso resulted statistically (p < 0.05) lower (495.20 ± 44.56 vs.
379.30 ± 54.82 pg·mg−1 creatinine, respectively; Figure 3C).
8-OH-dG concentration significantly increased (p < 0.01)
respect to basal value in the CTR group (5.80 ± 1.40 vs.
10.32 ± 1.28 ng·mg−1
creatinine) and was significantly
(p < 0.001) lower in the EXP group with respect to the CTR
after training intervention (5.14 ± 1.05 vs. 10.32 ± 1.28 ng·mg−1
creatinine, respectively; Figure 3D).
On the contrary after 6 weeks of training, no differences
were found comparing the relative post values in the CTR
and EXP groups in the TAC level (CTR: 149.75 ± 30.44 vs.
post: 147.25 ± 22.20 nW; EXP: 152.25 ± 25.55 vs. post:
163.50 ± 42.35 nW; Figure 3B).

The evaluation was based on a Likert scale whose elements indicated: not at all (0), not really (1), neutral (2), somewhat (3) and very much (4). Results in this table were
previously published in Arlati et al. (2017).
As highlighted in the table, patients expressed in general a
neutral position towards the training and a positive confirmation
of their expectations consisting, according to open questions, in
an improvement or, at least, to maintain their current status (2,5).
These data showed that in general, the intervention was judged
acceptable and enjoyable by all the subjects. The interaction with
the technology was easy and intuitive for all of them and only
few side effects were reported. The setup was defined comfortable
and changing clothes to wear the smart garment was not an
issue. In particular, considering the scenarios supporting the
physical training (park and road-crossing), participants scored
positively with the joystick use and did not complain about the
difficulty of the physical exercise, also in terms of maintaining
the speed required (0). Also in the supermarket scenario for
the cognitive training, the different visual and auditory supports
(shopping list, guiding voice and hints) were judged clear and
useful (3).
Difficulties related to the cognitive tasks were mainly related
to graphical issues or products’ design, which did not match
the packages the participants used to buy. Moreover, answers
from participants reported that the different scenarios did
not elicit negative feelings as anxiety and boredom (0) except
for a slight sense of sickness in the park and road crossing
scenarios (0.5). Some interesting considerations on acceptability
arose also from the open questions analysis, confirming and
deepening specific aspects highlighted in the Table 3. First,
all participants stated that they would continue with the
training, if possible, and most of them also at their own home
with a proper setup, thus confirming a positive acceptance
level. Concerning expectations, all of them reported to have
received benefits from the intervention, both in terms of
motivation and perceived improvements. It is important to
underline that, according to the self-perceived improvements,
subjects
of
EXP
group
reported
better
performance
in
real life regardless of real improvements from results of
cognitive tests, probably due to a related reduced level of
anxiety.
DISCUSSION
Dementia pathogenesis is a multifactorial disorder where
mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but an important
role appears to be played by the interaction of genetic and
environmental factors.
The disease prevention appears to be possible, as many factors
involved in the onset and progression of dementia are modifiable
or susceptible to management. Therefore, encouraging the
implementation of preventive measures throughout life may be
most a effective strategy. Indeed, in Europe, three major multi-
center trials for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia
have been launched, and they all foresee multicomponent
interventions (Vellas et al., 2014; Ngandu et al., 2015; Moll van
Charante et al., 2016).
The evidence suggests that a multi-dimensional approach
aimed at increasing physical activity levels and stimulating
cognitive functions may have an effect on slowing cognitive
decline in a population of elderly people at risk of dementia.
The novelty of this VR-based system supporting physical and
cognitive training enabled to conduct a preliminary evaluation
of the efficacy and of the acceptability of an innovative
non-pharmacological system able to mitigate some of the
dementia effects, by means of exploiting VR technologies for the
training of both functions in elderly with MCI.
The combination of training and VR technologies, adopted
in the presented protocol, was revealed able to achieve the
expected goals, promoting a tendency towards improvement in
people affected by cognitive impairments. The application
allowed
to

cognitive
functions

Rehabilitation in MCI
executive function, navigation, planning and memory and
support procedures for reducing behavioral and psychological
symptoms of MCI and early-stage AD patients. Obtained
results are in agreement with recent reviews (Coyle et al.,
2015; Hill et al., 2016) on computerized and VR-based
training of cognitive abilities in MCI population, which
showed that attention, executive functions and memory are
the domains that can be better addressed with this type of
training.
Even if this study has average sample and time of intervention
smaller than that of others (Etnier et al., 2006) evaluating the
effects of physical exercise on cognition, the presented results
suggest that the adopted training protocol was actually able to
affect MMSE tasks and to increase the global cognition levels
of MCI. Anyways, according to the above-mentioned review, a
longer intervention would be more suitable to improve cognition
in older subjects incrementing physical activity level.
Numerous evidences support the role of OxS in the
development of AD. Indeed, lipid and DNA damage caused
by OxS is closely associated with the development of AD
(Nunomura et al., 2006) and very strong correlations among
lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes and senile plaques in AD
brains are reported (Feng and Wang, 2012).
OxS
is
characterized
by
an
imbalance
between

production
and

are
responsible
for
the

(Harman,
1981),
both
systems

considered
to

in
neurodegeneration
and
cognitive
decline,
processes
age-
related. A decrease in plasma antioxidant defense mechanism
was reported that it was associated with memory impairments
related to aging (Haider et al., 2014). Thus, the development
of strategies to mitigate OxS in neurodegenerative diseases
is relevant. The reduction of an uncontrolled ROS production
mitigating the deleterious effects should be positively considered.
Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present
study (i.e., reduction of ROS production and oxidative damage
of lipids and DNA), support the evidence that the adoption
of physical and cognitive training decreases OxS levels,
and speculatively, this would be associated with the slight
improvement in some cognitive functions.
Concerning user acceptability, qualitative data retrieved from
the questionnaires and the subjects’ comments revealed high
levels of engagement and motivation, enabled mainly by the
use of the VR technologies that they defined as a new way to
approach the cognitive training. Feedbacks on the VEs design
revealed appreciation, leading to the conclusion that the training
was well accepted by all the patients, who—in the majority
of the cases—would continue with the program also at home.
Having reached high levels of acceptability of the proposed
technology-based treatment is indeed a promising result. In
fact, acceptability represents a key issue for promoting the
successful employment of innovative technologies in therapy,
especially when dealing with older population (Dillon and
Morris, 1996).
Finally, it is important to highlight that the subjects enrolled
in the experimental group reported to ‘‘feel better’’ and to
have reduced their levels of anxiety during the accomplishment
of common ADLs. This feeling, though self-perceived and
not supported by psychometric results, probably due to the
small sample, enabled a real improvement of their quality
of life (QoL). Subjective perceptions have been recognized
as one of the outcomes of the rehabilitation path, and
several studies have shown how this aspect can contribute to
increase patients’ satisfaction (Cicerone et al., 2000; Dohnke
et al., 2005; Lexell et al., 2014) and self-efficacy, leading
indeed towards more autonomy and more effectiveness in
the performance of several behaviors (Grembowski et al.,
1993).
LIMITATIONS
Limitations of this clinical trial are linked to its pilot
study characteristics (i.e., small sample and a short period
of treatment). Moreover, the multimodal approach adopted,
including treatment with multiple compounds with diverse
properties that could improve several mechanisms and functions,
was not compared with another active intervention (e.g., a
matched cycle-ergometer training program) but without the VR
component, therefore we cannot estimate neither the impact
of every single component nor the additive effects. Long-term
follow-ups are indispensable to evaluate the rehabilitation
efficacy too. In spite of the small number of patients the strength
of this study includes the supervised exercise program, a high rate
of adherence to the intervention and the use of validated outcome
measures. Lack of monitoring of the physical activity outside the
experimental sessions and the lack of a social activity program in
the control group weaken the study too.
CONCLUSION
The potentialities of the proposed innovative approach have been
demonstrated, even if this study should be considered as a proof-
of-concept that requires further developments.
Results obtained concerning both the efficacy and the
acceptability of the novel VR-based combined training in
MCI populations are encouraging, but a greater number of
participants are required to support the preliminary data
with statistical significance. Other future challenges foresee the
inclusion of a follow-up phase to provide more consistent
results and highlight the long-term effectiveness of the proposed
combined program, which could represent a solution to the
development of a future home-based training service.
