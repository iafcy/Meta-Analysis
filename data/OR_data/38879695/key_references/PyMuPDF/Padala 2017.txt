Abstract.
Background/Objective: Balance problems are common in older adults with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective was
to study the effects of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to a walking program on measures of
balance in older adults with mild AD.
Methods: A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial (Wii-Fit versus walking) was conducted in thirty
community-dwelling older adults (73 ± 6.2 years) with mild AD. Home-based exercises were performed under caregiver
supervision for 8 weeks. Primary (Berg Balance Scale, BBS) and secondary outcomes (fear of falls and quality of life) were
measured at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 16 weeks (8-weeks post-intervention).
Results: At 8 weeks, there was a signiﬁcantly greater improvement (average inter-group difference [95% CI]) in the Wii-Fit
group compared to the walking group in BBS (4.8 [3.3–6.2], p < 0.001), after adjusting for baseline. This improvement was
sustained at 16 weeks (3.5 [2.0–5.0], p < 0.001). Analyses of the secondary outcome measures indicated that there was a
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in the Wii-Fit group compared to walking group in Activity-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence
scale (6.5 [3.6–9.4], p < 0.001) and Falls Efﬁcacy Scale (–4.8 [–7.6 to –2.0], p = 0.002) at 8 weeks. However, this effect was
not sustained at 16 weeks. Quality of life improved in both groups at 8 weeks; however, there were no inter-group differences
(p = 0.445).
Conclusion: Home-based, caregiver-supervised Wii-Fit exercises improve balance and may reduce fear of falling in
community-dwelling older adults with mild AD.

INTRODUCTION
Falls are associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and
mortality [1, 2]. More than 60% of patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) fall annually, a rate three

times greater than those without AD [3]. Falls in
AD are associated with an increased rate of institu-
tionalization [4]. Poor balance and gait abnormalities
seen in AD are risk factors for falls [5]. AD patients
score more poorly on tests of equilibrium and limb
coordination compared to their cognitively intact
peers, independent of age [6]. Shortened step length,
increaseddoublesupporttime,increasedstridelength
variability, and decreased gait speed are common gait
abnormalities in AD [7]. Increased stride length vari-
ability is a proven risk factor for falls in patients with
AD. These balance and gait impairments worsen with
dual tasking potentially due to overlap in the brain
areas involved in gait and certain cognitive tasks [8].
Gait and balance problems are potentially modiﬁable
independent risk factor of falls [9]. Thus, we focused
on an intervention that could improve balance and
gait in patients with AD.
In a recent review of exercise programs in demen-
tia, exercises that target strength training and balance
were seen necessary for reducing falls [10]. Caregiver
engagement and having multiple exercise options to
choose from were noted to be important in this pop-
ulation. Exergames give the ﬂexibility of choosing
from a bank of multiple exercises targeting strength
training and balance and hence may do better than
traditional exercise programs in this population. In a
systematic review of exercise studies in older adults,
balance training exercises have demonstrated sig-
niﬁcant impact on preventing falls in cognitively
intact older adults [11]. In deconditioned older adults
at high risk of falls, even low intensity exercise
has proven beneﬁts [12]. However, there are very
few studies examining the effect of balance train-
ing exercises as a strategy for improving balance in
community-dwelling older adults with AD [13, 14].
In spite of many known beneﬁts of exercise, many
older adults continue to remain sedentary. A novel
approach of engaging older adults in exercises would
be to make the exercises fun, engaging, and easily
accessible at home such as exergames. The use of
exergames at home may help overcome some of the
barriers to exercise such as fear of falling, lack of
motivation,theeffortandcostsoftravelingtoexercise
venues, and a preference for the privacy of the home
environment [15, 16]. No study to date has explored
a self-directed, caregiver-supervised exergames pro-
gram for balance in community-dwelling patients
with AD.
Exergames are interactive video games that
involve physical activity [17]. The Nintendo Wii-
Fit® exergame uses a balance board that senses shifts
in weight to provide aerobics, strength, and balance
training [18]. This gaming system is widely available,
is easy to use, has the potential for home use, and
may provide a mechanism for sedentary older adults
to safely add exercise to their lifestyle. In our pilot
study, residents of an assisted living facility with mild
to moderate AD used supervised Wii-Fit exercise as
a safe and feasible means to improve balance [19].
Exergames have been used as a home-based exercise
under unsupervised conditions in healthy older adults
[20, 21]. However, no such studies have been done in
community-dwelling patients with AD. We hypoth-
esized that home-based caregiver supervised Wii-Fit
exercises would be safe and improve balance more
than the walking program in older adults with mild
AD. Thus, the primary objective of this pilot study
was to study the effects of an 8-week home-based
caregiver supervised Wii-Fit program on balance in
community-dwelling older adults with mild AD. The
secondary objectives were to explore the effects of the
exercise program on fear of falling, functional state,
quality of life, and cognition in the same subjects.
METHODS
Study design and participants
A 16-week home-based, caregiver supervised,
prospective randomized controlled parallel-group
pilot trial was conducted to compare the effects of
the Wii-Fit program to the walking program on bal-
ance and fear of falling with 8 weeks of intervention
followed by 8 weeks of detraining. The protocol
was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review
Board and the study was conducted in compliance
with guidelines on human experimentation from June
2010 to December 2014. Community-dwelling older
(≥60 years) adults (n = 30) with AD (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual DSM-IV TR criteria [22]), a Mini-
Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥18, with history
or fear of falling in the past year, and had a care-
giver were included in the study. Subjects using wheel
chairs or walkers for mobility or having absolute con-
traindications to exercise per American College of
Sports Medicine guidelines were excluded [23]. The
sample size was a priori determined for the primary
outcome measure of BBS using information from a
previous study. Assuming a common SD of 3.3 for
BBS change for both groups, a sample size of 24
(12 per group) was necessary to detect a difference
between BBS improvement of 5 points in the Wii-Fit
group versus a 1-point improvement in the control

group with a power of 0.80 using a two-sided alpha of
0.05. Twenty percent attrition was projected based on
our previous experience, which inﬂated the required
sample size to 30 with 15 subjects in each group.
Study procedure
IRB approval was obtained for a HIPAA waiver
to allow pre-screening of subjects after their initial
telephone contact with the study team. The medical
center’s electronic medical records were reviewed for
the pre-screening. Recruits that met the pre-screening
criteria by the electronic medical record review were
invited for the baseline visit. All recruitment was
done at the medical center. Consent was obtained
from subjects that met the cut-off score for the UCSD
Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC)
[24]. Assent from subjects, and consent from care-
givers was obtained for subjects that did not meet
the cut-off on UBACC. Additionally, all caregivers
provided a written informed consent for their own
participation in the study. After the consent, all sub-
jects were reviewed for the diagnosis of mild AD. The
study physician determined the diagnosis of mild AD
based on the clinical history and DSM-IV TR criteria.
All subjects also underwent an MMSE assessment.
Those with scores ≥18 were included in the study.
Demographicsandanthropometricdataalongwithall
the primary and secondary outcomes measures were
assessed at the baseline visit. Subjects and their care-
givers were trained to use Wii-Fit over one to two
sessions to learn about the program, and to ensure
their willingness to participate. Subjects were ran-
domized using a randomized block design to the
Wii-Fit exercise (n = 15) and walking control groups
(n = 15) using sealed envelopes prepared by the
statistician.
Role of research assistants
After randomization, a research assistant made
home visits to the Wii-Fit group to set up the device
and trained the subject and their caregiver about
its use. The research assistants followed up with
phone calls one day after installation, one week after
starting the program, and then every two weeks to
troubleshoot problems, provide encouragement, and
identify any adverse events. Adverse events were
deﬁned as study related adverse events such as falls,
dizziness, and pain during exercise. These were iden-
tiﬁed by open ended questions and speciﬁc inquiries.
Subjects were also queried for serious adverse events
such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations
via telephone calls.
Study intervention
Subjects in both groups exercised under caregiver
supervision for 30 min ﬁve days/week for 8 weeks.
The Wii-Fit group performed exercises from ﬁve
categories of the Wii-Fit program: yoga, strength
training, aerobics, balance games, and training plus,
which includes more complex exercise tasks. Each
session in the Wii-Fit included a warm up, exercise,
and cool down phase. During the warm up and cool
down phases, subjects walked for 5 min at a self-
selected comfortable pace using the program’s ‘basic
walk’ activity. The exercise phase was designed to
be participant centric. The study physician set up the
components of the exercise program based on knowl-
edge from our prior studies of which exercises could
be completed by this population with respect to abil-
ity and safety. Exercises were deliberately chosen
from the balance, aerobic, strength training, and yoga
components. The speciﬁc exercises in each category
were picked based on their ease of use and subject
preference expressed in our prior clinical work. All
subjects started each exercise at level one. Upon mas-
tery, subsequent levels were opened automatically by
the program. Subjects were encouraged to choose one
or more exercises from every Wii-Fit category during
each session. Research assistants did an initial home-
visit to set-up the program at the patient’s home and
trained the subject and their caregiver on the use of
the program. Caregivers were instructed to help the
subjects in setting up the instruments if needed and
supervise them during each exercise session. They
were also instructed to help the subjects record the
activities performed daily in their activity diary. Sub-
jects in the walking program were instructed to walk
for 30 min at their self-selected pace either indoors
or outdoors for ﬁve days of the week. Subjects were
advised to walk in an uninterrupted block of activity
and not cumulative over the day. Subjects maintained
an activity diary with the assistance from the care-
givers wherein they recorded the day they exercised
and time spent exercising during each session.
All outcomes were measured at baseline, 8 weeks
(end of intervention), and at 16 weeks (8-weeks post
intervention) by an outcomes assessor, who was not
part of the study interventions but was aware of the
group assignments. The primary outcome was the
Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which assesses balance
impairments in older adults, and is a good measure

of static and dynamic stability [25]. It consists of
14 tasks performed in a standardized order with each
task scored on a ﬁve-point scale according to quality
or time ranging from “0” (lowest level of function) to
“4” (highest level). The maximum score is 56. BBS
has good test-retest reliability (0.95) and inter-rater
reliability (0.72) in community-dwelling older adults
with mild to moderate AD [26].
The secondary outcome measures included fear
of falling, quality of life, cognition, and functional
state. Fear of falling is an important psychologi-
cal consequence that develops in subjects who fall.
Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) scale
measures fear of falling and self-conﬁdence to main-
tain balance [27]. Subjects rate their conﬁdence
in maintaining balance while engaging in 16 non-
hazardous activities of daily living. Lower scores
indicate greater fear of falling. The test-retest reli-
ability is 0.92 with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.96 in
cognitively intact community-dwelling older adults
[27]. Falls Efﬁcacy Scale (FES) is a 10-item rating
scale which assesses the conﬁdence of subjects in
performing activities of daily living. Scores range
from 10 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater
conﬁdence in maintaining daily living activities [28].
FES has also been shown to have a good reliability
( = 0.89) in cognitively impaired population [29].
Quality of Life-AD (QOL-AD) is a 13-item scale
which assesses quality of life from the subject’s per-
spective in older adults with AD. It assesses subject’s
physical condition, mood, interpersonal relation-
ships, ability to participate in meaningful activities,
ﬁnancial situation, and overall assessment of self, and
quality of life as a whole. It is rated on a four-point
scale, with 1 being poor and 4 being excellent. Total
scores range from 13–52 with higher scores indicat-
ing higher QOL. This scale has been evaluated and
shown to have a good reliability ( = 0.84) in cogni-
tively impaired population [30].
Modiﬁed Mini Mental (3MS) is a global screening
for cognitive function that covers orientation to time
and place, registration, recall, simple language, and
construction. Test-retest reliability ranges from 0.91
to 0.93 [31]. The total score places the individual on
a well-accepted scale of cognitive function. Different
versions were used at each testing occasion to mini-
mize practice effects. An MMSE score derived from
3MS was used in the inclusion criteria of the study.
Katz’s Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assesses a
subject’s independence in performing basic tasks of
daily living such as bathing, eating, toileting, dress-
ing, grooming, and ambulation. Each task is further
divided in questions of ability to do things. The score
ranges from 0–24 with higher scores indicating a
higher level of function [32]. This scale is widely used
in geriatrics and in research studies involving cogni-
tivelyintactandimpairedpopulations.Arecentreport
of factor analysis of Katz ADL found that there was
no need for normalization of the scale according to
cognitive decline [33]. Lawton and Brody’s Instru-
mental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) assesses
the subject’s independence in performing hierarchi-
cal activities, which include ability to prepare meals,
handling ﬁnances, ability to use telephone, shopping
for grocery or personal items, performing house-
hold work, ability to do the laundry, ability to take
responsibility of one’s own medication, and mode
of transportation. The score ranges from 0–23 with
higher scores indicating higher level of function [34].
Statistical analyses
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics
were compared using t-tests (continuous data) and
Fisher’s exact tests (categorical data).
Changes from baseline at 8 and 16 weeks in pri-
mary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using
repeated measures mixed model analyses of covari-
ance. Group (Wii-Fit and walking) and time (8
and 16 weeks) as well as the interaction between
the two were independent variables; the dependent
variable’s baseline measure was included as a covari-
ate. In post-hoc analyses, groups were compared
in terms of the changes from baseline at 8 and
16 weeks using t-tests derived from model-based
contrasts. Additionally, comparisons were made to
separately assess improvements within each group.
For BBS, the primary endpoint, a sensitivity analysis
to investigate bias due to missing data for subjects
(n = 6) who dropped out of the study was performed
by carrying forward baseline values to conserva-
tively impute missing data as no change. Two-sided
p-values less than 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁ-
cance. Since there was only one primary endpoint,
p-values were not adjusted; however, the higher than
nominal experiment-wise Type I error rate should be
kept in mind particularly for the exploratory analy-
ses of secondary endpoints [35]. Data were analyzed
using SAS Enterprise Guide v5.1 (SAS, Cary, SC).
RESULTS

assessed for eligibility of which 57 failed to meet
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 19 were
not interested in participation. Thirty subjects were
deemed eligible and randomized. Twenty-four sub-
jects completed the 8-week visit and 22 completed
the 16-week visit. Six subjects dropped out of the
study and did not attend any of the follow-up vis-
its; two did not attend the ﬁnal 16-week visit. Two
subjects dropped as their caregivers were not able to
dedicate the necessary time, and four others dropped
due to loss of interest. The demographic characteris-
tics of the study are presented in Table 1. The mean
(SD) age of the subjects was 73.0 (6.2) years, 63%
were males, and 77% were non-Hispanic Caucasian.

groups with regard to age, gender, race, and anthro-
pometry (Table 1). There were also no signiﬁcant
differences between the two groups with regards to
comorbidities, number of comorbidities, and number
of medications (Table 1).
There were no signiﬁcant differences at baseline
between the two groups with regards to primary or
secondary outcome measures (Table 2). There were
four adverse events, but they were deemed to be not
study related. There were no study-related adverse
events. Total time spent exercising in the Wii-Fit
group was 1,253 (444) min while in the walking
group was 985 (211) min. Total number (mean ± SD)
of exercise sessions in the Wii-Fit group was 38±2
while in the walking group was 37±6. There was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the
two groups regarding the total time spent exercis-
ing (p = 0.072) (Table 2) or the number of exercise
sessions (p = 0.452) which is analogous to 95% and
93% adherence, respectively, given the target of 40
sessions. There was no correlation with session dura-
tion and balance improvement (r = 0.02, p = 0.95), but
there is a strong correlation with number of sessions
and balance improvement (r = 0.75, p = 0.005).
Among the completers (n = 24), there was a sig-
niﬁcant group-by-time interaction for the primary
outcome measure BBS (p = 0.048, Fig. 2). Post-hoc
analysis showed that the change in BBS from base-
line for the Wii-Fit group signiﬁcantly differed from
that in the walking group at both 8 and 16 weeks.
After adjusting for baseline BBS score, the average
inter-group differences (95% CI) were 4.8 (3.3–6.2;
p < 0.001) at 8 weeks and 3.5 (2.0–5.0; p < 0.001)
at 16 weeks. Intra-group analysis showed signiﬁ-
cant improvements in BBS in the Wii-Fit group at 8
weeks (5.8 [4.8–6.8], p < 0.001) and 16 weeks (5.4
[4.4–6.4], p < 0.001), and in the walking group at

outcomes data for the eight subjects (four in each
group) were imputed as no change in a sensitivity
analysis (intent-to-treat approach), the effect of exer-
cise decreased, but was still statistically signiﬁcant:
the average inter-group differences (95% CI) were
3.5 (1.7–5.4, p = 0.001) at 8 weeks and 2.5 (0.6–4.3,
p = 0.011) at 16 weeks.
There was a signiﬁcant improvement (average
inter-group difference [95% CI]) in the ABC scale
in the Wii-Fit group compared to walking group
(6.5 [3.6–9.4], p < 0.001) at 8 weeks. However, this
effect was not sustained at 16 weeks (2.0 [–1.0–5.1],
p = 0.182). There was a signiﬁcant improvement in
the FES in the Wii-Fit group compared to walking
group (–4.8 [–7.6 to –2.0], p = 0.002) at 8 weeks.
However, this effect was not sustained at 16 weeks
(–2.2 [–5.1–0.7], p = 0.129). There was signiﬁcant
intra-group improvement in the QOL-AD both in the
Wii-Fit group (1.7 (0.6–2.8), p = 0.005) and the walk-
ing group (1.1 (0.0–2.3) p = 0.048) at 8 weeks. These
effects were not sustained at 16 weeks. There was also
signiﬁcant intra-group improvement in the IADLs
both in the Wii-Fit group (1.7 (0.7–2.6), p = 0.002)
and the walking group (1.0 (0.1–1.9), p = 0.039) at

DISCUSSION
The main objective of our pilot home-based,
caregiver-supervisedstudywastocomparetheeffects
of Wii-Fit exercises to walking on balance in
community-dwelling older adults with mild AD.
This study establishes the feasibility of using Wii-
Fit in a home setting under caregiver supervision
in community-dwelling older adults with mild AD.
At 8 weeks, subjects in the Wii-Fit group showed
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in their balance
compared to the Walking group. The improvement
in BBS is both statistically and clinically signiﬁcant.
Minimally detectable change in BBS is dependent on
factors such as their baseline BBS score. Donoghue et
al. found that a change of 4 points is clinically signif-
icant if the baseline BBS scores ranged from 45–56
in community-dwelling patients (n = 118, aged over
65 years) [36]. Our study population’s baseline BBS
scores is similar to Donoghue et al. and had a 5.8-
point improvement in BBS. This improvement was
sustained at 8-weeks post-intervention. The Wii-Fit
group also showed signiﬁcantly greater improvement
in the fear of falling measures compared to the walk-
ing group. The adherence to the program as measured
by the amount of time spent exercising was slightly
better in the exercise group compared to the con-
trol group. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, there
was a trend toward signiﬁcance. Time spent exercis-
ing by the two groups would likely inﬂuence the out-
come. The Wii-Fit group did spend slightly more total

time exercising than the Walking group. This could
have affected the balance improvements found but it
also supports the possibility that the fun and inter-
active aspects of exergames promotes engagement.
The Wii-Fit program could have helped the balance
in several ways in this study. Many of the exercises
performed particularly those in the balance category
have similar tasks in the BBS such as weight transfer,
functional reach, and body rotations. Motor learn-
ing and practice effect could improve static balance,
dynamic balance, postural control, and other compo-
nents of balance. Some of the exercises used increase
strength which could improve the performance on
BBS tasks. Improved self-efﬁcacy and mastery with
successful performance of the Wii-Fit program could
also contribute to improvement in balance. There are
several reasons why exergames may be a better alter-
native than other modalities of exercise in AD. The
multimedia platform, the presence of a virtual trainer,
easy to follow instructions, and real-time feedback to
theirbodilymovementsmayengenderhigherengage-
ment to exergames than traditional exercise programs
in patients with AD. Transportation and economic
barriers to exercise disproportionately impact those
with AD. Home-based exergame programs have the
potential to break the transportation and economic
hurdles. Lack of adherence to long-term exercise pro-
gram is a huge problem. The gaming format was
interactive, required mental and physical tasking, and
could be considered fun. Having an exercise program
readily available that could be easily and safely per-
formed by the patient at-home with supervision by a
caregiver is important to sustain long-term adherence
and exergames provide this.
Although this is the ﬁrst study of home-based
exergames in community-dwelling patients with AD,
our results are in keeping with other home-based tra-
ditional exercise studies. In a single arm study of
community-dwelling older adults with dementia, 6
months of home-based, caregiver-enhanced, tailored
balance exercises improved balance, and reduced fear
of falls [37]. This study differed from our study with
regards to the subjects they included (any type of
dementia), and had slightly lower average MMSE,
and performed home visits by physical therapists.
Average MMSE may be important as those who com-
pleted the study had higher average MMSE than
thosewhodroppedout(21.7 ± 3.9versus19.1 ± 4.2).
The adherence rates in both studies were around
80%. In another randomized controlled trial (RCT)
of 6 months of home-based, caregiver-supervised
traditional exercise program (Otago program) in
community-dwelling older adults with AD, a signiﬁ-
cant improvement was noted in the exercise group on
functional reach, and fall risk score compared to the
control group (education sessions on dementia and
aging) [13]. This study differed from our study with
regards to the subjects in the exercise group who had
slightly lower average MMSE, and a higher drop-out
rate of 42% [13]. The adherence rate in the exercise
group for those who completed the study was simi-
lar in both studies. Another RCT with 4 months of
home based, caregiver-supervised, traditional exer-
cise program (strength and balance training with 30
min of brisk walking) in community-dwelling older
adults with AD (n = 40), found a similarly signiﬁcant
improvement in the exercise group on Timed Up and
Go, functional reach, and sit-to-stand tests compared
to the control group (usual treatment) [13]. Home-
based caregiver supervised exercise programs have
shown to improve balance in community-dwelling
older adults with dementia.
Exergames have been used as a home-based
exercise program under unsupervised conditions
in healthy older adults [20, 21]. In a 6-week,
single arm study of healthy community-dwelling
older adults (n = 10), balance, as measured by sway
characteristics, improved signiﬁcantly with a home-
based unsupervised exergames training program
[21]. In a three-arm home-based (step-mat training,
Kinect, and control arms), 16-week RCT of healthy
community-dwelling older adults, the step-mat train-
ing showed signiﬁcantly greater improvement in fall
risk, proprioception, reaction time, executive func-
tioning, and sit-to-stand performance over the control
arm while the Kinect arm improved muscle strength,
and vision over the control arm [20]. Exergames have
been used as a home-based exercise programs in pop-
ulations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
non-small cell carcinoma of lung, multiple sclero-
sis,andsystemiclupuserythematosusinuncontrolled
studies [38–41].
The major strength of the study is the study
design, a randomized parallel-group trial comparing
the widely available exergame to walking (most com-
monly used exercise strategy) in older adults. The
other strengths include that it was a home-based exer-
cise program, and that there was a post-intervention
follow-up to study the sustainability of effects of
exercise. However, the current study has several
limitations. This was a pilot study and was only
a priori powered to address one primary outcome
measure BBS and did not consider other outcomes as
functional status and quality of life. Measures such

as gait speed and lower extremity strength were also
not included as outcome measures. Hence, improve-
ments in gait speed and lower extremity strength with
use of Wii-Fit cannot be learned from this study.
These measures need to be included in future studies.
Another major limitation was the lack of blinding of
the outcomes assessor. However, all outcomes were
measured by an outcomes assessor who was not part
of the study interventions but was aware of the group
assignments. The assessor also did not have access
to the previous measurements at each visit. In spite
of all these precautions, there could have been a bias
toward the intervention group. There was also fail-
ure to strictly monitor the intensity of the exercises in
each group. Subjects in the walking group walked at
their self- selected pace. So, we expect the intensity to
be mild to moderate. However, a speciﬁc measure to
assess exercise intensity was not included. Subjects
that would have done exercises at higher intensity
may have had better outcomes. As the subjects had to
perform the exercises ﬁve days of the week, the day
of the week the exercise was performed and number
of minutes spent exercising were the only two items
recorded in the log to avoid patient and caregiver
burden. Physical activity level prior to entry in the
study was not recorded and is another limitation of the
study. Those that had higher level of physical activ-
ity at baseline could have been better motivated to do
the exercises. Data on number of falls in the previous
year prior to entry into the study was not recorded
and is another limitation of the study. This study was
conducted prior to the publication of guidelines indi-
cating that 12 weeks may be the effective duration of
exercise needed to effect change in balance in older
adults [42]. In order for Wii-Fit to be recommended
as a home-based exercise program, a longer duration
study with larger sample size is needed with enroll-
ment of diverse ethnic groups, focusing primarily
on balance exercises, and systematically measuring
effects on incidence of falls and fall related injuries.
Conclusion
This pilot study supports that the home-based
caregiver supervised Wii-Fit exercise program could
improve balance and may reduce fear of falling in
community-dwelling older adults with mild AD.
