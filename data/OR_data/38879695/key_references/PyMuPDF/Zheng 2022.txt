ABSTRACT
Objectives: This pilot study was intended to evaluate the effects of active game play on cognition, 
quality of life, and depression for older people with dementia.
Methods: Thirty-eight older people with dementia were recruited. Eighteen people received eight- 
week active game play using Xbox 360 Kinect. Twenty people received their usual care. The Mini 
Mental State Examination, Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease and Cornell Scale for Depression in 
Dementia were used to measure the outcomes.
Results: The results showed that there was no significant improvement on the mean scores of Mini 
Mental State Examination (P = .252), however, the active game play increased the mean score of 
Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (P = .005), and reduced the mean score of Cornell Scale for 
Depression in Dementia (P = .001) in comparison with the usual care group.
Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the active game play was effective in improving quality 
of life and alleviating depression in older people with dementia.
Clinical Implications: Findings highlight the potential for gaming as a non-pharmacological 
interventions for older people with dementia.

Background
Dementia represents a collection of symptoms that 
are caused by brain disorders. It is usually chronic and 
involves progressive deterioration in cognitive and 
daily functions (“2019 Alzheimer’s disease facts and 
figures,” 2019). Dementia does not only cause diffi­
culty in performing activities of daily living, such as 
eating, dressing, and toileting (Cornelis, Gorus, Van 
Schelvergem, & De Vriendt, 2019), but also has a 
significant impact on the quality of life (Kisvetrová 
et al., 2021). Behavioral and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSD) and depression can cause rapid 
decline in function, earlier institutionalization and 
increasing mortality (Khundakar & Thomas, 2015). 
Managing dementia requires substantial amount of 
human and economic resources worldwide, including 
medical and nursing care, pharmacological manage­
ment, and informal daily living care by family mem­
bers. These impose substantial societal and economic 
costs (Cantarero-Prieto, Leon, Blazquez-Fernandez, 
Juan, & Cobo, 2019). Therefore, dementia is a grow­
ing public health concern associated with the aging 
population.
As there is no medical cure to stop or reverse the 
progress of functional decline in dementia, an 
increasing scientific and community interest has 
been focused on non-pharmacological interven­
tions to improve or at least to maintain cognition 
and quality of life for people with dementia 
(Cabrera et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015). 
Neuroplasticity is the ability of the human brain 
to adapt to environmental changes by modifying 
neural connectivity and brain function (Knaepen, 
Goekint, Heyman, & Meeusen, 2010). Studies have 
indicated that even older people with dementia still 
maintain a certain level of neural plasticity 
(Spironelli, Bergamaschi, Mondini, Villani, & 
Angrilli, 2013). This provides hope to improve 
their cognition through rehabilitation training 
(Spironelli et al., 2013).

Because playing games requires mental concen­
tration, intelligence, memory, and quick reaction 
(Cohen, Firth, Biddle, Lewis, & Simmens, 2009; 
Fenney & Lee, 2010), Anguera et al. (2013) suggest 
that games can be used for cognitive training of 
people with dementia. Games, in general, are fun 
and delightful. They can reduce loneliness, invoke a 
sense of accomplishment, and cultivate positive 
mood (Lin, Cao, & Gao, 2015; Manera et al., 
2015). Recently, there is increasing use of active 
game play to provide various therapies in virtual 
environments under simulating conditions. These 
therapies take the advantages of active games in 
combining the fun of gameplay with physical exer­
cise (Ackerman, Kanfer, & Calderwood, 2010; 
Saenz-de-Urturi, 
Garcia-Zapirain, 
& 
Zorrilla, 
2014), physical exercise has a therapeutic effect on 
cognition by delaying hippocampal neurodegen­
eration in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
(Huttenrauch et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2014). 
Moreover, active games provide immediate perfor­
mance feedback, such as encouragement com­
ments, bonuses; and music, which is interactive 
and motivational, and active games have the flex­
ibility to offer various activity levels, and allow 
playing in different postures, either standing, or 
sitting (Chao, Scherer, & Montgomery, 2015). 
These make active games suitable for players with 
different levels of game play experience and physi­
cal condition.
There are some pioneer experiments with active 
game play for people with dementia. For example, 
Dove et al. (2019) used Xbox Kinect as a group 
activity for people with dementia, this qualitative 
study found that people with dementia can learn to 
play active games and enjoy doing so. Yamaguchi 
(2011) examined the effects of video-sports games 
on cognition, visuospatial and constructive func­
tions, and behavior in people with dementia (n = 9). 
Two types of games were used in their program: 
one working on the upper limb, another working 
on the lower limb. The former required a player to 
catch coins which appeared to be flying out of the 
screen. The later required a player to move legs to 
the music rhythm. The gaming was provided once a 
week for 10 weeks. It was shown that the active 
game play can lead to improvement in the partici­
pant’s cognition, visuospatial, and constructive 
functions. While, the sample size of this study was 
small (n = 9), the duration of the game session and 
the baseline characteristics of the participants have 
not been reported. Swinnen et al. (2021) explored 
the physical, mental, and cognitive effects of an 
active game with “Dividat Senso” device in com­
parison with watching preferred music videos (con­
trol group) for people with major neurocognitive 
disorder living in long-term care facilities. For the 
experiment period was 8 weeks. The gaming group 
had improvement in depression than the control 
group as measured by Cornell Scale for Depression 
in Dementia (CSDD). Their quality of life was also 
improved despite the changes did not reach statis­
tically significant level in comparison with the con­
trol group as measured by Dementia Quality of Life 
questionnaire.
Due to poor study design and small sample size 
in the aforementioned studies, to date, there is a 
lack of sound evidence to support the positive 
effects of active game play on cognition, quality of 
life, and depression for older people with dementia. 
Therefore, this study aims to close this knowl­
edge gap.
We will test the following hypotheses: 
H1: The active game play will result in higher Mini 
Mental State Examination scores compared to the 
control group and baseline after 8 weeks.
H2: The active game play will result in lower 
Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia scores 
compared to the control group and baseline after 
8 weeks.
H3: The active game play will result in higher 
Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease scores com­
pared to the control group and baseline after 8 
weeks.
Methods
Study design and setting
An eight-week pilot/trial was conducted with 
randomized, comparative design. Participants 
were randomly allocated to a gaming (exercise) 
group and a usual-care (control) group (see 
Figure 1). This trial was conducted at Huafeng 
CLINICAL GERONTOLOGIST

community, in Hangzhou city, P.R.China. The 
study site was selected for prior knowledge 
with the study population and rapport with the 
management team from a well-established, 
ongoing research collaboration (Zheng & Chen, 
2017).
Ethics and consent
Ethics approval was acquired from the Hangzhou 
Normal University Ethics Committee (reference 
number: +86-0579-28,865,576). The study aim, 
plan, methods and communication of results 
were presented to and approved by the manage­
ment of the participating organization.
Written informed consent was obtained from 
the participants and/or their primary caregivers 
prior to their inclusion in the study. For those 
participants who had lost the capacity to provide 
written consent, the process model of consent 
was applied (Dewing, 2007). This included iden­
tifying a representative, usually a relative or pri­
mary caregiver, for consent. Further information 
was gathered about the participant’s possible 
means of signaling consent (e.g. personal beha­
vior). The presence or absence of such signals 
was monitored during training to gauge the per­
son’s consent.
Sample size
The sample size was calculated based on the results 
of a previous study conducted in the same popula­
tion with the same outcome measures reporting the 
average difference in a participant’s Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score to be 2.75 with a 
standard deviation (SD) of 2.175 (Chen, 2013). We 
added 20% of allowance for dropouts (Tarraga et al., 
2006; Zhuang et al., 2013). With the significance level 
(α) set at 0.05 and test power (1-β) at 0.80 (one- 
sided), the minimum sample size should be 31 peo­
ple (Friedman, Furberg, & DeMets, 2010). Finally, 
we recruited 48 people allowing for attrition.
Participants
The criteria for inclusion were aged over 60 years, 
with medical diagnosis of dementia by a qualified 
specialist in geriatric medicine or psychiatry; hav­
ing basic listening and comprehension ability; 
CSDD score below 8 (Ru-Jing & Gang, 2008) and 
giving written consent for participation in the study 
by themselves or their primary caregivers.
The criteria for exclusion were bedridden, severe 
hearing or visual impairment to impede basic com­
munication, having acute delirium or confusion, 
terminal illness, or other disease known to affect 
the brain function or cognitive function, such as

Parkinson’s disease or brain tumor, or were cur­
rently participating in another clinical trial or 
gaming.
Recruitment strategies
The Huafeng community runs a senior day care 
center and a nursing home, which was owned by 
the municipality government. Day care center 
offers care and supervision for older people during 
day time. As the study was conducted at these two 
sites in the same community, we sent fliers and 
advertised the study and recruitment process in 
press releases, as well as requesting referral by 
health care providers in the day care center. 19 
people were recruited 9 consented via proxy. The 
study participants in the nursing home were 
referred by the nursing manager. With the approval 
of the management, the researcher sought further 
consent from the family member and the older 
people. Only after written consent was provided 
by the family member and oral consent was given 
by the older person, did the project proceed further, 
with 29 people recruited from the nursing home, 7 
of them consenting via proxy.
We interviewed each participant using the 
MMSE and health history form under the compa­
nion of the family caregiver. If the person’s MMSE 
score was below 26, and had a medical diagnosis of 
dementia from a medical doctor, the person would 
be considered as study participant. However, only 
after further screening using the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, would the person be formally 
recruited into the pilot trial.
Method of randomization
Each eligible person was randomly assigned to 
either exercise or the control group according to a 
random number list. The list was generated with 
SPSS 19.0 by a statistician who was not directly 
involved in the study.
Blinding
After completing the baseline data collection, each 
old person was randomized into the exercise group 
or the control group. To avoid allocation bias, the 
research staff conducting the outcome assessment 
was blind to the allocation of the participant group. 
All participants were informed that they would 
have the opportunity to play the game; the control 
group could play the game after the intervention 
was completed.
Intervention
The length of intervention in the previous studies 
ranged from 1 day to 10 weeks, the duration of 
gaming varied from 5 min to an hour (Zheng, 
Chen, & Yu, 2017). The optimal efficacy was 8 
week intervention period. Therefore, we designed 
the gaming to be offered 1 h/day, 5 days/week for 
8 weeks. The box Kinect system was selected for the 
active game as it was considered feasible for use by 
this population. The game system consists of a 
Kinect sensor and a console. The console controls 
the game. First, a participant was asked to sit in a 
chair that was located 1 to 1.5 m away from the 
Kinect sensor. The position of the sensor was 
adjusted to ensure optimal capture of the person’s 
position and motion by the infrared camera in the 
sensor (Park, Lee, Lee, & Lee, 2017). The training 
was provided by a nursing researcher in a group of 
five to six participants. After the initial training, the 
participants started to play. Each participant played 
the game for 10 minutes each time.
The Kinect game Fruit Ninja was selected as the 
exercise intervention to train the person’s hand-eye 
coordination and motor skills. In the game, a player 
was faced with a variety of fruits flying in all direc­
tions on the screen. The task for the player was to 
use their upper arm as an imaginary sword to cut 
the fruits before they dropped to the bottom of the 
screen. This required the player to focus attention 
on the fruits amidst distractors, and act rapidly 
upon viewing the targets. Points were awarded for 
each successful cut. Bonus points were given if 
several fruits were cut with one slashing motion. 
To standardize the length of play, the game was set 
to last 1 min before a bomb was exploded. A pome­
granate would appear at the end of each game. The 
player could slash it multiple times to win bonus 
points. If the sword touched the bomb, the player 
would be penalized 10 points.
In each session of the game, a researcher accom­
panied a participant to record the person’s score 
and playing time. Motivational suggestions were

given, such as paying attention to the score of the 
last game, trying to beat it and to achieve a personal 
best. The participants also talked and joked with 
each other, sharing experiences of playing and 
achievements in scores, and competing with each 
other in a joyful environment. Upon the appear­
ance of any sign of fatigue, or any abnormalities in 
breathing, the game play was immediately stopped. 
To prevent a fall in the process of play, a participant 
could choose to take the standing position or sitting 
in chair.
The study did not interfere with the participants 
existing pharmacological treatment or nursing care. 
The participants in both groups received their usual 
care.
Outcome measures
The assessment scores on cognition, quality of life, 
and depression for a participant were measured 
before and after 8 weeks of intervention. All mea­
surements were performed by one third-year uni­
versity nursing student who received training on 
these tasks.
Cognition was measured by Mini Mental State 
Examination (MMSE). MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, 
& McHugh, 1975) is the most widely used clinical 
assessment of cognitive function. The Chinese ver­
sion has been translated, modified and validated by 
Katzman and colleges (1988), and it has been tested 
in a Chinese population (Li, Jia, Yang, & Moreau, 
2016; Yu et al., 1989) and found to have excellent 
reliability and validity (test re-test was 0.91, α was 
0.99) (Katzman et al., 1988). The Chinese version of 
the MMSE consists of 30 questions in six domains, 
including 
orientation, 
registration 
(repeating 
named prompts), attention and calculation, recall, 
language skills, and visuospatial construction. 
MMSE is scored from 0 to 30. The higher score 
indicates better cognition. The test for the MMSE 
indicated a good overall alpha (0.73).
Quality of life was measured by the Quality of 
Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD) (Legouverneur, 
Pino, Boulay, & Rigaud, 2011). QoL-AD has 13 items 
covering the domains of physical health, energy, 
mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, 
friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around 
the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and 
life as a whole. QoL-AD is scored from 13 to 52; the 
higher score indicates better QoL.
Depression was measured by the Cornell Scale 
for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) (Chen, 2013). 
CSDD is designed for assessment of depressive 
symptoms in older people with dementia. It con­
sists of questions on mood-related signs, behavioral 
disturbance, physical signs, cyclic functions, and 
ideational disturbance. Items are rated from 0 
(absent) to 2 (severe) or symptom not possible to 
evaluate. A higher overall score indicates severe 
symptoms. The reliability of the Chinese version 
of CSDD was validated with Cronbach’s alpha 
being 0.81 (Ru-Jing & Gang, 2008).
Data analysis
The data included in the analysis were collected 
from the participants who completed both pre- 
and post-intervention measurements. All statistical 
analyses were performed in SPSS19.0. As the data 
for age, MMSE, QoL-AD, and CSDD were contin­
uous data, a t-test was used for within-group ana­
lysis and between-group analysis if the data was 
normally distributed. Otherwise a Mann–Whitney 
u-test was conducted. If the baseline data were 
categorical data, i.e., male and female, χ2 test was 
used for comparison. Difference was considered as 
significant if p < .05. The sizes of within-group 
differences and between-group differences were 
measured by calculating effect size (Cohen’s d) 
and the following intervals were applied for inter­
pretations: 0.2–0.5 representing a small effect size; 
0.5–0.8 representing a medium effect size; and 0.8 
and higher representing a large effect size (Cohen, 
1988; Morris & Deshon, 2002).
Results
Participant flow
Eighteen out of 24 participants in the exercise 
group completed the study. Six people dropped 
out; three suffered from poor physical health, one 
had no time to continue, and two did not give a 
reason. The daily attendance rate of the 18 partici­
pants in the exercise group was 100%. Twenty 
1038

participants in the usual care group completed the 
study; four dropped out without explanation. There 
were no study-related adverse events reported by 
the participants, nor observed by the research team. 
There were no significant between-group differ­
ences in demographic variables and the MMSE, 
QoL-AD, and CSDD scores at the baseline (see 
Table 1).
Effectiveness of intervention on outcomes
Pre- and post-intervention comparisons of each 
group, between groups comparisons are shown in 
Table 2. After the intervention no significant 
between-group differences were found for the 
overall MMSE score (P = .252). The MMSE 
score of the exercise group showed a positive 
trend of improvement after the intervention, 
while did not reach statistically significant (P = 
.247). Therefore, hypothesis H1 was not sup­
ported. However, the exercise group had signifi­
cantly higher levels of quality of life (P = .023) 
and lower levels of depression (P = .000) after the 
intervention. There was no within-group differ­
ence in the control group. A statistically signifi­
cant difference between groups was found on 
quality of life (P = .005) and lower levels of 
depression 
(P 
= 
.001) 
after 
intervention. 
Therefore, hypothesis H2 and H3 were supported.
Discussion
The effects of active game play on older people with 
dementia was evaluated in this study. After receiv­
ing eight-week gaming, no significant change in 
overall cognition was found. This was different 
from a previous meta-analysis finding that video 
gaming can improve several dimensions of cogni­
tion in healthy older people, i.e., improving reac­
tion time, attention and memory (Toril, Reales, & 
Ballesteros, 2014). This might be because the eight- 
week training period was not long enough, or the 
intensity level of exercise was not high enough. 
Another explanation may be that the MMSE mea­
surement may not be sensitive enough in detecting 
changes in cognition in a short eight week period, 
although it has been widely used to effectively test 
the intervention effect on cognition for detecting 
dementia (Creavin et al., 2016). Cheung et al. 
(2019) administered a Cognitive Stimulating Play 
intervention on people with dementia for 8 weeks. 
Their intervention included batting a balloon, mak­
ing handicrafts and card games. The intervention 
improved cognition as measured by Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment. In contrast to Cheung et al. 
(2019), we only provided one type of game; there­
fore, the outcome may not be as effective.
Significant improvement in quality of life and 
depression were achieved in the exercise group. 
Therefore, the positive effects of active game play 
on quality of life and depression in older people 
with dementia was validated in this study. This 
contributes much needed knowledge to support 
the potential inclusion of active game play into 
the non-pharmacological rehabilitation treatment 
for people with dementia.
QoL-AD measurement has been reported to be 
very useful for assessing quality of life for older 
people with dementia (Li et al., 2016). In the train­
ing group, the QoL-AD score was significantly 
improved after the intervention, and in comparison 
with the control group. This may be attributed to 
the active game play incorporating both socially 
and cognitively pleasant, competitive activities 
with physical activities. These can increase social 
interaction and improve mood for older people 
with dementia (Chiang, Tsai, & Chen, 2012), as 
seen in a significant improvement in the mood

score. Similarly, Yoon et al. (2013) found that an 
intervention combining cognitive training with 
active physical exercise can improve QoL of older 
people with dementia. Cahill and Diaz-Ponce 
(2011) suggest that social contact and pleasurable 
activity have significant positive impacts on 
patients’ QoL as the game creates a distraction 
from the mind on illness, thus can block the dete­
rioration of QoL in older people with dementia 
(Castro-Monteiro et al., 2016). Furthermore, the 
process of participating in the game provided the 
older people with a sense of self-achievement. 
These may have all accounted to the significant 
improvement in overall QoL-AD score, and in par­
ticular the scores for mood and friends after the 
eight-week gaming, as well as in comparison with 
the usual care group.
Depression is common among older people with 
dementia. It is associated with rapid cognitive and 
functional decline and increased caregiver burden. 
To date there is a lack of attention and strategy to 
manage this unavoidable symptom of dementia. 
Swinnen et al. (2021) found that an exergaming 
program can reduce depression of people with 
major neurocognitive disorder. Loneliness and 
lack of social support are associated with depres­
sion (Hermida, McDonald, Steenland, & Levey, 
2012; Santini et al., 2016). Situating in a group 
setting undoubtedly increased social interaction 
for the participants who were in the gaming. 
Motivational feedback such as the encouraging 
remarks made by the group members and the sup­
porting researcher could make the participants feel 
respected, boost self-esteem, and gain a sense of 
identity. The real-time, visual, and audio emotional 
support and performance feedback from the game 
were also fun and appealing, evoking a sense of 
meaning and self-actualization. There is no doubt 
that the game was effective in relieving depression 
for these older people with dementia.
Limitations
Four limitations are identified for this study. The 
first is the convenience sampling and confined sam­
ple size that may reduce generalizability. Due to a 
lack of rigorous prior research for this study to refer 
to, the sample size calculation was based on a small 
study conducted with similar participants but with 
different MMSE score. This may lead to the sample 
size calculation being less accurate. Second, most of 
the participants were receiving drug treatment and it 
was not appropriate to ask them to quit since the 
study was performed in a naturalistic setting; there­
fore, the finding could be compounded by dementia- 
related medications. As the participants were accom­
panied by a researcher in the entire process gaming 
process, the effect of the amenable social interactions 
with a young, friendly female nurse cannot be 
ignored in explaining the findings. Third, the study 
was limited to one community in Hangzhou which 
may limit generalizability to other groups and as the 
gaming was situated in a group setting, it is also 
possible that the improvements in quality of life 
and depression in acquired in our study was attrib­
uted to social interaction. Fourth, further follow-up 
assessment, outcome assessment after a longer per­
iod, i.e., half or one-year intervention, may increase

the rigor of the findings. Further comparative study 
between gaming and other group intervention are 
needed to investigate the impact of the social factor.
Clinical implications
The eight-week group active game play led to 
improvements in quality of life and reduction in 
depression for the older people with dementia. This 
supports its potential inclusion into the non-phar­
macological interventions for older people with 
dementia.
