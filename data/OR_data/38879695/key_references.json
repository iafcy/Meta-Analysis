Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games are a combination of physical activity and cognitive training. The objective of this study was to determine the short- and long-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games on slowness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive functions in older subjects with MCI.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nA clinical trial was conducted on 44 MCI subjects. Both males and females were randomized into experimental group (participated in Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games) and control group (range of motion exercises only and no Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games). Subjects were assessed before and after one session of game intervention for short-term effects and after 6 weeks for long-term effects. The outcome measures were the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), trail making test (TMT) A and B, and slowness and complexity of EEG.\n## RESULTS\nAfter one session of game intervention, delta (0.704\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025; P\u2009=\u20090.013), theta (0.128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.009; P\u2009=\u20090.00127) waves, and complexity of EEG (0.642\u2009\u00b1\u20090.042; P\u2009=\u20090.008) significantly improved, in eyes closed state.

Exercise yields cognitive benefits, but few older adults exercise. Virtual reality-enhanced exercise or \"exergames\" may elicit greater participation.\n## PURPOSE\nTo test the following hypotheses: (1) stationary cycling with virtual reality tours (\"cybercycle\") will enhance executive function and clinical status more than traditional exercise; (2) exercise effort will explain improvement; and (3) brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) will increase.\n## DESIGN\nMulti-site cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the impact of 3 months of cybercycling versus traditional exercise, on cognitive function in older adults. Data were collected in 2008-2010; analyses were conducted in 2010-2011.\n## SETTING/PARTICIPANTS\n102 older adults from eight retirement communities enrolled; 79 were randomized and 63 completed.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nA recumbent stationary ergometer was utilized; virtual reality tours and competitors were enabled on the cybercycle.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nExecutive function (Color Trails Difference, Stroop C, Digits Backward); clinical status (mild cognitive impairment; MCI); exercise effort/fitness; and plasma BDNF.\n## RESULTS\nIntent-to-treat analyses, controlling for age, education, and cluster randomization, revealed a significant group X time interaction for composite executive function (p=0.002). Cybercycling yielded a medium effect over traditional exercise (d=0.50). Cybercyclists had a 23% relative risk reduction in clinical progression to MCI. Exercise effort and fitness were comparable, suggesting another underlying mechanism. A significant group X time interaction for BDNF (p=0.05) indicated enhanced neuroplasticity among cybercyclists.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCybercycling older adults achieved better cognitive function than traditional exercisers, for the same effort, suggesting that simultaneous cognitive and physical exercise has greater potential for preventing cognitive decline.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThis study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01167400.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nExercise is often proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to delay cognitive decline in people\u00a0with dementia, but evidence remains inconclusive. Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.\n## METHODS\nA three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually trained three times a week during 12\u2009weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of covariance.\n## RESULTS\nData from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age\u2009=\u200979.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score\u2009=\u200922.9 (3.4)) were analysed.

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.",

Analysis of the subjects for group-time interactions revealed that the intervention group exhibited a significantly improved executive function and brain function at the resting state. Additionally, gait speed and mobility were also significantly improved between and after the follow-up. The VR-based training program improved cognitive and physical function in patients with MCI relative to controls. Encouraging patients to perform VR and game-based training may be beneficial to prevent cognitive decline.\n",

            "abstract": "Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily living. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the intervention group (n = 30; 70.12 \u00b1 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 \u00b1 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our results showed that 12 weeks of VR-based rehabilitation enhanced cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Using VR applications in CR is recommended to improve cognitive functions of older adults with MCI.",

Exergaming, which combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment, was developed to overcome barriers in performing physical activities. We evaluated the effects of exergaming in day care centers (DCCs) for PwD and informal caregivers (ICs).\n## DESIGN\nA randomized controlled trial among 23 DCCs across the Netherlands randomized to exergaming (interactive cycling during 6\u00a0months) or a care-as-usual control group.\n## SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nA total of 112 (73 exergaming, 39 control) community-dwelling dyads (PwD, IC), with the PwD visiting a DCC at least twice per week.\n## METHODS\nAll outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires during interviews with PwD and ICs at baseline (T0), 3\u00a0months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Primary outcomes: physical activity and mobility of the PwD.\n## SECONDARY OUTCOMES\nphysical, cognitive, emotional and social functioning, and quality of life for PwD. For ICs: experienced burden, quality of life, and positive care experiences.\n## RESULTS\nMixed-model analyses showed no statistically significant effects on primary outcomes. There were statistically significant positive effects on PwD's secondary outcomes at T2 on cognition [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): r\u00a0=\u00a02.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 3.96, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007; and Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A): r\u00a0=\u00a0-28.98, 95% CI:\u00a0-54.89,\u00a0-3.08, P\u00a0=\u00a0.029], social functioning (Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatrics subscale 1 (GIP): r\u00a0=\u00a0-1.86, 95% CI:\u00a0-3.56,\u00a0-0.17, P\u00a0=\u00a0.031), and positive post-test effects in ICs on distress caused by the PwD's neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q total distress: r\u00a0=\u00a0-3.30, 95% CI:\u00a0-6.57,\u00a0-0.03, P\u00a0=\u00a0.048) and on sense of competence (SSCQ: r\u00a0=\u00a02.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nExergaming appeared not effective on the primary outcomes. Despite the study being underpowered, we found positive effects on secondary outcomes for PwD and ICs, and no negative effects. We therefore recommend further study, dissemination, and implementation.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDespite increasing interest in the effects of exergaming on cognitive function, little is known about its effects on older adults with dementia.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this is to investigate the effects of exergaming on executive and physical functions in older adults with dementia compared to regular aerobic exercise.\n## METHODS\nIn total, 24 older adults with moderate dementia participated in the study. Participants were randomized into either the exergame group (EXG, n=13, 54%) or the aerobic exercise group (AEG, n=11, 46%). For 12 weeks, EXG engaged in a running-based exergame and AEG performed a cycling exercise. At baseline and postintervention, participants underwent the Ericksen flanker test (accuracy % and response time [RT]) while recording event-related potentials (ERPs) that included the N2 and P3b potentials. Participants also underwent the senior fitness test (SFT) and the body composition test pre- and postintervention. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to assess the effects of time (pre- vs postintervention), group (EXG vs AEG), and group\u00d7time interactions.\n## RESULTS\nCompared to AEG, EXG demonstrated greater improvements in the SFT (F\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that exergaming may be associated with greater improvements in brain neuronal activity and enhanced executive function task performance than regular aerobic exercise.
