            "abstract": "Background and objectives:\n        \n      \n      Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes cognitive impairment in approximately 50% of cases. Disease modifying medications and cognitive rehabilitation produce only small positive effects on cognition in MS. Converging animal and human research suggests that aerobic exercise may improve cognition in people with MS, but definitive trials are lacking. We describe the design of the GET Smart study, a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of aerobic exercise versus stretching and toning on cognition in MS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study is a single-blind, parallel group randomized (1:1) controlled trial that compares aerobic exercise training with an active control group consisting of stretching and toning exercises for improving cognition. Participants are nondepressed, ambulatory, non-exercising adults with MS aged 18-54 years who have below average cognitive processing speed. Both treatments were designed to generate equivalent outcome expectancies and entailed supervised, progressive exercise programs, 3 times per week for up to 40 min over a 6 month period.\n    \n\n\n          Projected patient outcomes:\n        \n      \n      The primary hypothesis is that the aerobic training group will demonstrate significantly greater cognitive processing speed compared with the control group at the end of the treatment phase (6 months) as measured by a composite of the Paced Auditory Serial Additon Test and the oral Symbol-Digit Modalities Test using intent-to treat analyses. Secondary outcomes are neuropsychological functioning and cardiorespiratory fitness as well as participant reported outcomes such as depression, sleep, and fatigue. Study findings will inform future research, patient education, clinical care and policymaking.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02106052."

Motor-cognitive impairments contribute to postural instability, often leading to falls and decreased physical activity. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a multimodal training (MMT) versus single-modal (SMT) training on motor symptoms, fall frequency, and physical activity in patients with PD classified as fallers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Individuals with PD were randomized into SMT (n = 11) or MMT (n = 10) and completed training 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The SMT completed gait and cognitive training separately, whereas MMT completed gait and cognitive training simultaneously during each 45-minute session. Physical activity, 30-day fall frequency, and PD motor symptoms were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and during a 4-week follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both groups exhibited significant (P < .05) improvements in clinical ratings of motor function, as symptoms improved by 8% and 15% for SMT and MMT, respectively. Physical activity significantly increased (P < .05) for both groups from baseline (mean steps 4942 [4415]) to posttreatment (mean steps 5914 [5425]). The MMT resulted in a significant 60% reduction in falls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although SMT and MMT approaches are both effective in improving physical activity and motor symptoms of PD, only MMT reduced fall frequency after the intervention."

            "abstract": "Approximately 35% of individuals with dementia exhibit depression and/or anxiety symptoms, often manifested by symptoms of negative affect. Exercise has been associated with improved affect but has not been demonstrated to improve affect in residents of secured dementia units in long-term care facilities. This pilot study determined whether moderate-intensity, chair-based exercise was associated with changes in negative affect in residents in secured units. The sample included 36 patients from 2 nursing homes who participated in a 12-week, 30-minute moderate-intensity group exercise program thrice weekly. Affect, measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Apparent Affect Rating Scale, was assessed at weeks 3 and 12, before and after each exercise session. Paired t tests assessed the immediate effect of exercise (before/after a session) and the long-term effect of exercise (study initiation/12 wk) on patients' affect ratings. The mean age was 85 years (SD=5.5), with 86% female, and 97% white. At week 3, anxiety was significantly lower immediately after the exercise session when adjusted for level of participation (P=0.02) compared with immediately before the exercise session, indicating immediate changes in affect. Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced at week 12, when compared with week 3, after adjusting for level of participation (P=0.01; P=0.03), indicating long-term effects of the exercise intervention. The study revealed the feasibility of conducting a moderate-intensity exercise program and the potential for exercise as a nonpharmacologic intervention for reducing symptoms of negative affect and depression in this vulnerable population."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dementia is associated with cognitive and functional deficits, and poses a significant personal, societal, and economic burden. Directing interventions towards older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints may provide the greatest impact on dementia incidence and prevalence. Risk factors for cognitive and functional deficits are multifactorial in nature; many are cardiovascular disease risk factors and are lifestyle-mediated. Evidence suggests that multiple-modality exercise programs can provide cognitive and functional benefits that extend beyond what can be achieved from cognitive, aerobic, or resistance training alone, and preliminary evidence suggests that novel mind-motor interventions (i.e., Square Stepping Exercise; SSE) can benefit cognition and functional fitness. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether multiple-modality exercise combined with mind-motor interventions can benefit diverse cognitive and functional outcomes in older adults with cognitive complaints.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The Multiple-Modality, Mind-Motor (M4) study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the cognitive and functional impact of combined physical and cognitive training among community-dwelling adults with self-reported cognitive complaints who are 55 years of age or older. Participants are randomized to a Multiple-Modality and Mind-Motor (M4) intervention group or a Multiple-Modality (M2) comparison group. Participants exercise for 60 minutes/day, 3-days/week for 24 weeks and are assessed at baseline, 24 weeks and 52 weeks. The primary outcome is global cognitive function at 24 weeks, derived from the Cambridge Brain Sciences computerized cognitive battery. Secondary outcomes are: i) global cognitive function at 52 weeks; ii) domain-specific cognitive function at 24 and 52 weeks; iii) mobility (gait characteristics under single and dual-task conditions and balance); and 3) vascular health (blood pressure and carotid arterial measurements).

After searching a range of academic databases (CINHAL, PSYCinfo, and Web of Science), the studies evaluated (N = 16) were categorized as CCT (N = 10), VRCT (N = 3), and multimodal interventions (N = 3). Effect sizes were calculated, but a meta-analysis was not possible because of the large variability of study design and outcome measures adopted. The cognitive domains of attention, executive function, and memory (visual and verbal) showed the most consistent improvements. The positive effects on psychological outcomes (N = 6) were significant reductions on depressive symptoms (N = 3) and anxiety (N = 2) and improved perceived use of memory strategy (N = 1). Assessments of activities of daily living demonstrated no significant improvements (N = 8). Follow-up studies (N = 5) demonstrated long-term improvements in cognitive and psychological outcomes (N = 3), and the intervention groups showed a plateau effect of cognitive functioning compared with the cognitive decline experienced by control groups (N = 2). CCT and VRCT were moderately effective in long-term improvement of cognition for those at high risk of cognitive decline. Total intervention time did not mediate efficacy. Future research needs to improve study design by including larger samples, longitudinal designs, and a greater range of outcome measures, including functional and quality of life measures, to assess the wider effect of cognitive training on individuals at high risk of cognitive decline."

However, no direct data from randomized trials exists to support these indirect observations. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible relationship of aerobic exercise dose on cognition. Underactive or sedentary participants without cognitive impairment were randomized to one of four groups: no-change control, 75, 150, and 225 minutes per week of moderate-intensity semi-supervised aerobic exercise for 26-weeks in a community setting. Cognitive outcomes were latent residual scores derived from a battery of 16 cognitive tests: Verbal Memory, Visuospatial Processing, Simple Attention, Set Maintenance and Shifting, and Reasoning. Other outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and measures of function functional health. In intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses (n = 101), cardiorespiratory fitness increased and perceived disability decreased in a dose-dependent manner across the 4 groups. No other exercise-related effects were observed in ITT analyses. Analyses restricted to individuals who exercised per-protocol (n = 77) demonstrated that Simple Attention improved equivalently across all exercise groups compared to controls and a dose-response relationship was present for Visuospatial Processing. A clear dose-response relationship exists between exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. Cognitive benefits were apparent at low doses with possible increased benefits in visuospatial function at higher doses but only in those who adhered to the exercise protocol. An individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness response was a better predictor of cognitive gains than exercise dose (i.e., duration) and thus maximizing an individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness may be an important therapeutic target for achieving cognitive benefits.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01129115."

Exercise has shown many beneficial effects in cancer prevention and anticancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To contribute to our understanding of the role of exercise regulation in cancer and provide recommendations for future preclinical and clinical exercise oncology research, we examine the functions of exercise in cancer and its underlying mechanisms. In addition to reducing the incidence of cancer, exercise can enhance the efficacy of certain types of approved anticancer treatments (e.g., targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy) and reduce the symptoms/side effects of cancer and its treatment (e.g., fatigue, cancer cachexia, cognitive impairment, and depression). The mechanisms mediating these effects include the regulation of intratumoral angiogenesis, myokines, adipokines and their associated pathways, cancer metabolism, and anticancer immunity. Cancer rehabilitation guidelines advise cancer survivors to perform exercises. Many ongoing clinical trials have investigated the effects and mechanisms of exercise in cancer. This review supports the prescription of exercise for cancer prevention to sensitize cancer to anticancer therapy and manage associated symptoms and side effects after cancer diagnosis."

            "abstract": "Background: Off-the-shelf digital gaming technology has been shown to support the well-being of people with dementia. Yet, to date, it is rarely adopted within dementia care practice, particularly within care homes. Drawing on a descriptive, qualitative approach, this is the first study that has sought to explore care home practitioners' perceptions of the barriers and facilitators for using gaming technology within their workplace. Method: Data were collected across eight focus groups in the south of England with a total of 39 care home workers. These were analysed inductively following the 6-stage thematic process as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006). Findings: Three themes, constructed from the data suggested, the care environment, staff knowledge and skills for inclusive gaming, and staff perceptions about capabilities (their own and those of people with dementia) inhibited or facilitated the use of gaming technology in care homes. The findings were interpreted through a combination of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour model and the Theoretical Domains Framework to provide theory-based insights into the mechanisms for supporting behaviour change and implementation within the care home context. Conclusions: We argue for the need to target wider institutional barriers alongside providing inclusive training for care staff on incorporating gaming technology within their person-centred care approaches. Through these mechanisms, they can be provided with the capabilities, opportunities and motivation to integrate gaming technology within their practice, and thus facilitate the process of culture change within care homes."

Feasibility questions were on: recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery, adherence and withdrawals, level of supervision required, adverse events, data collection and sample size assumptions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a three-arm, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled feasibility trial. Eligibility criteria were aged 65 years or older, diagnosed mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment, able to walk without human help, and communicate in English, no co-morbidities that prevented participation in cognitive assessment and capacity to give consent. Participants were recruited from Memory Assessment Service clinics and the 'Join Dementia Research' register. Patient participants were randomised 1:1:1 to a high intensity supervision PrAISED intervention, moderate intensity supervision PrAISED intervention or brief falls prevention assessment and advice (control). The PrAISED intervention aimed for participants to complete three hours of PrAISED exercises a week for 12 months. It included individualised activity and exercise plans and supervised exercises with regular re-assessment and progression, and was delivered by occupational therapists, physiotherapists and rehabilitation support workers. Primary efficacy outcome was the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), measured after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, quality of life, mood, cognition, strength, balance, rate of falls, frailty and carer strain. Falls and activity were ascertained by monthly diary.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between September 2016 and March 2017 we recruited 60 patient participants and 54 carer participants from two sites. Forty-nine patient participants completed a follow-up interview. Feasibility outcomes were mostly satisfactory, including recruitment and retention, intervention delivery and data completeness for most scales used. We could not maintain blinding of researchers at follow-up and experienced difficulties collecting data using some questionnaires and devices. Participants only completed a mean 77 (moderate supervision) and 71 (high supervision) minutes per week of PrAISED exercises over 12 months.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring impairments. However, given the life-long plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying neuronal reorganization. Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be mobilized. Novel technology based neurorehabilitation techniques hold promise to address this issue. Here we describe a Virtual Reality (VR) based system, the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) that is based on a number of hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recovery, the structure of training and the role of individualization. We investigate the psychometrics of the RGS in stroke patients and healthy controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We describe the key components of the RGS and the psychometrics of one rehabilitation scenario called Spheroids. We performed trials with 21 acute/subacute stroke patients and 20 healthy controls to study the effect of the training parameters on task performance. This allowed us to develop a Personalized Training Module (PTM) for online adjustment of task difficulty. In addition, we studied task transfer between physical and virtual environments. Finally, we assessed the usability and acceptance of the RGS as a rehabilitation tool.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We show that the PTM implemented in RGS allows us to effectively adjust the difficulty and the parameters of the task to the user by capturing specific features of the movements of the arms. The results reported here also show a consistent transfer of movement kinematics between physical and virtual tasks. Moreover, our usability assessment shows that the RGS is highly accepted by stroke patients as a rehabilitation tool.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We introduce a novel VR based paradigm for neurorehabilitation, RGS, which combines specific rehabilitative principles with a psychometric evaluation to provide a personalized and automated training. Our results show that the RGS effectively adjusts to the individual features of the user, allowing for an unsupervised deployment of individualized rehabilitation protocols."

Exercising in virtual reality environments (VR Exergame) is becoming an increasingly feasible and enjoyable way to promote PA and well-being in PLWD/MCI. Although co-design can significantly improve the design of technology, it is rarely done with PLWD/MCI.

Thus, we analyzed the overall and age-stratified effect of physical activity on risk of dementia in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Participants of the ELSA, aged over 50 with MCI, were followed-up nine times between 2002 and 2019. Physical activity was assessed using a self-reported, validated questionnaire and participants were classified as inactive, low, or moderate-to-high active. Medical diagnosis of dementia was self-reported or determined using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Data from 521 participants with MCI were analyzed (56% women; mean [SD] age, 68.7 [10.6]). Over 17-year follow-up, 20.5 (95%CI: 17.3 to 24.2)% were diagnosed with dementia. The risk of incident dementia was reduced in participants engaging in low (HR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.22 to 0.54) or moderate-to-high (HR: 0.16; 95%CI: 0.08 to 0.33) levels of physical activity. Risk of dementia in adults aged 80 or more engaging in low or moderate-to-high levels of physical activity was not different from inactive adults aged between 50 and 69 years. Results were sustained after competing risk regression model and sensitivity analyses to reduce the impact of reverse causality. Physical activity appears to minimize the risk associated with aging in older adults with MCI."

The goal of the present investigation is to examine the effects of 4 weeks of supervised, over-ground gait training using a robotic exoskeleton (RE) compared with a control condition (conventional gait therapy, CGT) in persons with MS with ambulatory and cognition disabilities. Four subjects (mean age=50 years, three females) with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) participated in this study and completed a total of eight sessions (1-hour/session) gait training in a standard therapy gym either using a RE supervised by an RE training physical therapist (PT) or with the CGT supervised by a PT. Outcome measures (walking speed and temporal-spatial parameters) were measured on a level surface without RE using an instrumented walkway, for both groups, pre- and post-intervention. The two participants in the RE group were also tested in the same testing environment, while wearing a RE pre- and post-intervention. Cognitive processing speed was assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) pre- and post-intervention. Subjects in the RE group tested without a RE increased average walking speed, stride length, and step length with decreased stride width and step time bilaterally after the 8-session of RE training. The two participants in the CGT group only had modest improvements in walking performance. Furthermore, while the CGT group had no improvements in the processing speed (SDMT scores), an average of 80% improvement in the processing speed was noted in the RE group."

Logistic regression analyses showed that participants in the highest tertile of the processed food pattern score were more likely to have poorer cognitive functioning; in the lowest tertile of executive function (OR 2.55; 95% CI: 1.08-6.03); as assessed by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination. In a group of older people with MCI; a diet high in processed foods was associated with some level of cognitive impairment."

Sixty-one long-term hospitalized patients with schizophrenia were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: Baduanjin exercise and brisk walking. Patients in the Baduanjin group received 24 weeks of Baduanjin training (5 days/week, 40 min/day), while patients in the brisk walking group received 24 weeks of brisk walking (5 days/week, 40 min/day). Scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the positive and negative syndrome scale were used to evaluate the logical memory (LM), processing speed, and clinical symptoms of all participants, while the score of Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A) was applied to assess the visual attention and graphomotor speed, at baseline and the 16th week and 24th week of intervention. The one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the differences in neurocognitive changes between the two groups. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the two groups in the LM immediate (F = 6.21, p = 0.003) and LM delayed (F=5.60, p = 0.005) scores, but not in the completion times of TMT-A (F=.22, p = 0.806) or DSST scores (F=0.97, p = 0.328). A significant effect of time was also detected in the LM immediate (F=10.24, p = 0.000) and LM delayed (F=4.93, p = 0.009) scores and in the completion time of the TMT-A (F=33.10, p = 0.000), but not in the DSST scores (F=2.12, p = 0.122).

            "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders are characterized by difficulties in communicating and cooperating with other people. Impairment in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer what another person is thinking, may contribute to these social deficits. The present study assesses the relationship between autistic traits and decision-making in a socioeconomic game environment that measures ToM and cooperation. We quantified participant strategy during game play with computer agents that simulated aspects of ToM or fixed strategy agents with static behaviors or heuristics. Individuals with higher Autism Quotient (AQ) scores cooperated less than subjects with low AQ scores with the ToM agents. In contrast, subjects with higher AQ scores cooperated more with fixed strategy agents. Additionally, subjects with higher AQ scores spent more time than low AQ subjects signaling cooperative intent in games with fixed strategy agents while spending less time signaling cooperation with adaptive agents, indicating a preference toward systemizing behaviors in the face of uncertainty. We conclude that individuals with high levels of autistic traits are less likely to utilize ToM as a cognitive strategy, even when it is beneficial, to achieve a desired outcome."

The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test the feasibility and effects of controlled visual and acoustic stimulation in a virtual reality (VR) setup in the ICU. The VR setup consisted of a head-mounted display in combination with an eye tracker and sensors to assess vital signs. The stimulation consisted of videos featuring natural scenes and was tested in 37 healthy participants in the ICU. The VR stimulation led to a reduction of heart rate (p = 0. 049) and blood pressure (p = 0.044). Fixation/saccade ratio (p < 0.001) was increased when a visual target was presented superimposed on the videos (reduced search activity), reflecting enhanced visual processing. Overall, the VR stimulation had a relaxing effect as shown in vital markers of physical stress and participants explored less when attending the target.

            "abstract": "Although there is no unanimity, growing evidence supports the value of regular physical exercise to prevent Alzheimer's disease as well as cognitive decline in affected patients. Together with an introductory summary on epidemiological evidence, the aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the potential biological mechanisms underlying exercise benefits in this condition. Regular physical exercise has proven to be beneficial for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., reduced vascular flow, diabetes) involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Exercise also promotes neurogenesis via increases in exercise-induced metabolic factors (e.g., ketone bodies, lactate) and muscle-derived myokines (cathepsin-B, irisin), which in turn stimulate the production of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Finally, regular exercise exerts anti-inflammatory effects and improves the brain redox status, thereby ameliorating the pathophysiological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., amyloid-β deposition). In summary, physical exercise might provide numerous benefits through different pathways that might, in turn, help prevent risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease. More evidence is needed, however, based on human studies."

CFS presents as a common, debilitating and serious health problem. Treatment may include physical interventions, such as exercise therapy, which was last reviewed in 2004.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy (ET) for patients with CFS as compared with any other intervention or control.• Exercise therapy versus 'passive control' (e.g. treatment as usual, waiting-list control, relaxation, flexibility).• Exercise therapy versus other active treatment (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive treatment, supportive therapy, pacing, pharmacological therapy such as antidepressants).• Exercise therapy in combination with other specified treatment strategies versus other specified treatment strategies (e.g. exercise combined with pharmacological treatment vs pharmacological treatment alone).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014 using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished or ongoing trials through the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to May 2014). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Studies had to compare exercise therapy with passive control, psychological therapies, adaptive pacing therapy or pharmacological therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We combined serious adverse reactions and drop-outs using risk ratios (RRs). We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We have included eight randomised controlled studies and have reported data from 1518 participants in this review. Three studies diagnosed individuals with CFS using the 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); five used the Oxford criteria. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 to 26 weeks. Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, whilst one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control (eight studies; e.g. treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility) or CBT (two studies), cognitive therapy (one study), supportive listening (one study), pacing (one study), pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Risk of bias varied across studies, but within each study, little variation was found in the risk of bias across our primary and secondary outcome measures.Investigators compared exercise therapy with 'passive' control in eight trials, which enrolled 971 participants. Seven studies consistently showed a reduction in fatigue following exercise therapy at end of treatment, even though the fatigue scales used different scoring systems: an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 11 points (MD -6.06, 95% CI -6.95 to -5.17; one study, 148 participants; low-quality evidence); the same 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD -2.82, 95% CI -4.07 to -1.57; three studies, 540 participants; moderate-quality evidence); and a 14-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 42 points (MD -6.80, 95% CI -10.31 to -3.28; three studies, 152 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Serious adverse reactions were rare in both groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; one study, 319 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but sparse data made it impossible for review authors to draw conclusions. Study authors reported a positive effect of exercise therapy at end of treatment with respect to sleep (MD -1.49, 95% CI -2.95 to -0.02; two studies, 323 participants), physical functioning (MD 13.10, 95% CI 1.98 to 24.22; five studies, 725 participants) and self-perceived changes in overall health (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.40; four studies, 489 participants). It was not possible for review authors to draw conclusions regarding the remaining outcomes.Investigators compared exercise therapy with CBT in two trials (351 participants). One trial (298 participants) reported little or no difference in fatigue at end of treatment between the two groups using an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD 0.20, 95% CI -1.49 to 1.89). Both studies measured differences in fatigue at follow-up, but neither found differences between the two groups using an 11-item fatigue scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD 0.30, 95% CI -1.45 to 2.05) and a nine-item Fatigue Severity Scale with a scoring system of 1 to 7 points (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.14). Serious adverse reactions were rare in both groups (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96). We observed little or no difference in physical functioning, depression, anxiety and sleep, and we were not able to draw any conclusions with regard to pain, self-perceived changes in overall health, use of health service resources and drop-out rate.With regard to other comparisons, one study (320 participants) suggested a general benefit of exercise over adaptive pacing, and another study (183 participants) a benefit of exercise over supportive listening. The available evidence was too sparse to draw conclusions about the effect of pharmaceutical interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes. A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but no conclusions for the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible. The effectiveness of exercise therapy seems greater than that of pacing but similar to that of CBT. Randomised trials with low risk of bias are needed to investigate the type, duration and intensity of the most beneficial exercise intervention."

Currently, no effective treatment is available. Cognitive training is effective in relieving cognitive dysfunctions in several -neurodegenerative- diseases, and earlier small-scale trials have shown positive results for PD.

The decline in functional capacity and mobility was assessed using the Barthel index. Some 221 participants were included. Results from the multivariate logistic regression showed how residents who never participated in physical activities had a five-fold higher risk of mobility decline compared with residents who did engage for the whole follow-up time. A lower effect was seen in residents who participated for only 6 months. Although dementia appeared to be a significant predictor of decline, a substantial stabilisation in mobility capacity was noted in patients with both mild and severe dementia performing exercise. The findings suggest that preventing or slowing physical decline in nursing home residents is an achievable goal, and even those with a higher degree of cognitive decline may benefit from a tailored physical activity plan."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Patients suffering from the Fibromyalgia (FM) have impaired cognitive function, reduced physical activity and more marked depressive symptoms. While physical activity and exercise therapy are not typically part of the standard treatment for this syndrome, there is mounting evidence that regular participation in activities involving physical exertion has a positive impact on psychological functioning in people with FM. This study compares the impact of two different interventions, aerobic exercise training and Zumba dancing, on working memory, motor function and depressive symptoms among female patients with FM. The design also included a control condition.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A total of sixty middle-aged female patients with FM (mean age: 35.76 years) and undergoing standard care took part in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: aerobic exercise training, Zumba dancing, or control. At baseline and 12 weeks later after the end of the intervention, participants' working memory, motor function and depressive symptom severity were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Working memory, motor function and depressive symptoms improved over time, but only in the aerobic exercise training and Zumba dancing conditions than in the control condition.

            "abstract": "Classically, cognitive deficits have been studied and treated in isolation from each other. A stroke patient is classified as being memory impaired, having executive dysfunction or showing attentional deficits after which a dedicated rehabilitation therapy is given. Studies seldom looked at the relationship between these different cognitive domains and syndromes, although, there is evidence that they might share common neuronal substrates and do not occur in isolation. Here, we propose a novel rehabilitation method in virtual reality to treat cognitive deficits in conjunction and report the preliminary results of an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial. The current results suggest that in a homogeneous patient group the cognitive deficits are correlated and that the individual impairment level can be optimally addressed through an adaptive training paradigm."

            "abstract": "We performed a pilot randomized, controlled trial of intensive, computer-based cognitive training in 47 subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 min/d, 5 d/wk for 6 weeks; the control group performed more passive computer activities (reading, listening, visuospatial game) for similar amounts of time. Subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60% were men; 77% successfully completed training. On our primary outcome, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scores improved 0.36 standard deviations (SD) in the intervention group (P=0.097) compared with 0.03 SD in the control group (P=0.88) for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 0.33 SD (P=0.26). On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects. We conclude that intensive, computer-based mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted."

Both training interventions involve the use of the smart±step home-based computerised game playing system for a recommended 120 min/week for 12 months. Cognitive training group participants will use a desktop electronic touch pad to play games with the smart±step system while seated and using both hands. The cognitive-motor training group participants will use a wireless electronic floor step mat that requires accurate stepping using both legs for playing the same smart±step games, hence incorporating balance exercises. All groups will receive an education booklet on fall prevention.

Demonstrating that VR MCI scenarios can elicit the same desired stress response achieved in live-action exercises is a first step in showing non-inferiority. The primary objective of this study was to measure changes in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response via a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) in subjects participating in a VR MCI scenario.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An MCI simulation was filmed with a 360º camera and shown to participants on a VR headset while simultaneously recording electrocardiography (EKG) and HRV activity. Baseline HRV was measured during a calm VR scenario immediately prior to exposure to the MCI scenarios, and SNS activation was captured as a decrease in HRV compared to baseline. Cognitive stress was measured using a validated questionnaire. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank analysis, Welch's t-test, and multivariate logistic regression were performed with statistical significance established at P <.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-five subjects were enrolled: eight attending physicians (two surgeons, six Emergency Medicine [EM] specialists); 13 residents (five Surgery, eight EM); and 14 medical students (six pre-clinical, eight clinical-year students). Sympathetic nervous system activation was observed in all groups during the MCI compared to baseline (P <.0001) and occurred independent of age, sex, years of experience, or prior MCI response experience. Overall, 23/35 subjects (65.7%) reported increased cognitive stress in the MCI (11/14 medical students, 9/13 residents, and 3/8 attendings). Resident and attending physicians had higher odds of discordance between SNS activation and cognitive stress compared to medical students (OR = 8.297; 95% CI, 1.408-64.60; P = .030).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Live-actor VR MCI simulation elicited a strong sympathetic response across all groups.

            "abstract": "Non-pharmacological preventive strategies to delay cognitive decline have become the focus of recent research. This review aims to discuss evidence supporting the use of physical and cognitive activity to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in later life. Both strategies are associated with better cognitive health in older adults. This positive effect seems stronger for middle-aged and older adults with normal cognition and less clear when cognitive impairment is present. Physical and cognitive activities have been linked to indirect and direct biological factors affecting brain health. Future research will need to explore details about type, intensity, duration and combination of interventions. An important aim is standardization between studies, as well as evidence of improved clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Identifying strategies that succeed at sustaining improved lifestyle is necessary, and the use of modern technology could play a crucial role in this regard. In the meantime advice on physical and cognitive activities should be included when health advice is given to middle-aged and older adults."

            "abstract": "Commercial advertising of computerized \"brain games\" may result in clinicians being asked whether brain games prevent dementia. To address this question, we conducted a review of computerized cognitive training (CCT) interventions in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Studies were identified using a PubMed and PSYCinfo search for review articles. Within 11 review articles we identified 15 unique studies. Nine of these studies used commercially available \"brain games\" as their primary CCT intervention. Nine of 12 studies that examined the effect of CCT on episodic memory performance showed significant improvements in this domain. Furthermore, four of six studies that examined mood and or anxiety showed improvements in these domains following a CCT intervention. While more than double the amount of time was spent on the training that used commercially available \"brain games\" versus those designed by investigators, there were no differences in outcomes. Overall, it appears that \"brain games\" may modestly benefit aspects of cognition and aspects of mood in patients presenting with MCI. However, there is no direct evidence from the studies presented here that \"brain games\"/CCT can prevent dementia. We present recommendations to consider when discussing \"brain games\" with persons with MCI."

            "abstract": "Lewy body dementia (consisting of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterised by visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention, motor disturbances, falls, and sensitivity to antipsychotics. This combination of features presents challenges for pharmacological management. Given this, we sought to review evidence for non-pharmacological interventions with patients with Lewy body dementia and their carers. Bibliographic databases were searched using a wide range of search terms and no restrictions were placed on study design, language, or clinical setting. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, rated study quality, and extracted data. The search identified 21 studies including two randomised controlled trials with available subgroup data, seven case series, and 12 case studies. Most studies reported beneficial effects of the interventions used, though the only sizeable study was on dysphagia, showing a benefit of honey-thickened liquids. Given the heterogeneity of interventions and poor quality of the studies overall, no quantitative synthesis was possible. Overall, identified studies suggested possible benefits of non-pharmacological interventions in Lewy body dementia, but the small sample sizes and low quality of studies mean no definite recommendations can be offered. Our findings underscore the clear and urgent need for future research on this topic."

The current systematic review examined the efficacy of physical exercise on executive function performance in community-dwelling older adults living with Alzheimer's-type dementia. An electronic search of databases retrieved randomized and non-randomized controlled trials of community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's-type dementia who completed a physical exercise intervention and who were assessed using an executive function outcome measure. Methodological quality of six studies meeting the inclusion criteria published between 2009 and 2016 was scored independently by two raters using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database and a Cochrane informed domain-based assessment of risk of bias. Trends toward improvement in executive function scores were seen across all six studies, and significant improvement was seen in four of the eligible studies.

Here, utilizing the Tg2576 mouse, a model of AD-like parenchymal amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment, we sought to understand the effects of different lengths of daily access to a running wheel on advanced stage disease. This study is the first to determine the benefits of long-term exercise (4 months of voluntary running) and different periods of daily access to a running wheel (0 h, 1 h, 3 h, and 12 h running wheel access) beginning in 14-month-old Tg2576 mice, an age with significant amyloid pathology.

            "abstract": "Background and purpose:\n        \n      \n      Dementia affects physical as well as cognitive performance. In individuals with dementia (IWD), decline in physical performance increases with disease progression and is associated with higher functional dependence and decreased quality of life. It is paramount to examine factors that potentially preserve physical performance in IWD, particularly in light of conflicting findings on the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on physical performance of IWD, mainly due to limited number of high-quality studies, large heterogeneity in methods used, or insufficient reporting of methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 16-week multimodal exercise program (MEP) combining physical and cognitive tasks on physical performance in IWD, and to identify individual characteristics of MEP responders.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multicenter randomized controlled trial with assessment methods identified by an expert panel was conducted. We included 319 IWD of mild to moderate severity, older than 65 years, who underwent a standardized MEP specifically designed for IWD. At baseline and immediately after the MEP, we assessed physical performance (ie, mobility, balance, and strength) and function of lower extremities (primary outcomes). Potential effects of the MEP on physical performance were identified using 2-factor analyses of variance with repeated measurements within 2 samples (ie, intention-to-treat and per-protocol sample). Additionally, we compared characteristics related to physical performance between positive, non-, and negative responders.\n    \n\n\n          Results and discussion:\n        \n      \n      Neither analysis procedure revealed statistically significant time×group effects. However, 28% to 40% of participants were positive responders with regard to balance, and strength and function of lower extremities; and these persons had statistically significant lower baseline performance in the corresponding assessments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial revealed no overall effects of the MEP on physical performance, probably due to high heterogeneity of the study sample. Findings in responder analysis showed that IWD with lower physical performance at baseline tended to benefit more than those with higher baseline performance. Thus, a higher degree of individualization of the MEP depending on baseline performance on IWD may improve overall MEP effectiveness."

No adverse events were reported during the trial.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both training protocols improved muscle strength, but only RTI improved the mobility, motor signs, cognitive impairment, and quality of life, likely because of the usage of high motor complexity exercises. Thus, RTI may be recommended as an innovative adjunct therapeutic intervention for patients with PD."

Despite observational evidence supporting a role for PA in delaying the onset of AD, randomised controlled trials have reported mixed findings, likely due to the heterogeneity in study cohorts, outcome measures, and the adopted PA intervention. The primary objective of this narrative review is to evaluate the extant evidence on the relationship between PA, cognitive decline and AD in older populations. The interaction between PA and the putative mechanisms underlying AD progression, including genetic factors and amyloid-β levels will be explored. In this context, particular attention will be given to studies assessing PA in the early clinical and preclinical, asymptomatic stages of AD. Based on current evidence, clinical considerations for implementation of exercise-based interventions are discussed, along with limitations of previous research and directions for future studies."

Inclusion criteria were articles published in the indexed databases Pubmed, Scopus, Sciencedirect, IEEE and Cochrane published since January 1, 2014. Exclusion criteria were papers with a target group other than PD patients exclusively, or contributions not based on exergames.

Pilot studies (n = 11) stated the safety and feasibility of both Microsoft Kinect and Wii Balance Board, potentially in home scenarios as well. Technical papers (n = 30) stated the reliability of balance and gait data captured by both devices. Related meta-analyses and systematic reviews (n = 15) further support these statements, generally citing the need for adaptation to patient's skills and new input devices and sensors as identified gaps.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Recent evidence indicates exergame-based therapy has been widely proven to be feasible, safe, and at least as effective as traditional PD rehabilitation.

Also, studies linking game parameters and results with traditional assessment methods, such as UPDRS scores, are required.

ClinicaVR: Classroom-CPT (VC) is a neuropsychological test embedded in virtual reality that is designed to assess attention deficits in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other conditions associated with impaired attention. The present study aimed to (1) investigate the diagnostic validity of VC in comparison to a traditional continuous performance test (CPT), (2) explore the task difficulty of VC, (3) address the effect of distractors on the performance of ADHD participants and typically-developing (TD) controls, and (4) compare the two measures on cognitive absorption. A total of 33 children diagnosed with ADHD and 42 TD children, aged between 7 and 13 years, participated in the study and were tested with a traditional CPT or with VC, along with several cognitive measures and an adapted version of the Cognitive Absorption Scale. A mixed multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed that the children with ADHD performed worse on correct responses had more commissions and omissions errors than the TD children, as well as slower target reaction times . The results showed significant differences between performance in the virtual environment and the traditional computerized one, with longer reaction times in virtual reality. The data analysis highlighted the negative influence of auditory distractors on attention performance in the case of the children with ADHD, but not for the TD children.

However, evidence for an influence of dietary cholesterol on behavioral models is poor. Here, we investigated the behavioral changes of Wistar male rats fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 months in experimental models of depression and anxiety, such as the forced swim test (FST) paradigm and the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT). The correlation between behavioral depression and impaired cognitive capacity was also examined testing rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) task one day after the FST. Different groups of rats fed various dietary regimens, were subjected to acute or repeated treatment (14 days) with clomipramine hydrochloride (50 or 25 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg) or with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) antagonist, isoquinoline PK11195 (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Rats fed the cholesterol-enriched diet showed a significant decrease of grooming score in the NGT and of immobility time in the FST in comparison to animals fed a standard diet. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of diazepam and clomipramine were not affected by the different diets. Only after repeated treatment, PK11195 impaired the performance of animals fed a standard diet in the FST, and exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in animals fed either the cholesterol-enriched or the standard diet. The improved performance in the FST was followed by a better learning performance in the acquisition phase of the MWM. These results suggest that effects of cholesterol-enriched diet on the behavioral reaction of rats in experimental models of mild stress may involve PBRs. They deserve attention in order to clarify the clinical correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and mood disorders in humans."

We also searched trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists of identified studies up to this date.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one type of physical exercise for adults with PD to another type of exercise, a control group, or both.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data. A third author was involved in case of disagreements. We categorized the interventions and analyzed their effects on the severity of motor signs, QoL, freezing of gait, and functional mobility and balance up to six weeks after the intervention using NMAs. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool and rated the confidence in the evidence using the CINeMA approach for results on the severity of motor signs and QoL. We consulted a third review author to resolve any disagreements. Due to heterogeneous reporting of adverse events, we summarized safety data narratively and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 156 RCTs with a total of 7939 participants with mostly mild to moderate disease and no major cognitive impairment. The number of participants per study was small (mean 51, range from 10 to 474). The NMAs on the severity of motor signs and QoL included data from 71 (3196 participants), and 55 (3283 participants) trials, respectively. Eighty-five studies (5192 participants) provided safety data. Here, we present the main results. We observed evidence of beneficial effects for most types of physical exercise included in our review compared to a passive control group. The effects on the severity of motor signs and QoL are expressed as scores on the motor scale of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-M) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39), respectively. For both scales, higher scores denote higher symptom burden. Therefore, negative estimates reflect improvement (minimum clinically important difference: -2.5 for UPDRS-M and -4.72 for PDQ-39). Severity of motor signs The evidence from the NMA (71 studies; 3196 participants) suggests that dance has a moderate beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (mean difference (MD) -10.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.54 to -4.96; high confidence), and aqua-based, gait/balance/functional, and multi-domain training might have a moderate beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (aqua-based: MD -7.77, 95% CI -13.27 to -2.28; gait/balance/functional: MD -7.37, 95% CI -11.39 to -3.35; multi-domain: MD -6.97, 95% CI -10.32 to -3.62; low confidence). The evidence also suggests that mind-body training and endurance training might have a small beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (mind-body: MD -6.57, 95% CI -10.18 to -2.81; endurance: MD -6.43, 95% CI -10.72 to -2.28; low confidence). Flexibility training might have a trivial or no effect on the severity of motor signs (MD 2.01, 95% CI -4.82 to 8.98; low confidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of strength/resistance training and \"Lee Silverman Voice training BIG\" (LSVT BIG) on the severity of motor signs (strength/resistance: MD -6.97, 95% CI -11.93 to -2.01; LSVT BIG: MD -5.49, 95% CI -14.74 to 3.62; very low confidence). Quality of life The evidence from the NMA (55 studies; 3283 participants) suggests that aqua-based training probably has a large beneficial effect on QoL (MD -14.98, 95% CI -23.26 to -6.52; moderate confidence). The evidence also suggests that endurance training might have a moderate beneficial effect, and that gait/balance/functional and multi-domain training might have a small beneficial effect on QoL (endurance: MD -9.16, 95% CI -15.68 to -2.82; gait/balance/functional: MD -5.64, 95% CI -10.04 to -1.23; multi-domain: MD -5.29, 95% CI -9.34 to -1.06; low confidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mind-body training, gaming, strength/resistance training, dance, LSVT BIG, and flexibility training on QoL (mind-body: MD -8.81, 95% CI -14.62 to -3.00; gaming: MD -7.05, 95% CI -18.50 to 4.41; strength/resistance: MD -6.34, 95% CI -12.33 to -0.35; dance: MD -4.05, 95% CI -11.28 to 3.00; LSVT BIG: MD 2.29, 95% CI -16.03 to 20.44; flexibility: MD 1.23, 95% CI -11.45 to 13.92; very low confidence). Adverse events Only 85 studies (5192 participants) provided some kind of safety data, mostly only for the intervention groups. No adverse events (AEs) occurred in 40 studies and no serious AEs occurred in four studies. AEs occurred in 28 studies. The most frequently reported events were falls (18 studies) and pain (10 studies). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical exercise on the risk of adverse events (very low confidence). Across outcomes, we observed little evidence of differences between exercise types.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found evidence of beneficial effects on the severity of motor signs and QoL for most types of physical exercise for people with PD included in this review, but little evidence of differences between these interventions. Thus, our review highlights the importance of physical exercise regarding our primary outcomes severity of motor signs and QoL, while the exact exercise type might be secondary. Notably, this conclusion is consistent with the possibility that specific motor symptoms may be treated most effectively by PD-specific programs. Although the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of exercise on the risk of adverse events, the interventions included in our review were described as relatively safe. Larger, well-conducted studies are needed to increase confidence in the evidence. Additional studies recruiting people with advanced disease severity and cognitive impairment might help extend the generalizability of our findings to a broader range of people with PD."

Thus, rehabilitation approaches should not only involve the recovery of motor function but also of higher-order abilities such as processing of social stimuli. In keeping with the general role of the cerebellum in anticipating and predicting events, we used a VR-based rehabilitation system to implement a social cognition intensive training specifically tailored to improve predictive abilities in social scenarios (VR-Spirit).\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The study is an interventional randomised controlled trial that aims to recruit 42 children, adolescents and young adults with congenital cerebellar malformations, randomly allocated to the experimental group or the active control group. The experimental group is administered the VR-Spirit, requiring the participants to compete with different avatars in the reaching of recreational equipment and implicitly prompting them to form expectations about their playing preference. The active control group participates in a VR-training with standard games currently adopted for motor rehabilitation. Both trainings are composed by eight 45-min sessions and are administered in the GRAIL VR laboratory (Motekforce Link, Netherlands), an integrated platform that allows patients to move in natural and attractive VR environments. An evaluation session in VR with the same paradigm used in the VR-Spirit but implemented in a different scenario is administered at the beginning (T0) of the two trainings (T1) and at the end (T2). Moreover, a battery of neurocognitive tests spanning different domains is administered to all participants at T0, T2 and in a follow-up session after 2 months from the end of the two trainings (T3).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study offers a novel approach for rehabilitation based on specific neural mechanisms of the cerebellum. We aim to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a new, intensive, social cognition training in a sample of Italian patients aged 7-25 years with congenital cerebellar malformations.

Cognitive interventions such as computerized cognitive trainings (CCT) are effective in attenuating cognitive decline in AD. However, in those at risk of dementia related to AD, results are heterogeneous. Efficacy and feasibility of CCT needs to be explored in depth. Moreover, underlying mechanisms of CCT effects on the three cognitive domains typically affected by AD (episodic memory, semantic memory and spatial abilities) remain poorly understood.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this bi-centric, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with parallel groups, participants (planned N = 162, aged 60-85 years) at risk for AD and with at least subjective cognitive decline will be randomized to one of three groups.

Subsequently, the CCT group will continue at-home training for an additional twenty-weeks including monthly on-site booster sessions. Investigators conducting the cognitive assessments will be blinded. Group leaders will be aware of participants' group allocations.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Assessing arm and hand sensorimotor impairments that are functionally relevant is essential to optimize the impact of neurorehabilitation interventions. Technology-aided assessments should provide a sensitive and objective characterization of upper limb impairments, but often provide arm weight support and neglect the importance of the hand, thereby questioning their functional relevance. The Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT) addresses these limitations by quantifying arm and hand movements as well as grip forces during a goal-directed manipulation task requiring active lifting of the upper limb against gravity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of the VPIT metrics to characterize arm and hand sensorimotor impairments that are relevant for performing functional tasks.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Arm and hand sensorimotor impairments were systematically characterized in 30 chronic stroke patients using conventional clinical scales and the VPIT. For the latter, ten previously established kinematic and kinetic core metrics were extracted. The validity and robustness of these metrics was investigated by analyzing their clinimetric properties (test-retest reliability, measurement error, learning effects, concurrent validity).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-three of the participants, the ones with mild to moderate sensorimotor impairments and without strong cognitive deficits, were able to successfully complete the VPIT protocol (duration 16.6 min). The VPIT metrics detected impairments in arm and hand in 90.0% of the participants, and were sensitive to increased muscle tone and pathological joint coupling. Most importantly, significant moderate to high correlations between conventional scales of activity limitations and the VPIT metrics were found, thereby indicating their functional relevance when grasping and transporting objects, and when performing dexterous finger manipulations. Lastly, the robustness of three out of the ten VPIT core metrics in post-stroke individuals was confirmed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This work provides evidence that technology-aided assessments requiring goal-directed manipulations without arm weight support can provide an objective, robust, and clinically feasible way to assess functionally relevant sensorimotor impairments in arm and hand in chronic post-stroke individuals with mild to moderate deficits. This allows for a better identification of impairments with high functional relevance and can contribute to optimizing the functional benefits of neurorehabilitation interventions."

Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) is a 12-month person-centred exercise and activity programme which aims to increase activity and independence whilst reducing falls in people with early dementia. In this patient group, as well as many others, poor adherence to exercise interventions can undermine treatment effectiveness. We aimed to explore patterns of barriers and facilitators influencing PrAISED participants' adherence to home-based strength and balance exercises.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were a subsample of 20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia and their carer(s) taking part in the PrAISED programme.

Participants' adherence were categorised based upon reported number of times a week they undertook the PrAISED strength and balance exercises over a 4 month period (<3 times a week = low adherence, 3-4 = meeting adherence expectations, >5 = exceeding adherence expectations). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in month 4 of the PrAISED programme to explore barriers and facilitators to adherence.

Where are we now 30 years later? We systematically but also selectively review the medical literature on exercise, sport, psychiatry, mental health and mental disorders and related topics. The number of publications in the field has increased exponentially. Most topics keep remaining on the agenda, e.g., head trauma and concussion, drug abuse and doping, performance enhancement, overtraining, ADHD or eating disorders. Supported by the growing literature, evidence-based recommendations have become available now in many clinical areas. A relatively new phenomenon is muscle dysmorphia, observed in weightlifters, bodybuilders but also in college students and gym users. Further, sports therapy of mental disorders has been studied by more and more high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials. Mostly as a complementary treatment, however, for some disorders already with a 1a evidence level, e.g., depression, dementia or MCI but also post-traumatic stress disorder. Being grown up and accepted nowadays, sports psychiatry still represents a fast-developing field. The reverse side of the coin, sport therapy of mental disorders has received a scientific basis now. Who else than sports psychiatry could advance sport therapy of mental disorders? We need this enthusiasm for sports and psychiatry for our patients with mental disorders and it is time now for a broadening of the scope.

This raises general questions regarding the specific risks of old age and frailty in demanding political positions. Therefore, I tried to give important contemporary examples of elderly leaders, study the mean age of leading political figures over the last 3 decades and present historical examples of heads of state with age-associated brain diseases and cognitive deficits. I reviewed the literature on mental illness and politics and analyzed the ages of international political leaders in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      There are several impressive contemporary examples of elderly politicians. The mean age of political leaders has not increased significantly in most parts of the world over the last 3 decades with the exception of the Gulf States and sub-Saharan Africa. Health problems of heads of state in earlier centuries had not been primarily age associated. After 1900, dementia but also mild cognitive and mild behavioral impairment became important issues in politically critical situations, for example international peace negotiations, the rise of Nazi Germany, the breakup of communism, the Arab Spring and others. Key Messages: This paper collects anecdotal evidence of cognitive frailty in ageing politicians; it is not an in-depth analysis of political history. Observations confirm that a very long time in power may obviously increase the risk of age-associated problems; dynamic revolutionary or entrepreneurial idols may be misled to rely on their irreplaceable charisma for too long. However, caution must be exercised against ageism on one side versus silent acquiescence towards leaders with failing mental powers on the other, who may become victims of obscure parties and their decompensating personality disorders."

It is characterized by concurrent physical frailty and potentially reversible cognitive impairment. In this study, we sought to elucidate the effects of high-speed resistance exercise training on cognitive function and physical performance in older adults with cognitive frailty.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial involving community-living older adults with cognitive frailty.

In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration issued updated recommendations regarding statin medications, and the panel's comments regarding memory impairment fostered clinical confusion (in part because of the lay media's amplification). Cognitive data from several large epidemiological studies have not reliably demonstrated a robust association between incident cognitive impairment and statin use, with some studies reporting a protective effect, some reporting an increased risk and others finding no association. Although several interventional studies have evaluated statins as a possible adjunctive treatment for Alzheimer's disease, none have clearly demonstrated a benefit. A small number of case series have reported infrequent memory difficulties associated with statin use. In these series, the patients' cognitive symptoms resolved after statin discontinuation. The existing medical literature does not suggest that cognitive considerations should play a major role in medical decision making to prescribe statins for the large majority of patients. As with any medication prescribed for older adults, careful clinical monitoring for side effects should be exercised. If a patient is suspected of having idiosyncratic memory impairment associated with use of a statin medication, the drug can be discontinued. The patient should then be followed with careful clinical observation for 1-3 months for resolution of the cognitive symptoms."

In terms of the circulating molecular biomarkers, the 16-week exercise interventions did not change some parameters (e.g., leptin, VEGF, FGF-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8). However, the peripheral serum BDNF level was significantly increased, and the levels of insulin, TNF-α, and IL-15 levels were significantly decreased in the AE group, whereas the RE group showed significantly increased IGF-1 levels and decreased IL-15 levels. The relationships between the changes in neurocognitive performance (AR and P3 amplitudes) and the changes in the levels of neurotrophins (BDNF and IGF-1)/inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) only approached significance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggested that in older adults with aMCI, not only aerobic but also resistance exercise is effective with regard to increasing neurotrophins, reducing some inflammatory cytokines, and facilitating neurocognitive performance.

            "abstract": "Exercise training effectively mitigates aging-induced health and fitness impairments. Traditional training recommendations for the elderly focus separately on relevant physiological fitness domains, such as balance, flexibility, strength and endurance. Thus, a more holistic and functional training framework is needed. The proposed agility training concept integratively tackles spatial orientation, stop and go, balance and strength. The presented protocol aims at introducing a two-armed, one-year randomized controlled trial, evaluating the effects of this concept on neuromuscular, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychosocial health outcomes in healthy older adults. Eighty-five participants were enrolled in this ongoing trial. Seventy-nine participants completed baseline testing and were block-randomized to the agility training group or the inactive control group. All participants undergo pre- and post-testing with interim assessment after six months. The intervention group currently receives supervised, group-based agility training twice a week over one year, with progressively demanding perceptual, cognitive and physical exercises. Knee extension strength, reactive balance, dual task gait speed and the Agility Challenge for the Elderly (ACE) serve as primary endpoints and neuromuscular, cognitive, cardiovascular, and psychosocial meassures serve as surrogate secondary outcomes. Our protocol promotes a comprehensive exercise training concept for older adults, that might facilitate stakeholders in health and exercise to stimulate relevant health outcomes without relying on excessively time-consuming physical activity recommendations."

            "abstract": "Humans show a remarkable capacity to navigate various environments using different navigation strategies, and we know that strategy changes across the life span. However, this observation has been based on studies of small sample sizes. To this end, we used a mobile app-based video game (Sea Hero Quest) to test virtual navigation strategies and memory performance within a distinct radial arm maze level in over 37,000 participants. Players were presented with six pathways (three open and three closed) and were required to navigate to the three open pathways to collect a target. Next, all six pathways were made available and the player was required to visit the pathways that were previously unavailable. Both reference memory and working memory errors were calculated. Crucially, at the end of the level, the player was asked a multiple-choice question about how they found the targets (i.e., a counting-dependent strategy vs. a landmark-dependent strategy). As predicted from previous laboratory studies, we found the use of landmarks declined linearly with age. Those using landmark-based strategies also performed better on reference memory than those using a counting-based strategy. These results extend previous observations in the laboratory showing a decreased use of landmark-dependent strategies with age."

Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non-melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings.

We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I(2)= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I(2) = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I(2) = 67%). Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.16; I(2) = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be low quality and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, the, albeit low-quality evidence may be interpreted to suggest that non-pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi-site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer."

            "abstract": "Τhe rate of patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment or any type of dementia has been constantly on the rise. Considering that no effective treatment of dementia has been discovered to date and that drug use can have numerous side effects, there is an urgent need for the application of alternative, non-pharmacological interventions. To this end, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of physical activity on the cognitive impairment of the elderly, and its use as a form of non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of dementia. Taking a review of the relevant literature, as its data collection method, this study examined peer-reviewed papers published between 2010 and 2018 that met the criteria for their inclusion. The articles were drawn from three electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science), and were examined with regard to the populations under consideration, research design, type of intervention programs and assessment tools applied. The vast majority of these research papers tend to support that physical activity offers significant benefits to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Specifically, it helps stabilize and improve cognitive function as well as reduce and delay the onset of severe neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, confusion, apathy, etc. In addition, physical exercise plays an important role in improving the executive functioning of patients with dementia, increasing autonomy in their everyday activities and reducing the risk of falls. In conclusion, recent research shows physical activity to be a promising intervention for the prevention and non-pharmacological treatment of dementia in that it contributes to the improvement of patients' quality of life. However, results vary according to the particularly characteristics of the exercise under review, such as type, intensity, frequency, and duration. It is therefore important to gain both awareness and understanding of the specific factors that give physical activity its therapeutic potential leading to the development of exercise programs designed specially to treat dementia."

This can adversely affect cognitive performance, not only in groups more vulnerable to dehydration, such as children and the elderly, but also in young adults. However, few studies have examined the impact of mild or moderate dehydration on cognitive performance. This paper reviews the principal findings from studies published to date examining cognitive skills. Being dehydrated by just 2% impairs performance in tasks that require attention, psychomotor, and immediate memory skills, as well as assessment of the subjective state. In contrast, the performance of long-term and working memory tasks and executive functions is more preserved, especially if the cause of dehydration is moderate physical exercise. The lack of consistency in the evidence published to date is largely due to the different methodology applied, and an attempt should be made to standardize methods for future studies. These differences relate to the assessment of cognitive performance, the method used to cause dehydration, and the characteristics of the participants."

However, the clinical and central effects of VRT have not been investigated in patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP). To comprehensively assess the effects of VRT on clinical indices and brain function, we used a randomized clinical trial based on clinical and brain mapping assessment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six women with PFP for more than 6 months were randomly allocated to 2 groups: intervention and control. The intervention consisted of lifestyle education + 8 weeks VRT, in 24 sessions each lasting 40 min of training, whereas the control group just received lifestyle education. The balance was the primary outcome and was measured by the modified star excursion balance test. Secondary outcomes included pain, function, quality of life, and brain function which were assessed by visual analogue scale, step down test and Kujala questionnaire, SF-36, and EEG, respectively. Pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up (1 month after the end of the intervention) measurements were taken for all outcome measures except EEG, which was evaluated only at pre-intervention and post-intervention).

            "abstract": "Apathy is one of the most challenging and prevalent behavioral symptoms of dementia. It is associated with increased disability and caregiver frustration as well as reduced quality of life, rehabilitation outcomes and survival after nursing home admission. A literature search to set criteria yielded 56 nonpharmacological intervention studies with outcomes relevant to apathy in dementia. Studies were rated according to quality and categorized into 7 groups: exercise, music, multisensory, animals, special care programming, therapeutic activities and miscellaneous. Despite a lack of methodological rigor, it is apparent that nonpharmacological interventions have the potential to reduce apathy. This review indicates that therapeutic activities, particularly those provided individually, have the best available evidence for effectiveness in dementia.

            "abstract": "Converging evidence has identified cognitive control deficits in internet gaming disorder (IGD). Recently, mounting evidence had revealed that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) and structural connectivity of frontostriatal circuits could modulate cognitive control in healthy individuals. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the thoroughly circuit-level characterization of the frontostriatal pathways (both the dorsal and ventral striatum) during resting-state and their association with cognitive control in IGD. In the current study, the differences of striatum volume and RSFC networks were investigated between 43 young IGD individuals and 44 healthy controls. Meanwhile, cognitive control deficits were assessed by Stroop task performances. The neuroimaging findings were then correlated with the Stroop task behaviors. In IGD subjects, we demonstrated an increased volume of right caudate and nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as reduced RSFC strength of dorsal prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-caudate and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-NAc. NAc volumes were positively correlated with internet addiction test scores in IGD. The caudate volume and DLPFC-caudate RSFC was correlated with the impaired cognitive control (more incongruent errors in Stroop task) in IGD. Consistent with substance use disorder (SUD) findings, we detected striatum volume and frontostriatal circuits RSFC differences between IGD and healthy controls, which provided evidence of some degree of the similarity between IGD and SUD. More importantly, the cognitive control deficits in IGD were correlated with the reduced frontostrital RSFC strength. It is hoped that our results could shed insight on the neurobiological mechanisms of IGD and suggest potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment."

Preferences for utilitarian over non-utilitarian responses have been explained by two contrasting hypotheses; one implicating increased deliberative reasoning, and the other implicating diminished harm aversion. In recent field experiments, these hypotheses have been investigated using alcohol intoxication to impair both social and cognitive functioning. These studies have found increased utilitarian responding, arguably as a result of alcohol impairing affective empathy.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The present research expands existing investigations by examining the acute effects of alcohol on affective empathy and subsequent moral judgments in traditional vignettes and moral actions in virtual reality, as well as physiological responses in moral dilemmas.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants (N = 48) were administered either a placebo or alcohol in one of two dosages; low or moderate.

Research has convincingly demonstrated the implication of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of dementia as well as of the conditions which increase the risk of developing dementia. However, drugs which target single pathways have so far failed in providing significant neuroprotection. Natural antioxidants, due to their effects in multiple pathways through which oxidative stress leads to neurodegeneration and triggers neuroinflammation, could prove valuable weapons in our fight against dementia. Although efficient in vitro and in animal models of AD, natural antioxidants in human trials have many drawbacks related to the limited bioavailability, unknown optimal dose, or proper timing of the treatment. Nonetheless, trials evaluating several of these natural compounds are ongoing, as are attempts to modify these compounds to achieve improved bioavailability."

            "abstract": "At the heart of this paper is an exploration of artistic co-creativity involving people with dementia and their partners. Co-creativity promotes a relational approach to creativity which nurtures inclusion and participation. This paper investigates how co-creativity can affect well-being from the perspectives of people with dementia and their carers; and explores how well-being and agency might be usefully reconsidered. The article draws on findings from a small-scale study 'With All' that focused on music and dance as non-verbal and therefore inclusive artforms. A range of disciplinary perspectives, from psychology, philosophy and social sciences, inform the study. The research used an intrinsic case-study methodology and within this a mixed-methods approach was adopted. This included dialogic interviews, video data analysis and the Canterbury Well-being Scale (CWS). Thematic analysis of the interviews and video data revealed three key themes: autonomy, connections, and art as an enabler. These themes captured the experiences of the participants and facilitated a more nuanced understanding of wellbeing and agency in the context of living with dementia. The analysis of the CWS indicated some improvements in well-being. Following this analysis using multiple data sources, the paper argues that well-being and agency are best understood as relational, and ongoing, rather than completed states. Further both wellbeing and agency contain their opposites (ill-being and passivity). This innovative exploration highlighted the importance of co-creative collaboration as a method that was considered valuable by participants, and that therefore should be further considered in future research with people living with dementia."

Fatigue effects may be task specific and related to the time of post-exercise testing. The present study examined the effects on adults' performance of two cognitive tasks that differed in processing demands over an 80-min period of fatigue. Thirty young adult men and women were randomly assigned to either an exercise group and completed a 60-min bout of cycle ergometry at 90% ventilatory threshold or a control group and rested for 60 min. Following interventions, each participant completed a simple and complex version of a visual perceptual discrimination test, a 40-min memory-based vigilance test and a repetition of the visual perceptual discrimination tests. Those who exercised evidenced significant decrements in performance on complex perceptual-discrimination tasks compared to participants who rested. The response time of exercisers during a memory-demanding vigilance test were significantly slower than those of participants who rested; however, detection performance did not differ between groups neither was there a decrease in target detection across the vigil. The effects of exercise-induced fatigue may be task specific, with greater effects on perceptual tasks, which involve relatively automatic processing, compared to effortful memory-based tasks."

We aimed to update previous syntheses examining the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions in reducing functional decline (activities of daily living, activity-specific physical functioning, or function-specific goal attainment) in people living in their own homes with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We systematically searched electronic databases from January 2012 to May 2018; two researchers independently rated risk of bias of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) fitting predetermined inclusion criteria using a checklist; we narratively synthesised findings, prioritising studies judged to have a lower risk of bias.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-nine papers (describing 26 RCTs) met eligibility criteria, of which we judged 13 RCTs to have a lower risk of bias. Study interventions were evaluated in four groups: physical exercise, occupational, multicomponent, and cognition-oriented interventions. Four out of 13 RCTs reported functional ability as a primary outcome. In studies judged to have a lower risk of bias, in-home tailored exercise, individualised cognitive rehabilitation, and in-home activities-focussed occupational therapy significantly reduced functional decline relative to control groups in individual studies. There was consistent evidence from studies at low risk of bias that group-based exercise and reminiscence therapies were ineffective at reducing functional decline.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We found no replicated evidence of intervention effectiveness in decreasing functional decline. Interventions associated with slower functional decline in individual trials have been individually delivered and tailored to the needs of the person with dementia. This is consistent with previous findings. Future intervention trials should prioritise these approaches."

            "abstract": "Because of diversities of physical, mental, and psychological functions as well as clinical and social backgrounds, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is of great importance in treating elderly diabetic patients. We addressed three issues as to functions important for the CGA. First, we assessed several domains of cognitive function in 213 elderly diabetic patients. Attention and visual memory in diabetic patients without vascular disease were impaired compared with non-diabetic controls after adjusting for age and sex using analysis of covariance. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, hyperglycemia, and the presence of cerebral infarction were independent determinants for the impairment of attention in the diabetic patients. The results suggest that glucose control is important for the maintenance of cognitive function in elderly diabetic patients. Secondly, we assessed positive well-being as a measure of psychological function using a PGC morale scale in 197 elderly diabetic patients without cerebrovascular disease at baseline and examined whether the low well-being affect the development of cerebrovascular disease in a 3-year longitudinal study. The results indicate that low well-being was an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular disease after adjusting conventional risk factors in elderly diabetic patients. Thirdly, as a physical function, we assessed 5-m walking speed for both usual and maximum walking in 64 diabetic patients. The walking speed decreased with age and correlated significantly with the knee extension power and functional reach. The result suggests that muscle-strength exercise and balance training as well as endurance exercises are necessary to improve age-related decreases in walking speed and for effective exercise in elderly patients. From a gerontological point of view, new strategies of elderly diabetes treatment including muscle strength exercise and psychological approaches should be established to improve physical, mental, psychological, and social functions as assessed by the CGA."

A secondary aim was to examine cognitive control processes at several time points during an acute bout of exercise to determine whether cognition is selectively influenced by the duration of exercise. Twenty-seven healthy participants completed a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task while exercising on a cycle ergometer at 40% and 60% VO2 peak and during a no-exercise seated control across three separate days. During task performance, continuous EEG was collected to assess neurocognitive function using the N2 and P3 event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Neurocognitive performance was assessed at 5, 15, and 25min time points during steady-state exercise. Regardless of intensity, behavioral findings revealed impaired accuracy during both exercise conditions for the flanker task trials that require greater cognitive control. However, faster reaction times were found during moderate-intensity exercise. Neuroelectric measures revealed increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during both exercise conditions relative to rest. Together, these findings suggest divergent effects of exercise on behavioral performance measures accompanied by an upregulation of cognitive control during aerobic exercise. These impairments are discussed in terms of dual-task paradigms and the transient hypofrontality theory."

A total of 1716 participants from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Ageing and Diet (HELIAD), a population-based study of participants ≥65 years, were included in this analysis. Lifestyle factors were evaluated using standard, validated questionnaires and a Total Lifestyle Index (TLI) was constructed. Cognitive outcomes included mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis, a composite z-score (either continuous or with a threshold at the 25th percentile) and z-scores for five cognitive domains. A higher TLI was associated with 65% reduced odds for MCI in the non-demented individuals and 43% reduced odds for low global cognition when MCI participants were excluded, a risk reduction equivalent to 9 and 2.7 fewer years of ageing, respectively. Each lifestyle factor was differentially associated with domain-specific cognitive performance.

            "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. This disease is characterized by motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Although balance impairment is characteristic of advanced stages, it can be present with less intensity since the beginning of the disease. Approximately 60% of PD patients fall once a year and 40% recurrently. On the other hand, cognitive symptoms affect up to 20% of patients with PD in early stages and can even precede the onset of motor symptoms. There are cognitive requirements for balance and can be challenged when attention is diverted or reduced, linking a worse balance and a higher probability of falls with a slower cognitive processing speed and attentional problems. Cognitive rehabilitation of attention and processing speed can lead to an improvement in postural stability in patients with Parkinson's. Methods: We present a parallel and controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the impact on balance of a protocol based on cognitive rehabilitation focused on sustained attention through the NeuronUP platform (Neuronup SI, La Rioja, Spain) in patients with PD. For 4 weeks, patients in the experimental group will receive cognitive therapy three days a week while the control group will not receive any therapy. The protocol has been registered at trials.gov NCT04730466. Conclusions: Cognitive therapy efficacy on balance improvement may open the possibility of new rehabilitation strategies for prevention of falls in PD, reducing morbidity, and saving costs to the health care system."

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the most recent data from clinical studies investigating the relationship between cognitive impairment and PA in adults older than 60 years of age. For this purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, search was conducted, and a total of thirty-five studies were selected to review. Eleven studies investigated the effect of PA on individuals without cognitive impairment and seven of them presented some significant improvement, mostly on specific cognitive domains and only one in global cognition. Fourteen studies included populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and twelve of them reported significant improvements in cognitive function. The majority of them presented a beneficial effect on global cognition and executive function. Finally, nine studies investigated interventions on populations with a diagnosis of dementia and only four of them showed any cognitive benefit following their interventions. There was no consistent observed association of a specific type of exercise and greater improvement or improvement in certain domains of cognition nor was there a minimum duration of intervention required for the improvements to take effect. In conclusion, the majority of the latest published literature suggests a protective role of PA on cognitive function. People with MCI seem to benefit the most from PA interventions, benefits in people with normal cognition are more subtle and harder to detect, while findings from studies in people with dementia remain contradictory. As findings are not currently in total agreement, further long-term prospective intervention studies are required in order to elucidate the reasons of this heterogeneity."

Here, using two robotic behavioural tasks, we investigated motor control in both the dominant and non-dominant limbs of children with DCD. Twenty-six children with diagnosed DCD (20 males; mean age 10.6 years ± 1.3 years) and 155 controls were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed a visually guided reaching task with their dominant and non-dominant limbs and a bimanual object hitting task. Motor performance was quantified across nine parameters. We determined the number of children with DCD who fell outside of the typical performance range of the controls on these parameters and compared the DCD and control groups using ANCOVAs, accounting for age. Children with DCD demonstrated impairments in six out of nine parameters; deficits were more commonly noted in the non-dominant limb. Interestingly, when looking at individual performance, several children with DCD performed in the range of controls. These findings indicate that children with DCD display deficits in motor control in both the dominant and non-dominant limb and highlight the importance of including detailed assessments of both limbs when investigating children with DCD. They also demonstrate the variability in motor control performance evidenced by children with DCD."

            "abstract": "Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) are typically more susceptible than healthy adults to impaired performance when two tasks (dual task interference) are performed simultaneously. This limitation has by many experts been attributed to limitations in cognitive resources. Nearly all studies of dual task performance in PD employ walking or balance-based motor tasks, which are commonly impaired in PD. These tasks can be performed using a combination of one or two executive function tasks. The current study examined whether persons with PD would demonstrate greater dual task effects (DTEs) on cognition compared to healthy older adults (HOAs) during a concurrent cycling task. Participants with and without PD completed a battery of 12 cognitive tasks assessing visual and verbal processing in the following cognitive domains: speed of processing, controlled processing, working memory and executive function. Persons with PD exhibited impairments compared to healthy participants in select tasks (i.e., 0-back, 2-back and operation span). Further, both groups unexpectedly exhibited dual task facilitation of response times in visual tasks across cognitive domains, and improved verbal recall during an executive function task. Only one measure, 2-back, showed a speed-accuracy trade-off in the dual task. These results demonstrate that, when paired with a motor task in which they are not impaired, people with PD exhibit similar DTEs on cognitive tasks as HOAs, even when these task effects are facilitative. More generally, these findings demonstrate that pairing cognitive tasks with cycling may actually improve cognitive performance which may have therapeutic relevance to cognitive decline associated with aging and PD pathology."

The present study thus aimed (i) to investigate the effects of acute aerobic or resistance exercise on neurocognitive performances and molecular markers when performing a cognitive task involving executive functioning in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and (ii) to explore relationships of acute exercise-induced neurocognitive changes with changes in circulating levels of neuroprotective growth factors (e.g., BDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, and FGF-2, collectively termed 'exerkines'), elicited by different acute exercise modes. Sixty-six older adults with aMCI were recruited and randomly assigned to an aerobic exercise (AE) group, a resistance exercise (RE) group, or a non-exercise-intervention (control) group. The behavioral [i.e., accuracy rate (AR) and reaction time (RT)] and electrophysiological [i.e., event-related potential (ERP) P3 latency and amplitude collected from the Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes] indices were simultaneously measured when participants performed a Flanker task at baseline and after either an acute bout of 30 min of moderate-intensity AE, RE or a control period. Blood samples were taken at three time points, one at baseline (T1) and two after an acute exercise intervention (T2 and T3: before and after cognitive task test, respectively). The results showed that the acute AE and RE not only improved behavioral (i.e., RTs) performance but also increased the ERP P3 amplitudes in the older adults with aMCI. Serum FGF-2 levels did not change with acute aerobic or resistance exercise. However, an acute bout of aerobic exercise significantly increased serum levels of BDNF and IGF-1 and tended to increase serum levels of VEGF in elderly aMCI individuals. Acute resistance exercise increased only serum IGF-1 levels. However, the exercise-induced elevated levels of these molecular markers returned almost to baseline levels in T3 (about 20 min after acute exercise). In addition, changes in the levels of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors were not correlated with changes in RTs and P3 amplitudes. The present findings of changes in neuroprotective growth factors and neurocognitive performances through acute AE or RE suggest that molecular and neural prerequisites for exercise-dependent plasticity are preserved in elderly aMCI individuals. However, the distinct pattern of changes in circulating molecular biomarkers induced by two different exercise modes in aMCI elderly individuals and the potentially interactive mechanisms of the effects of BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF on amyloid-β provide a basis for future long-term exercise intervention to investigate whether AE relative to RE might be more effective in prevention/treatment of an early stage neurodegenerative disease."

In-house validated cutoff values of biomarkers were applied: Aβ1-42 <638.5 pg/mL, T-tau>296.5 pg/mL, P-tau(181P) >56.5 pg/mL. Both increments and decrements (from ± 5% to ± 40% ) were added to the true (=observed) CSF biomarker values, imitating the anticipated differences in biomarker concentrations. Within certain limits, the clinical diagnostic performance of AD CSF biomarkers remains largely unchanged and clinical diagnostic accuracy deviated less than 8.2% from the reference when concentration shifts ranging between -20% and +20% were added to one of the three CSF biomarkers in MCI and autopsy-confirmed AD patients. Notwithstanding the fact that (pre- and post-)analytical parameters can affect the clinical classification, the present exploratory study provides evidence that for a specific context of use, the impact on clinical accuracy of biomarker concentration shifts might be lower than originally expected. In conclusion, induced shifts of ±20% in only one of the three biomarkers has limited impact on the clinical accuracy of AD CSF biomarkers in MCI and autopsy-confirmed AD patients when using the IWG-2 criteria."

            "abstract": "Objective: Research suggests that prospective memory (PM) is impaired from the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to further characterize this impairment in patients with mild AD, using a virtual reality (VR) task to provide ecological assessment of PM. Methods: Fifteen cognitively normal older individuals (76.47 years old ± 4.14, MMSE: 28.80 ± 1.21), and 17 patients with mild AD (79.29 years old ± 4.45, MMSE: 22.82 ± 2.83) were asked to recall the prospective and retrospective components of seven intentions in a virtual town task. Six intentions were event-based, where the prospective cue was either highly (three intentions) or weakly (three intentions) associated with the retrospective component. The remaining intention was time-based. All participants completed a neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory, semantic memory and executive functioning. Non-parametric tests were used to compare the two groups on the different intentions types and components. Correlations between cognition and PM scores were then realized to further understand the cognitive correlates of the PM impairment in patients with AD. Results: Overall, patients with Alzheimer disease recalled fewer intentions than controls, with the retrospective component and time-based intentions being the most challenging for them. The strength of the association between the prospective and retrospective components, however, had no effect on their performance. Event-based PM impairment, as well as deficit in the recall of prospective component correlated with memory and executive functions performance. Conclusion: PM is impaired in AD. Both automatic and controlled processes of PM retrieval are disturbed. This study also confirms the reliability of VR for assessing complex cognitive functions such as PM."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common major neurocognitive disorder of ageing. Although largely ignored until about a decade ago, accumulating evidence suggests that deteriorating brain energy metabolism plays a key role in the development and/or progression of AD-associated cognitive decline. Brain glucose hypometabolism is a well-established biomarker in AD but was mostly assumed to be a consequence of neuronal dysfunction and death. However, its presence in cognitively asymptomatic populations at higher risk of AD strongly suggests that it is actually a pre-symptomatic component in the development of AD. The question then arises as to whether progressive AD-related cognitive decline could be prevented or slowed down by correcting or bypassing this progressive ‘brain energy gap’. In this review, we provide an overview of research on brain glucose and ketone metabolism in AD and its prodromal condition – mild cognitive impairment (MCI) – to provide a clearer basis for proposing keto-therapeutics as a strategy for brain energy rescue in AD. We also discuss studies using ketogenic interventions and their impact on plasma ketone levels, brain energetics and cognitive performance in MCI and AD. Given that exercise has several overlapping metabolic effects with ketones, we propose that in combination these two approaches might be synergistic for brain health during ageing. As cause-and-effect relationships between the different hallmarks of AD are emerging, further research efforts should focus on optimising the efficacy, acceptability and accessibility of keto-therapeutics in AD and populations at risk of AD."

We designed an attentional task to train selective and sustained attention, and we tested a VR and a paper version of this task in a single-session within-subjects design. Results showed that participants with MCI and dementia reported to be highly satisfied and interested in the task, and they reported high feelings of security, low discomfort, anxiety and fatigue. In addition, participants reported a preference for the VR condition compared to the paper condition, even if the task was more difficult.

Low-grade inflammation is common during aging and seems to be linked to neurodegenerative process. Regular physical exercises can help to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and to improve BDNF peripheral concentrations. The main goal of this research was to analyze the effects of a 16-week multimodal physical exercise program on peripheral BDNF levels and on Tumor Necrosis-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin- 6 (IL-6) as pro-inflammatory markers in cognitive healthy elderly individuals and in elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cognitive functions were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) prior to and after the intervention. Thirty cognitively healthy participants and thirty-seven MCI participants were assigned to the control (CG) and trained (TG) groups. The TG participated in a multimodal physical training program for a 16-week period. The results showed a significant between-subjects interaction, which indicates the beneficial contribution of training on the reduction of TNF-α (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.001) and on the improvement of BDNF (p<0.001) peripheral concentrations. Cognitive functions also presented significant improvements for MCI trained group (p=0.03). In conclusion, physical exercise was effective to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and to improve BDNF peripheral levels, with positive reflexes on cognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated longitudinally the effects of a multimodal physical exercises protocol on peripheral concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cognition performance in elderly MCI individuals."

Exercise parameters such as exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality are carefully manipulated to induce specific adaptations to the neuromuscular system. While the benefits of resistance exercise on the neuromuscular system are well documented, there is growing evidence to suggest that resistance exercise, even when performed acutely, can lead to neuroplastic changes within the central nervous system (CNS) and improve cognitive functioning. As such, resistance exercise has been proposed as a novel adjuvant rehabilitation strategy in populations that suffer from neurological or neurocognitive impairments (i.e. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's dementia) or even to attenuate age-related declines in cognitive health. In this review, we present evidence for the neuroplastic effects and cognitive benefits of resistance exercise and propose some of the underlying mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity following resistance training. We will further discuss the effects of exercise parameters, in particular exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality to improve cognitive health. Lastly, we will highlight some of the existing limitations in the literature surrounding the use of resistance exercise to improve cognitive function and propose considerations to improve future studies in this field. In summary, the current evidence supports the role of resistance exercise, as a stand alone or in combination with aerobic exercise, for benefiting cognitive health and that it should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to treat age- or disease-related cognitive declines."

This contributes to reduced mobility and impaired quality of life (QoL) among seniors. Regular physical activity, and more particularly aerobic training (AT), has demonstrated benefits on adults' health. The aim of this review was to assess the current level of evidence regarding the health benefits of AT in the population aged 70 years and over. A comprehensive, systematic database search for manuscripts was performed. Two reviewers independently assessed interventional studies for potential inclusion. Cardiovascular, metabolic, functional, cognitive, and QoL outcomes were targeted. Fifty-three studies were included totalling 2051 seniors aged 70 years and over. Studies selected were divided into 5 categories according to their main outcomes: cardiovascular function (34 studies), metabolic outcomes (26 studies), functional fitness (19 studies), cognitive functions (8 studies), and QoL (3 studies). With a good level of evidence but a wide heterogeneity between study designs, a significant and beneficial effect of AT was measured on the 5 outcomes. For QoL results showed a significant but slighter improvement. This systematic review highlights the benefits of AT on seniors' health outcome such as cardiovascular, functional, metabolic, cognitive, and QoL outcomes although the optimal program remains unclear. When more studies regarding this specific population are needed to determine the most favourable exercise program, clinicians should nevertheless encourage older adults over 70 to participate in AT programs to favour active and healthy ageing."

Each task replicates activities of daily living performed in a familiar environment. The main goal of the present study was to ascertain whether Smart Aging could differentiate between different types and levels of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29 ± 7.70 years)-healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)-were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients. Finally, the Smart Aging scores significantly correlated with the results of the neuropsychological assessments used. Conclusion: These findings, although preliminary due to the small sample size, suggest the validity of Smart Aging as a screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative diseases."

The study design was a qualitative interview study with 21 participants (15 women), aged 74-96, and with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 10-23 at study start. The HIFE-program comprises exercises performed in functional weight-bearing positions and including movements used in everyday tasks. The exercise was individually designed, supervised in small groups in the nursing homes and performed during four months. Interviews were performed directly after exercise sessions and field notes about the sessions were recorded. Qualitative content analysis was used for analyses. The analysis revealed four themes: Exercise is challenging but achievable; Exercise gives pleasure and strength; Exercise evokes body memories; and Togetherness gives comfort, joy, and encouragement. The intense and tailored exercise, adapted to each participant, was perceived as challenging but achievable, and gave pleasure and improvements in mental and bodily strength. Memories of previous physical activities aroused and participants rediscovered bodily capabilities. Importance of individualized and supervised exercise in small groups was emphasized and created feelings of encouragement, safety, and coherence. The findings from the interviews reinforces the positive meaning of intense exercise to older people with moderate to severe dementia in nursing homes. The participants were able to safely adhere to and understand the necessity of the exercise. Providers of exercise should consider the aspects valued by participants, e.g. supervision, individualization, small groups, encouragement, and that exercise involved joy and rediscovery of body competencies."

Clinical dementia does not develop suddenly, but rather is preceded by a period of cognitive decline beyond normal age-related change. People at this intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia are often described as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease-modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of at least 12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) on maintaining or improving cognitive function and preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched to 31 May 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) and ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which cognitive training via interactive computerised technology was compared with an active or inactive control intervention. Experimental computerised cognitive training (CCT) interventions had to adhere to the following criteria: minimum intervention duration of 12 weeks; any form of interactive computerised cognitive training, including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality. Participants were adults with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or otherwise at high risk of cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to describe the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight RCTs with a total of 660 participants met review inclusion criteria. Duration of the included trials varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. Only one trial used an inactive control. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. Overall, our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by very low-quality evidence. Almost all results were very imprecise; there were also problems related to risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and indirectness of the evidence.No trial provided data on incident dementia. For comparisons of CCT with both active and inactive controls, the quality of evidence on our other primary outcome of global cognitive function immediately after the intervention period was very low. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about this outcome.Due to very low quality of evidence, we were also unable to determine whether there was any effect of CCT compared to active control on our secondary outcomes of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, depression, functional performance, and mortality. We found low-quality evidence suggesting that there is probably no effect on speed of processing (SMD 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies; 119 participants), verbal fluency (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.44; 3 studies; 150 participants), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -1.85 to 2.65; 1 study; 19 participants).When CCT was compared with inactive control, we obtained data on five secondary outcomes, including episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, depression, and functional performance. We found very low-quality evidence; therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about these outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently available evidence does not allow us to determine whether or not computerised cognitive training will prevent clinical dementia or improve or maintain cognitive function in those who already have evidence of cognitive impairment. Small numbers of trials, small samples, risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and highly imprecise results mean that it is not possible to derive any implications for clinical practice, despite some observed large effect sizes from individual studies. Direct adverse events are unlikely to occur, although the time and sometimes the money involved in computerised cognitive training programmes may represent significant burdens. Further research is necessary and should concentrate on improving methodological rigour, selecting suitable outcomes measures, and assessing generalisability and persistence of any effects. Trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the potential of this intervention to reduce the risk of dementia."

Research has repeatedly shown that AVG experience can causally enhance cognitive ability and is related to neural plasticity in gray matter and functional networks in the brain. However, the relation between AVG experience and the plasticity of white matter (WM) network still remains unclear. WM network modulates the distribution of action potentials, coordinating the communication between brain regions and acting as the framework of neural networks. And various types of cognitive deficits are usually accompanied by impairments of WM networks. Thus, understanding this relation is essential in assessing the influence of AVG experience on neural plasticity and using AVG experience as an interventional tool for impairments of WM networks. Using graph theory, this study analyzed WM networks in AVG experts and amateurs. Results showed that AVG experience is related to altered WM networks in prefrontal networks, limbic system, and sensorimotor networks, which are related to cognitive control and sensorimotor functions. These results shed new light on the influence of AVG experience on the plasticity of WM networks and suggested the clinical applicability of AVG experience."

This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools-for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely."

Metrics collected by TELE were used to categorize participants as: cognitively impaired, suffering mild cognitive impairment, or cognitively healthy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participation in vigorous physical activity compared to non-participation for both 1975 and 1981 was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment in individual-based analyses (fully adjusted OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.73). Pairwise analyses yielded similar but statistically non-significant associations. In terms of the volume of physical activity, the most active quintile of individuals (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46-1.04) had a reduced risk of cognitive decline compared with the most sedentary quintile in the fully adjusted model although no clear dose-response was found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Vigorous midlife physical activity was associated with less cognitive impairment but without a clear dose-response association between the volume of physical activity and cognition."

            "abstract": "The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in mental health problems. The lives of people suffering from an anxiety disorder can be severely impaired. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is an effective treatment, which immerses patients in a controlled Virtual Environment (VE). This creates the opportunity to confront feared stimuli and learn how to deal with them, which may result in the reduction of anxiety. The configuration of these VEs requires extensive effort to maximise the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) and the effectiveness of the therapy. Manual configuration becomes infeasible when the number of possible virtual stimuli combinations is infinite. Due to the growing complexity, acquiring the skills to truly master a VR system is difficult and it increases the threshold for psychotherapists to use such useful systems. We therefore developed a prototype of a supportive algorithm to facilitate the use of VRET in a clinical setting. This automatised system assists psychotherapists to use the wide range of functionalities without burdening them with technical challenges. Thus, psychotherapists can focus their attention on the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this paper both the prototype of the algorithm and a first proof of concept are described. The algorithm suggests environment configurations for VRET, tailored to the individual therapeutic needs of each patient. The system aims to maximise learning during exposure therapy for different combinations of stimuli by using the Rescorla-Wagner model as a predictor for learning. In a first proof of concept, the VE configurations suggested by the algorithm for three anonymised clinical vignettes were compared with prior manual configurations by two psychotherapists.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prototype of the algorithm and a first proof of concept are described. The first proof of concept demonstrated the relevance and potential of the proposed system, as it managed to propose similar configurations for the clinical vignettes compared to those made by therapists. Nonetheless, because of the exploratory nature of the study, no claims can yet be made about its efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      With the increasing ubiquity of immersive technologies, this technology for assisted configuration of VEs could make VRET a valuable tool for psychotherapists."

            "abstract": "Dementia is understood to arise from a mixed etiology, enveloping chronic inflammatory and vascular impacts on the brain, driven by a constellation of modifiable risk factors which are largely mediated by lifestyle-related behaviors. These risk factors manifest over a prolonged preclinical period and account for up to 40% of the population attributable risk for dementia, representing viable targets for early interventions aimed at abating disease onset and progression. Here we outline the protocol for a 12-week randomized control trial (RCT) of a multimodal Lifestyle Intervention Study for Dementia Risk Reduction (LEISURE), with longitudinal follow-up at 6-months and 24-months post-intervention. This trial integrates exercise, diet, sleep, and mindfulness to simultaneously target multiple different etiopathogenetic mechanisms and their interplay in a healthy older adult population (aged 50-85 years), and assesses dementia risk reduction as the primary endpoint. The LEISURE study is located in the Sunshine Coast region of Australia, which has one of the nation's highest proportions of adults aged over 50 years (36.4%), and corresponding dementia prevalence. This trial is novel in its inclusion of mindfulness and sleep as multidomain lifestyle targets, and in its comprehensive suite of secondary outcomes (based on psychological, physical health, sleep activity, and cognitive data) as well as exploratory neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) and molecular biology measures. These measures will provide greater insights into the brain-behavioral underpinnings of dementia prevention, as well as the predictors and impacts of the proposed lifestyle intervention. The LEISURE study was prospectively registered (ACTRN12620000054910) on 19 January 2020."

There was a gradual increase in the odds ratio (OR) for UI depending on the ADL hierarchy scale, from the hierarchy scales of \"supervised\" to \"total dependence\" of 1.43 - 30.25. For CPS, the OR for UI from \"borderline intact\" to \"very severe impairment\" was 1.35 - 5.99. Considering the interaction between ADL and CPS, all ADL hierarchies remained significantly associated with UI, however for CPS this was the case only in the lower hierarchies. Of the 11 examined comorbid conditions, only diabetes mellitus (OR 1.19), dementia (OR 1.01) and arthrosis/arthritis (OR 1.53) were significantly associated with UI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The study indicated that impairment in ADL performance is strongly associated with UI, more than CPS performance and comorbidities.

            "abstract": "In an aging population with increasing incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment, strategies are needed to slow age-related decline and reduce disease-related cognitive impairment in older adults. Physical exercise that targets modifiable risk factors and neuroprotective mechanisms may reduce declines in cognitive performance attributed to the normal aging process and protect against changes related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. In this review we summarize the role of exercise in neuroprotection and cognitive performance, and provide information related to implementation of physical exercise programs for older adults. Evidence from both animal and human studies supports the role of physical exercise in modifying metabolic, structural, and functional dimensions of the brain and preserving cognitive performance in older adults. The results of observational studies support a dose-dependent neuroprotective relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance in older adults. Although some clinical trials of exercise interventions demonstrate positive effects of exercise on cognitive performance, other trials show minimal to no effect. Although further research is needed, physical exercise interventions aimed at improving brain health through neuroprotective mechanisms show promise for preserving cognitive performance. Exercise programs that are structured, individualized, higher intensity, longer duration, and multicomponent show promise for preserving cognitive performance in older adults."

A large number of players play online games recreationally without being addicted to it. These individuals are defined as recreational Internet gaming users (RGU). So far, no research has investigated decision-making and impulse control in RGU. In the current study, we used delay discounting (DD) task and probabilistic discounting (PD) task to examine decision-making and impulse control in 20 healthy controls, 20 subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and 23 RGU during fMRI scanning. At the behavioral level, RGU showed lower DD rate and higher PD rate than subjects with IGD and there was no significant difference between RGU and healthy controls on the DD and PD rates. At the neural level, RGU showed increased neural response in the parahippocampal gyrus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus as compared with subjects with IGD. These brain regions may play an important role in preventing RGU from developing addiction. The results suggest that the RGU are capable of inhibiting impulse due to additional cognitive endeavor and the subjects with IGD have deficit in decision-making and impulsive control, which are associated with brain dysfunction."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive impairment is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Physical exercise represents a promising non-pharmacological therapy option, however, potential predictors for successful cognitive improvements mediated by exercise remain to be elucidated in order to optimize targeted exercise training regimens. One of the most promising exercise training regime in this context is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Against this backdrop, this study i) analysed the effects of a three-week HIIT compared to moderate continuous exercise on cognitive performance and ii) investigated potential predictors for changes of cognitive performance following a three-week aerobic exercise intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Datasets of two randomized controlled trials (RCT) were pooled, resulting in a total sample size of n = 130 persons with MS (pwMS) who either performed HIIT or moderate intensity continuous (MCT) exercise 3-5x/ week for three weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS. I) Potential within (time) and interaction (time x group) effects for cognitive performance were investigated with univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). II) Potential predictors for changes of cognitive performance were assessed by multiple linear regression models.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ANCOVA revealed significant time effects for all cognitive outcomes and a time x group interaction for verbal learning (p=.045), with HIIT inducing superior effects compared to moderate continuous exercise (MCT). Cognitive status (impaired/intact cognition) (p= .008) and exercise regime (HIIT/moderate continuous) (p=.040) influenced changes of verbal learning. Cognitive status (p=.006) and EDSS (p=.048) affected changes of visuospatial memory in pwMS. The models accounted for 5.4% and 7.7% of the variance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive status, exercise regime and EDSS potentially impact changes of specific cognitive domains following aerobic exercise. Further predictors for changes of cognitive performance following an aerobic exercise intervention need to be investigated as current results accounted only for a limited amount of variance. RCTs that investigate effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance should include only pwMS with impaired baseline cognitive performance. To better understand the impact of exercise on cognitive performance, it is furthermore recommendable to include cognitive assessments in clinical routine."

            "abstract": "Purpose To investigate thalamic connectivity changes after use of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program, as thalamic damage and alterations in thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) are important factors in cognitive dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethical committee. Twenty-four patients with MS and cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a wait-list group. Patients were evaluated with cognitive tests and 3-T resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at baseline and after an 8-week period. In addition, 11 healthy subjects underwent baseline resting-state functional MR imaging. Patients in the intervention group performed the video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program, while those in the wait-list group served as control subjects. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test efficacy of the intervention. The thalamic resting-state network was identified with a seed-based method; both first-level and high-level analyses were performed by using software tools. Results Patients showed lower baseline FC compared with healthy subjects. A significant improvement was seen in results of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and the Stroop Test after 8 weeks of cognitive rehabilitation (F = 6.616, [P = .018] and F = 5.325 [P = .030], respectively). At follow-up, the intervention group had an increased FC in the cingulum, precuneus, and bilateral parietal cortex and a lower FC in the cerebellum and in left prefrontal cortex compared with the wait-list group (P < .05, family-wise error corrected); correlations were found between FC changes in these regions and cognitive improvement (P < .05, family-wise error corrected). Conclusion The results of this study show the relevance of thalamic regulation of the brain networks involved in cognition and suggest that changes in thalamic resting-state network connectivity may represent a functional substrate for cognitive improvement associated with a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program.

These devices often allow the patient to perform practical, attentive, and visual-spatial tasks in a semi-virtual reality (VR) setting. We aimed to investigate whether the hand end-effector robotic device AmadeoTM could improve cognitive performance, beyond the motor deficit, as compared to the same amount of occupational treatment focused on the hand. Forty-eight patients (aged 54.3 ± 10.5 years, 62.5% female) affected by either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the chronic phase were enrolled in the study. The experimental group (EG) underwent AmadeoTM robotic training, while the control group (CG) performed occupational therapy involving the upper limb. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation protocol using a specific neuropsychological battery, as well as motor function tests. The EG showed greater improvements in different cognitive domains, including attentive abilities and executive functions, as well as in hand motor function, as compared to CG. Our study showed that task-oriented VR-based robotic rehabilitation enhanced not only motor function in the paretic arm but also global and specific cognitive abilities in post-stroke patients. We may argue that the hand robotic plus VR-based training may provide patients with an integration of cognitive and motor skill rehabilitation, thus amplifying the functional outcome achievement."

African Americans are almost two times more likely than Caucasians to experience cognitive impairment in late adulthood. This increased risk may be attributed to lower level and quality of education, lower socioeconomic status, and higher prevalence of vascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of which are recognized as risk factors for dementia. Fortunately, interventions targeting cardiovascular health (i.e., physical activity) are associated with improved neurocognitive function and a reduced risk for dementia, so African Americans may be particularly suited for interventions targeting cardiovascular health and cognitive function. Here, we describe a randomized intervention protocol for increasing physical activity in older (65-75years) African Americans. Participants (n=80) at two study locations will be randomized into one of two groups. The treatment group will participate in African Dance three times per week for six months and the control group will receive educational training on Africana history and culture, as well as information about health behaviors, three times per week for six months.

The group of older adults included both healthy adults and those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Participant´s performance in various cognitive domains was evaluated using 12 cognitive measures from five neuropsychological tests. Four summary cognitive indexes were calculated for each case: 1) the z-score of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from a population norm (MMSE z-score); 2) the sum of the absolute z-scores of the patients' neuropsychological measures from a population norm (ZSum); 3) the first principal component scores obtained from the individual cognitive variables z-scores (PCCog); and 4) the Mahalanobis distance between the vector that represents the subject's cognitive state (defined by the 12 cognitive variables) and the vector corresponding to a population norm (MDCog).

Sixteen STGF for each walking task, and the dual-task costs for the dual tasks (when a subject performs an attention-demanding task and walks at the same time) were computed.

The objectives were to examine age-related effects on visuo-spatial working memory capabilities in various environments and to determine the impact of landmarks in navigation skills in normal aging. 42 young women (23.6 ± 4.9 years) and 37 older women (70.7 ± 4.7 years) with no cognitive impairment have performed three visuo-spatial working memory tests: one in reaching space (computerized Corsi-Block-Tapping test) and two in locomotor navigation space (a condition without landmarks: Virtual Walking Corsi Test and a condition with landmarks: Virtual Room Walking Test). A two-way mixed ANOVA test showed that the young subjects performed better in all conditions than older subjects. The performance in visuo-spatial working memory thus decreases with age. Visuo-spatial working memory performances were identical in reaching and navigation spaces for both groups. The integration of landmarks into a navigational task decreases performance in older women, while this performance is not altered in younger women."

This chapter is an attempt to introduce a virtual reality computer-based intervention, which can used for cognitive stimulating and disease progression evaluation of a wide range of cognitive disorders ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease and various dementias. Virtual reality (VR) environments have already been successfully used in cognitive rehabilitation and show increased potential for use in neuropsychological evaluation allowing for greater ecological validity while being more engaging and user friendly. Nevertheless a holistic approach has been attempted, in order to view the research themes and applications that currently exist around the ‘‘intelligent systems’’ healthcare given to the cognitively impaired persons, and thus looking at research directions, systems, technological frameworks and perhaps trends."

            "abstract": "Mental fatigue (MF) impairs endurance exercise performance. Brain endurance training (BET) describes the systematic repetition of mentally-fatiguing cognitive tasks designed to build resilience to MF and improve endurance performance. Evidence to date shows that mental training during physical training can benefit post-training exercise performance, however, this concurrent BET approach may not be practical for all settings. Therefore, the current study evaluated the effects of mental training before physical training (prior BET) on exercise performance. A randomised control trial design: pre-test, training (BET, control), post-test. During the pre-test and post-test sessions, participants performed a 5-min rhythmic handgrip task requiring the generation of as much force as possible, a 20-min 2-back working memory task, and another 5-min rhythmic handgrip task. Participants were randomly assigned to a BET (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). Both groups completed the same submaximal rhythmic handgrip training for five weeks (four sessions per week). The BET group also completed 20-min cognitive training (2-back working memory task, incongruent colour-word Stroop task) before each submaximal exercise training session. Endurance performance improved more (p < 0.05) following BET (24%) than physical training alone (12%). Compared to the control group, the BET group showed higher prefrontal oxygenation during the post-test exercise tasks (p < 0.05). Both groups were characterised by the same exertion, motivation, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Mental training before physical training improves endurance performance greater than physical training alone. The benefits of prior BET may be explained, at least in part, by improved prefrontal oxygenation.HighlightsThis study provides further evidence that brain endurance training (BET) improves performance over matched physical training.Prior BET (i.e. engaging in mentally demanding cognitive tasks before physical training) offers another option to enhance fatigue resilience, which expands the use of BET to more sports and potentially higher intensity training where concurrent BET will not be practical.The benefits of prior BET may be explained, at least in part, by improved prefrontal oxygenation."

            "abstract": "It is well known that regular low or mild exercise helps to improve and maintain cognition. On the other hand, ever thought many people prefer high-intensity exercise (e.g., running, swimming, biking, soccer, basketball, etc.) to get rid of stress or improve their health, the previous studies reported that intense exercise either impairs cognition or has no effect on cognitive function. However, we previously showed that intermittent intense exercise prevents stress-induced depressive behavior in mice in a similar manner to moderate exercise. On the basis of this finding, we investigated the effect of intermittent intense exercise on cognitive deficit in chronically stressed mice. A total of forty mice were evenly divided into control, stressed, stressed with moderate exercise, and stressed with intense exercise groups. The stressed mice were chronically exposed a restraint stress (10 h/day, 6 days/week for 7 weeks). The exercised mice were subjected to intermittent intense or endurance moderate running on the treadmill three times a week. Cognition was evaluated using the Morris water maze test and the object recognition test. Chronic stress decreased cognition, and newborn cell survival and blood vessel density in the hippocampus. However, both regular intense and moderate exercise prevented decrease of cognition, improved newborn cell survival and blood vessel density. These findings suggest that intermittent intense exercise may protect against decrease of cognition in a similar manner to moderate exercise and that both exercise-induced protection of decrease of cognition is closely related to newborn cell survival and angiogenesis in the hippocampus."

            "abstract": "Researchers have been divided on the efficacy of computerized cognitive training (CCT) for enhancing spatial abilities, transfer of training, and improving malleability of skills. In this study, we assessed the effects of puzzle video game training on subsequent mental rotation (MR) and mental folding (MF) performance among adults with no cognitive impairment. We assessed participants at baseline with the Shepard-Metzler MR test followed by the differential aptitude test: space relations MF test (i.e., far transfer). We ranked participants' skills on these pre-tests and used a matching technique to form two skill groups from which we then randomly assigned members of each skill group either to an experimental group or a wait-list control group. The experimental group played two puzzle video games closely related to two-dimensional and three-dimensional MR tasks during 4-week training sessions (total of 12 hour of video games). Post-training, participants completed the MR and MF tests again. Two months later, we re-assessed only the experimental group's spatial skills to explore the sustainability of the trained performance. In addition to response times (RT) and error scores (ES), reported separately, we combined these variables into rate correct scores (RCS) to form an integrated measure of potential speed-accuracy trade-offs (SAT). As a result, we did not find significant improvements in MR performance from CCT engagement, nor did participants show a transfer of skills obtained by practicing MR-related puzzle games to a MF task. Based on the current findings, we urge caution when proposing a game-based intervention as a training tool to enhance spatial abilities. We argue that separately interpreting individual test measures can be misleading, as they only partially represent performance. In contrast, composite scores illuminate underlying cognitive strategies and best determine whether an observed improvement is attributable to enhanced capacities or individual heuristics and learned cognitive shortcuts."

The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of physical exercise on cognition in older subjects with MCI or dementia. PubMed, Cochrane and DARE databases were systematically searched for RCTs using terms related to cognition and physical exercise. Altogether, 22 trials were found. The studies on older subjects with MCI reported some positive effects of physical exercise on cognition, mainly on global cognition, executive function, attention and delayed recall. However, most studies performed on older subjects with dementia showed no effect of exercise on cognition. The studies had methodological problems in defining dementia/MCI diagnosis, blinding, inadequate sample sizes and not reporting dropouts, compliance or complications.

There is however, no direct evidence that reducing these risk factors prevents or slows AD. The Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease (rrAD) trial is designed to study the independent and combined effects of intensive pharmacological control of blood pressure and cholesterol and exercise training on neurocognitive function. Six hundred and forty cognitively normal older adults age 60 to 85 years with hypertension and increased risk for dementia will be enrolled. Participants are randomized into one of four intervention group for two years: usual care, Intensive Reduction of Vascular Risk factors (IRVR) with blood pressure and cholesterol reduction, exercise training (EX), and IRVR+EX. Neurocognitive function is measured at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; brain MRIs are obtained at baseline and 24 months. We hypothesize that both IRVR and EX will improve global cognitive function, while IRVR+EX will provide a greater benefit than either IRVR or EX alone. We also hypothesize that IRVR and EX will slow brain atrophy, improve brain structural and functional connectivity, and improve brain perfusion. Finally, we will explore the mechanisms by which study interventions impact neurocognition and brain. If rrAD interventions are shown to be safe, practical, and successful, our study will have a significant impact on reducing the risks of AD in older adults. NCT Registration: NCT02913664."

            "abstract": "Long-range autocorrelations (LRA) are a robust feature of rhythmic movements, which may provide important information about neural control and potentially constitute a powerful marker of dysfunction. A clear difficulty associated with the assessment of LRA is that it requires a large number of cycles to generate reliable results. Here we investigate how series length impacts the reliability of LRA assessment. A total of 94 time series extracted from walking or cycling tasks were re-assessed with series length varying from 64 to 512 data points. LRA were assessed using an approach combining the rescaled range analysis or the detrended fluctuation analysis (Hurst exponent, H), along with the shape of the power spectral density (α exponent). The statistical precision was defined as the ability to obtain estimates for H and α that are consistent with their theoretical relationship, irrespective of the series length. The sensitivity consisted of testing whether significant differences between experimental conditions found in the original studies when considering 512 data points persisted with shorter series. We also investigate the use of evenly-spaced diffusion plots as a methodological improvement of original version of methods for short series. Our results show that the reliable assessment of LRA requires 512 data points, or no shorter than 256 data points provided that more robust methods are considered such as the evenly-spaced algorithms. Such series can be reasonably obtained in clinical populations with moderate, or even more severe, gait impairments and open the perspective to extend the use of LRA assessment as a marker of gait stability applicable to a broad range of locomotor disorders."

Unfortunately, conventional balance exercise programs are not tailored to patients with cognitive impairments, and exercise adherence is often poor due to unsupervised settings. This study describes the acceptability and feasibility of a sensor-based in-home interactive exercise system, called tele-Exergame, used by older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Our tele-Exergame is specifically designed to improve balance and cognition during distractive conditioning while a telemedicine interface remotely supervises the exercise, and its exercises are gamified balance tasks with explicit augmented visual feedback. Fourteen adults with MCI or dementia (Age = 68.1 ± 5.4 years, 12 females) participated and completed exergame twice weekly for six weeks at their homes. Before and after 6 weeks, participants' acceptance was assessed by Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, and participants' cognition and anxiety level were evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. Results support acceptability, perceived benefits, and positive attitudes toward the use of the system. The findings of this study support the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefit of tele-Exergame to preserve cognitive function among older adults with MCI and dementia."

Positive symptoms respond well to antipsychotic medication and psycho-social interventions, in contrast to negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments. Cognitive deficits have been linked to a poorer outcome and hence specific cognitive remediation therapies have been proposed. Their effectiveness is nowadays approved and neurobiological correlates have been reconfirmed by brain imaging studies. Interestingly, recent MRI work showed that commercial video games modified similar brain areas as these specialized training programs. If gray matter increases and functional brain modulations would translate in better cognitive and every day functioning, commercial video game training could be an enjoyable and economically interesting treatment option for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

            "abstract": "Virtual reality has gained attention as an effective tool for cognitive, motor, and daily activity rehabilitation in patients with major neurocognitive disorder (M-NCD). The first objective of this study was to check for differences between M-NCD caused by degenerative and non-degenerative conditions (DC and NDC, respectively) in terms of relearning four functional living skills (FLSs), by means of a non-immersive virtual reality training (VRT). The second purpose was to verify whether spontaneous transfer from the virtual environment to the real environment occurred. Four FLS apps were developed in our institute (Information, Suitcase, Medicine, and Supermarket). A nonrandomized interventional study was carried out, comparing experimental and control groups (EG and CG, respectively). The study included three phases: in vivo test at T1; VRT at T2 only for EG; in vivo test at T3. During the in vivo test, the four FLSs were assessed in their natural environments. Both EG-DC and EG-NDC significantly improved in all of the VRT variable scores (the EG-NDC group seemed to show better outcomes than the EG-DC group). Moderate-to-high satisfaction with the VRT was reported. EG-DC and EG-NDC also enhanced their performances in the in vivo test. No statistically significant differences between them were found. CG-DC and CG-NDC improved only in the execution time of Information in the in vivo test. These findings confirm the ecological validity of VRT for FLSs."

However, research has traditionally focused on treating cognitive symptoms, thus neglecting core clinical symptoms that often have a more profound impact on living with dementia. Recent evidence (Kales et al, 2007; Ballard et al, 2009) indicates that the popular approach to managing BPSD - prescription of anti-psychotic medication - can increase mortality and the risk of stroke in people with dementia as well as impair quality of life and accelerate cognitive decline.

            "abstract": "Aerobic training improves cognitive and brain outcomes across different populations and neurocognitive disorders of aging, including mild subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment (SIVCI). However, little is known of the underlying mechanisms through which aerobic training exerts its beneficial effects on the brain. Recently, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) has been proposed as a possible mediator of aerobic training. Thus we conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from the proof-of-concept single-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT01027858) in older adults with mild SIVCI to determine whether the beneficial effects of 6-months, thrice weekly, moderate-intensity aerobic training on cognitive performance is related to changes in S100B levels. At trial completion, aerobic training decreased circulating levels of S100B compared with usual care plus education. Furthermore, reduced S100B levels were associated with improved global cognitive function in those who received the aerobic exercise intervention. Together these findings suggest that S100B is a promising target mediating the beneficial effects of moderate-intensity aerobic training on brain health in older adults with mild SIVCI."

            "abstract": "Research has found that body illusions may be accompanied by consequences for the real body whereby various somatosensory and homeostatic bodily functions may be impaired. These findings stem from research where an experimenter induced the body illusions. In line with advances in the domains of videogames and virtual reality where the real body is used as a controller we investigate if these consequences also accompany self-generated body illusions. In two preregistered experiments we made use of a head-mounted display set-up to induce the full body illusion (FBI) whereby touch is felt to originate from a 3PP body, and examined effects in the simple detection of supra-threshold vibrotactile stimuli presented to the participants' back and head. Results of both experiments indicate that it is possible to induce a FBI through self-stroking of the neck and that the FBI is accompanied by reduced accuracy and delayed reaction times in detection of somatosensory stimuli. In an additional preregistered control experiment the alternative explanation that a difference in motion presented in the conditions was responsible for these findings was ruled out. Our findings corroborate previous studies that have found body illusions to be accompanied by bodily consequences and further extend these findings to the domain of self-induced body illusions. These results are relevant for video games and VR setups that are geared towards virtual embodiment as they advance our understanding of the conditions and mechanisms in which bodily consequences may express themselves."

However, lockdown measures during COVID-19 have limited people's opportunity to exercise regularly. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of Fitness and Dance training, followed by four weeks of COVID-19-induced detraining, on cardiac adaptations and physical performance indicators in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twelve older adults (6 males and 6 females) with MCI (age, 73 ± 4.4 y; body mass, 75.3 ± 6.4 kg; height, 172 ± 8 cm; MMSE score: 24-27) participated in eight weeks of a combined Fitness-Dance training intervention (two sessions/week) followed by four weeks of training cessation induced by COVID-19 lockdowns. Wireless Polar Team Pro and Polar heart rate sensors (H10) were used to monitor covered distance, speed, heart rate (HR min, avg and max), time in HR zone 1 to 5, strenuousness (load score), beat-to-beat interval (max RR and avg RR) and heart rate variability (HRV-RMSSD). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data of the three test sessions (T1: first training session, T2: last training session of the eight-week training program, and T3: first training session after the four-week training cessation). Statistical analysis showed that eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training induced beneficial cardiac adaptations by decreasing HR (HR min, HR avg and HR max) with p < 0.001, ES = 0.5-0.6 and Δ = -7 to-9 bpm, and increasing HRV related responses (max and avg RR and RMSSD), with p < 0.01 and ES = 0.4. Consequently, participants spent more time in comfortable HR zones (e.g., p < 0.0005; ES = 0.7; Δ = 25% for HR zone 1) and showed reduced strenuousness (p = 0.02, Δ = -15% for load score), despite the higher covered total distance and average speed (p < 0.01; ES = 0.4). However, these changes were reversed after only four weeks of COVID-19 induced detraining, with values of all parameters returning to their baseline levels. In conclusion, eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training seems to be an efficient strategy to promote cardioprotective benefits in older adults with MCI. Importantly, to maintain these health benefits, training has to be continued and detraining periods should be reduced. During a pandemic, home-based exercise programs may provide an effective and efficient alternative of physical training."

An alternative approach is to focus on restoring precursor abilities such as motor adaptation and volitional movement, as is common in upper-limb robotic therapy.

A recumbent exercise cycle platform is powered with a servomotor and instrumented with angular encoders, force-torque sensing pedals, and a wireless EMG system. Virtual environments ranging from spring-mass-damper systems to novel foot-to-crank mechanical laws present variants of leg-reaching and pedaling tasks that challenge perception, cognition, motion planning, and motor control systems. This paper characterizes the dynamic performance and haptic rendering accuracy of NOTTABIKE and presents an example motor adaptation task to illustrate its use. Torque and velocity mode controllers showed near unity magnitude ratio and phase loss less than 60 degrees up to 10 Hz. Spring rendering demonstrated 1% mean error in stiffness, and damper rendering performed comparably at 2.5%. Virtual mass rendering was less accurate but successful in varying perceived mass.

            "abstract": "Cognitive load (CL) theory suggests that working memory can be overloaded in complex learning tasks such as surgical technical skills training, which can impair learning. Valid and feasible methods for estimating the CL in specific learning contexts are necessary before the efficacy of CL-lowering instructional interventions can be established. This study aims to explore secondary task precision for the estimation of CL in virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation and also investigate the effects of CL-modifying factors such as simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice. Twenty-four participants were randomized for visual assistance by a simulator-integrated tutor function during the first 5 of 12 repeated mastoidectomy procedures on a VR temporal bone simulator. Secondary task precision was found to be significantly lower during simulation compared with nonsimulation baseline, p < .001. Contrary to expectations, simulator-integrated tutoring and repeated practice did not have an impact on secondary task precision. This finding suggests that even though considerable changes in CL are reflected in secondary task precision, it lacks sensitivity. In contrast, secondary task reaction time could be more sensitive, but requires substantial postprocessing of data. Therefore, future studies on the effect of CL modifying interventions should weigh the pros and cons of the various secondary task measurements."

Three executive processes were measured: (1) response inhibition by Stroop Test; (2) working memory by digits backward test; and (3) set shifting by the Trail Making Test.

A complete case analysis (n = 58) was conducted using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate between-group differences in the three executive processes. A significant interaction was found between cardiovascular risk group and intervention group (AT or CON) for the digit span backward and the Trail Making Test.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression. Recent clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that swimming exercise could be a potential therapy for cognitive and behavioral disorders. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is increasing among patients with AD; hence, further studies are needed to develop therapies for these behavioral abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of swimming exercise on memory impairment, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer-like disease. Eight days after AD induction by streptozotocin (STZ), mice were subjected to the swimming exercise for four weeks. To assess cognitive functions, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in animals, Y-maze, novel object recognition, open field, zero maze, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were used. To understand the possible mechanisms, amyloid-β (Aβ)-42, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were measured in the hippocampus. The results of this study indicate that STZ administration impaired cognitive functions, increased anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and elevated Aβ-42, glutamate, MDA, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the hippocampus of mice. In contrast, swimming exercise significantly reversed these neurobehavioral disorders, increased BDNF, and decreased both glutamate and TNF-α in the hippocampus of STZ-treated mice. Overall, these findings provide some support for the idea that swimming exercise might be associated with reduced neurobehavioral disorders in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, further clinical studies on this topic are required to confirm and validate these findings."

            "abstract": "Dementia is one of the increasing problems of modern societies. The immediate cure is not a possible solution, at least at the moment, but science has found a number of new ways to retard and under specific conditions to halt its development. A potential, and constantly evolving scientific field is the use of Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation (CCR) and Virtual Environments (Vr.E). According to the existing literature, subjecting patients to various neuro-rehabilitative conditions within 3D virtual environments, allows them to obtain significant therapeutic benefits in which both transferability and durations over time are observed, in relation to the training period of the intervention. In the present study we examine whether \"Serious Games (SGs)\" - (learning and rehabilitating games in virtual and augmented reality) - have utilitarian value in the field of cognitive neurorehabilitation, concerned with demented population. For research purposes, we have conducted a number of case studies, based on 10 elderly patients, suffering from moderate or mild severity impairment of higher cortical functions, attributed to various types of dementias (Vascular, Alzheimer's disease, DLB dementia and mixed dementia). Each participant underwent rehabilitative intervention through our SG for a total of 10 hours within 4-5 weeks period. At the end of the cognitive rehabilitation program, patients' performance was assessed based in standard neuropsychological tests (measuring: working memory, memory retention, attention, problem solving, rigid thinking and executive function) and the results were compared with measurements taken before, during, and at the end of the intervention. Our experimental hypothesis states that there will be a significant difference between the results of cognitive performance of the patients between the pre- and post- rehabilitative period, consequential of the Interactive Computer-based Training (ICT). In conclusion, a review and brief analysis of the relevant literature was carried out in order to investigate the specification of potentially beneficial variables and to appreciate as much as possible the multifactorial causes related to this particular rehabilitation method of the corresponding suffering population. The ultimate purpose of our research is the design and creation of a prospective interactive cognitive rehabilitation training SG, able to combine both the neuro-rehabilitative character of the controlled virtual environment, as well as the potential realism that is also attributed to it (factual validity under high experimental realism). The results showed a relative improvement in the total of the cognitive variables under consideration after the completion of the neuro-rehabilitative program, while a parallel review of the literature on the subject revealed methodological considerations similar to those of the present study."

            "abstract": "Dementia is one of the greatest global challenges for health and social care in the 21st century. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is by no means an inevitable consequence of growing old. Several lifestyle factors may increase, or reduce, an individual's risk of developing AD. Much has been written over the ages about the benefits of exercise and physical activity. Among the risk factors associated with AD is a low level of physical activity. The relationship between physical and mental health was established several years ago. In this review, we discuss the role of exercise (aerobic and resistance) training as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. Older adults who exercise are more likely to maintain cognition. We address the main protective mechanism on brain function modulated by physical exercise by examining both human and animal studies. We will pay especial attention to the potential role of exercise in the modulation of amyloid β turnover, inflammation, synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and improvements in cerebral blood flow. Promoting changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias worldwide. Multimodal interventions that include the adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for older populations."

Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to one of three groups: one group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., CT), the second group engaged in a computerized training program focused on fast perceptual comparisons, visuospatial working memory, rapid scanning of a visual array and pattern recognition, visual discrimination, and selective and divided attention and processing speed (i.e., InSight), and the third (control) group received no training. Training in the two intervention conditions consisted of 60 training sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). As part of a larger study, participants received mental rotation testing, which was administered immediately before (baseline), after (post-test), and 3 months after (follow-up) training. Results: Although the InSight group showed greater improvements in rotation rate at the immediate post-test, by the 3-month follow-up, the combined treatment groups (CT and InSight) had improved more than controls. Conclusion: The improvements in mental rotation performance found at 3-month follow-up add additional support to previous research, showing visuospatial benefits of both videogame play and cognitive training in older adults.

Adults aged 60-90 years with a high risk of falls based on a history of two or more falls in the 6 months before the study and with varied motor and cognitive deficits were randomly assigned by use of computer-based allocation to receive 6 weeks of either treadmill training plus VR or treadmill training alone. Randomisation was stratified by subgroups of patients (those with a history of idiopathic falls, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with Parkinson's disease) and sex, with stratification per clinical site. Group allocation was done by a third party not involved in onsite study procedures. Both groups aimed to train three times per week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting about 45 min and structured training progression individualised to the participant's level of performance. The VR system consisted of a motion-capture camera and a computer-generated simulation projected on to a large screen, which was specifically designed to reduce fall risk in older adults by including real-life challenges such as obstacles, multiple pathways, and distracters that required continual adjustment of steps. The primary outcome was the incident rate of falls during the 6 months after the end of training, which was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who were assigned a treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01732653.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between Jan 6, 2013, and April 3, 2015, 302 adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill training plus VR group (n=154) or treadmill training alone group (n=148). Data from 282 (93%) participants were included in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat analysis. Before training, the incident rate of falls was similar in both groups (10·7 [SD 35·6] falls per 6 months for treadmill training alone vs 11·9 [39·5] falls per 6 months for treadmill training plus VR). In the 6 months after training, the incident rate was significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than it had been before training (6·00 [95% CI 4·36-8·25] falls per 6 months; p<0·0001 vs before training), whereas the incident rate did not decrease significantly in the treadmill training alone group (8·27 [5·55-12·31] falls per 6 months; p=0·49). 6 months after the end of training, the incident rate of falls was also significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than in the treadmill training group (incident rate ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·36-0·96; p=0·033). No serious training-related adverse events occurred.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      In a diverse group of older adults at high risk for falls, treadmill training plus VR led to reduced fall rates compared with treadmill training alone.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      European Commission."

Cognitive impairment due to vascular pathology of the brain, termed vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), is one of the most frequent causes of cognitive impairment in elderly subjects. Thus far, VCI has no specific pharmacological treatment. Recent observational studies have suggested a protective effect of physical activity in cognition, but adequate randomised controlled trials (RCT) are lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      AFIVASC is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, with a 6-month intervention treatment and an additional follow-up of 6 months, that aims to estimate the impact of 6 months of moderate intensity physical activity on cognition (the primary outcome) at 6 and 12 months in subjects with VCI.

The quantitative analysis showed equal completion rates for the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the accelerometer but a lower completion rate for the calendar. Correlations between outcome measures were moderate or strong. The qualitative analysis indicated that all measures were acceptable, though some participants required help to complete the calendars or fasten the accelerometers.

Although the interrelation between cortisol and cytokines was fully elucidated previously, few studies considered how their association with exercise can affect brain structures or play an anti-inflammatory role in preserving cognitive function among older adults. To evaluate both the neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory activities of moderate aerobic exercise in improving cognitive performance among healthy older adults, the serum levels of CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and cortisol and their correlation with cognitive performance were estimated in all participants. A total of 60 healthy older adults aged 50-85 years were included in this study. The Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) test, colorimetric testing, and ELISA immunoassays were used to measure cognitive abilities; blood sugar; and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cortisol, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, respectively, in older adults before and after 12-week exercise interventions. Exactly 50% of the participants showed moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) (LOTCA scores: 84.8 ± 8.2), and the remaining 50% of the participants (n = 30) were diagnosed as normal healthy subjects (LOTCA scores: 98.7 ± 8.1). There was a significant association between cognitive decline in LOTCA scores of motor praxis, vasomotor organization, thinking operations, and attention and concentration and higher levels of cortisol, CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as adiposity markers BMI and WHR, in the MCI group compared to control subjects. However, significant improvements in the same LOTCA score domains in MCI subjects were recorded along with decrements in the levels of cortisol and cytokine CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as improved adiposity markers, following a 12-week moderate exercise program. Cognitive performance correlated positively with cortisol levels and negatively with physical activity, adiposity markers, and cytokine levels. Also, in participants with normal and abnormal cortisol profiles, there was a positive interrelation between cytokine levels and cortisol. Moderate aerobic exercise for 12 weeks showed beneficial effects on cognitive performance in older adults. Our results suggest that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise improves cognitive disorders in older adults via modulating stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may have been due to significant changes in the levels of cortisol, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, and physical activity may thus be used as non-drug strategy for treating cognitive disorders."

            "abstract": "A rapidly growing literature strongly suggests that exercise, specifically aerobic exercise, may attenuate cognitive impairment and reduce dementia risk. We used PubMed (keywords exercise and cognition) and manuscript bibliographies to examine the published evidence of a cognitive neuroprotective effect of exercise. Meta-analyses of prospective studies documented a significantly reduced risk of dementia associated with midlife exercise; similarly, midlife exercise significantly reduced later risks of mild cognitive impairment in several studies. Among patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) documented better cognitive scores after 6 to 12 months of exercise compared with sedentary controls. Meta-analyses of RCTs of aerobic exercise in healthy adults were also associated with significantly improved cognitive scores. One year of aerobic exercise in a large RCT of seniors was associated with significantly larger hippocampal volumes and better spatial memory; other RCTs in seniors documented attenuation of age-related gray matter volume loss with aerobic exercise. Cross-sectional studies similarly reported significantly larger hippocampal or gray matter volumes among physically fit seniors compared with unfit seniors. Brain cognitive networks studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging display improved connectivity after 6 to 12 months of exercise. Animal studies indicate that exercise facilitates neuroplasticity via a variety of biomechanisms, with improved learning outcomes. Induction of brain neurotrophic factors by exercise has been confirmed in multiple animal studies, with indirect evidence for this process in humans. Besides a brain neuroprotective effect, physical exercise may also attenuate cognitive decline via mitigation of cerebrovascular risk, including the contribution of small vessel disease to dementia. Exercise should not be overlooked as an important therapeutic strategy."

It is important that non-pharmacological therapies are utilized to help manage the symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, as they are the recommended first approach in best practice guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial with a qualitative component which evaluated the effects and feasibility of a physical therapist-led physical exercise intervention on agitation of individuals living with dementia in nursing homes. Physical performance levels were considered as a secondary outcome. This evidence-based protocol consisted of a range of adaptable physical exercises that targeted strength, balance, endurance, and flexibility. To help determine the optimum parameters for this population group, the study used two intervention groups: (a) physical exercise intervention for 45 minutes once a week; (b) physical exercise intervention for 15 minutes three times a week (total time also 45 minutes per week). Both intervention groups were compared to a control group, which continued to participate in usual care only (no specific physical exercise intervention), such as basic seated exercise class, carpet bowls, and \"armchair\" activities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The physical therapist-led physical exercise intervention detailed in this protocol could be integrated into dementia care in nursing homes or other similar settings to help reduce agitation and improve physical performance."

However, the evidence gathered in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of exercise training for improving spatio-temporal gait parameters in people with dementia is scarce. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a specific, standardized training regimen can improve gait characteristics in people with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-one individuals (mean age: 81.9 years) with confirmed mild to moderate stage dementia took part in a 3-month double-blinded outpatient RCT. Subjects in the intervention group (IG) received supervised, progressive resistance and functional group training for 3 months (2 times per week for two hours) specifically developed for people with dementia. Subjects in the control group (CG) conducted a low-intensity motor placebo activity program. Gait characteristics were measured before and after the intervention period using a computerized gait analysis system (GAITRite®).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Adherence to the intervention was excellent, averaging 91.9% in the IG and 94.4% in the CG. The exercise training significantly improved gait speed (P < 0.001), cadence (P = 0.002), stride length (P = 0.008), stride time (P = 0.001), and double support (P = 0.001) in the IG compared to the CG. Effect sizes were large for all gait parameters that improved significantly (Cohen's d: 0.80-1.27). No improvements were found for step width (P = 0.999), step time variability (P = 0.425) and Walk-Ratio (P = 0.554). Interestingly, low baseline motor status, but not cognitive status, predicted positive training response (relative change in gait speed from baseline).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The intensive, dementia-adjusted training was feasible and improved clinically meaningful gait variables in people with dementia.

Impairments in the cholinergic-mediated attentional supervision of gait may contribute to increased fall risk, especially when obstacles challenge gait. Interventions combining motor-cognitive approaches have been shown to improve motor performance, cognitive skills, and falls number. Here, we hypothesized that an intervention simulating an attention-demanding walking condition could affect not only complex gait performance and fall risk but also short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), as a marker of cholinergic activity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-nine participants at falls risk (24 Parkinson's disease participants and 15 older adults) were recruited in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to treadmill training or treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality intervention and trained three times a week for 6 weeks. SAI, a transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm, was used to assess cholinergic activity. Gait kinematics was measured during usual walking and while negotiating physical obstacles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and gait assessments were performed pre, post, and 6 months post-intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Treadmill training combined with non-immersive virtual reality induced an increase in inhibition of the SAI protocol on cortical excitability, improved obstacle negotiation performance, and induced a reduction of the number of falls compared with treadmill training. Furthermore, the more SAI increased after training, the more the obstacle negotiation performance improved and fall rate decreased.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We provide evidence that an innovative rehabilitation approach targeting cognitive components of complex motor actions can induce changes in cortical cholinergic activity, as indexed by SAI, thereby enabling functional gait improvements."

In this study, a popular and interesting exercise called the square-stepping exercise (SSE) was chosen as an intervention for people with PD. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of SSE on cognitive function, especially executive function. Twenty-eight participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=14) or the control group (n=14). The duration of the intervention for both groups was 8 weeks, twice a week. The outcomes, including the trail making test, the digit span task, the Montreal cognitive assessment, and the Parkinson's disease questionnaire, were evaluated before the intervention, after the intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. The results showed that executive function improved significantly on the digit span task after SSE training. Consequently, SSE could be an effective intervention to improve executive function in people with PD."

            "abstract": "As the population ages, it is increasingly important to detect non-normative cognitive declines as early as possible. Measures of combined sensory-motor-cognitive functioning may be early markers for identifying individuals who are at increased risk of developing dementia. Further, older adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may have elevated risk of dementia compared to those without SCD. Tasks involving complex, multisensory interactions reflective of everyday challenges may be particularly sensitive to subjectively perceived, pre-clinical declines. In the current study, older adults with and without SCD were asked to simultaneously perform a standing balance task and a listening task under increasingly challenging sensory/cognitive/motor conditions using a dual-task paradigm in a realistic, immersive virtual environment. It was hypothesized that, compared to older adults without SCD, those with SCD would exhibit greater decrements in postural control and listening response accuracy as sensory/motor/cognitive loads increased. However, counter to predictions, older adults with SCD demonstrated greater reductions in postural sway under more challenging dual-task conditions than those without SCD. Across both groups, poorer postural task performance was associated with poorer cognitive function and speech-in-noise thresholds measured with standard baseline tests. Poorer listening task performance was associated with poorer global cognitive function, poorer mobility, and poorer speech-in-noise detection. Overall, the results provide additional support for the growing evidence demonstrating associations between sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning and contribute to an evolving consideration of how best to categorize and characterize SCD in a way that guides strategies for screening, assessment, and intervention."

            "abstract": "It is now well established, at least in animal models, that exercise elicits potent pro-cognitive and pro-neurogenic effects. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia and represents one of the greatest burdens on healthcare systems worldwide, with no effective treatment for the disease to date. Exercise presents a promising non-pharmacological option to potentially delay the onset of or slow down the progression of AD. Exercise interventions in mouse models of AD have been explored and have been found to reduce amyloid pathology and improve cognitive function. More recent studies have expanded the research question by investigating potential pro-neurogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of exercise. In this review we summarise studies that have examined exercise-mediated effects on AD pathology, cognitive function, hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation in transgenic mouse models of AD. Furthermore, we attempt to identify the optimum exercise conditions required to elicit the greatest benefits, taking into account age and pathology of the model, as well as type and duration of exercise."

However, there was insufficient evidence to support a benefit of dyadic exercise intervention on cognitive performance and on behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in participants with dementia due to AD.

Exercise plus cognitive training programs combining strength and balance training, functional mobility training, and training on attention and executive function also improve gait.\n    \n\n\n          Conlusion:\n        \n      \n      Physical and cognitive factors affect gait performance, and both should be addressed in intervention programs. Physical exercises including functional mobility training, especially walking, have better results than physical programs with only static, resistance, and flexibility training. Cognitive intervention should be concomitant with physical exercises rather than separate, with a focus on attention and executive function. Combining physical training with cognitive training in a functional context may assist older adults with cognitive impairment generalize from training to everyday activity.

            "abstract": "Recent studies found structural changes of the brain during cognitive training. These changes may be important when assistive technologies are used, for example, to boost memory and navigation abilities in patients with neurocognitive disorders. In this study, we show that extensive training with a platformer game simulating navigation and real-life spatial abilities, patients with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairmant exhibit an increased volume of the caudate nucleus in contrast to healthy individuals who display increased hippocampal volumes. These results raise the possibility that cognitive training and assistive technology may induce compensatory changes of brain structure in memory disorders."

The largest effects on cognitive function were found on motor function, auditory attention and delayed memory functions (effect sizes of 1.17, 0.52 and 0.50 respectively). However, the results for delayed memory functions should be interpreted with care since they are based on a single study.

However, the majority of comparisons yielded no significant results. The data are insufficient to show that the improvements in cognitive function which can be attributed to physical exercise are due to improvements in cardiovascular fitness, although the temporal association suggests that this might be the case. Larger studies are still required to confirm whether the aerobic training component is necessary, or whether the same can be achieved with any type of physical exercise. At the same time, it would be informative to understand why some cognitive functions seem to improve with (aerobic) physical exercise while other functions seem to be insensitive to physical exercise.

This hypothesis proposes that improved cognitive functioning may be in part a result of the physiological processes that occur after physical exercise such as: Increased cerebral perfusion and regional cerebral blood flow. These processes ensure increased oxygenation and glucose transportation to the brain, which together can improve cognitive function. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the contribution of this hypothesis in the care of African older adults with neurodegenerative conditions (i.e., dementia (Alzheimer's disease)) or with mild cognitive impairments. Although studies in developed countries have examined people of African descent (i.e., with African Americans), only the limited findings presented in this review reflect how these conditions are also important for the African continent. This review revealed that no studies have examined the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on neurodegenerative disease in Africa. African nations, like many other developing countries, have an aging population that is growing and will face an increased risk of neurodegenerative declines. It is therefore imperative that new research projects be developed to explore the role of the cardiorespiratory fitness in neurodegenerative disease prevention in African nations."

Change in cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using residualized scores of the peak rate of oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) from pre- to post-intervention. Structural magnetic resonance images were processed using FreeSurfer v5.1.0. V̇O2peak increased an average of 8.49%, which was comparable between MCI and healthy elders. Overall, cortical thickness was stable except for a significant decrease in the right fusiform gyrus in both groups. However, improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness due to the intervention (V̇O2peak) was positively correlated with cortical thickness change in the bilateral insula, precentral gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and inferior and superior frontal cortices. Moreover, MCI participants exhibited stronger positive correlations compared to healthy elders in the left insula and superior temporal gyrus. A 12-week moderate intensity walking intervention led to significantly improved fitness in both MCI and healthy elders. Improved V̇O2peak was associated with widespread increased cortical thickness, which was similar between MCI and healthy elders. Thus, regular exercise may be an especially beneficial intervention to counteract cortical atrophy in all risk groups, and may provide protection against future cognitive decline in both healthy elders and MCI."

Possible strategies include gait training, exercise and muscle stimulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2011.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions aimed at improving mobility and physical functioning after hip fracture surgery in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, trial registers and reference lists, to March 2021.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All randomised or quasi-randomised trials assessing mobility strategies after hip fracture surgery. Eligible strategies aimed to improve mobility and included care programmes, exercise (gait, balance and functional training, resistance/strength training, endurance, flexibility, three-dimensional (3D) exercise and general physical activity) or muscle stimulation. Intervention was compared with usual care (in-hospital) or with usual care, no intervention, sham exercise or social visit (post-hospital).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Members of the review author team independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the assessment time point closest to four months for in-hospital studies, and the time point closest to the end of the intervention for post-hospital studies. Critical outcomes were mobility, walking speed, functioning, health-related quality of life, mortality, adverse effects and return to living at pre-fracture residence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 4059 participants from 17 countries. On average, participants were 80 years old and 80% were women. The median number of study participants was 81 and all trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more domains. Most trials excluded people with cognitive impairment (70%), immobility and/or medical conditions affecting mobility (72%). In-hospital setting, mobility strategy versus control Eighteen trials (1433 participants) compared mobility strategies with control (usual care) in hospitals. Overall, such strategies may lead to a moderate, clinically-meaningful increase in mobility (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.96; 7 studies, 507 participants; low-certainty evidence) and a small, clinically meaningful improvement in walking speed (CI crosses zero so does not rule out a lack of effect (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.37; 6 studies, 360 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mobility strategies may make little or no difference to short-term (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.30; 6 studies, 489 participants; low-certainty evidence) or long-term mortality (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.12; 2 studies, 133 participants; low-certainty evidence), adverse events measured by hospital re-admission (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.11; 4 studies, 322 participants; low-certainty evidence), or return to pre-fracture residence (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.56; 2 studies, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mobility strategies improve functioning or health-related quality of life as the certainty of evidence was very low. Gait, balance and functional training probably causes a moderate improvement in mobility (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.06; 6 studies, 463 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little or no difference in effects on mobility for resistance training. No studies of other types of exercise or electrical stimulation reported mobility outcomes. Post-hospital setting, mobility strategy versus control Twenty-two trials (2626 participants) compared mobility strategies with control (usual care, no intervention, sham exercise or social visit) in the post-hospital setting. Mobility strategies lead to a small, clinically meaningful increase in mobility (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.54; 7 studies, 761 participants; high-certainty evidence) and a small, clinically meaningful improvement in walking speed compared to control (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29; 14 studies, 1067 participants; high-certainty evidence). Mobility strategies lead to a small, non-clinically meaningful increase in functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.36; 9 studies, 936 participants; high-certainty evidence), and probably lead to a slight increase in quality of life that may not be clinically meaningful (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.29; 10 studies, 785 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mobility strategies probably make little or no difference to short-term mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.06; 8 studies, 737 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Mobility strategies may make little or no difference to long-term mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; 4 studies, 588 participants; low-certainty evidence) or adverse events measured by hospital re-admission (95% CI includes a large reduction and large increase, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 2 studies, 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). Training involving gait, balance and functional exercise leads to a small, clinically meaningful increase in mobility (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.36; 5 studies, 621 participants; high-certainty evidence), while training classified as being primarily resistance or strength exercise may lead to a clinically meaningful increase in mobility measured using distance walked in six minutes (mean difference (MD) 55.65, 95% CI 28.58 to 82.72; 3 studies, 198 participants; low-certainty evidence). Training involving multiple intervention components probably leads to a substantial, clinically meaningful increase in mobility (SMD 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34; 2 studies, 104 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of aerobic training on mobility (very low-certainty evidence). No studies of other types of exercise or electrical stimulation reported mobility outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Interventions targeting improvement in mobility after hip fracture may cause clinically meaningful improvement in mobility and walking speed in hospital and post-hospital settings, compared with conventional care. Interventions that include training of gait, balance and functional tasks are particularly effective. There was little or no between-group difference in the number of adverse events reported. Future trials should include long-term follow-up and economic outcomes, determine the relative impact of different types of exercise and establish effectiveness in emerging economies."

Physical activity interventions have the potential to reduce the level of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. Exergaming combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a virtual environment. It is an innovative and fun way of exercising, which may aid people with dementia to be more physically active. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week exergame training and equally long aerobic training, both compared to an active control group, on frailty in people with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A 3-armed randomized controlled trial compared exergame training, aerobic training, and an active control intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      115 people with dementia [mean (standard deviation [SD]) age = 79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) Mini-Mental State Examination score = 22.9 (3.4)].\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were randomized and individually trained 3 times a week during 12 weeks.

Based on the findings, we can recommend the GRADYS game for cognitive enhancement and as a possible counter-measure for cognitive decline experienced in normal cognitive ageing. Our results provide also support for the usefulness of VR technology in cognitive interventions in older adults.

Using a cross-sectional design, 161 participants (77% women), a mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 15, and mean age of 85.5years and living in nursing homes were included. Self-paced forward walking (FW) and backward walking (BW) velocity over 2.4m was measured. Global cognitive outcome measurements included MMSE and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Executive function was measured using Verbal Fluency (VF). In comprehensively adjusted multivariate linear regression analyses, FW was independently associated with VF (p=0.001), but not MMSE (p=0.126) or ADAS-Cog (p=0.818). BW was independently associated with VF (p=0.043) and MMSE (p=0.022), but not ADAS-Cog (p=0.519). Interaction analyses showed that the association between BW velocity and executive function were stronger in participants who walked without a walking aid. No associations differed according to dementia type. In conclusion, executive function appears important to walking velocity, both forward and backward, in people with dementia with mild to moderately severe cognitive impairment. Global cognitive function was associated with backward walking only, perhaps due to it being more challenging. The association between BW velocity and executive function differed according to use of walking aids, which appeared to attenuate the association."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Currently, an estimated 25-30% of people ages 85 or older have dementia, with a projected 115 million people worldwide living with dementia by 2050. With this worldwide phenomenon fast approaching, early detection of at-risk older adults and development of interventions focused on preventing loss in quality of life are increasingly important. A new construct defined by the International Consensus Group (I.A.N.A/I.A.G.G) as «cognitive frailty» combines domains of physical frailty with cognitive impairment and provides a framework for research that may provide a means to identify individuals with cognitive impairment caused by nonneurodegenerative conditions. Using the integrative review method of Whittemore and Knafl., 2005 this study examines and appraises the optimal measures for detecting cognitive frailty in clinical populations of older adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The integrative review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. From the total 185 articles retrieved, review of titles and key words were conducted. Following the initial review, 168 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria for association of frailty and cognition. Of the 18 fulltext articles reviewed, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria; these articles were reviewed in-depth to determine validity and reliability of the cognitive frailty measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Predictive validity was established by the studies reviewed in four main areas: frailty and type of dementia MCI (OR 7.4, 95% CI 4.2-13.2), vascular dementia (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.6-27.4) and Alzheimer's dementia (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-6.2), frailty and vascular dementia (VaAD) is further supported by the rate of change in frailty x macroinfarcts (r = 0.032, p < 0.001); frailty and the individual domains of cognitive function established with the relationship of neurocognitive speed and change in cognition using regression coefficients; individual components of frailty and individual domains of cognitive function associations inculded slow gait and executive function (β -0.20, p < 0.008 ), attention (β -0.25 p < 0.008), processing speed (β -0.16, p < 0.008), word recall (β - 0.18, p = 0.02), and logical memory (β = 0.04, p =0.04). Weak grip was predictive for changes in executive function (β - 0.16, p =0.008). Physical activity was associated with changes in executive function (β = -0.18, p= 0.02) and word recall (β = 0.17, p= 0.02), individual components of frailty and global cognitive function were found in several studies which included grip strength (r = - 0.51, p < 0.001), gait speed (r = - 0.067, p < 0.001), and exhaustion (β - 0.18, p < 0.008).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This paper presents the first-known review of the measurement properties for the cognitive frailty construct since the published results from the International Consensus Group (I.A.N.A/I.A.G.G). Evidence presented in this review continues to support the link between physical frailty and cognition with developing validity to support distinct relationships between components of physical frailty and cognitive decline. Results call attention to inconsistencies in reporting of reliability, validity, and heterogeneity in the measurements and operational definition for cognitive frailty. Further research is needed to establish an operational definition and develop psychometrically appropriate clinical measures to construct an understanding of the relationship between physical frailty and cognitive decline."

Alzheimer's disease primarily causes cognitive impairment and drugs have only modest short-term effects, highlighting a pressing need to develop effective interventions. Aerobic exercise holds promise for treating cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease through biologically sound mechanisms. Nonetheless, aerobic exercise studies in Alzheimer's disease are limited with mixed findings.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This pilot randomized controlled trial will investigate the effects of a 6-month, individualized, moderate-intensity cycling intervention (20 to 50 minutes per session, 3 times a week) on cognition and hippocampal volume in community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The specific aims are to: 1) determine the immediate effect of the cycling intervention on cognition in Alzheimer's disease; 2) examine if the cycling intervention slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease from baseline to 12 months; and 3) assess the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume over 12 months. Ninety subjects will be randomized on a 2:1 allocation ratio to cycling or attention control (low-intensity stretching) and followed for another 6 months.

Among a varied range of topics, nutritional aspects arose as possibilities of treatments towards the promotion of a healthy aging. Among the discussed themes, supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and multi-nutrient approaches were presented, suggesting that long-term supplementation (i.e., over 3 years) might be needed for observing positive effects on cognitive performance. Trials testing ketogenic agents and carbohydrate-restricted diet were also presented and showed promising effects on improving cognitive function of mild-cognitive impaired (MCI) and pre-diabetic individuals, respectively, in a short-term way (i.e. after 3 to 6 months). The combination of some of the nutritional approaches with physical activity interventions raises the question on whether they would individually perform in a similar way. Promising therapies involving nutrition appear to be safe and well tolerated by volunteers. Failures on achieving positive findings raise questions on whether they were driven by specific characteristics of the studied populations, insufficient doses or duration of treatment.

Moreover, we propose to use motion sensors to determine if patient movement patterns can lead to early prediction of delirium onset.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is conducted as a randomized clinical trial. A total of 920 critically ill patients in the ICU will participate. The control group will receive standard ICU care, whereas the intervention group will, in addition to the standard ICU care, receive relaxing 360-degree immersive virtual reality content played inside a head-mounted display with noise-cancelling headphones, three times a day. The first 100 patients, regardless of their group, will additionally have their movement patterns recorded using wearable and ambient sensors. Follow-up measurements will take place 6 months after discharge from the ICU.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Delirium is widely present within the ICU setting but lacks validated prevention and treatment strategies. By providing patients with virtual reality stimulation presented inside a head-mounted display and noise-cancelling headphones, participants may be isolated from disturbances on an ICU. It is believed that by doing so, the incidence of delirium will be decrease among these patients. Moreover, identifying movement patterns associated with delirium would allow for early detection and intervention, which may further improve long-term negative outcomes associated with delirium during critical care.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04498585 .

            "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) shares psychological and physiological similarities with the physical practice of the same action. Yet, it remains unclear whether fatigue elicited by exercise impairs MI ability. Fourteen participants performed MI of a self-paced walking sequence of 22 m before and after a resistance exercise eliciting muscle fatigue from upper and lower limbs, selectively. We indexed MI ability using psychometric and behavioral methods. Electromyography of the quadriceps was also recorded during physical practice trials of the walking sequence. For both experimental conditions, we recorded improved temporal congruence between MI and physical practice of the walking sequence (9.89 %, 95 % CI [7.03, 12.75], p < 0.01). Vividness decreased immediately after the fatiguing exercise (6.35 %, 95 % CI [5.18, 7.51], p < 0.05), before rapidly returning to pre-fatigue values during recovery trials. The results challenge the hypothesis of an effect of acute fatigue elicited by a resistance exercise on MI ability, i.e. restricted to MI tasks focusing fatigued effectors. The beneficial effects of fatigue conditions on the psychometric and behavioral indexes of MI ability are discussed in the broader context of psychobiological fatigue models linking perceived exertion with the reallocation of attentional resources. The general perception of fatigue, rather than local muscle fatigue, appeared linked to the acute effects of resistance exercise on MI ability."

The present pilot project sought to examine whether participation in a long-term exercise program involving cognitive-motor (CM) dual-task gait training and aerobic exercise training improves executive function in persons with an OCI. To accomplish our objective, individuals with an OCI (n = 12) as determined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of less than 26 and older adults (n = 11) deemed to be cognitively healthy (i.e., control group: MoCA score ≥26) completed a six-month moderate-to-high intensity (65-85% maximum heart rate) treadmill-based CM and aerobic exercise training program wherein pre- and post-intervention executive control was examined via the antisaccade task. Notably, antisaccades require a goal-directed eye-movement mirror-symmetrical to a target and represent an ideal tool for the study of executive deficits because of its hands- and language-free nature. As well, the cortical networks mediating antisaccades represent regions associated with neuropathology in cognitive decline and dementia (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Results showed that antisaccade reaction times for the OCI group reliably decreased by 30 ms from pre- to post-intervention, whereas the control group did not produce a reliable pre- to post-intervention change in reaction time (i.e., 6 ms). Thus, we propose that in persons with OCI long-term CM and aerobic training improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the executive mechanisms mediating high-level oculomotor control."

Several subsequent studies substantiate the great functional burden related to NMS, their progression, and negative effect on quality of life in PD. Additional evidence indicates interesting relationships between striatal dopaminergic function and NMS. The basal ganglia are implicated in the modulation and integration of sensory information and pain, bladder function is under control of both inhibitory (D1) and facilitatory (D2) dopaminergic inputs, finally reduced dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways is involved in the development of several NMS including mood, motivational, and cognitive alterations. Some NMS fluctuate in response to dopaminergic treatment and are relieved by dopamine replacement therapy, other are insensitive to current therapeutic strategies. The relation among the overall disease complications, perhaps the most important for PD patients and family members' well-being and functionality is dementia that affects most PD patients over the course of disease. Specific pharmacological treatment is lacking, and alternative approaches have been implemented to improve everyday functionality and quality of life. The state of the art suggests that cognitive rehabilitation in PD is possible and may either increase performance or preserve cognitive level over the time. However, it is also evident that cognitive abnormalities in PD are heterogeneous and we still do not have biomarkers to detect early patients at risk for dementia. Cognitive dysfunction is one the most prevalent NMS and is a clinically and functionally important disease milestone. Given the available clinical and imaging evidence it is possible to use cognition to model NMS progression and design nonpharmacological interventions. In this chapter we will address the use of cognitive rehabilitation and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to modulate cognitive performance and rescue connectivity in affected brain circuitry."

            "abstract": "In order to improve the efficiency of auxiliary medication for patients with mild cognitive impairment, this paper proposes a method based on VR technology and health education. Sixty elderly patients with COPD and MCI admitted to a hospital from January 2019 to February 2020 were randomly divided into a control group and study group, with 50 cases in each group. On the basis of conventional drug therapy, health education, and respiratory muscle training, patients in the control group received routine lung rehabilitation training, while patients in the study group received lung rehabilitation training using the BioMaster virtual scene interactive rehabilitation training system. Both groups continued training for 12 weeks. Lung function indexes, 6-minute walking distance, COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and Montreal Cognitive Function Assessment Scale (MoCA) score were compared between the 2 groups before training and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after training. The experimental results show that, in the study group, the percentage of FEV1 in the predicted value at 8 weeks after training, the percentage of FEV1 in the predicted value at 12 weeks after training, and FEV1/FVC were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in 6-minute walking distance, CAT score, and MoCA score between the two groups before training (P > 0.05). Twelve weeks after training, patients in the study group had a longer 6-minute walking distance, a lower CAT score, and a higher MoCA score than those in the control group (P < 0.05). It is proved that the application of virtual reality technology in lung rehabilitation training of elderly COPD patients with MCI is effective, which can effectively improve the lung function, cognitive function, and exercise tolerance of the patients and reduce the symptoms of dyspnea and the efficiency of medication."

This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review. Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the virtual reality devices used. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system. Control groups usually received no intervention or therapy based on a standard-care approach.\n    \n\n\n          Primary outcome:\n        \n      \n      results were not statistically significant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.05 to 0.20, 22 studies, 1038 participants, low-quality evidence) when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy. However, when virtual reality was used in addition to usual care (providing a higher dose of therapy for those in the intervention group) there was a statistically significant difference between groups (SMD 0.49, 0.21 to 0.77, 10 studies, 210 participants, low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Secondary outcomes:\n        \n      \n      when compared to conventional therapy approaches there were no statistically significant effects for gait speed or balance. Results were statistically significant for the activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43, 10 studies, 466 participants, moderate-quality evidence); however, we were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, or quality of life. Twenty-three studies reported that they monitored for adverse events; across these studies there were few adverse events and those reported were relatively mild.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming was not more beneficial than conventional therapy approaches in improving upper limb function. Virtual reality may be beneficial in improving upper limb function and activities of daily living function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time). There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation, or quality of life. This review found that time since onset of stroke, severity of impairment, and the type of device (commercial or customised) were not strong influencers of outcome. There was a trend suggesting that higher dose (more than 15 hours of total intervention) was preferable as were customised virtual reality programs; however, these findings were not statistically significant."

            "abstract": "Poor cognitive function is associated with reduced functional independence, risk of institutionalization and reduced health-related quality of life. The ability to independently perform instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs) is compromised in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Emerging evidence suggests that adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), may play an important protective role against cognitive decline and dementia risk, whilst preserving functional status. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the independent associations between MedDiet adherence, cognitive risk, and functional status in community-dwelling older adults living in Australia. MedDiet adherence was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS); a modified Lawton's iADL scale was used for the assessment of functional status and risk of cognitive impairment was assessed using the AD8 dementia screening intervention. A total of n = 294 participants were included in the final analyses (70.4 ± 6.2 years; Females, n = 201; Males, n = 91; n = 2 unspecified). Adherence to a MedDiet was positively associated with functional ability (β = 0.172; CI: 0.022, 0.132; P = 0.006) independent of age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, sleep duration, physical activity duration, diabetes status, and level of education. Furthermore, MedDiet adherence was inversely associated with cognitive risk (β = -0.134; CI: -0.198, -0.007; P = 0.035) independent of all covariates. However, our sensitivity analyses further showed that adherence to a MedDiet was not associated with cognitive risk in older adults free from cognitive impairment. We showed that adherence to a MedDiet is associated with healthy physical and cognitive aging. Nevertheless, exploration of these findings in larger cohorts, using longitudinal analyses and controlling for important confounders to ascertain the direction of the relationship is warranted."

Five studies that met inclusion criteria were included in this study. The VR-based cognitive training showed significant effects on ADL and IADL in both MCI and AD patients. When comparing effects in each group, both MCI and AD patients showed significant effects on ADL and IADL, but MCI patients showed lower effects on ADL and IADL than AD patients.

Research has demonstrated that nursing home patients without dementia can improve their function in activities of daily living, strength, balance and mental well being by physical exercise. The evidence on effect of physical exercise among nursing home patients with dementia is scarce and ambiguous. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a high intensity functional exercise program on the performance of balance in nursing home residents with dementia.

In both groups the intervention occurred under supervision for 30 minutes daily, five times a week for eight weeks. Repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests were used to analyze changes. Results. Both groups showed improvement in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti Test (TT) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) over 8 weeks. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time. Intragroup analysis in the Wii-Fit group showed significant improvement on BBS (P = 0.003), and TT (P = 0.013).

The current study evaluated the effects of a 10-week strengthening exercise intervention on cognitive functioning and EEG in a sample of 13 older adults with early dementia, and 9 normative controls. Results revealed beneficial effects of strengthening exercise on verbal memory coupled with frontal beta and delta power asymmetries and N200 amplitude asymmetry. Results point to increased cognitive efficiency following 10 weeks of strengthening exercise. The findings suggest it is feasible to conduct a strengthening intervention with early dementia patients, and to gather neuropsychological and neurophysiological data to evaluate outcomes.

This review describes the state of the literature as it relates to the use of immersive virtual reality technology with persons with dementia. One hundred fifty-eight articles were returned by keyword search, but just three of those used modern virtual reality systems. Each of the three studies found positive results in their respective uses of virtual reality with persons with dementia. VR was well tolerated by participants and engagement was high, though sample sizes were small across studies. Results demonstrated immersive VR is a viable pathway for a variety of novel interventions with this population, but more research using modern immersive devices is required. Social workers in a variety of care settings can build on these early findings and develop an array of novel palliative and leisure-time experiences for this population."

We recently found that USN alters goal-directed locomotion in conditions of different cognitive/perceptual demands. However, sensorimotor post-stroke dysfunction (e.g. decreased walking speed) could have influenced the results. Analogous to a previously used goal-directed locomotor paradigm, a seated, joystick-driven navigation experiment, minimizing locomotor demands, was employed in individuals with and without post-stroke USN (USN+ and USN-, respectively) and healthy controls (HC).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants (n = 15 per group) performed a seated, joystick-driven navigation and detection time task to targets 7 m away at 0°, ±15°/30° in actual (visually-guided), remembered (memory-guided) and shifting (visually-guided with representational updating component) conditions while immersed in a 3D virtual reality environment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Greater end-point mediolateral errors to left-sided targets (remembered and shifting conditions) and overall lengthier onsets in reorientation strategy (shifting condition) were found for USN+ vs. USN- and vs. HC (p < 0.05).

A narrative review of the literature was conducted with any studies using meditation as an intervention for dementia or dementia-related memory conditions meeting inclusion criteria. Studies where moving meditation was the main intervention were excluded due to the possible confounding of exercise. Ten papers were identified and reviewed. There was a broad use of measures across all studies, with cognitive assessment, quality of life and perceived stress being the most common. Three studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional changes to brain regions during meditation. The interventions fell into the following three categories: mindfulness, most commonly mindfulness-based stress reduction (six studies); Kirtan Kriya meditation (three studies); and mindfulness-based Alzheimer's stimulation (one study). Three of these studies were randomised controlled trials. All studies reported significant findings or trends towards significance in a broad range of measures, including a reduction of cognitive decline, reduction in perceived stress, increase in quality of life, as well as increases in functional connectivity, percent volume brain change and cerebral blood flow in areas of the cortex.

Nonetheless, adherence to exercise is low and travel costs and time may limit participation and compliance. Training at home can help avoid these burdens and, as needed during the recent global pandemic (COVID-19), reinforce social distancing and reduce the risk of infection. However, training at home requires motivation and self-control and telerehabilitation is time-consuming for both patient and therapist. In recent years, there is growing use of virtual reality and exergaming to increase motivation and adherence for exercising with evidence of improvements in mobility and balance after using virtual reality in the clinic. Here, a novel telerehabilitation training program using a treadmill-virtual reality system for simultaneous training of two patients with Parkinson disease in their homes is described. Remote monitoring software enabled visual and auditory communication with the two patients, allowing the trainer to adapt the settings remotely and provide feedback. Participants received weekly training sessions over 1 yr. The findings show high adherence to training, increased walking duration throughout the sessions, and increased patient confidence, gait speed, and mobility. Training multiple participants simultaneously was feasible, enabling an individualized treatment approach while conserving therapist time."

Cerebral perfusion and hence cognition can be enhanced by exercise. The present review describes first how the effects of exercise on cerebral perfusion in AD are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and tissue-type plasminogen activator, the release of which is regulated by NO. A conclusion of clinical relevance is that exercise may not be beneficial for the cognitive functioning of all people with dementia if cardiovascular risk factors are present. The extent to which cardiovascular risk factors play a role in the selection of older people with dementia in clinical studies will be addressed in the second part of the review in which the effects of exercise on cognition are presented. Only eight relevant studies were found in the literature, emphasizing the paucity of studies in this field. Positive effects of exercise on cognition were reported in seven studies, including two that excluded and two that included patients with cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that cardiovascular risk factors do not necessarily undo the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition in cognitively impaired people.

Home practice of Tai Chi will be supported by the use of behaviour change techniques with the Tai Chi instructor at a home visit in week 3-4 of the intervention (action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and alarm clock reminder) and at the end of each class (feedback on home practice). The primary outcome is dynamic balance measured using the Timed Up and Go test, coinciding with the end of the 20-week intervention phase for participants in the Tai Chi arm. Secondary outcomes for PWD include functional balance, static balance, fear of falling, global cognitive functioning, visual-spatial cognitive functioning, quality of life, and falls. Secondary outcomes for carers include dynamic balance, static balance, quality of life, costs, and carer burden.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This trial is the first in the UK to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve balance among PWD. The trial will inform a future study that will be the first in the world to use Tai Chi in a trial to prevent falls among PWD.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \nNCT02864056 ."

Aerobic physical exercise has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for maintaining health and well-being in postmenopausal women, and for improving brain health and plasticity in populations at high risk for AD. To study the neuroprotective mechanisms of physical exercise in a postmenopausal animal model, we submitted previously ovariectomized, six-month old non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice to three months of voluntary exercise in a running wheel. At nine months of age, we observed lower grip strength and some exacerbation of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)-like involving active exploratory activities. A similar major cognitive impairment was observed of ovariectomized 3xTg-AD mice in comparison with sham-operated 3xTg-AD mice. A reduction of bodily fitness and lack of retention of memory were observed in the ovariectomized non-transgenic mice. Physical exercise protected against all deleterious behaviors and normalized learning and memory. It also protected against body frailty, as expected. Analyses of hippocampal key markers of antioxidant and neuroplasticity signaling pathways, showed that ovariectomy impairs the activation of CREB through physical exercise. Furthermore, molecular and behavioral correlates suggested a central role of BDNF in the neuroprotection mediated by physical exercise therapy against apathy and memory loss induced by ovariectomy and the AD-genotype."

Various applications, often based on virtual reality, have been implemented to carry out psychological assessments and interventions, using innovative human-machine interaction systems. In this context, the LEAP Motion sensing technology has raised interest, since it allows for more natural interactions with digital contents, via an optical tracking of hand and finger movements. Recent research has considered LEAP Motion features in virtual-reality-based systems, to meet specific needs of different clinical populations, varying in age and type of disorder. The present paper carried out a systematic mini-review of the available literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2013 and 2020, (ii) being an empirical study or project report, (iii) written in English or Italian languages, (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal and/or conference proceedings, and (v) assessing LEAP Motion intervention for four specific psychological domains (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment), objectively. Nineteen eligible empirical studies were included. Overall, results show that protocols for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder can promote psychomotor and psychosocial rehabilitation in contexts that stimulate learning.

            "abstract": "For about 10% of children reading acquisition is extremely difficult because they are affected by a heritable neurobiological disorder called developmental dyslexia (DD), mainly associated to an auditory-phonological disorder. Visual crowding is a universal phenomenon that impairs the recognition of stimuli in clutter, such as a letter in a word or a word in a text. Several studies have shown an excessive crowding in individuals with DD, but the causal link between excessive crowding and DD is not yet clearly established. An excessive crowding might be, indeed, a simple effect of DD due to reduced reading experience. The results of five experiments in 181 children reveal that: (i) an excessive crowding only at unattended locations characterizes an unselected group of children with DD (Experiment 1); (ii) an extra-large spaced text increases reading accuracy by reducing crowding in an unselected group of children with DD (Experiment 2); (iii) efficient attentional action video game trainings reduce crowding and accelerate reading speed in two unselected groups of children with DD (Experiment 3 and 4), and; (iv) pre-reading crowding longitudinally predicts future poor readers (Experiment 5). Our results show multiple causal links between visual crowding and learning to read. These findings provide new insights for a more efficient remediation and prevention for DD."

Modifiable lifestyle factors that cause a decline in cardiometabolic health, such as physical inactivity, exacerbate these changes beyond those that are associated with normal ageing. The purpose of this review was to examine cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuroanatomical adaptations to ageing and the potential benefits of exercise training on these outcomes in adults 50 years or older. We systematically searched for cross-sectional or intervention studies that included exercise (aerobic, resistance or multimodal) and its effect on cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroanatomical adaptations in this age demographic. The included studies were tabulated and described narratively. Aerobic exercise training was the predominant focus of the studies identified; there were limited studies exploring the effects of resistance exercise training and multimodal training on cerebrovascular function and cognition. Collectively, the evidence indicated that exercise can improve cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroplasticity through areas of the brain associated with executive function and memory in adults 50 years or older, irrespective of their health status. However, more research is required to ascertain the mechanisms of action."

In the human model, aerobic, multimodal, and resistance training are beneficial in both MCI and AD. Multimodal training of moderate to high intensity multimodal exercise is effective for MCI. Voluntary cycling training, moderate- or high-intensity aerobic exercise is effective in mild AD patients."

A total of 197 healthy older adults with no evidence of dementia participated in moderate-intensity interval training or low-intensity continuous training for 16 weeks. Size decreased in the right hippocampus such that the effect of time was significant but the interaction with condition was not. For the left hippocampus, size decreased in the low-intensity continuous training condition but increased in the moderate-intensity continuous training plus interval training condition at the trend level. Finally, there was a significant time-by-condition interaction such that the thickness of the left insula increased for low-intensity continuous training and decreased for moderate-intensity continuous training plus interval training. Few structural changes were associated with the exercise intervention. Future studies should examine the effects of exercise on brain structure in high-risk or clinical populations for a longer period of time."

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a strong interest in physical activity as a primary behavioural prevention strategy against cognitive decline. A number of large prospective cohort studies have highlighted the protective role of regular physical activity in lowering the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Most prospective intervention studies of exercise and cognition to date have focused on aerobic-based exercise training. These studies highlight that aerobic-based exercise training enhances both brain structure and function. However, it has been suggested that other types of exercise training, such as resistance training, may also benefit cognition. The purpose of this brief review is to examine the evidence regarding resistance training and cognitive benefits. Three recent randomised exercise trials involving resistance training among seniors provide evidence that resistance training may have cognitive benefits. Resistance training may prevent cognitive decline among seniors via mechanisms involving insulin-like growth factor I and homocysteine. A side benefit of resistance training, albeit a very important one, is its established role in reducing morbidity among seniors. Resistance training specifically moderates the development of sarcopenia. The multifactorial deleterious sequelae of sarcopenia include increased falls and fracture risk as well as physical disability. Thus, clinicians should consider encouraging their clients to undertake both aerobic-based exercise training and resistance training not only for \"physical health\" but also because of the almost certain benefits for \"brain health\"."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The motivation of patients during robot-assisted rehabilitation after neurological disorders that lead to impairments of motor functions is of great importance. Due to the increasing number of patients, increasing medical costs and limited therapeutic resources, clinicians in the future may want patients to practice their movements at home or with reduced supervision during their stay in the clinic. Since people only engage in an activity and are motivated to practice if the outcome matches the effort at which they perform, an augmented feedback application for rehabilitation should take the cognitive and physical deficits of patients into account and incorporate a mechanism that is capable of balancing i.e. adjusting the difficulty of an exercise in an augmented feedback application to the patient's capabilities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We propose a computational mechanism based on Fitts' Law that balances i.e. adjusts the difficulty of an exercise for upper-extremity rehabilitation. The proposed mechanism was implemented into an augmented feedback application consisting of three difficulty conditions (easy, balanced, hard). The task of the exercise was to reach random targets on the screen from a starting point within a specified time window. The available time was decreased with increasing condition difficulty. Ten subacute stroke patients were recruited to validate the mechanism through a study. Cognitive and motor functions of patients were assessed using the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the modified Ashworth scale as well as the Addenbrookes cognitive examination-revised. Handedness of patients was obtained using the Edinburgh handedness inventory. Patients' performance during the execution of the exercises was measured twice, once for the paretic and once for the non-paretic arm. Results were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Post hoc analysis was performed using a Tukey HSD with a significance level of p < 0.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Results show that the mechanism was capable of balancing the difficulty of an exercise to the capabilities of the patients. Medians for both arms show a gradual decrease and significant difference of the number of successful trials with increasing condition difficulty (F(2;60) = 44.623; p < 0.01; η(2) = 0.623) but no significant difference between paretic and non-paretic arm (F(1;60) = 3.768; p = 0.057; η(2) = 0.065). Post hoc analysis revealed that, for both arms, the hard condition significantly differed from the easy condition (p < 0.01). In the non-paretic arm there was an additional significant difference between the balanced and the hard condition (p < 0.01). Reducing the time to reach the target, i.e., increasing the difficulty level, additionally revealed significant differences between conditions for movement speeds (F(2;59) = 6.013; p < 0.01; η(2) = 0.185), without significant differences for hand-closing time (F(2;59) = 2.620; p = 0.082; η(2) = 0.09), reaction time (F(2;59) = 0.978; p = 0.383; η(2) = 0.036) and hand-path ratio (F(2;59) = 0.054; p = 0.947; η(2) = 0.002). The evaluation of a questionnaire further supported the assumption that perceived performance declined with increased effort and increased exercise difficulty leads to frustration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results support that Fitts' Law indeed constitutes a powerful mechanism for task difficulty adaptation and can be incorporated into exercises for upper-extremity rehabilitation."

Mean adherence during the trial was 53%. About one third of participants had lapses during the trial but completed, one third had no lapses, and one third dropped out or never started. Practical barriers (time, location) were related to not starting and functional limitations to dropout.

Initially Alzheimer's disease develops asymptomatically with primary clinical signs, such as memory impairment, decline of spatial and perceptual abilities, occurring at a later stage. This delay implies the possibility of promoting early interventions during the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease. Different strategies have been applied in order to prevent/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease or at least to improve quality of life and health conditions of Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers, especially in the absence of current viable therapies. Multidomain interventions, aimed at affecting several risk factors simultaneously, offer a versatility that may attain improved outcomes in comparison with single-domain prevention trials. These multidomain interventions involve diet, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activities, while music therapy, improving self-consciousness and reducing neurofibrils, may contribute to deceleration/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease progression. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides broad applications to improve quality of life and well-being of Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers, suffering from psychological distress, as well as reducing additional public health costs."

            "abstract": "The cultural and geographical properties of the environment have been shown to deeply influence cognition and mental health1-6. Living near green spaces has been found to be strongly beneficial7-11, and urban residence has been associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders12-14-although some studies suggest that dense socioeconomic networks found in larger cities provide a buffer against depression15. However, how the environment in which one grew up affects later cognitive abilities remains poorly understood. Here we used a cognitive task embedded in a video game16 to measure non-verbal spatial navigation ability in 397,162 people from 38 countries across the world. Overall, we found that people who grew up outside cities were better at navigation. More specifically, people were better at navigating in environments that were topologically similar to where they grew up. Growing up in cities with a low street network entropy (for example, Chicago) led to better results at video game levels with a regular layout, whereas growing up outside cities or in cities with a higher street network entropy (for example, Prague) led to better results at more entropic video game levels. This provides evidence of the effect of the environment on human cognition on a global scale, and highlights the importance of urban design in human cognition and brain function."

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomized or quasi-randomized trials that utilized an individualized home-based exercise program with at least one falls outcome measure reported. Single intervention exercise studies, and multifactorial interventions where results for an exercise intervention were reported independently were included. Two researchers independently rated the quality of each included study. Of 16,871 papers identified from six databases, 12 met all inclusion criteria (11 randomized trials and a pragmatic trial). Study quality overall was high. Sample sizes ranged from 40 to 981, participants had an average age 80.1 years, and although the majority of studies targeted the general older population, several studies included clinical groups as their target (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hip fracture).

            "abstract": "Voluntary exercise, treadmill activity, skills training, and forced limb use have been utilized in animal studies to promote brain plasticity and functional change. Motor enrichment may prime the brain to respond more adaptively to injury, in part by upregulating trophic factors such as GDNF, FGF-2, or BDNF. Discontinuation of exercise in advance of brain injury may cause levels of trophic factor expression to plummet below baseline, which may leave the brain more vulnerable to degeneration. Underfeeding and motor enrichment induce remarkably similar molecular and cellular changes that could underlie their beneficial effects in the aged or injured brain. Exercise begun before focal ischemic injury increases BDNF and other defenses against cell death and can maintain or expand motor representations defined by cortical microstimulation. Interfering with BDNF synthesis causes the motor representations to recede or disappear. Injury to the brain, even in sedentary rats, causes a small, gradual increase in astrocytic expression of neurotrophic factors in both local and remote brain regions. The neurotrophic factors may inoculate those areas against further damage and enable brain repair and use-dependent synaptogenesis associated with recovery of function or compensatory motor learning. Plasticity mechanisms are particularly active during time-windows early after focal cortical damage or exposure to dopamine neurotoxins. Motor and cognitive impairments may contribute to self-imposed behavioral impoverishment, leading to a reduced plasticity. For slow degenerative models, early forced forelimb use or exercise has been shown to halt cell loss, whereas delayed rehabilitation training is ineffective and disuse is prodegenerative. However, it is possible that, in the chronic stages after brain injury, a regimen of exercise would reactivate mechanisms of plasticity and thus enhance rehabilitation targeting residual functional deficits."

At the same time, the availability of on-site psychiatric care declined drastically because of the COVID-19 preventive social restriction measures. To address this shortfall, telepsychiatry assumes a greater role in mental health care services. Among various on-line treatment modalities, immersive virtual reality (VR) environments provide an important resource for adjusting the emotional state in people living with depression. Therefore, we reviewed the literature on VR-based interventions for depression treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Subjects and methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, as well as the Internet, for full-length articles published during the period of 2020-2022 citing a set of following key words: \"virtual reality\", \"depression\", \"COVID-19\", as well as their terminological synonyms and word combinations. The inclusion criteria were: 1) the primary or secondary study objectives included the treatment of depressive states or symptoms; 2) the immersive VR intervention used a head-mounted display (HMD); 3) the article presented clinical study results and/or case reports 4) the study was urged by or took place during the COVID-19-associated lockdown period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 904 records were retrieved using the search strategy. Remarkably, only three studies and one case report satisfied all the inclusion criteria elaborated for the review. These studies included 155 participants: representatives of healthy population (n=40), a case report of a patient with major depressive disorder (n=1), patients with cognitive impairments (n=25), and COVID-19 patients who had survived from ICU treatment (n=89). The described interventions used immersive VR scenarios, in combination with other treatment techniques, and targeted depression. The most robust effect, which the VR-based approach had demonstrated, was an immediate post-intervention improvement in mood and the reduction of depressive symptoms in healthy population. However, studies showed no significant findings in relation to both short-term effectiveness in treatment of depression and primary prevention of depressive symptoms. Also, safety issues were identified, such as: three participants developed mild adverse events (e.g., headache, \"giddiness\", and VR misuse behavior), and three cases of discomfort related to wearing a VR device were registered.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There has been a lack of appropriately designed clinical trials of the VR-based interventions for depression since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, all these studies had substantial limitations due to the imprecise study design, small sample size, and minor safety issues, that did not allow us making meaningful judgments and conclude regarding the efficacy of VR in the treatment of depression, taking into account those investigations we have retrieved upon the inclusion criteria of our particularistic review design. This may call for randomized, prospective studies of the short-term and long-lasting effect of VR modalities in managing negative affectivity (sadness, anxiety, anhedonia, self-guilt, ignorance) and inducing positive affectivity (feeling of happiness, joy, motivation, self-confidence, viability) in patients suffering from clinical depression."

We emphasize that multimodal programmes, which combine several types of interventions, improve cognitive function to a greater extent than programmes that use a single interventional approach. We suggest specific methods for weighting the relative importance of cognitive training, physical exercise and non-invasive brain stimulation according to the functional and structural state of the brain of the targeted subject to maximize the cognitive improvements induced by multimodal programmes."

The usefulness of this programme in the field of dementia is beginning to be recognised by the scientific community, since studies have reported physical, cognitive, and psychological benefits. Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease underwent music therapy for 6 weeks.

Fifty-nine subjects participated in the experiment. The receiver operating characteristic curve of the game system was statistically analyzed for determining the best cutoff-point in the cognitive function assessment. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were used to explore the correlations between the results and the clinical cognitive assessment scales. According to the MoCA scores, the results showed that the accuracy of the system was 86.4% in evaluating mild cognitive impairment. The system seems feasible and was strongly correlated with clinical cognitive assessment scales. We anticipate that daily use of our system could keep track of changes of cognitive function of the elderly in home life."

            "abstract": "Walking is a complex motor task generally performed automatically by healthy adults. Yet, by the elderly, walking is often no longer performed automatically. Older adults require more attention for motor control while walking than younger adults. Falls, often with serious consequences, can be the result. Gait impairments are one of the biggest risk factors for falls. Several studies have identified changes in certain gait parameters as independent predictors of fall risk. Such gait changes are often too discrete to be detected by clinical observation alone. At the Basel Mobility Center, we employ the GAITRite electronic walkway system for spatial-temporal gait analysis. Although we have a large range of indications for gait analyses and several areas of clinical research, our focus is on the association between gait and cognition. Gait analysis with walking as a single-task condition alone is often insufficient to reveal underlying gait disorders present during normal, everyday activities. We use a dual-task paradigm, walking while simultaneously performing a second cognitive task, to assess the effects of divided attention on motor performance and gait control. Objective quantification of such clinically relevant gait changes is necessary to determine fall risk. Early detection of gait disorders and fall risk permits early intervention and, in the best-case scenario, fall prevention. We and others have shown that rhythmic movement training such as Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics, tai chi and social dancing can improve gait regularity and automaticity, thus increasing gait safety and reducing fall risk."

However, investigation into the effects of tACS on individuals with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is lacking. In this pilot study, we investigated the hypothesis that following a regular schedule of challenging brain exercises combined with simultaneous tACS application would improve the working memory and cognitive function of older adults with memory impairments. Further, we explored whether pairing brain exercises with tACS would result in longer-lasting positive effects on cognitive function than brain exercises alone. A total of 17 older adults (12 males, 5 females, 70 ± 7 years), each with a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia were enrolled in the study. All participants completed brain exercises in the lab on the following schedule: two 30-minute sessions per day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks consecutively. Eleven of the participants received brain exercises paired with tACS application at 40Hz. We evaluated cognitive function of the participants at baseline, post-intervention and 1-month followup using the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV) as an independent assessment of our brain exercises. Both the non-tACS and tACS groups significantly improved their WMS scores from baseline to post-intervention assessments. Comparison of the post-intervention and 1-month follow-up assessments indicated that the tACS group maintained their improvement significantly better than the non-tACS group."

In this paper, we summarize from previous studies systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the various types of technology used in cognitive interventions (namely, computerized cognitive training, virtual-reality interventions and robot-assisted interventions) and the empirical evidence on the effects of these technologies on global and specific cognitive functions in healthy and clinical populations of older adults (e.g., older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia). We also describe older adults' perceptions, experiences and acceptance of these technologies. Finally, we discuss the limitations, challenges and future avenues of research in this field."

While there was generally low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function. Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive.

Particularly affected are older adults (i.e., those aged ≥ 65 years) who are at elevated risk for various adverse health outcomes, including declines in motor ability and physical activity (PA) participation, increased obesity, impaired cognition, and various psychological disorders. Thus, given the secular increases in the older adult population, novel and effective intervention strategies are necessary to improve physical activity behaviors and health in this population. Virtual reality (VR)-integrated exercise is a promising intervention strategy, which has been utilized in healthcare fields like stroke rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this editorial is to synthesize recent research examining the efficacy and effectiveness of VR exercise in the promotion of favorable health outcomes among the older adults. Results indicate the application of VR exercise to facilitate improved physical outcomes (e.g., enhanced motor ability, reduced obesity), cognition and psychological outcomes. VR exercise has also been observed to be an effective intervention strategy for fall prevention in this population. Future research should employ more rigorous research designs to allow for a more robust quantitative synthesis of the effect of VR exercise on the preceding outcomes to elucidate which type(s) of VR-based PA interventions are most effective in promoting improved health outcomes among older adults. Findings from this study will better inform the development of technology-savvy PA programs for wellness promotion in older adults who practice social distancing and exercise from home under the unprecedented global health crisis."

However, the low learning motivation and engagement of the subjects hinder the widespread use of spatial cognitive training. This study designed a home-based spatial cognitive training and evaluation system (SCTES), which aimed to train subjects on spatial cognitive tasks for 20 days, and compared the brain activities before and after the training. This study also evaluated the feasibility of using a portable all-in-one prototype for cognitive training that combined a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display with high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. During the course of training, the length of the navigation path and the distance between the starting position and the platform position revealed significant behavioral differences. In the testing sessions, the subjects showed significant behavioral differences in the time it took to complete the test task before and after training. After only four days of training, the subjects demonstrated significant differences in the Granger causality analysis (GCA) characteristics of brain regions in the δ , θ , α1 , β2 , and γ frequency bands of the EEG, as well as significant differences in the GCA of the EEG in the β1 , β2 , and γ frequency bands between the two test sessions. The proposed SCTES used a compact and all-in-one form factor to train and evaluate spatial cognition and collect EEG signals and behavioral data simultaneously. The recorded EEG data can be used to quantitatively assess the efficacy of spatial training in patients with spatial cognitive impairments."

Use of new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality are currently under investigation for their potential to provide exciting and engaging activities for older people in residential aged care facilities. However, there is limited evidence on whether these technologies can promote physical activity in a small group setting for people with cognitive impairment. Using mixed methods, we examined the use of a virtual cycling experience in a sample of 10 participants with cognitive impairment living in residential aged care facilities. In a randomised crossover design, participants engaged in a 25-minute, self-paced, facilitated seated virtual cycling experience and a time-matched seated physical activity session in groups of five. All participants completed a brief pre- and post-intervention mood questionnaire. Video analysis was used for both conditions to compare levels of environmental stimulation, apathy and engagement using both the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale and the Engagement of a Person with Dementia Scale. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews following the virtual cycling experience was also performed. No differences were observed between conditions for all outcomes except for environmental stimulation, where there was a lower response in the intervention than the control condition (p = 0.032). This was primarily driven by lower scores for the virtual cycling experience than control in physical accessibility (p = 0.012). Participants reported the virtual cycling experience to be immersive and challenging and reminisced about cycling earlier in life. The activity manager observed that the virtual cycling experience was an overall positive experience and emphasised benefits of safety screening and preparation prior to the activities. The findings of this study support the use of the virtual cycling experience as an immersive and engaging alternative to usual activities, which might encourage higher levels of physical activity in residential aged care facilities."

A mixed-methods study was conducted with 13 residents of varying cognitive capacity in a residential aged care facility (RACF) operated by a not-for-profit organization in Brisbane, Australia. Residents participated in one facilitated VR session, either as a group or individual session. Residents' mood and apathy were measured by the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) and the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale. Residents also completed a structured interview to provide their feedback after the VR session. In addition, four RACF staff members were interviewed about their experience of using the VR in residents and the ongoing feasibility. The experience of VR administered by a researcher and leisure and lifestyle coordinator as a leisure activity, significantly reduced apathy in residents (Z = -2.818, p = 0.005) through observations of increased facial expression, eye contact, physical engagement, verbal tone, and expression. The study did not find a VR impact on the OERS measures; no significant increase in fear/anxiety was observed. Reminiscence was clearly observed in six of the nine residents with the ability to verbally communicate. VR was found not to be helpful in residents during episodes of acute neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. This study suggested feasibility of using fully immersive VR delivered by mobile phone technologies. It provides preliminary data for a controlled trial presently underway examining the effectiveness of VR as a group activity in RAC to improve mood states, behavioral symptoms, and pro re nata psychotropic medication use.

It is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life and is associated with a significant social burden and increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Because of mixed effectiveness of medications, exercise has been considered as a treatment for pre-clinical AD, late stage AD, and as a prevention strategy. Exercise appears to improve brain blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and improve neurogenesis. Prospective studies indicate that physical inactivity is one of the most common preventable risk factors for developing AD and that higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of development of disease. Exercise as a treatment for AD shows improvement in cognitive function, decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a slower decline in activities of daily living (ADL). Exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects and better adherence compared to medications."

Falls are not random events and occur, at least in part, due to impaired physiological function, such as impaired balance, and cognitive impairment. The clinical syndrome of falls is important for Sports and Exercise Medicine Clinicians as there is Level 1 evidence that targeted exercise prescription is an effective intervention strategy. The widely accepted dogma is that improved physical function, balance and muscle strength, underlies the effectiveness of the exercise in reducing falls. However, findings from randomised controlled trials suggest that exercise reduce falls via mechanisms other than improved physiological function.

While wearing a belt-worn sensor, 757 dementia-free older adults completed TUG during two conditions, with and without a concurrent verbal serial subtraction task. We segmented TUG into its four subtasks (i.e., walking, turning, and two postural transitions), and extracted 18 measures that were summarized into nine validated sensor metrics. Participants also underwent a detailed cognitive assessment during the same visit. We then employed a series of regression models to determine the combinations of subtask sensor metrics most strongly associated with MCI and specific cognitive abilities for each condition. We also compared subtask performances with and without dividing attention to determine whether the costs of divided attention were associated with cognition. While slower TUG walking and turning were associated with higher odds of MCI under normal conditions, these and other subtask associations became more strongly linked to MCI when TUG was performed under divided attention. Walking and turns were also most strongly associated with executive function and attention, particularly under divided attention. These differential associations with cognition were mirrored by performance costs. However, since several TUG subtasks were more strongly associated with MCI and cognitive abilities when performed under divided attention, future work is needed to determine how instrumented dual-task TUG testing can more accurately estimate risk for late-life cognitive impairment in older adults."

The aim of this study was to determine whether ground kayak paddling (GKP) exercise can improve postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty participants were randomly allocated to a GKP group (n=30; mean age, 74 years) or a control group (n=30; mean age, 74 years). GKP exercise consisted 5 types of exercise protocols, including paddling and multi-directional reaching with repetitive trunk and upper-extremities movements, which was performed for 60 min twice a week for 6 weeks. The outcome measures included the Timed Up and Go Test, the Functional Reach Test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Arm Curl Test, handgrip strength, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. RESULTS In this study, adherence to the regimen was 96% in the GKP group. Postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function were significantly improved after intervention (p<0.05), and all the values in the GKP group, except for the Berg Balance Scale scores, were significantly decreased or increased compared to the control group. Differences between the 2 groups were Timed Up and Go Test -0.74 s; Functional Reach Test +7.20 cm; Arm Curl Test +5.56 repetitions; right handgrip strength +3.57 kg; left handgrip strength +3.08 kg; and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, +3.46 score (p<0.05).

            "abstract": "Motor impairments are among the most relevant, evident, and disabling symptoms of Parkinson’s disease that adversely affect quality of life, resulting in limited autonomy, independence, and safety. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs specifically targeted to the needs of Parkinsonian patients in supporting drug treatments and improving motor control and coordination. However, due to the expected increase in patients in the coming years, traditional rehabilitation pathways in healthcare facilities could become unsustainable. Consequently, new strategies are needed, in which technologies play a key role in enabling more frequent, comprehensive, and out-of-hospital follow-up. The paper proposes a vision-based solution using the new Azure Kinect DK sensor to implement an integrated approach for remote assessment, monitoring, and rehabilitation of Parkinsonian patients, exploiting non-invasive 3D tracking of body movements to objectively and automatically characterize both standard evaluative motor tasks and virtual exergames. An experimental test involving 20 parkinsonian subjects and 15 healthy controls was organized. Preliminary results show the system’s ability to quantify specific and statistically significant (p < 0.05) features of motor performance, easily monitor changes as the disease progresses over time, and at the same time permit the use of exergames in virtual reality both for training and as a support for motor condition assessment (for example, detecting an average reduction in arm swing asymmetry of about 14% after arm training). The main innovation relies precisely on the integration of evaluative and rehabilitative aspects, which could be used as a closed loop to design new protocols for remote management of patients tailored to their actual conditions."

Recent work has suggested a positive effect of balance and motor control training (BMCT) in reducing fatigue. It is unclear whether this effect can also be attained during inpatient rehabilitation. Multimodal agility-based exercise training (MAT) has been developed as a framework that incorporates BMCT with added agility components but has not been applied to pwMS. Therefore, this study will evaluate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial comparing MAT against strength and endurance training (SET) for the improvement of MS-related fatigue and fatigability in a German neurological rehabilitation centre.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      A total of 24 pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤5.0, Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions ≥53) will be randomly assigned to either SET or land and water-based MAT for 4-6 weeks during inpatient rehabilitation. Assessments of subjective fatigue, motor and cognitive fatigability, cognitive and cardiorespiratory performance, and balance confidence will be performed at admission and discharge. Subjective fatigue will also be assessed at 1, 4 and 12 weeks after discharge. Feasibility outcomes will include patients' acceptance of study procedures and interventions, recruitment rate, retention rate, time needed to complete baseline assessments, intervention adherence and fidelity. All quantitative outcomes will be reported descriptively.

People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at an increased likelihood of dementia due to AD. No study has yet investigated and contrasted the MCI subtypes in relation to eye movement performance. Methods: In this work we explore whether eye-tracking impairments can distinguish between patients with the amnesic and the non-amnesic variants of MCI. Participants were 68 people with dementia due to AD, 42 had a diagnosis of aMCI, and 47 had a diagnosis of naMCI, and 92 age-matched cognitively healthy controls.

Two highly intensive tests of anti-saccade with VM task and pro-saccade with SO task also influenced postural sway significantly. Strong associations were seen between postural sway and eye movements for the conditions where the two movements theoretically shared common neural pathways in the brain, and vice versa. This study suggests that assessing posture and saccades with the integrated tasks comprehensively and simultaneously could be useful to explain different functions of the brain. The results warrant a cross-sectional study in OA with and without dementia to explore differences between these groups."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Long-term multicomponent cognitive-physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age-related decline in physical functioning."

            "abstract": "Dementia is a disease characterized by cognitive impairment and physical decline that worsens over time. Exercise is one lifestyle factor that has been identified as a potential means of reducing or delaying progression of the symptoms of dementia, maximizing function and independence. The purpose of this study was to explore physical therapists' (PTs) experiences and reflections on facilitating high-intensity functional exercise with older people living with dementia, in residential care home settings. The study used a qualitative design based on interviews, individually or in small groups, with seven PTs engaged as leaders in the training of older people with dementia. The interviews were analyzed with a modified Grounded Theory method with focus on constant comparisons. To increase trustworthiness the study used triangulation within investigators and member checking. The core category \"Discover and act in the moment-learn over time\" reflects how the PTs continuously developed their own learning in an iterative process. They built on previous knowledge to communicate with residents and staff and to tailor the high intensity training in relation to each individual at that time point. The category \"Be on your toes\" highlights how the PTs searched for sufficient information about each individual, before and during training, by eliciting the person's current status from staff and by interpreting the person's body language. The category \"Build a bond with a palette of strategies\" describes the importance of confirmation to build up trust and the use of group members and the room to create an interplay between exercise and social interaction. These findings highlight the continuous iterative process of building on existing knowledge, sharing and reflecting, being alert to any alterations needed for individuals that day, communication skills (both with residents and staff) and building a relationship and trust with residents in the effective delivery of high intensity functional exercise to older people living with dementia in care settings."

Sixteen healthy males participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design study involving 4 experimental trials (separated by ≥7 d). In each trial, participants were dehydrated by 2.5% body mass through exercise. After 1 h recovery in a thermo-neutral environment (22 ± 2 °C, 60-70% relative humidity) 4 tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were administered to the participants (test 1). In two of the trials, participants were provided with water equivalent to either 50% or 150% body mass loss and given salt (NaCl) capsules (50 mmol/L). A set volume of alcohol or placebo was then consumed in each trial, incorporating the conditions: dehydration-placebo (DP), dehydration-alcohol (DA), partial rehydration-alcohol (PA), and full rehydration-alcohol (FA). The same 4 CANTAB tasks were then re-administered (test 2). Subjective ratings of mood and estimates of alcohol intoxication and driving impairment were also recorded in each trial. Alcohol consumption caused deterioration on 3 of the 4 CANTAB measures (viz., choice reaction time, executive function and response inhibition). This reduction in performance was exacerbated when participants were dehydrated compared to trials where full rehydration occurred. Subjective ratings of impairment and intoxication were not significantly different between any of the trials where alcohol was consumed; however ratings for alcohol trials were significantly higher than in the placebo trial. These findings suggest that rehydration after exercise that causes fluid loss can attenuate alcohol-related deterioration of cognitive functions. This may pose implications for post match fluid replacement if a moderate amount of alcohol is also consumed."

Methods: All major databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, WanFang, and CNKI, were searched to identify all relevant studies published in English or Chinese since October 28th, 2019. Two researchers independently conducted document retrieval, study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality evaluation. Result: 15 randomized controlled trials were analyzed (N = 612 people with MCI), with the methodological quality evaluation score ranging from 5 to 7 points. A random effects model was selected to combine effect sizes. The result of the meta-analysis indicates that VR significantly enhanced MCI patients' overall cognitive ability (SMD = 0.869, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.330-1.407, P = 0.002, I 2 = 86.822, n = 537) and executive function (SMD = 1.083, 95%, 95%CI = 00.134-2.031, P = 0.025, I 2 = 93.748, n = 220).

We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions (namely diet, exercise and cognitive training) for T2DM on cognition. A search strategy was constructed and applied to four databases: EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed journal articles in English were considered assessing the effect of exercise, dietary or cognitive training/stimulation-based interventions (or any combination of these) in patients with T2DM on cognition. Results were dual-screened and extracted by two independent reviewers. Of 4820 results, 3782 remained after de-duplication. Forty full-texts were screened and two studies were included in the final review. The first assessed the impact of a 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention on T2DM-related complications (Look-AHEAD study) and the second was a post hoc analysis of T2DM patients from a trial of a physical activity intervention in older non-demented adult with functional limitations (LIFE study). Whilst the Look-AHEAD study found no impact on diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, the LIFE study demonstrated beneficial effects on global cognitive function and delayed memory specifically in older adults with T2DM. There is insufficient evidence to fully assess the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on cognition in T2DM. Well-constructed trials must be designed to specifically assess the effect of non-pharmacological and multi-domain interventions for cognition in patients with T2DM in midlife. All trials examining interventions in T2DM should consider cognition as at least a secondary outcome."

Therefore, the search for innovative strategies to prevent/delay these physiological and cognitive disorders is essential to guarantee the independence and life quality of an elderly population. The aim of this work is to verify the effect of a 12-week resistance exercise program on the general physical aptitude and cognitive capacities of elderly and sedentary women. Twenty-nine women (65.87±5.69 years) were divided into two groups. The control group was composed of eight elderly women who met the same inclusion criteria of the study and the strength training group was composed of 29 elderly women who were subjected to a resistance exercise program defined by 12 upper and lower limb exercises combined in 3×10 repetitions with 1-minute interval between repetitions and two resting minutes between exercises (three times/week). Weight loads were fixed between 60% and 75% of the apparent 1 repetition maximum, which was estimated by the test of 10 maximum repetitions. The direct curl was performed for upper body strength evaluation with 2.3 kg dumbbells for 30 seconds, whereas the chair test was used for lower body evaluation (total sit-stand movements in 30 seconds). The cognitive capacities of subjects were evaluated by \"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment\" questionnaire. After 12 weeks, the elderly group showed significant increases in the average upper body strength (58%), lower body strength (68%), and cognitive capacity (19%). The present study demonstrated that regular resistance exercises could provide significant gains on the upper and lower body strength concomitant to positive improvements on cognitive capacities of elderly women, bringing enhanced life quality."

Identifying factors related to a lack of improvement in submaximal exercise capacity may help us interpret findings and design new interventions. The aim of this study is to identify factors contributing to a lack of improvement in submaximal exercise capacity 3 months after physical activity advice or an exergame intervention in patients with HF. Additionally, we aimed to assess differences in lack of improvement in submaximal exercise capacity of patients whose baseline exercise capacity predicted a worse compared with better prognosis of HF.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      This secondary analysis of the HF-Wii study analysed baseline and 3 month data of the 6 min walk test (6MWT) from 480 patients (mean age 67 years, 72% male).

Among patients with a baseline 6MWT of ≥300 m, 18% had deteriorated submaximal exercise capacity. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, lower baseline levels of self-reported physical activity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60-0.97], lower baseline levels of cognitive function (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.79-0.96) were significantly associated with lack of improvement in exercise capacity at 3 months.

Forty-five older women were randomized into one of three experimental groups: TRT, PTRT, and control group (CG). Cognitive tests explored global cognitive function, short-term memory, and dual-task performance. Serum BDNF levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Exercise sessions were performed twice a week over 22 weeks. In TRT, exercise sessions were based on three sets of 8-10 repetitions at \"difficult\" intensity. In PTRT, the first session was based on PT (three sets of 8-10 repetitions at \"moderate\" intensity), while the second session was similar to the TRT. Our analyses indicated that overall cognitive function, short-term memory, and dual-task performance were similarly improved after TRT and PTRT. Serum BDNF concentrations were not altered by any training protocol. In conclusion, the two RT programs tested in the present trial improved global cognitive function, short-term memory and dual task performance in non-demented, well-functioning, community-dwelling older women. In addition, our findings suggest that mechanisms other than BDNF may be associated with such improvements."

However, it remains unclear what combination strategies are most beneficial for cognitive and physical outcomes. We aimed to compare the efficacy of the three main types of combination strategies (simultaneous, sequential or exergaming) to either intervention alone or control in older adults. Randomized controlled trials of combined cognitive and physical training were included in multivariate and network meta-analyses. In cognitively healthy older adults and mild cognitive impairment, the effect of any combined intervention relative to control was small and statistically significant for overall cognitive (k = 41, Hedges' g = 0.22, 95 % CI 0.14 to 0.30) and physical function (k = 32, g = 0.25, 95 % CI 0.13 to 0.37). Simultaneous training was the most efficacious approach for cognition, followed by sequential combinations and cognitive training alone, and significantly better than physical exercise. For physical outcomes, simultaneous and sequential training showed comparable efficacy as exercise alone and significantly exceeded all other control conditions. Exergaming ranked low for both outcomes. Our findings suggest that simultaneously and sequentially combined interventions are efficacious for promoting cognitive alongside physical health in older adults, and therefore should be preferred over implementation of single-domain training."

            "abstract": "The human ageing process is universal, ubiquitous and inevitable. Every physiological function is being continuously diminished. There is a range between two distinct phenotypes of ageing, shaped by patterns of living - experiences and behaviours, and in particular by the presence or absence of physical activity (PA) and structured exercise (i.e., a sedentary lifestyle). Ageing and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with declines in muscle function and cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in an impaired capacity to perform daily activities and maintain independent functioning. However, in the presence of adequate exercise/PA these changes in muscular and aerobic capacity with age are substantially attenuated. Additionally, both structured exercise and overall PA play important roles as preventive strategies for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity; improvement of mobility, mental health, and quality of life; and reduction in mortality, among other benefits. Notably, exercise intervention programmes improve the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, energy) and cognition, thus optimising functional capacity during ageing. In these pathological conditions exercise is used as a therapeutic agent and follows the precepts of identifying the cause of a disease and then using an agent in an evidence-based dose to eliminate or moderate the disease. Prescription of PA/structured exercise should therefore be based on the intended outcome (e.g., primary prevention, improvement in fitness or functional status or disease treatment), and individualised, adjusted and controlled like any other medical treatment. In addition, in line with other therapeutic agents, exercise shows a dose-response effect and can be individualised using different modalities, volumes and/or intensities as appropriate to the health state or medical condition. Importantly, exercise therapy is often directed at several physiological systems simultaneously, rather than targeted to a single outcome as is generally the case with pharmacological approaches to disease management. There are diseases for which exercise is an alternative to pharmacological treatment (such as depression), thus contributing to the goal of deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS). There are other conditions where no effective drug therapy is currently available (such as sarcopenia or dementia), where it may serve a primary role in prevention and treatment. Therefore, this consensus statement provides an evidence-based rationale for using exercise and PA for health promotion and disease prevention and treatment in older adults. Exercise prescription is discussed in terms of the specific modalities and doses that have been studied in randomised controlled trials for their effectiveness in attenuating physiological changes of ageing, disease prevention, and/or improvement of older adults with chronic disease and disability. Recommendations are proposed to bridge gaps in the current literature and to optimise the use of exercise/PA both as a preventative medicine and as a therapeutic agent."

Specifically, Internet use disorder is associated with structural or functional impairment in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. These regions are associated with the processing of reward, motivation, memory, and cognitive control. Early neurobiological research results in this area indicated that Internet use disorder shares many similarities with substance use disorders, including, to a certain extent, a shared pathophysiology. However, recent studies suggest that differences in biological and psychological markers exist between Internet use disorder and substance use disorders. Further research is required for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Internet use disorder."

            "abstract": "The slow, progressive accumulation of pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is the principal determinant of cognitive decline leading to dementia. Risk-reduction strategies during midlife focus on raising the clinical threshold for the appearance of cognitive symptoms and on reducing the extent of Alzheimer pathology. Best available evidence suggests an approach based on three, conceptually distinct strategies. (1) Raise the threshold for cognitive symptoms by improving brain health. To achieve this goal, the tactic is to reduce cerebrovascular risks mediated by hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia. (2) Raise the threshold for cognitive symptoms by enhancing cognitive reserve. Here, tactics focus on mental stimulation associated with occupation, leisure activities and social engagement. (3) Reduce the burden of Alzheimer pathology. The most promising tactic toward this end is regular aerobic exercise. Tactics in support of strategies to reduce cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer pathology are not yet substantiated by robust, consistent clinical trial evidence. There is pressing need for well-designed pragmatic trials to provide stronger evidence on preventive strategies for late-life cognitive decline and dementia."

The relationship between cognitive function and measures of daily activity measured by continuous three-axis accelerometers in Xiaomi Mi Band, including subject-level average step counts, average distance (kilometers), and average calorie expenditure per day of 7-day activity, was determined. The slope of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the measures of activity to draw comparisons between early-stage MCI and late-stage MCI. The patients were assessed by using several cognitive tests such as Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument and Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test. The multivariate linear regression model indicated a significant correlation of higher average step counts per day of 7-day activity (aver-step-counts) with higher score in visual construction (β = 0.355; p = .015). To differentiate patients with late-stage MCI from those with early-stage MCI, the cut-off value of 6,284 steps on aver-step-counts showed an optimal sensitivity and specificity (Youden index = 0.36, area under the curve = 0.651, p = .042). The aver-step-counts showed a significantly better differentiating rate between patients with early-stage and late-stage MCI than average calorie expenditure per day of 7-day activity did (p = .046).

Data Sources. Electronic databases and trial registries were searched from their inception until July 2020. Study Selection. Trials were collected with the following study inclusion criteria: (1) patients over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with PSCI; (2) combined cognitive-exercise interventions, regardless of the order of the two types of interventions or whether they were administered simultaneously; (3) any control group studied at the same time that was deemed acceptable, including no intervention/routine care, delayed intervention, sham intervention, and passive training; (4) the use of any validated cognitive neuropsychological test to evaluate cognitive function; and (5) clinically administered random trials with controls. Data Extraction. Five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the full texts and methodological quality of the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

            "abstract": "The benefits of physical exercise on improvements in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and cognitive functioning have been reported in the literature. However, the variability of individual responses may be linked to genetic differences. BDNF is considered one of the most plausible factors involved in the cognitive benefits associated with physical activity practice. A single nucleotide polymorphism localized in the gene that codes BDNF results in a missense mutation that promotes an amino acid substitution (Val66Met) in the protein. This process has been associated with decreased levels of BDNF secretion, with corresponding impairments in specific cognitive functions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a multimodal physical exercise program on peripheral BDNF levels and cognitive functions in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The participants were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) prior to and after the intervention. Forty-five participants were assigned to the control and trained groups. The trained group participated in a multimodal physical training for a 16-week period. The results showed a significant between-subjects interaction (p < 0.05), which indicates the beneficial contribution of training on cognitive functions independent of the BDNF genotype. However, only participants with BDNF-Met genotypes exhibited significant improvements in peripheral BDNF levels. The BDNF genotype appears to modulate the effects of physical exercise on BDNF secretion, but it does not influence cognition. This is the first study that evaluated the influence of a BDNF polymorphism on physical activity and cognition performance in elderly MCI individuals."

The physical activity sessions were delivered twice weekly for the first twelve weeks, and then reduced to once weekly, to groups of 15 participants. Activities included cardiovascular, strength, balance and flexibility exercises. A sub-sample of participants in the physical activity (N = 54) and control arms (N = 48) underwent a 3 T MRI brain scan and cognitive assessments at baseline, 6- and 12-months (mean age = 76.6 years, 6.8 SD). It was hypothesised that the intervention would lead to a reduced rate of decline in hippocampal volume. Group differences in changes in cognition were also examined.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      As hypothesised, we found a maintenance in left hippocampal volume in the intervention arm, in comparison with the control arm after 12 months (p = 0.027). In a secondary analysis, this effect was attenuated after including age, sex and education level as covariates (p = 0.057). There was no significant between-group difference in the right hippocampus (p = 0.405). Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a beneficial effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that a community-based physical activity intervention can significantly ward-off hippocampal atrophy in older adults.

Under single- and dual-task, gait speed was obtained using a computerized mat. For the dual-task there were three conditions: 1) reciting alternate letters of the alphabet (DT-alpha); 2) counting backwards in 3 s (DT-counting); and 3) recalling words from a shopping list (DT-recall). Dual-task interference in gait and cognition were calculated as: (dual task-single task)/single task×100 and summed to obtain total interference. The cognitive domains of executive function, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial function and verbal memory (recall and recognition) were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Raw test scores were subjected to principal component analysis to derive a global cognition score. Partial correlations were used to determine the strength of associations between single- and dual-task measures and cognitive scores, adjusting for age, sex and education.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The strongest significant associations for each cognitive outcome variable were between greater total interference under DT-alpha and lower global cognition (r = 0.25), working memory (r = 0.28) and verbal memory [recognition] (r = 0.21), greater gait interference under DT-alpha and slower processing speed (r = 0.43) and single-task gait speed and verbal fluency (r = 0.23).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a virtual reality (VR) educational workshop on improving understanding of the impact of environments for people living with dementia for carers in residential aged care facilities in Australia. Participants were nonrandomly allocated to one of two conditions: a VR condition which enabled them to take the perspective of a person living with dementia as they navigate a home environment (n = 40), or to a non-VR condition, in which participants received equivalent information in a classroom without the use of VR (n = 56). Participants completed a purpose-built pictorial measure of their understanding of environmental factors that could impact on people with dementia before and after the workshop. Following education, an analysis of covariance revealed that compared to non-VR education, those who received VR education identified a significantly greater number of appropriate environmental modifications, after adjusting for practice test scores. The results from this study demonstrate the utility of VR as a promising tool to improve carers' understanding of the ways in which the environment can be modified to assist people living with dementia."

Thirty healthy subjects comprising 18 males and 12 females who were familiar with video game playing were recruited. Each subject underwent three sessions of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with a bolus injection of 20 mCi (99m)Tc ECD IV to measure their CBF. The first measurement was performed as baseline, the second and third measurements were performed after playing two different video games for 30 min, respectively. Statistic parametric mapping (SPM2) with Matlab 6.5 implemented on a personal computer was used for image analysis. CBF was significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex and significantly increased in the temporal and occipital cortices after both video games playing. Furthermore, decreased CBF in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which was significantly correlated with the number of killed characters was found after the violent game playing. The major finding of hypo-perfusion in prefrontal regions after video game playing is consistent with a previous study showing reduced or abnormal prefrontal cortex functions after video game playing. The second finding of decreased CBF in the ACC after playing the violent video game provides support for a previous hypothesis that the ACC might play a role in regulating violent behavior."

            "abstract": "Current treatment in late-life cognitive impairment and dementia is still limited, and there is no cure for brain tissue degeneration or reversal of cognitive decline. Physical activity represents a promising non-pharmacological interventional approach in many diseases causing cognitive impairment, but its effect on brain integrity is still largely unknown. Especially research of cerebral alterations in disease state that goes beyond observations of clinical improvement is crucial to understand disease processes and possible effective treatments. In this systematic review, we address the question how physical activity and fitness in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) influences brain architecture compared to cognitively healthy elderly. We review both interventional studies comprising aerobic, coordinative and resistance exercises and observational studies on fitness and physical activity combined with Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI). Different MRI approaches were included such as volumetric and structural analyses, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), functional MRI and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). We evaluate MRI results for different exercise modalities and performed a methodological evaluation of interventional studies in cognitive decline compared to normal aging. According to our results, among 12 interventions in AD/MCI, aerobic exercise is most frequently applied (9 studies). Interventions in AD/MCI altogether reveal a higher methodological quality compared to interventions in healthy elderly (8.33 ± 2.19 vs. 6.25 ± 2.36 out of 13 points), with most frequent missing aspects related to descriptions of complications, lack of intention-to-treat and statistical power analyses. Effects of aerobic exercise and fitness seem to mainly impact brain structures sensitive to neurodegeneration, which especially comprise frontal, temporal and parietal regions, such as the hippocampal/parahippocampal region, precuneus, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, which are reported by several studies. General fitness measured via an objective fitness assessment and questionnaires seems to have a more global cerebral effect, probably due to its long-term application, whereas distinct intervention effects of durations between 3 and 6 months seem to concentrate on more local brain regions as the hippocampus, which can also be influenced by region of interest analyses. There is still a lack of evidence on other or combined types of intervention modalities, such as resistance, coordinative as well as multicomponent exercise during cognitive decline, and complex interventions as dancing. Future research should examine their beneficial effect on brain integrity, since several non-MRI studies already point to their advantageous impact. As a further future prospect, combination and application of newly developed imaging methods such as metabolic imaging should be envisaged to understand physical activity and its cerebral influence under its many-sided facets."

Significant effects still existed when excluding waitlist-only controlled studies, and when comparing to physical activity interventions. Furthermore, benefits of exergames where observed for both healthy older adults and clinical populations with conditions associated with neurocognitive impairments (all p<0.05).

This pilot sudy investigated the feasibility and efficacy of an eight-week home-based neurofunctional training (HBNFT) program vs. home-based resistance training (HBRT) on ambulatory performance in MS patients with cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty males/females with MS (age 18-50 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤ 6, and processing speed score ≤ 41.5 as a marker of cognitive impairment) were randomly assigned into HBNFT and HBRT groups. After one week (three sessions) of center-based, supervised training for learning the programs and maximizing safety, the participants completed eight weeks (three sessions per week) of the home-based training programs. The programs were supported through videos, brochures and Digital Video Discs (DVDs) provided during clinic visits (weeks 1 and 5). Ambulatory performance (tandem stance test; tandem walk test; timed up-and-go (TUG); six-minute walk test (6MWT), 10- meter walking test (10MWT); timed 25 foot walk test (T25FWT); five times sit to stand test (5TSTS); six spot step test (SSST); and hand grip) was measured before and after the exercise programs.

Method: OvidMedline, PsychInfo and Embase were searched for studies on the 5th August 2017. The efficacy of the studies was estimated using meta-analyses. Results: Eight RCTs were included. No RCTs were identified for people with MCI. Four RCTs found that psychosocial interventions (multicomponent intervention, Tai Chi, problem adaptation therapy and exercise/walking) were effective at reducing symptoms of depression in PWD who were depressed. One study (Tai Chi) found that these reductions were no longer evident at six-month follow-up. Another study, not included in the meta-analyses, found that pleasant events behaviour therapy and problem solving behaviour therapy improved depression symptoms and this effect remained significant at follow-up. Three RCTs found that psychosocial interventions (music therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) reduced symptoms of anxiety in PWD who were anxious. Evidence from two of these RCTs (music therapy and CBT) showed that these improvements were evident at three to six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The identified psychosocial interventions are effective at reducing symptoms of depression or anxiety in PWD experiencing these symptoms. This review is limited by the quality of studies, small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of the interventions, therefore high quality studies with larger sample sizes are required to test the efficacy of specific interventions such as CBT."

Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that subtle cognitive changes, detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive impairment are met, may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention and reduction in disease risk, research also suggests that engaging in stimulating mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces dementia risk. Therefore, midlife (defined here as 40 to 65 years) may be a suitable time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and, in the longer term, possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for maintaining or improving cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched up to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG). We ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP at www.apps.who.int/trialsearch, to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people between 40 and 65 years of age (80% of study population within this age range). Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      For preliminary screening of search results, we used a 'crowd' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened remaining citations against inclusion criteria; independently extracted data; and assessed the quality of the included trial, using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We used GRADE to describe the overall quality of the evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified one eligible study that examined the effect of computerised cognitive training (CCT) in 6742 participants over 50 years of age, with training and follow-up duration of six months. We considered the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and the overall quality of the evidence to be low.Researchers provided no data on our primary outcome. Results indicate that there may be a small advantage for the CCT group for executive function (mean difference (MD) -1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.85 to -1.29; participants = 3994; low-quality evidence) and a very small advantage for the control group for working memory (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15; participants = 5831; low-quality evidence). The intervention may have had little or no effect on episodic memory (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; participants = 3090; low-quality evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found low-quality evidence from only one study. We are unable to determine whether computerised cognitive training is effective in maintaining global cognitive function among healthy adults in midlife. We strongly recommend that high-quality studies be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of cognitive training in midlife, using interventions that last long enough that they may have enduring effects on cognitive and brain reserve, and with investigators following up long enough to assess effects on clinically important outcomes in later life."

However, they may also occur in problematic states of elevated mood, such as in bipolar disorder. Can we apply an understanding of spontaneous imagery gained by the study of spontaneous negative images to spontaneous positive images? In an analogue of the trauma film studies, 69 volunteers viewed an explicitly positive (rather than traumatic) film. Participants were randomly allocated post-film either to perform a visuospatial task (the computer game 'Tetris') or to a no-task control condition. Viewing the film enhanced positive mood and immediately post-film increased goal setting on a questionnaire measure. The film was successful in generating involuntary memories of specific scenes over the following week. As predicted, compared with the control condition, participants in the visuospatial task condition reported significantly fewer involuntary memories from the film in a diary over the subsequent week. Furthermore, scores on a recognition memory test at 1 week indicated an impairment in voluntary recall of the film in the visuospatial task condition. Clinical implications regarding the modulation of positive imagery after a positive emotional experience are discussed. Generally, boosting positive imagery may be a useful strategy for the recovery of depressed mood."

Those with MS have difficulties executing cognitive tasks and walking simultaneously, a reflection of dual-task interference. Therefore, dual-task training may improve functional ambulation. Additionally, using technology such as virtual reality can provide personalized rehabilitation while mimicking real-world environments. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the benefits of a combined cognitive-motor virtual reality training on MS symptoms compared to conventional treadmill training.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study will be a single-blinded, two arm RCT with a six-week intervention period. 144 people with MS will be randomized into a treadmill training alone group or treadmill training with virtual reality group. Both groups will receive 18 sessions of training while walking on a treadmill, with the virtual reality group receiving feedback from the virtual system. Primary outcome measures include dual-task gait speed and information processing speed, which will be measured prior to training, one-week post-training, and three months following training.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study will provide insight into the ability of a multi-modal cognitive-motor intervention to reduce dual-task cost and to enhance information processing speed in those with MS. This is one of the first studies that is powered to understand whether targeted dual-task training can improve MS symptoms and increase functional ambulation. We anticipate that those in the virtual reality group will have a significantly greater increase in dual-task gait speed and information processing speed than those achieved via treadmill training alone."

            "abstract": "Exposure to acute hypoxia causes a detrimental effect on the brain which is also manifested by a decrease in the ability to perform psychomotor tasks. Conversely, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose levels are elevated in response to exercise, is a well-known factor in improving cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate whether the exercise under hypoxic conditions affects psychomotor performance. For this purpose, 11 healthy young athletes performed a graded cycloergometer exercise test to volitional exhaustion under normoxia and acute mild hypoxia (FiO2 = 14.7%). Before, immediately after exercise and after a period of recovery, choice reaction time (CRT) and number of correct reactions (NCR) in relation to changes in serum BDNF were examined. Additionally, other selected factors which may modify BDNF production, i.e., cortisol (C), nitrite, catecholamines (adrenalin-A, noradrenaline-NA, dopamine-DA, serotonin-5-HT) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), were also measured. Exercise in hypoxic conditions extended CRT by 13.8% (p < 0.01) and decreased NCR (by 11.5%) compared to rest (p < 0.05). During maximal workload, NCR was lower by 9% in hypoxia compared to normoxia (p < 0.05). BDNF increased immediately after exercise in normoxia (by 29.3%; p < 0.01), as well as in hypoxia (by 50.0%; p < 0.001). There were no differences in BDNF between normoxia and hypoxia. Considering the fact that similar levels of BDNF were seen in both conditions but cognitive performance was suppressed in hypoxia, acute elevation of BDNF did not compensate for hypoxia-induced cognition impairment. Moreover, neither potentially negative effects of C nor positive effects of A, DA and NO on the brain were observed in our study."

Modern neuroscience and neuroimaging enable study of the processes during artistic performance. Creative people have less marked hemispheric dominance. It was found that the right hemisphere is specialized for metaphoric thinking, playfulness, solution finding and synthesizing, it is the center of visualization, imagination and conceptualization, but the left hemisphere is still needed for artistic work to achieve balance. A specific functional organization of brain areas was found during visual art activities. Marked hemispheric dominance and area specialization is also very prominent for music perception. Brain is capable of making new connections, activating new pathways and unmasking secondary roads, it is \"plastic\". Music is a strong stimulus for neuroplasticity. fMRI studies have shown reorganization of motor and auditory cortex in professional musicians. Other studies showed the changes in neurotransmitter and hormone serum levels in correlation to music. The most prominent connection between music and enhancement of performance or changing of neuropsychological activity was shown by studies involving Mozart's music from which the theory of \"The Mozart Effect\" was derived. Results of numerous studies showed that listening to music can improve cognition, motor skills and recovery after brain injury. In the field of visual art, brain lesion can lead to the visuospatial neglect, loss of details and significant impairment of artistic work while the lesions affecting the left hemisphere reveal new artistic dimensions, disinhibit the right hemisphere, work is more spontaneous and emotional with the gain of artistic quality. All kinds of arts (music, painting, dancing...) stimulate the brain. They should be part of treatment processes.

Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline and 3 years later, whilst CT+PE had additional annual assessments. According to the results, the 3Y CT+PE outperformed control in cognitive abilities (p < 0.002), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (p < 0.001), stabilized their functional performances between 1st and 2nd year, but worsened in working and verbal memory between 2nd and 3 rd year (p < 0.002). Control deteriorated in cognitive functions (p < 0.001) and ADL (p < 0.001) after 3 years, whilst 1.33% of the experimental and 13.53% of the control group progressed to dementia (p < 0.001). Longitudinal CT+PE improves cognitive performance and ADL in MCI and delay the progression to dementia."

Consequently, treatment of these symptoms requires physical activation and pharmacological or physical immobilization should be avoided. The few trials that have been conducted in inpatient dementia care to investigate the effects of exercise on behavioural and psychological symptoms revealed inconsistent results. Due to a lack of evidence, there is a paucity of recommendations for physical activation in this stage of care. Therefore, this trial seeks to investigate the effects of a day-structuring exercise programme on behavioural and psychological symptoms as well as on circadian rhythms of patients with dementia, hospitalized because of their behavioural and psychological disturbances.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A single-centre randomised controlled trial will be conducted in three special dementia care units of an old age psychiatry hospital.

Due to the provision of four day-structuring exercise-sessions in the course of an intervention day, the exercise programme for the study group is called exercise-carrousel. Baseline and post-intervention assessment for the primary outcome variable - the overall effects on behavioural and psychological symptoms--will be measured by the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change. The following objectives are set up as secondary outcomes: dimensions of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregiver burden, routine and on-demand psychotropic medication, patients' motor behaviour, diurnal cortisol-levels from saliva probes and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-levels from blood serum.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      In order to be regarded as an important treatment option for behavioural and psychological symptoms, physical activation in inpatient hospital dementia care requires more evidence and appropriate recommendations. Respecting hospital routines and the intra-daily variability of the patients' motivation and behavioural disturbances in the provision of exercise sessions could lead to higher exercise adherence and better effects on patients' behavioural and psychological symptoms than former trials have presented.

The impact of sprint interval exercise in acute severe hypoxia on executive function. High Alt Med Biol. 23: 135-145, 2022. Objective: The present study evaluated executive performance responses to sprint interval exercise in normoxia and relatively severe hypoxia. Methods: Twenty-five physically active men (age 22 ± 2 years; maximal oxygen uptake 43 ± 2 ml/[kg·min]) performed four trials including two normoxic (FIO2 = 0.209) and two normobaric hypoxic trials (FIO2 = 0.112), at rest (control) and exercise at the same time on different days. The exercise scheme consisted of 20 sets of 6-seconds all-out cycling sprint interspersed with 15-seconds recovery. The Stroop task was conducted before, 10, 30, and 60 minutes after each trial, whereas peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion, and feelings of arousal were additionally recorded immediately after the interventions. Results: Despite the low SpO2 levels, both resting and sprint interval exercise in hypoxia had no adverse effects on executive function. Exercise elicited executive improvements in normoxia (-5.3% and -3.4% at 10 and 30 minutes after exercise) and in hypoxia (-7.8% and -4.3%), which is reflected by ameliorating incongruent reaction time and its 30-minutes sustained effects (p = 0.018). Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that sprint interval exercise caused sustained executive benefits, and exercise in relatively severe hypoxia did not impair executive performance."

Composite executive function scores improved post-intervention in both groups, but there was no evidence for between-group differences. Social dancing, however, generated greater improvements on digit symbol substitution test than treadmill walking. No intervention-related differences were observed in brain activation-although less hippocampal atrophy (tertiary) was observed following social dancing than treadmill walking. These preliminary findings are promising but need to be confirmed in future large-scale and sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials."

We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available."

However, combined effects of these interventions in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are unknown. Using a randomized interventional design, we evaluated the effect of combined omega-3 FA supplementation, aerobic exercise and cognitive stimulation (target intervention) versus omega-3 FA supplementation and non-aerobic exercise (control intervention) on cognitive function and gray matter volume in patients with MCI. Moreover, we analyzed potential vascular, metabolic or inflammatory mechanisms underlying these effects. Twenty-two MCI patients (8 females; 60-80years) successfully completed six months of omega-3 FA intake, aerobic cycling training and cognitive stimulation (n=13) or omega-3 FA intake and non-aerobic stretching and toning (n=9). Before and after the interventions, cognitive performance, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at 3T (n=20), intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery and serum markers of glucose control, lipid and B-vitamin metabolism, and inflammation were assessed. Intervention-related changes in gray matter volume of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions, i.e., frontal, parietal, temporal and cingulate cortex were examined using voxel-based morphometry of high resolution T1-weighted images. After the intervention period, significant differences emerged in brain structure between groups: Gray matter volume decreased in the frontal, parietal and cingulate cortex of patients in the control intervention, while gray matter volume in these areas was preserved or even increased after the target intervention. Decreases in homocysteine levels in the target intervention group were associated with increases in gray matter volume in the middle frontal cortex (p=0.010). No significant differences in cognitive performance or other vascular, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were observed between groups. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that omega-3 FA intake combined with aerobic exercise and cognitive stimulation prevents atrophy in AD-related brain regions in MCI patients, compared to omega-3 FA intake plus the control condition of stretching and toning. These promising findings should now be validated in a larger interventional trial."

Besides drug treatment, physical activity seems to be a promising intervention target as epidemiological and clinical studies suggest beneficial effects of exercise training on cognition. Using comparable inclusion and exclusion criteria, we analyzed the efficacy of drug therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and Ginkgo biloba) and exercise interventions for improving cognition in AD and MCI populations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched The Cochrane Library, EBSCO, OVID, Web of Science, and U.S Food and Drug Administration data from inception through October 30, 2013. Randomized controlled trials in which at least one treatment arm consisted of an exercise or a pharmacological intervention for AD or MCI patients, and which had either a non-exposed control condition or a control condition that received another intervention.

            "abstract": "A pharmaceutical intervention that has received great attention in recent years for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the use of antibodies targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain, as the formation of Aβ plaques is considered as being the driving force for the development and progression of AD. Recently, a Phase III trial in patients with mild-to-moderate AD has provided ambivalent evidence for the efficacy of this intervention. In this trial, the intravenous administration of bapineuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting Aβ in the brain, for 78weeks led to a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau and evidence for lower Aβ accumulation in the brain of AD patients who carried APOE ε4. However, this treatment did not improve clinical outcomes (e.g. the rate of cognitive decline) in these patients. Similar null results with respect to the rate of cognitive decline were found in a separate Phase III clinical trial after treatment with solanezumab. Based on these findings, one conclusion could be that antibodies targeting Aβ in the brain may unfold their highest efficacy when given before the development of clinical AD symptoms, i.e. during a period where neurodegeneration but not cognitive loss represents the major pathology. Another conclusion could be that antibody-based pharmaceutical interventions may fail to slow the progress of cognitive loss in patients who have AD because of their solely pharmaceutical therapeutic approach. Leisure activities that require patients' mental and physical abilities (e.g. exercise) are associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia. In the same manner, they may help to curb the progress of this devastating disease. Thus, combining the use of antibodies targeting Aβ with therapeutic strategies that require patients' mental and physical abilities might help tackle the neurodegenerative dynamics and cognitive loss both in patients with AD, and its prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment."

We aim to adopt new MCDT protocols and to compare their performance against the gold standard (a walking based MCDT, called GAIT). 27 older adults have been assessed through a customized wearable system during 4 MCDTs. We developed as many pooled indices (PIs), based on MCDTs perfomance, demographic data, and clinical scores. We use these parameters as regressors in 4 different logistic regression models. The regression models that encompassed features from innovative MCDT overcame the gold standard classification performance. In particular, models based on the heel tapping and the alternate heel-toe tapping reach the best outputs, namely +8% of accuracy if compared to the gold standard (a walking task). The use of logistic regression models based on MCDT PI have been effective in discerning between CNA vs MCI. Our results suggest that the gold standard MCDT may represents a too demanding exercise to highlight differences between CNA and MCI. It seems that MCDT based on an intermediate level of motor difficulty could represent the sweet spot for the identification of MCI against CNA. Clinical relevance- The combination of innovative digital devices and innovative approach on data analysis (PIs) opened a new scenarios to the early detection and prediction of dementia. Their use would standardize the assessment procedure, lightening the physician from the burden of cumbersome testing sessions. This study suggests that a broader framework for MCDT, which should encompass an ampler selection of motor tasks with different possibilities in terms of difficulties levels, could provide clinicians with a new appropriate set of tools for the early detection of dementia."

            "abstract": "Cognitive decline and dementia have a deep impact on the health and quality of life of older subjects and their caregivers. Since the therapeutic options currently available have demonstrated limited efficacy, the search for preventive strategies for cognitive decline and dementia are mandatory. A possible role of lifestyle-related factors was recently proposed for age-related changes of cognitive function, predementia syndromes and the cognitive decline of degenerative (Alzheimer's disease [AD]) or vascular origin. At present, cumulative evidence suggests that vascular risk factors may be important in the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and AD. Moderate alcohol drinking has been proposed as a protective factor against MCI and dementia in several longitudinal studies, but contrasting findings also exist. The Mediterranean diet could therefore be an interesting model with which to further study the association between dietary patterns and cognitive functioning, given the suggested role of many components of this diet (monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cereals and red wine) in contrasting cognitive impairment and dementia. The association between low education and predementia and dementia syndromes is supported by the majority of studies, but very few studies have investigated whether this association may be attributed with lifestyle factors that covary with education. Studies in the literature seem to identify in physical exercise one promising strategy in decreasing cognitive decline, but some of the limitations of these studies do not allow us to draw definite conclusions. At present, in older subjects, healthy diets, antioxidant supplements, the prevention of nutritional deficiencies, and moderate physical activity could be considered the first line of defense against the development and progression of predementia and dementia syndromes. However, in most cases, these were only observational studies, and results are awaited from large multicenter randomized clinical trials in older persons that may clarify the possible synergy, for example, between moderate exercise, physical activity and healthy Mediterranean diet on cognition in the elderly."

            "abstract": "With the aging of the population, there is continued emphasis on finding interventions that prevent or delay onset of cognitive disorders of aging. Pharmacological interventions have proven less effective than hoped in this capacity and a greater emphasis has therefore been placed on understanding behavioral interventions that will positively impact dementia risk. Building on a robust animal literature, a substantial volume of research has emerged, particularly over the last 5 years, to suggest that modifiable behaviors impact brain plasticity in both humans and animals. This chapter aims to provide a critical summary of this ever growing body of research, focusing specifically on participation in physical and cognitive activities among older adults and their impact on cognition, the brain, and cognitive aging outcomes. The animal literature on activity and cognition provides a series of hypotheses as to how exercise exerts its cognitive and brain benefits. Research in animals is briefly reviewed in the context of these hypotheses as it provides the groundwork for investigations in humans. The literature on physical and cognitive activity benefits to brain and cognition in humans is reviewed in more detail. The largely positive impact of physical and cognitive activities on cognition and brain health documented in epidemiological, cross sectional, and prospective randomized controlled studies are summarized. While most studies have targeted older adults in general, the implications of exercise and cognitive interventions in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are also described as is the evidence supporting the ability for physical activity to modify genetic risk. The connection between activity levels and brain volume, white matter integrity, and improved functionality is reviewed. Practical recommendations regarding the nature, duration, intensity and age of onset of physical or mental activity necessary to reap cognitive and brain benefits are also detailed. Most studies have investigated a singular behavioral factor or intervention, but there is some research detailing the impact of combining both mental and physical activity to boost brain health; this emerging literature is also reviewed. Finally, we comment on the limitations of the extant literature and directions for future research, in particular the need for prospective trials of activity interventions in older adults."

            "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are common contributors to institutionalization and loss of quality of life in older people. Both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and physical inactivity are prevalent and important modifiable risk factors for developing dementia. Physical activity is recommended in the management of T2DM, and there is growing evidence that exercise, a subgroup of physical activity, is also beneficial for maintaining and improving brain structure and function. This paper reviews the evidence for a benefit of exercise on T2DM related cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition, the type (e.g., aerobic, resistance), intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise are discussed. This review shows that although exercise has known benefits on the mechanisms linking T2DM to dementia, there are very few randomized controlled trials examining whether this is the case. It is concluded that the uptake of exercise for the brain has great potential to improve quality of life and provide significant cost savings, but further research is warranted to clarify the effects of exercise on T2DM and those on dementia."

            "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a new safe and efficient tool for the rehabilitation of many childhood and adulthood illnesses. VR-based therapies have the potential to improve both motor and functional skills in a wide range of age groups through cortical reorganization and the activation of various neuronal connections. Recently, the potential for using serious VR-based games that combine perceptual learning and dichoptic stimulation has been explored for the rehabilitation of ophthalmological and neurological disorders. In ophthalmology, several clinical studies have demonstrated the ability to use VR training to enhance stereopsis, contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity. The use of VR technology provides a significant advantage in training each eye individually without requiring occlusion or penalty. In neurological disorders, the majority of patients undergo recurrent episodes (relapses) of neurological impairment, however, in a few cases (60-80%), the illness progresses over time and becomes chronic, consequential in cumulated motor disability and cognitive deficits. Current research on memory restoration has been spurred by theories about brain plasticity and findings concerning the nervous system's capacity to reconstruct cellular synapses as a result of interaction with enriched environments. Therefore, the use of VR training can play an important role in the improvement of cognitive function and motor disability. Although there are several reviews in the community employing relevant Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, VR has not yet been thoroughly examined in this regard. In this systematic review, we examine the key ideas of VR-based training for prevention and control measurements in ocular diseases such as Myopia, Amblyopia, Presbyopia, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Epilepsy and Autism spectrum disorder. This review highlights the fundamentals of VR technologies regarding their clinical research in healthcare. Moreover, these findings will raise community awareness of using VR training and help researchers to learn new techniques to prevent and cure different diseases. We further discuss the current challenges of using VR devices, as well as the future prospects of human training."

Few studies had similar objectives meaning that in many instances findings could not be synthesised in a meaningful way. Nevertheless, there was some cross-study evidence that elite cyclists have more positive mood states (relative to normative scores), pre-race anxiety impairs performance (among male cyclists), and associative strategies are perceived as helpful for pain management. Among single studies coded as having low risk of bias, evidence suggests that implicit beliefs affect decision making performance, elite cyclists are less susceptible to mental fatigue (than non-elite cyclists), and better leadership skills relates to greater social labouring. Limitations include non-standardisation of measures, lack of follow-up data, small sample sizes, and overall poor research quality.

To improve the impaired functions, serious games targeting the lost functions are commonly developed and used in training programs. In this study, we designed a virtual reality driving simulator (VRDS) as a serious game with different difficulty levels for improving the spatial cognition; we evaluated it on 11 participants with different levels of dementia for two weeks, every day except weekends (10 sessions of practice in total) and 30 min/day. We assessed the participants' spatial cognition before and after the intervention by an independent assessment (the VR replica of Morris Water test) and also by their performance playing the VRDS during the intervention. We also assessed the participants' mood by a standard depression scale as well as their plausible experience of simulation sickness. The results showed significant improvement in Morris water test. The participants' normalized correct trajectory (to find the target) was improved significantly by 44.4% at post-intervention with respect to baseline. Furthermore, on average, the participants progressed to higher (more challenging) levels of the game, and their spatial learning score increased throughout the sessions. Their mood also showed improvement with respect to baseline. Overall, the results hold promise for the designed VRDS as a mood-lifting and enhancing spatial skills serious game for older adults if it is played regularly.

The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the benefits of a combined motor-cognitive virtual reality training program on key motor and cognitive symptoms and related outcomes in pwMS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a single-blinded, two-arm RCT, 124 pwMS were randomized into a treadmill training with virtual reality (TT + VR) group or a treadmill training alone (TT) (active-control) group. Both groups received three training sessions per week for 6 weeks. Dual-tasking gait speed and cognitive processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT, score) were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included additional tests of cognitive function, mobility, and patient-reported questionnaires. These were measured before, after, and 3 months after training.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Gait speed improved (p < 0.005) in both groups, similarly, by about 10 cm/s. The TT + VR group (n = 53 analyzed per-protocol) showed a clinically meaningful improvement of 4.4 points (95% CI 1.9-6.8, p = 0.001) in SDMT, compared to an improvement of only 0.8 points in the TT (n = 51 analyzed per-protocol) group (95% CI 0.9-2.5 points, p = 0.358) (group X time interaction effect p = 0.027). Furthermore, TT + VR group-specific improvements were seen in depressive symptoms (lowered by 31%, p = 0.003), attention (17%, p < 0.001), and verbal fluency (11.6% increase, p = 0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that both TT and TT + VR improve usual and dual-task gait in pwMS.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting, but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting. The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia.

A total of 39 individuals were randomly assigned to an exercise group or to a control group. The exercise group participants cycled at their self-selected intensity at least for 15 min daily during 15 months. The control group participants performed recreational activities. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Fuld object memory evaluation, and symbol digit modality test were used for cognitive assessments. The Katz index, the timed \"Up & Go\" test, and the World Health Organization questionnaire were used to assess functional independence, mobility, and fall risk. Significant improvements were observed in the exercise group for global cognition and attention, visual scanning, and processing speed. Long-term self-paced cycling training seems to have a protective effect on cognitive status and attention, visual scanning, and processing speed in older institutionalized individuals."

At the beginning of the intervention, there were no differences between the groups in the assessed variables. The active groups which carried out the resistance training programme (AC and AP), registered better results in IGF-1 than the sedentary groups. These differences were statistically significant in AC vs. SC (p < 0.01) and AP vs. SC (p < 0.05).

Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are two promising interventions. Aerobic exercise increases aerobic fitness, which in turn improves brain structure and function, while cognitive training improves selective brain function intensively. Hence, combined aerobic exercise and cognitive training may have a synergistic effect on cognition by complementary strengthening of different neural functions. Few studies have tested the effects of such a combined intervention, and the findings have been discrepant, largely due to varying doses and formats of the interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this single-blinded, 2 × 2 factorial phase II randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy and synergistic effects of a 6-month combined cycling and speed of processing training intervention on cognition and relevant mechanisms (aerobic fitness, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity in the default mode network) in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.

            "abstract": "Cognitive impairment occurs in 30%-50% of patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Exercise is beneficial in preventing and treating cognitive impairment and cardiometabolic abnormalities in many chronic inflammatory diseases, but there are few studies investigating the impact of exercise in HCV infection. The study aimed to assess the effect of a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention on cognition and extrahepatic manifestations in individuals with HCV. In this nonrandomized controlled pilot study, individuals with HCV participated in a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention. Outcome measures included cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA], Trail Making Test A & B [TMT-A; TMT-B], Digit Symbol Test [DST]), cardiorespiratory fitness (estimated V˙O2max ), physical activity (accelerometry), anthropometry, quality of life (depression; fatigue; sleep quality) and biochemical markers. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), intervention completion (T1) and 12 weeks after intervention completion (T2). Thirty-one patients completed the study (exercise group n = 13, control group n = 18). In the exercise group, cognition improved at T1 in the TMT-A (31% mean improvement, p = 0.019), TMT-B (15% mean improvement, p = 0.012) time and MOCA (14% mean improvement, p ≤ 0.001). These improvements were not maintained at T2. Depression (p = 0.038), sleep quality (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.037) and estimated V˙O2max (7.8 mL kg-1 min-1 [22%] mean increase, p = 0.004) also improved at T1. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the benefits of a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention in improving cognition, quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with HCV. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and strategies for continued exercise engagement in individuals with HCV are warranted for sustained benefits."

We present a case study of a traumatic brain injury subject in whom eight sessions of a neuropsychological rehabilitation protocol targeting attention, executive functions, and working memory as compared with a personalized EEG-based neurofeedback protocol focused on the electrodes and bands that differed from healthy subjects (F3, F1, Fz, FC3, FC1, and FCz), targeting the inhibition of theta frequency band (3 Hz-7 Hz) in the same number of sessions. Quantitative EEG and neuropsychological testing were performed. Clear benefits of EEG-based neurofeedback were found in divided and sustained attention and several aspects related to visuospatial skills and the processing speed of motor-dependent tasks. Correlative quantitative EEG changes justify the results. EEG-based neurofeedback is probably an excellent complementary technique to be considered to enhance conventional neuropsychological rehabilitation."

We examined the action-specific perception impairments of MCI patients by means of body-ownership illusion in a non-immersive virtual reality environment. Twenty healthy young adults, 21 healthy older adults, and 15 MCI patients were recruited.

The MCI patients' original-body action-specific perception was no different than that of the healthy controls (p = 0.679). However, the enlarged-body action-specific perception of the MCI patients was significantly biased (p < 0.001).

The negative results in this study compared to the study that has been carried out in the US might be explained by the translation, adaptation, and shortening of the intervention used in the US, and a different social context. In addition, the results might be explained by the lack of room for improvement and by experiencing the intervention as too much of a burden. Furthermore, improving physical health might only be effective if the physical exercises are of moderate-to-high-intensity and are tailored in accordance with participants' preferences and needs. For future studies, because dyads often commented positively about the pleasure and support they received, it might also be valuable to measure quality of life outcomes such as relationship quality, pleasure, and self-esteem in dyadic focused interventions."

In addition, skin fibroblasts have been identified as surrogate indicators of pathogenic processes correlating with clinical measures. The PARKEX study aims to compare the effects of two different PA programs, analyzing the impact on mitochondrial function in patients' skin fibroblasts as biomarkers for disease status and metabolic improvement. Early-stage PD patients (n = 24, H&Y stage I to III) will be randomized into three age- and sex-matched groups. Group 1 (n = 8) will undergo basic physical training (BPT) emphasizing strength and resistance. Group 2 (n = 8) will undergo BPT combined with functional exercises (BPTFE), targeting the sensorimotor pathways that are most affected in PD (proprioception-balance-coordination) together with cognitive and motor training (Dual task training). Group 3 (n = 8) will serve as control (sedentary group; Sed). Participants will perform three sessions per week for 12 weeks.

            "abstract": "Sensorimotor therapy gives optimal results when patients are cognitively engaged into highly repetitive tasks, a goal that most children find hard to pursue. This paper presents the key developments of our ongoing effort to design an interactive rehabilitation environment that motivates physically impaired children throughout their therapy. The continuous motivation is achieved by the system adapting fundamental therapeutic components to the performance of each child. The relevant movement is mirrored to an animated character projected in front of the child. We speculate that the visual observation of one's own movements will activate the \"mirror neuron system\", a brain system underlying the human capacity to learn by imitation. Our rehabilitation algorithm personalizes the difficulty of the tasks by adapting the difficulty of reaching virtual targets on the animated environment through changing the visual gain between real and animated movements. To track the sensorimotor performance, we estimated the time required to reach a target. To give a proof of concept for the adaptation of the visual gain, we developed a serious game driven by a Leap Motion device. In addition to becoming a testbed for studying sensorimotor integration and neuroplasticity, the proposed notion of visual gain can be integrated into a highly engaging environment in which physically impaired children will play their way to recovery."

Computerized exercises were designed based on the hypothesis that repeated task-dependent coactivation of multiple DMN regions would translate into regulation of resting-state network connectivity. Forty seniors (mean age: 65.90 years; SD: 8.53) were recruited and assigned either to an experimental group (n=21) who received one month of intensive cognitive stimulation, or to a control group (n=19) who maintained a regime of daily-life activities explicitly focused on social interactions. An MRI protocol and a battery of neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at the end of the study. Changes in the DMN (measured via functional connectivity of posterior-cingulate seeds), in brain volumes, and in cognitive performance were measured with mixed models assessing group-by-timepoint interactions. Moreover, regression models were run to test gray-matter correlates of the various stimulation tasks. Significant associations were found between task performance and gray-matter volume of multiple DMN core regions. Training-dependent up-regulation of functional connectivity was found in the posterior DMN component. This interaction was driven by a pattern of increased connectivity in the training group, while little or no up-regulation was seen in the control group. Minimal changes in brain volumes were found, but there was no change in cognitive performance. The training-dependent regulation of functional connectivity within the posterior DMN component suggests that this stimulation program might exert a beneficial impact in the prevention and treatment of early AD neurodegeneration, in which this neurofunctional pathway is progressively affected by the disease."

Accordingly, we sought to investigate the relationship between exercise and mood, in early-stage AD patients (N=104) from California, over a 1-year period. Patients completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Blessed-Roth Dementia Rating Scale (BRDRS), while their caregivers completed the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YALE), Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Functional Abilities Questionnaire (FAQ). Approximately half of the participants were female, from a variety of ethnic groups (Caucasian=69.8%; Latino/Hispanic Americans=20.1%). Our results demonstrated that the patients spent little time engaged in physical activity in general, their overall activity levels decreased over time, and this was paired with a change in global cognition (e.g., MMSE total score) and affect/mood (e.g., POMS score). Patients were parsed into Active and Sedentary groups based on their Yale profiles, with Active participants engaged in walking activities, weekly, over 1 year. Here, Sedentary patients had a significant decline in MMSE scores, while the Active patients had an attenuation in global cognitive decline. Importantly, among the Active AD patients, those individuals who engaged in walking for more than 2 h/week had a significant improvement in MMSE scores. Structured clinical trials which seek to increase the amount of time AD patients were engaged in walking activities and evaluate the nature and scope of beneficial effects in the brain are warranted."

Yet, emerging studies suggest that larger cognitive gains may be induced when PA interventions are combined with cognitive activity (CA).

Computerized Cognitive Games Training (CCT) is an investigational strategy to improve targeted functions in MCI through the modulation of cognitive networks.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The goal of this study was to examine the effect of CCT versus a non-targeted active brain exercise on functional cognitive networks.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      107 patients with MCI were randomized to CCT or web-based crossword puzzles. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) was obtained at baseline and 18 months to evaluate differences in fMRI measured within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) and other large-scale brain networks: the executive control, salience, and sensorimotor networks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no differences between crosswords and games in the primary outcome, within-network DMN FC across all subjects. However, secondary analyses suggest differential effects on between-network connectivity involving the DMN and SLN, and within-network connectivity of the DMN in subjects with late MCI. Paradoxically, in both cases, there was a decrease in FC for games and an increase for the crosswords control (p < 0.05), accompanied by lesser cognitive decline in the crosswords group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Results do not support a differential impact on within-network DMN FC between games and crossword puzzle interventions. However, crossword puzzles might result in cognitively beneficial remodeling between the DMN and other networks in more severely impaired MCI subjects, parallel to the observed clinical benefits."

Due to a lack of pharmacological treatment options for people with dementia, non-pharmacological treatments such as exercise programs have been recommended to improve cognition, activities of daily living, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, inconsistent results have been reported across different trials, mainly because of the high heterogeneity of exercise modalities. Thus, this systematic review aims to answer the questions whether exercise programs improve cognition, activities of daily living as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms in community-dwelling people with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eight databases were searched for articles published between 2016 and 2021 (ALOIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science).

Aims: This observational intervention study investigated the impact of physical exercise and music interventions among patients with dementia on an acute psychogeriatric ward. Materials and methods: The data were collected during February 2009-December 2010 (n = 89; treatment as usual) and during April 2011-March 2013 (n = 86; treatment as usual with physical exercise, e.g. balance, flexibility, strength training, and music interventions, e.g. singing, listening to music and playing instruments). The primary outcome measure was the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the secondary outcome measures were the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, the Barthel Index, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: In both groups, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) decreased (p < .001) but daily functioning deteriorated (p < .001). No significant between-group differences for either outcome variable were found. Based on linear mixed models, fewer exercise sessions associated with more severe symptoms (p = .030), and the time variable (admission/discharge) with a decline in the level of NPS (p < .001). Moreover, female gender (p = .026) and more exercise sessions (p = .039) associated with an increased level of functioning (p = .031) and the time variable (admission/discharge) with a drop in the level of functioning during hospitalization (p < .001). Conclusion: Although no differences were found between the study groups, analysis within the intervention group suggest that physical exercise may have some positive effects for both NPS and the level of functioning in some patients with dementia while no positive effects regarding music interventions were found."

Traditional cognitive screening tools for dementia have their limitations, with emphasis on memory and, to a lesser extent, on the cognitive domain of executive function. The use of virtual reality (VR) in screening for cognitive function in older persons is promising, but evidence for its use is sparse.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary aim was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using VR to screen for cognitive impairment in older persons in a primary care setting.

They participated in a VR module for assessment of their learning and memory, perceptual-motor function, and executive function. Each participant was evaluated by the total performance score (range: 0-700) upon completion of the study. A questionnaire was also administered to assess their perception of and attitude toward VR.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 37 participants in Group 1 (cognitively intact; MoCA score≥26) and 23 participants in Group 2 (cognitively impaired; MoCA score<26) were assessed.

Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation. Overall, this paper raises awareness of the role of virtual reality in emotion elicitation, regulation, and expression and enhances our understanding of the use of virtual reality by older adults living with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia."

            "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition conceptualized as a stage between normal cognition and dementia. To diagnose it requires subjective cognitive impairment, evidence of cognitive impairment on cognitive testing but no abnormality in a person's functioning and no evidence of dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). There has been growing interest in the condition over the past two decades or so because people with MCI are much more likely than people with no cognitive impairment to progress to dementia (Roberts et al., 2013). However, a significant percentage of people with MCI will not progress to dementia and some will revert to having normal cognition. Rates of progression and reversion to normal cognition vary widely in different studies (Manly et al., 2008). People with MCI experience worry about their symptoms and this is partly alleviated by receiving a diagnosis of MCI and being reassured they do not have dementia (Gomersall et al., 2017). The benefits of diagnosis also include gaining a greater understanding of their symptoms and accessing clinical support but a significant amount of uncertainty remains with regards to the risk of progression and recipients of the diagnosis remain frustrated at the lack of treatments for MCI (Gomersall et al., 2017). There has been much interest in improving the prediction of progression to dementia from MCI but to date, the best predictors of progression remain structured clinical and functional assessments, with some additional benefit from measures of cortical volume/thickness from brain imaging (Korolev et al., 2016). As yet, however, there are no interventions that can prevent (Kane et al., 2017) or treat (Cooper et al., 2013) MCI so it seems set to remain an important clinical entity for the foreseeable future."

Although it forms an important part of recovery and helps to prevent future events and complications, there has been little focus on its potential cognitive benefits. Areas covered: Coronary artery disease and heart failure are common heart problems associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and cognitive decline is commonly seen in affected individuals. Cognitive impairment may influence patient self-management by reducing medication adherence, rendering patients unable to make lifestyle modifications and causing missed healthcare visits. Cognitive assessment in cardiac rehabilitation as an outcome measure has the potential to improve clinical, functional and behavioral domains as well as help to reduce gaps in the quality of care in these patients. Expert commentary: Limited evidence at present has shown that cardiac rehabilitation and exercise has potential in preventing cognitive decline. Cardiac prehabilitation, a rehabilitation-like program delivered before cardiac surgery, may also play a role in preventing postoperative cognitive dysfunction, but needs future research studies to support it."

A combined group (n = 35) participated in two strength and two walking sessions, an aerobic group (n = 35) participated in four walking sessions, and a social control group (n = 35) participated in four nonexercise social visits per week. The social group was used as a reference for the mediation analysis, which was performed in the combined and aerobic groups.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements:\n        \n      \n      ADLs were assessed using the Katz index (proxy-reported ADL performance), Erlangen-ADL test (E-ADL) (instrumental ADL performance), and 7-item Physical Performance Test (PPT-7) (physical ADL performance).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a group effect for Katz index (P = .02), E-ADL (P < .001), and PPT-7 (P = .003). Differences from baseline to after the intervention were similar in the combined and aerobic groups. Exercise-induced changes in global cognition mediated changes in Katz index (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05-0.41), leg muscle strength mediated changes in E-ADL (95% CI = 0.03-0.43), and leg muscle strength (95% CI = 0.01-0.36) and walking endurance (95% CI = 0.01-0.43) mediated changes in PPT-7 only in the combined group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Physical exercise can improve ADL levels in individuals with dementia, but improvements are small and seem independent of exercise type. Additional analyses suggest that combined aerobic and strength exercise may be more effective than aerobic-only exercise to effectively target ADL dysfunction in individuals with dementia. Future research is warranted to justify these exercise-specific findings."

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of a stepping exergame program on gait speed, balance, mobility, reaction time, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and daily life functioning in people with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks, three times weekly, 15 min of exergaming versus watching preferred music videos. The exergame device consisted of a pressure-sensitive step training platform on which participants performed stepping movements to play the games. The device automatically adapted the training level to the participants' capabilities. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), step reaction time test (SRTT), Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL), and Katz Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention.

The increasing rate of brain damaged victims and the heterogeneity of impairments decrease rehabilitation effectiveness and competence resulting in higher cost of rehabilitation treatment. On the other hand, traditional rehabilitation exercises are boring, thus leading patients to neglect the prescribed exercises required for recovery. Therefore, we propose game-based approach to address these problems. This paper presents a rehabilitation gaming system (RGS) for cognitive rehabilitation.

Already in the 1970s exercise programs for cardiovascular patients were established, whereas in other severe chronic illnesses such as breast cancer or multiple sclerosis exposure to physical stress seemed to be a contraindication. Today there is a grow ing body of evidence demonstrating positive physical as well as psychic effects of exercise training in patients with these diseases. These studies are summarized and complementary studies of our group are described in more detail. In patients with breast cancer we were able to demonstrate persistent psychosocial effects even 1 year after completion of the training program. In patients with multiple sclerosis we could confirm an induction of neurotrophic factors in trained individuals. Correspondingly, there is accumulating evidence showing positive effects of exercise on cognitive function, especially in the aged. Potential pathophysiological pathways regarding a progression to dementia are presented. Consequently exercise programs could play a pivotal role in the prevention and therapy of the cognitive decline in the aged in an aging society."

The assessment consisted of gait (measured by 10-m walk test and Timed Up and Go Test [TUGT]), dual task (measured by TUGT associated with a cognitive-motor task of calling a phone number), and cognition (domains of the Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-Revised and Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]). For data analysis, the Pearson product-moment correlation and the backward stepwise linear regression were conducted. Language, fluency, and visuospatial domains predicted the 10-m walk test measure specifically in PC, MCI, and AD groups. Only the visuospatial domain was independently associated with the TUGT measure in the MCI and AD groups. FAB score, language domain, and FAB score and fluency domain were the strongest predictors for the isolated cognitive-motor task measure in the PC, MCI, and AD groups, respectively. The visuospatial domain was independently associated with the dual-task test measure in all 3 groups.

            "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common condition in the elderly. It is characterized by deterioration of memory, attention, and cognitive function that is beyond what is expected based on age and educational level. MCI does not interfere significantly with individuals' daily activities. It can act as a transitional level of evolving dementia with a range of conversion of 10%-15% per year. Thus, it is crucial to protect older people against MCI and developing dementia. The preventive interventions and appropriate treatments should improve cognitive performance, and retard or prevent progressive deficits. The avoidance of toxins, reduction of stress, prevention of somatic diseases, implementation of mental and physical exercises, as well as the use of dietary compounds like antioxidants and supplements can be protective against MCI. The modification of risk factors such as stopping smoking, as well as the treatment of deficiency in vitamins and hormones by correcting behaviors and lifestyle, can prevent cognitive decline in the elderly. The progressive increase in the growth rate of the elderly population can enhance the rate of MCI all over the world. There is no exact cure for MCI and dementia; therefore, further studies are needed in the future to determine causes of MCI and risk factors of progression from MCI to dementia. This will help to find better ways for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment worldwide."

This study aims to investigate whether spatial memory can discriminate MCI better than neuropsychological screening tools. A total of 56 healthy older adults and 36 older adults with MCI participated in this study; they performed a spatial cognitive task based on virtual reality (SCT-VR), the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-K), and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test (WAIS-BDT). The discriminant power was compared between the SCT-VR and the MoCA-K, and the reliability and validity of the SCT-VR were analyzed. The spatial memory, assessed by the SCT-VR, showed better sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.944; specificity: 0.964) than the MoCA-K (sensitivity: 0.857; specificity: 0.746). The test-retest reliability of the SCT-VR was relatively high (ICCs: 0.982, p < 0.001) and the concurrent validity of the SCT-VR with the MoCA-K (r = −0.587, p < 0.001) and the WAIS-BDT (r = −0.594, p < 0.001) was statistically significant. These findings shed light on the importance of spatial memory as a behavioral marker of MCI.

We reviewed 32 unique randomized controlled trials that employed cognitive training (remediation or compensation approaches), physical exercise, or psychotherapeutic interventions that were published before November 2014. Evidence suggests that cognitive training focused on remediation and physical exercise interventions may promote small improvements in selected cognitive abilities. Cognitive training focused on compensation interventions and selected psychotherapeutic interventions may influence how cognitive changes impact daily living. However, confidence in these findings is limited due to methodological limitations. To better assess the value of non-pharmacological interventions for this population, we recommend: (1) adoption of universal criteria for \"early stage cognitive decline\" among studies, (2) adherence to guidelines for the conceptualization, operationalization, and implementation of complex interventions, (3) consistent characterization of the impact of interventions on daily life, and (4) long-term follow-up of clinical outcomes to assess maintenance and meaningfulness of reported effects over time."

However, the structural differences in cortical thickness of the brain between adolescents with online gaming addiction and healthy controls are not well unknown; neither was its association with the impaired cognitive control ability. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans from late adolescence with online gaming addiction (n = 18) and age-, education- and gender-matched controls (n = 18) were acquired. The cortical thickness measurement method was employed to investigate alterations of cortical thickness in individuals with online gaming addiction. The color-word Stroop task was employed to investigate the functional implications of the cortical thickness abnormalities. Imaging data revealed increased cortical thickness in the left precentral cortex, precuneus, middle frontal cortex, inferior temporal and middle temporal cortices in late adolescence with online gaming addiction; meanwhile, the cortical thicknesses of the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, lingual gyrus, the right postcentral gyrus, entorhinal cortex and inferior parietal cortex were decreased. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the cortical thicknesses of the left precentral cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus correlated with duration of online gaming addiction and the cortical thickness of the OFC correlated with the impaired task performance during the color-word Stroop task in adolescents with online gaming addiction. The findings in the current study suggested that the cortical thickness abnormalities of these regions may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of online gaming addiction."

Participants were allocated to either a multimodal lifestyle intervention (INT); or 2) education + attentional control (CON). INT participants received four once-weekly general sleep hygiene education classes, followed by 20-weeks of: 1) individually-timed BLT; and 2) individually-tailored PA promotion. Our primary outcome was sleep efficiency measured using the MotionWatch8© (MW8).

            "abstract": "Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a broad term for people at a stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, where cognitive problems are present but do not impair activities of daily living. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation program on cognitive functions in MCI. Materials and Methods: Sixty-one older adults (25 men, 36 women) with MCI were randomized to the intervention group (n = 30; 70.12 ± 2.57 years) or control (n = 31; 70.30 ± 2.73 years) group. The intervention group received a VR (computer-generated interactive environments) intervention in addition to a conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention, whereas the control group received only the CR intervention. Cognitive functions were assessed in both groups before and after the 12-week interventions by using the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in orientation, visual-spatial perception, visuomotor organization, thinking operation, and attention/concentration functions in the VR group than in the control group (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our results showed that 12 weeks of VR-based rehabilitation enhanced cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Using VR applications in CR is recommended to improve cognitive functions of older adults with MCI."

The present study investigated whether and to what extent there is a difference in selected skills of motor performance depending on the stages of dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      This study included 32 senior citizens with mild dementia (group A; 84.3 ± 6.1 years) and 27 senior citizens with moderate dementia (group B; 85.6 ± 5.5 years), whose classification was based on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The following motor tests were used: the hand dynamometer test (general strength), the drop bar test (motor reaction ability), frailty and injuries: cooperative studies of intervention techniques (FICSIT‑4; balance), the timed up-and-go test (TUG) and the modified chair rising test (CRT; both assess mobility and transfer performances in everyday life).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Group A, in contrast to group B, showed significantly better motor performance in all motor tests except the drop bar test.

We examined whether hopping to a metronome beat had the potential to detect anticipatory motor control deficits among people with mild MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 3.5).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants with MS (n = 13), matched controls (n = 9), and elderly subjects (n = 13) completed tests of cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) and motor performance (Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FWT)). Participants performed two bipedal hopping tasks: at 40 beats/min (bpm) and 60-bpm in random order.

Fitness training may be implemented to address this impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective of this updated review was to evaluate whether fitness training improves cardiorespiratory fitness in people who have sustained a TBI. The secondary objectives were to evaluate whether fitness training improves body function and structure (physical and cognitive impairments, psychological responses resulting from the injury), activity limitations and participation restrictions in people who have sustained a TBI as well as to evaluate its safety, acceptance, feasibility and suitability.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Injuries Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Embase; PubMed (MEDLINE); CINAHL; AMED; SPORTDiscus; PsycINFO; PEDro and PsycBITE) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for relevant trials. In addition we screened reference lists from systematic reviews related to the topic that we identified from our search, and from the included studies, and contacted trialists to identify further studies. The search was run in August 2017.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled studies with TBI participants were eligible if they compared an exercise programme incorporating cardiorespiratory fitness training to usual care, a non-exercise intervention, or no intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently screened the search results, extracted data and assessed bias. We contacted all trialists for additional information. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and odds ratio with 95% CI for dichotomous data. We pooled data when there were sufficient studies with homogeneity.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Two new studies incorporating 96 participants were identified in this update and were added to the six previously included studies. A total of eight studies incorporating 399 participants are included in the updated review. The participants were primarily men aged in their mid-thirties who had sustained a severe TBI. No studies included children. The studies were clinically diverse with regard to the interventions, time postinjury and the outcome measures used. At the end of intervention, the mean difference in peak power output was 35.47 watts (W) in favour of fitness training (MD 35.47 W, 95% CI 2.53 to 68.41 W; 3 studies, 67 participants; low-quality evidence). The CIs include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there was moderate heterogeneity among the studies.Five of the secondary outcomes had sufficient data at the end of intervention to enable meta-analysis: body composition (SMD 0.29 standard deviations (favouring control), 95% CI -0.22 to 0.79; 2 studies, 61 participants; low-quality evidence), strength (SMD -0.02 (favouring control), 95% CI -0.86 to 0.83; 2 studies, 23 participants; very low-quality evidence), fatigue (SMD -0.32 (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.90 to 0.26; 3 studies, 130 participants; very low-quality evidence), depression (SMD -0.43 (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.92 to 0.06; 4 studies, 220 participants; very low-quality evidence), and neuromotor function (MD 0.01 m (favouring fitness training), 95% CI -0.25 to 0.27; 2 studies, 109 participants; moderate-quality evidence). It was uncertain whether fitness training was more or less effective at improving these secondary outcomes compared to the control interventions. Quality of life was assessed in three trials, but we did not pool the data because of substantial heterogeneity. Five of the eight included studies had no dropouts from their intervention group and no adverse events were reported in any study.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is low-quality evidence that fitness training is effective at improving cardiorespiratory deconditioning after TBI; there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions about the other outcomes. Whilst the intervention appears to be accepted by people with TBI, and there is no evidence of harm, more adequately powered and well-designed studies are required to determine a more precise estimate of the effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as the effects across a range of important outcome measures and in people with different characteristics (e.g. children). In the absence of high quality evidence, clinicians may be guided by pre-exercise screening checklists to ensure the person with traumatic brain injury is safe to exercise, and set training parameters using guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine for people who have suffered a brain injury."

Performances on the VEGS memory tasks and the traditional neuropsychological assessments of memory were positively correlated, indicating that memory for VEGS content was similar to memory for traditional paper-and-pencil measures. The older adults performed significantly worse than young adults on the VEGS and the California Verbal Learning Test, but the DKEFS Color-Word Interference failed to differentiate the groups.

Searches for studies were performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. We included studies that compared the effects of a demanding cognitive task (set to induce mental fatigue) with a control condition on strength endurance in dynamic resistance exercise (i.e., expressed as the number of performed repetitions at a given load). The data reported in the included studies were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences. Seven studies were included in the review. We found that mental fatigue significantly reduced the number of performed repetitions for upper body exercises (standardized mean difference: -0.41; 95% confidence interval [-0.70, -0.12]; p = .006; I2 = 0%). Mental fatigue also significantly reduced the number of performed repetitions in the analysis for lower body exercises (standardized mean difference: -0.39; 95% confidence interval [-0.75, -0.04]; p = .03; I2 = 0%). Our results showed that performing a demanding cognitive task-which induces mental fatigue-impairs strength endurance performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that exposure to cognitive tasks that may induce mental fatigue should be minimized before strength endurance-based resistance exercise sessions."

We investigate explanations for inconsistent results across trials and discrepancies between evidence from RCTs and other research data. Twenty-five RCTs were included in the review. Meta-analysis results revealed significant improvements for resistance training compared to stretching/toning on measures of reasoning (p<0.005); and for Tai Chi compared to 'no exercise' controls on measures of attention (p<0.001) and processing speed (p<0.00001). There were no significant differences between exercise and controls on any of the remaining 26 comparisons. Results should be interpreted with caution however as differences in participant profiles, study design, exercise programmes, adherence rates, and outcome measures contribute to both discrepancies within the exercise research literature and inconsistent results across trials."

            "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) has been recognized as one of the core multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms that profoundly impact lives of people with MS (PwMS). Clinical trials have begun to focus on cognition as a primary or secondary outcome, but translating improvements in cognitive testing scores to functioning in the real world is difficult. Performance-based functional assessments and virtual reality (VR) assessments, which incorporate real-world challenges, have been proposed as a way to better assess functional cognition (i.e., cognitive performance and its impact on real-life cognitive functioning of PwMS) and could address the difficulty in evaluating the impact of a treatment on real-world functioning. In this narrative review, we identify and summarize some of the promising recent research applications of performance-based functional assessments and VR tools to assess functional cognition in MS. Overall, most of the studies suggest that functional and VR assessments can detect cognitive differences between people with and without MS and between PwMS with and without CI. Furthermore, performance on some of the functional and VR assessments was associated with performance on standard cognitive assessments. However, developing any guidelines on how to implement these assessments in clinical practice is difficult because of the relatively small sample size across these studies. Performance-based functional and VR assessments represent an innovative approach to increasing sensitivity of how cognitive impairments/abilities present in the daily life of PwMS. More studies, with a larger sample size, robust research methods, and pre- and post-treatment assessments, are warranted to validate relevant, accessible functional and VR assessments before implementing these assessment approaches in clinical practice."

Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters - dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function."

Serum levels of oxidative stress markers, including total anti-oxidation capability, super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA), were measured at baseline (all participants) and the 12-week follow-up (methamphetamine-dependent patients). Serum levels of CAT and MDA in methamphetamine-dependent patients (n = 68) were higher than those in healthy controls (n = 35) at baseline. Furthermore, the international shopping list (ISL) task scores of methamphetamine-dependent patients were significantly lower than those of the controls, indicating verbal memory deficits in methamphetamine-dependent patients. Although there were no significant interactions for all cognitive function scores, aerobic exercise improved the processing speed in methamphetamine-dependent patients. Of interest, aerobic exercise significantly attenuated a spontaneous increase in serum MDA levels in methamphetamine-dependent patients after 12-weeks of abstinence. In conclusion, this study showed that methamphetamine-dependent patients with verbal learning and memory deficits have higher serum levels of MDA, and that a 12-week aerobic exercise program may have beneficial effects on the processing speed as well as blood lipid peroxidation in methamphetamine-dependent patients."

Active Plus is a proven effective computer-tailored PA intervention for the older adult population focusing on PA in daily life. This manuscript describes the effects of the Active Plus intervention (N = 260) on PA of older adults with chronic illnesses (OACI), compared to a waiting list control group (N = 325). It was part of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of the Active Plus intervention on cognitive functioning. OACI (≥65 years) with at least one chronic illness were allocated to one of the conditions. Intervention group participants received PA advice. Baseline and follow-up measurements were assessed after 6 and 12 months. Intervention effects on objectively measured light PA (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) min/week were analysed with multilevel linear mixed-effects models adjusted for the clustered design. Intervention effects on self-reported MVPA min/week on common types of PA were analysed with two-part generalized linear mixed-effects models adjusted for the clustered design. The dropout rate was 19.1% after 6 months and 25.1% after 12 months. Analyses showed no effects on objectively measured PA. Active Plus increased the likelihood to perform self-reported cycling and gardening at six months and participants who cycled increased their MVPA min/week of cycling. Twelve months after baseline the intervention increased the likelihood to perform self-reported walking and participants who cycled at 12 months increased their MVPA min/week of cycling. Subgroup analyses showed that more vulnerable participants (higher degree of impairment, age or body mass index) benefitted more from the intervention on especially the lower intensity PA outcomes. In conclusion, Active Plus only increased PA behaviour to a limited extent in OACI 6 and 12 months after baseline measurements. The Active Plus intervention may yet be not effective enough by itself in OACI. A blended approach, where this eHealth intervention and face-to-face contact are combined, is advised to improve the effects of Active Plus on PA in this target group."

The pathogenesis of AD is complex, which is currently considered to be the result of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The APOE ɛ4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD and a risk factor for progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. So far, no effective drugs have been found for the progression of MCI. However, the effects of nonpharmacological interventions such as nutrition, cognitive, and physical exercises on early AD have received increasing attention. We followed up cognitive assessment scales, Aβ-PET and MRI examination of a patient with MCI for 4 years, who carried APOE ɛ4 homozygous with a clear family history. After 4 years of multi-domain lifestyle interventions including nutrition, socialization, and physical exercises, the patient's cognitive function, especially memory function, improved significantly. Intracerebral amyloid deposition was decreased, and hippocampal atrophy improved. Based on this case, this study reviewed and discussed the interaction of APOE ɛ4 with the environment in AD research in recent years, as well as the impact and mechanisms of non-pharmaceutical multi-domain lifestyle interventions on MCI or early AD.

One study demonstrated capability for detecting prodromal AD and correlated with neuroanatomical substrates. Two studies showed iVR to have high accuracy in differentiating participants with AD from controls but were not hypothesis driven or with adequate controls measures. In a small validation study and two longitudinal case studies, iVR cognitive training was positively rated but did not demonstrate reliable benefit.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      iVR is emerging as a viable method of assessing older adults and people with AD. Strongest benefits were seen when closely integrated with theoretical models of neurodegeneration and existing screening methods. Further randomized controlled trials integrated with clinical populations are required. This will consolidate the power of iVR for assessment of MCI and clarify treatment efficacy beyond current applications in physical rehabilitation."

            "abstract": "The focus of this review is on the close relationship between gait and cognition in ageing and associated dementias. This close relationship is supported by epidemiological studies, clinical studies of older people with and without dementia that focused on the intensity of the physical activity, clinical studies with older persons without dementia examining a relationship between gait and specific cognitive processes, and human and animal experimental studies examining a neural basis for such a relationship. Despite these findings, most studies with patients with dementia focus exclusively on the relationship between cognition and dementia, with relatively few addressing the relationship between gait and dementia. However, subtle disturbances in gait can be observed in ageing and in (preclinical) subtypes of dementia that are not known for prominent motor disturbances, i.e. Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, vascular Cognitive Impairment No Dementia, Subcortical Ischaemic Vascular Dementia, Frontotemporal Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Frontotemporal Dementia, supporting a close relationship between gait and cognition. The relationship between gait and cognition is weakened by the few available intervention studies that examine the effects of walking on cognition in patients with (preclinical) dementia. These studies report equivocal results, which will be discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research will be made."

A small number of studies have investigated the effects of tDCS on cognition in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and have demonstrated variable effects. Emerging evidence suggests that tDCS is most effective when applied to active brain circuits. Aerobic exercise is known to increase cortical excitability and improve brain network connectivity. Exercise may therefore be an effective, yet previously unexplored primer for tDCS to improve cognition in MCI and mild AD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants with MCI or AD will be randomized to receive 10 sessions over 2 weeks of either exercise primed tDCS, exercise primed sham tDCS, or tDCS alone in a blinded, parallel-design trial. Those randomized to an exercise intervention will receive individualized 30-min aerobic exercise prescriptions to achieve a moderate-intensity dosage, equivalent to the ventilatory anaerobic threshold determined by cardiopulmonary assessment, to sufficiently increase cortical excitability. The tDCS protocol consists of 20 min sessions at 2 mA, 5 times per week for 2 weeks applied through 35 cm2 bitemporal electrodes. Our primary aim is to assess the efficacy of exercise primed tDCS for improving global cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our secondary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of exercise primed tDCS for improving specific cognitive domains using various cognitive tests (n-back, Word Recall and Word Recognition Tasks from the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory).

The largest effects on cognitive function were found on motor function and auditory attention (effect sizes of 1.17 and 0.50 respectively).

However, the majority of comparisons yielded no significant results. The data are insufficient to show that the improvements in cognitive function which can be attributed to physical exercise are due to improvements in cardiovascular fitness, although the temporal association suggests that this might be the case. Larger studies are still required to confirm whether the aerobic training component is necessary, or whether the same can be achieved with any type of physical exercise. At the same time, it would be informative to understand why some cognitive functions seem to improve with (aerobic) physical exercise while other functions seem to be insensitive to physical exercise.

The potential correlation between in-game metrics and cognition was investigated in-depth by scrutinizing different in-game metrics. The predictive value of high-resolution monitoring games was assessed by correlating it with classical neuropsychological tests; the area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was calculated to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the method for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Classification accuracy was calculated to be 73.53% when distinguishing between MCI and normal subjects, and 70.69% when subjects with mild dementia were also involved.

In people with PD, impaired executive function has been identified as an indicator of fall risk and decreased quality of life. Therefore, it is important to consider impaired executive function in the physical therapy management of PD. It has been established that exercise improves cognition in older adults and emerging evidence suggests a similar effect in people with neurological conditions. We assessed changes in executive function in an aerobic exercise intervention in 2 people with cognitive impairments due to PD.\n    \n\n\n          Case description:\n        \n      \n      Two individuals with PD participated in this case series.

However, these studies have generally involved small numbers of participants from a handful of western countries. Here, we review findings from our project Sea Hero Quest, which used a video game for mobile and tablet devices to test 3.9 million people on their navigation ability, sampling across every nation-state and from 18 to 99 years of age. Results revealed that the task has good ecological validity and across all countries sufficiently sampled (N = 63), age is linked to a near-linear decline in navigation ability from the early 20s. All countries showed a male advantage, but this varied considerably and could be partly predicted by gender inequality. We found that those who reported growing up in a city were on average worse at navigating than those who grew up outside cities and that navigation performance helped identify those at greater genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. We discuss the advantages and challenges of using a mobile app to study cognition and the future avenues for understanding individual differences in navigation ability arising from this research."

The results showed positive outcomes on dimensions of general cognition, executive functioning, attention, and visual memory in the group that underwent VR-CS. Improvements in executive functioning in this group was supported by consistent evidence of increases in attention abilities but little evidence of increases in memory abilities.

This concept paper presents a smart textile prototype to both entertain and monitor/assess the behavior of the relevant clients. The prototype includes physical computing components for music playing and simple interaction, but additionally games and data logging systems, to determine baselines of activity and interaction. Using microelectronics, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and capacitive touch sensors woven into a fabric, the study demonstrates the kinds of augmentations possible over the normal manipulation of the traditional non-smart activity apron by incorporating light and sound effects as feedback when patients interact with different regions of the textile. A data logging system will record the patient's behavioral patterns. This would include the location, frequency, and time of the patient's activities within the different textile areas. The textile will be placed across the laps of the resident, which they then play with, permitting the development of a behavioral profile through the gamification of cognitive tests. This concept paper outlines the development of a prototype sensor system and highlights the challenges related to its use in a care home setting. The research implements a wide range of functionality through a novel architecture involving loosely coupling and concentrating artifacts on the top layer and technology on the bottom layer. Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services, and so this gives the solution the best flexibility. The literature shows that existing architectures that are strongly coupled result in difficulties modeling different individuals without incurring significant costs."

Early intervention of MCI is critical to protect against dementia. Exercise intervention has gained popularity for the management of MCI. Most current studies have focused only on improvements made by exercise interventions on the global/general cognitive function and/or a specific cognitive function. However, no studies have been performed on a subgroup analysis of the effects of exercise interventions on different cognitive domains of the elderly with MCI. The exploration of this issue will help to clarify the influence and through a preliminary analysis identify the level of influence of exercise interventions on particular cognitive domains, and it will provide the theoretical framework for the construction of precise exercise intervention strategies for MCI patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, the Wan Fang Database, and CBM), supplemented by expert contact, reference and citation checking, and gray literature searches have been conducted.

However, identification of clinically meaningful cognitive and functional outcomes for individuals who are, by definition, asymptomatic remains a significant challenge. Clinical trials for prevention and early intervention require measures with increased sensitivity to subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that comprise the first functional declines in prodromal disease.

Consistent with prior findings, both groups performed significantly worse than healthy younger adults (age 20-54). Participants with SCD also performed significantly worse than controls on objective cognitive measures. VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance. In the SCD group, VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance across nearly all tests with significant correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.7; VRFCAT summary measures all had correlations greater than r=0.5 with MoCA performance and BAC App Verbal Memory (p<0.01 for all).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings suggest the VRFCAT provides a sensitive tool for evaluation of IADL functioning in individuals with subjective cognitive decline.

In either case, getting lost can be a threat to individual and public safety, as well as to personal autonomy and quality of life.

            "abstract": "As the population ages, an increasing number of people will be diagnosed with dementia. Studies have found that insufficient activities are offered in memory care units to people with dementia, even though people benefit tremendously from participating in recreational activities. Information and communication technologies (ICT) can potentially facilitate activities in this setting, yet there is little guidance for designers to develop systems that can support people with dementia in engaging in recreational activities. To fill this gap, recommendations were generated through fieldwork and refined in two rounds of expert feedback. Areas covered include hardware, content, applications, and navigation. Systems should be usable by people with dementia, in addition to staff, to counter disempowerment by not enabling people to use their full abilities. In addition, a diversity of materials is needed to appeal to individuals with dementia who have widely varying backgrounds, abilities, interests, and preferences."

            "abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with pervasive cognitive deficits which are unresponsive to antipsychotic medications. Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia, although the mechanisms for this are unclear. We conducted a systematic review of all exercise intervention studies which reported changes in brain structure, connectivity or peripheral biomarkers which could underlie cognitive improvements from exercise in schizophrenia. An electronic database search was conducted on 22 September 2016 using keywords relevant to exercise and neurocognition in schizophrenia. The search returned 2342 articles. Sixteen were eligible for inclusion, reporting data from 14 independent trials of 423 patients with schizophrenia. Seven studies used neuroimaging to examine the impact of exercise on brain structure and connectivity in schizophrenia, whereas seven other studies examined peripheral biomarkers to assess the effects of exercise. Imaging studies collectively indicated that exercise can increase brain volume in people with schizophrenia, although the regions which responded to exercise varied across studies. Most biomarker studies assessed the effects of exercise on serum levels of BDNF. Several studies found significant increases from exercise along with positive correlations between BDNF and cognitive enhancements (indicating a mechanistic link), although other studies did not observe this relationship. In conclusion, the cognitive benefits of exercise in schizophrenia may be due to exercise stimulating neurogenesis, perhaps by up-regulating BDNF, although current evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. Further exploration of the pro-cognitive mechanisms of exercise in schizophrenia would inform the development of optimal interventions for reducing cognitive impairments in this population.

Findings from observational studies support a role for sleep disturbances (particularly for sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and sleep-disordered breathing) in the development of cognitive impairment. Less consistent evidence exists for associations of insomnia and circadian rhythm dysfunction with cognition. These findings suggest that the sleep-wake cycle plays a crucial part in brain ageing, pointing to a potential avenue for improvement of cognitive outcomes in people at risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Several biological mechanisms might underlie the association between sleep and cognition, but these pathways are not completely understood.

Results from individual studies show that aerobic exercise improved cognition in people with dementia, improved attention and cognitive flexibility in patients with traumatic brain injury, improved choice reaction time in people with multiple sclerosis, and enhanced motor learning in people with chronic stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is limited evidence to support the use of aerobic exercise to improve cognition in adults with neurologic disorders. Of the 67 studies retrieved, less than half included cognition as an outcome, and few studies continued the aerobic exercise program long enough to be considered effective. Further studies investigating the effect of aerobic exercise interventions on cognition in people with neurologic conditions are required."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dementia is a multifaceted disorder that impairs cognitive functions, such as memory, language, and executive functions necessary to plan, organize, and prioritize tasks required for goal-directed behaviors. In most cases, individuals with dementia experience difficulties interacting with physical and social environments. The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of a fire evacuation Virtual Reality Day-Out Task (VR-DOT) environment based on performance profiles as a screening tool for early dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives were (1) to examine the relationships among the performances of 3 groups of participants in the VR-DOT and traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions, and (2) to compare the performance of participants with mild Alzheimer's-type dementia (AD) to those with amnestic single-domain mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls in the VR-DOT and traditional neuropsychological tests used to assess executive functions. We hypothesized that the 2 cognitively impaired groups would have distinct performance profiles and show significantly impaired independent functioning in ADL compared to the healthy controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study population included 3 groups: 72 healthy control elderly participants, 65 amnestic MCI participants, and 68 mild AD participants. A natural user interface framework based on a fire evacuation VR-DOT environment was used for assessing physical and cognitive abilities of seniors over 3 years. VR-DOT focuses on the subtle errors and patterns in performing everyday activities and has the advantage of not depending on a subjective rating of an individual person. We further assessed functional capacity by both neuropsychological tests (including measures of attention, memory, working memory, executive functions, language, and depression). We also evaluated performance in finger tapping, grip strength, stride length, gait speed, and chair stands separately and while performing VR-DOTs in order to correlate performance in these measures with VR-DOTs because performance while navigating a virtual environment is a valid and reliable indicator of cognitive decline in elderly persons.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mild AD group was more impaired than the amnestic MCI group, and both were more impaired than healthy controls. The novel VR-DOT functional index correlated strongly with standard cognitive and functional measurements, such as mini-mental state examination (MMSE; rho=0.26, P=.01) and Bristol Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale scores (rho=0.32, P=.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Functional impairment is a defining characteristic of predementia and is partly dependent on the degree of cognitive impairment. The novel virtual reality measures of functional ability seem more sensitive to functional impairment than qualitative measures in predementia, thus accurately differentiating from healthy controls. We conclude that VR-DOT is an effective tool for discriminating predementia and mild AD from controls by detecting differences in terms of errors, omissions, and perseverations while measuring ADL functional ability."

Twenty-seven low active adults (21 females) aged 45 to 62 years (51.22 ± 5.20) participated in a ten-week randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to an iPad-enhanced aerobic exercise group (experimental group) or an aerobic exercise-only group (control group) following baseline assessment. Both groups exercised at 50% to 75% of age-predicted heart rate maximum for 30 to 50 min/d, 2 d/wk for 10 weeks. During aerobic exercise, the experimental group engaged in virtual tours delivered via iPad. Baseline and post-intervention assessments of wayfinding self-efficacy, wayfinding task performance, cognitive functioning, electroencephalogram (EEG), and psychosocial questionnaires were administered. The results suggest that ten weeks of iPad-enhanced, moderately intense aerobic exercise had specific effects on wayfinding self-efficacy; however, no statistical differences were found between groups on the behavioral wayfinding task or spatial memory performance at follow-up. Performance scores on an inhibitory attentional-control cognitive assessment revealed significant differences between groups, favoring the experimental group (p < 0.05). Virtual reality-enhanced aerobic exercise may prove to be an effective method for improving cognitive function and increasing confidence to navigate real-world scenarios among individuals at risk of cognitive impairment."

Cognitive assessments were performed by neuropsychologists according to standardized methods, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and frontal cognitive function: trail making test (TMT) A & B, and symbol digit substitute test (SDST). Resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured in eyes open and eyes closed conditions for 5 minutes each, with a 19-channel wireless EEG device. The VR intervention program (3 times/week, 100 min each session) comprised four types of VR game-based content to improve the attention, memory and processing speed. Analysis of the subjects for group-time interactions revealed that the intervention group exhibited a significantly improved executive function and brain function at the resting state. Additionally, gait speed and mobility were also significantly improved between and after the follow-up. The VR-based training program improved cognitive and physical function in patients with MCI relative to controls. Encouraging patients to perform VR and game-based training may be beneficial to prevent cognitive decline."

We recorded few adverse events, and the interviews show contrasting results concerning the participants' feelings (ie, degree of immersion, familiarity with technology, and VR content).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and implications:\n        \n      \n      The use of VR 360° videos seems feasible in community-dwelling older adults or residential aged care facilities, as they are safe and provide enjoyment. It constitutes an emerging and promising therapeutic tool to manage psychosocial disorders. This review provides key considerations for the design and implementation of interventions using VR 360° video in clinical practice."

This review summarizes recent evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise in preventing and treating neurocognitive disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Recent evidence suggests that exercise may prevent cognitive impairment in older adults with normal cognition. Besides, it may slow down the deterioration in older adults who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. But inconsistent findings have been reported, and larger randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its treatment value. This article also reviews existing evidence-based clinical guidelines advising on the optimal format and intensity of exercise interventions for older adults with different cognitive functions.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      There is a growing body of evidence supporting the cognitive benefits of exercise for older adults with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia. Exercise is a relatively safe and low-cost lifestyle intervention and should be recommended for older adults to prevent dementia and treat cognitive impairment. However, as the factors affecting the efficacy of exercise in improving cognition are complex, exercise prescription should be individually tailored."

However, such cognition-sparing effects are not uniform across cognitive domains and studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and is also emerging as a potential alternative to pharmaceutical therapies. Like AE, the effectiveness of tDCS is also inconsistent for reducing cognitive impairment in ageing. The unexplored possibility exists that pairing AE and tDCS could produce synergistic effects and reciprocally augment cognition-improving effects in older individuals with and without cognitive impairments. Previous research found such synergistic effects on cognition when cognitive training is paired with tDCS in older individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to explore if pairing AE with tDCS could augment singular effects of AE and tDCS on global cognition (GC), working memory (WM) and executive function (EF) in older individuals with or without MCI and dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using a PRISMA-based systematic review, we compiled studies that examined the effects of AE alone, tDCS alone, and AE and tDCS combined on cognitive function in older individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.

We included only randomized controlled trials (RTC) in humans if available in English full text over the past 20 years, with participants' age over 60. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies (RTC) by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 68 studies were included in the meta-analyses.

Within the context of combating cognitive decline through behavioural interventions, physical activity is a promising approach. There is a dearth of health economic data in the area of behavioural interventions for dementia prevention. Yet, economic evaluations are essential for providing information to policy makers for resource allocation. It is essential we first address population and intervention-specific methodological challenges prior to building a larger evidence base. We use a cost-utility analysis conducted alongside the exercise for cognition and everyday living (EXCEL) study to illustrate methodological challenges specific to assessing the cost-effectiveness of behavioural interventions aimed at older adults at risk of cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cost-utility analysis conducted concurrently with a 6-month, three-arm randomised controlled trial (ie, the EXCEL study) was used as an example to identify and discuss methodological challenges.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both the aerobic training and resistance training interventions were less costly than twice weekly balance and tone classes.

Evidence about effects of individual treatment techniques and modalities is synthesised within many reviews. For selection of effective rehabilitation treatment, the relative effectiveness of interventions must be known.

Quality of evidence within each comparison in each review was determined using objective criteria (based on numbers of participants, risk of bias, heterogeneity and review quality) to apply GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) levels of evidence. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We systematically tabulated the effects of interventions and used quality of evidence to determine implications for clinical practice and to make recommendations for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Our searches identified 1840 records, from which we included 40 completed reviews (19 Cochrane; 21 non-Cochrane), covering 18 individual interventions and dose and setting of interventions. The 40 reviews contain 503 studies (18,078 participants). We extracted pooled data from 31 reviews related to 127 comparisons. We judged the quality of evidence to be high for 1/127 comparisons (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrating no benefit for outcomes of activities of daily living (ADLs)); moderate for 49/127 comparisons (covering seven individual interventions) and low or very low for 77/127 comparisons.Moderate-quality evidence showed a beneficial effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice, suggesting that these may be effective interventions; moderate-quality evidence also indicated that unilateral arm training may be more effective than bilateral arm training. Information was insufficient to reveal the relative effectiveness of different interventions.Moderate-quality evidence from subgroup analyses comparing greater and lesser doses of mental practice, repetitive task training and virtual reality demonstrates a beneficial effect for the group given the greater dose, although not for the group given the smaller dose; however tests for subgroup differences do not suggest a statistically significant difference between these groups. Future research related to dose is essential.Specific recommendations for future research are derived from current evidence. These recommendations include but are not limited to adequately powered, high-quality RCTs to confirm the benefit of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice; high-quality RCTs to explore the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), tDCS, hands-on therapy, music therapy, pharmacological interventions and interventions for sensory impairment; and up-to-date reviews related to biofeedback, Bobath therapy, electrical stimulation, reach-to-grasp exercise, repetitive task training, strength training and stretching and positioning.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Large numbers of overlapping reviews related to interventions to improve upper limb function following stroke have been identified, and this overview serves to signpost clinicians and policy makers toward relevant systematic reviews to support clinical decisions, providing one accessible, comprehensive document, which should support clinicians and policy makers in clinical decision making for stroke rehabilitation.Currently, no high-quality evidence can be found for any interventions that are currently used as part of routine practice, and evidence is insufficient to enable comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions. Effective collaboration is urgently needed to support large, robust RCTs of interventions currently used routinely within clinical practice. Evidence related to dose of interventions is particularly needed, as this information has widespread clinical and research implications."

Six studies in participants with MCI (n = 1088) and eleven studies in participants with NC (n = 670) were included. Five effective MCTs that were superior to physical exercises or cognitive training alone in improving physical capacity and/or cognitive function were detected, however none of these MCTs improved IADL.

            "abstract": "There is considerable support for the view that aerobic exercise may confer cognitive benefits to mild cognitively impaired elderly persons. However, the biological mechanisms mediating these effects are not entirely clear. As a preliminary step towards informing this gap in knowledge, we enrolled older adults confirmed to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a 6-month exercise program. Male and female subjects were randomized into a 6-month program of either aerobic or stretch (control) exercise. Data collected from the first 10 completers, aerobic exercise (n=5) or stretch (control) exercise (n=5), were used to determine intervention-induced changes in the global gene expression profiles of the aerobic and stretch groups. Using microarray, we identified genes with altered expression (relative to baseline values) in response to the 6-month exercise intervention. Genes whose expression were altered by at least two-fold, and met the p-value cutoff of 0.01 were inputted into the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base Library to generate gene-interaction networks. After a 6-month aerobic exercise-training, genes promoting inflammation became down-regulated, whereas genes having anti-inflammatory properties and those modulating immune function or promoting neuron survival and axon growth, became up-regulated (all fold change≥±2.0, p<0.01). These changes were not observed in the stretch group. Importantly, the differences in the expression profiles correlated with significant improvement in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in the aerobic program as opposed to the stretch group. We conclude that three distinct cellular pathways may collectively influence the training effects of aerobic exercise in MCI subjects. We plan to confirm these effects using rt-PCR and correlate such changes with the cognitive phenotype."

The present study aims to examine the effectiveness of lifestyle medicine on cognitive functions among people with MCI and dementia, by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCT). A systematic literature search was conducted to extract RCTs adopting lifestyle interventions of diet, exercise, and stress management or emotional well-being. Results showed that 65 studies were eligible. Exercise was the most promising lifestyle intervention that improved various cognitive functions among people with MCI and dementia, and was more effective in MCI than in dementia. Interventions on stress management or emotional well-being did not show a significant effect on people with MCI, and the evidence for people with dementia was insufficient to conclude. Similarly, due to the lack of RCTs on a healthy dietary pattern, the effectiveness of diet interventions was not examined. In conclusion, the exercise component of lifestyle medicine can be an effective and clinically significant intervention for protecting people with MCI and dementia against cognitive declines, especially when served as an early intervention at the stage of MCI."

            "abstract": "Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) usually report navigation and spatial memory impairments. Spatial navigation is an embodied process that requires the active involvement of both physical (e.g., motor commands and proprioception) and cognitive (e.g., decision-making and mental rotation) information. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a valuable tool that employs this information as real-world navigation does. Given the crucial impact of spatial navigation on daily life, research should focus on ways to enhance it. Though they are still in their development, contemporary IVR methods for spatial navigation training in MCI seem promising. In this usability study, eight patients with MCI syndrome tested an IVR spatial navigation training demo and interacted with the CAVE using active stereo glasses, a foot-motion pad, and a joypad. During the demo, users were asked to report their impressions on the IVR training using the thinking-aloud procedure. Moreover, questionnaires regarding usability, presence and cybersickness were administered at the end of the experience. Our results show that the first version of this system is usable by the patients even if most of them did not have experience with PC/IVR. The system provided a moderate sense of spatial presence and limited negative effects. Issues found during the thinking-aloud procedure concerned the visual aspects, which affected the interaction user-system. Participants reported that they needed more practice with the foot-motion pad even though the overall experience was positively evaluated. Identifying these critical features was essential to develop an improved version of the current system."

This brain injury is associated with characteristic cognitive deficits, and, in extreme cases, with dementia. Even mild cognitive impairment creates a significant hurdle for alcohol rehabilitation, because the domains that are affected tend to be those important for sustaining abstinence. Thus, cognitive decline induced by alcohol contributes to the persistence of alcoholism. Here, I present converging data from animal and clinical studies that show how alcohol affects the brain and behavior. Although there is currently no targeted treatment for overcoming alcohol-induced cognitive decline, emerging evidence suggests that physical activity is both protective and restorative.

Therefore, we compared the state-of-theart controller input to our EMG based approach in terms of presence and user experience.Results show significant differences in terms of Novelty and Dependability. Since there are only few significant differences regarding presence and user experience, the advantage of applying a more demanding physical motion interaction approach (EMG), seems to be a promising method with the potential of having a positive effect on the cognitive training progress.

Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR's dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation. Hence, while replication of outcomes and standardization of VR interventions is required before it can be used in standard care, VR may provide a particularly effective tool for training cognition in elderly."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      There is an association among postural instability, gait dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Difficulty in dividing attention, response inhibition, and visuospatial attention deficiencies may contribute to the impairment of motor performance during daily activities. There are strong evidences that physical therapy can prevent physical and cognitive decline in individuals with PD. Recently, the European Physiotherapy Guideline (EPG) was developed based on randomized clinical trials about the effectiveness of the physical therapy to improve the functional deficiencies of individuals with PD. The EPG did not include the use of promising new intervention as virtual reality in PD due the lack of studies about its safety, feasibility and effectiveness. Therefore, this study protocol had as objective to evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of a physical therapy program-based on the European Physiotherapy Guideline (EPG) compared to Kinect-based training on postural control, gait, cognition, and quality of life (QoL) of Individuals with PD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A single-blind, parallel, randomized, controlled feasibility trial will be conducted with a sample of 32 individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD. Participants will be allocated into control group (CG) and experimental group (EG). The intervention of the CG will be conventional physical therapy, and the intervention of the EG will be a supervised practice of five Kinect games. Both groups will perform 14 sessions of 1 h each one, twice a week over 7 weeks. Process outcomes will be safety, feasibility, adherence, and acceptability. Safety will be assessed by the proportion of participants who experienced intervention-related adverse events or any serious adverse event during the study period. Feasibility will be assessed through the scores of the games recorded in all training sessions. Adherence will be assessed through the participant's attendance. Acceptability will be the motivation of the participants regarding the interventions. Clinical outcomes will be (1) postural control, (2) cognitive function, (3) balance, (4) gait, and (5) QoL. Individuals will be assessed pre- and post-interventions and after 30 days by a blinded evaluator.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This protocol will clarify if an intervention based on Kinect games will be feasible, safe, and acceptable for individuals with PD compared to conventional physical therapy. We will verify whether the proposed interventions can improve clinical outcomes as postural control, gait, cognition, and QoL of individuals with PD. Our hypothesis is that both Kinect games and conventional physical therapy will be feasible, safe, and acceptable for individuals with PD and will promote positive clinical effects. The results of this feasibility study will be used to design a future definitive clinical trial.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Unique identification number in WHO Trial Registration: U1111-1171-0371.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in a loss of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), which in turn affects the quality of life of affected people and places a burden on caretakers. Limited research has examined the influence of physical training (aerobic, balance, and strength training) on ADL performance of people with AD. METHOD. Six randomized controlled trials (total of 446 participants) fit the inclusion criteria. For each study, we calculated effect sizes for primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS. Average effect size (95% confidence interval) for exercise on the primary outcome (ADL performance) was 0.80 (p < .001). Exercise had a moderate impact on the secondary outcome of physical function (effect size = 0.53, p = .004). CONCLUSION. Occupational therapy intervention that includes aerobic and strengthening exercises may help improve independence in ADLs and improve physical performance in people with AD.

Yet, mechanistic interactions among key neurobiological factors linked to AD pathology are unclear. This study tested the effect of interactions between cerebrovascular function, individual genotype, and structural brain pathology on response inhibition performance, an early and sensitive indicator of cognitive executive dysfunction with aging. We quantified cerebrovascular response (CVR) to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise using transcranial doppler ultrasound and global amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition using positron emission tomography in a group of cognitively normal older adults genotyped as APOE4 carriers and noncarriers. We quantified response inhibition during a cognitive Stroop test. Individuals with blunted CVR possessed greater Aβ deposition. There was CVR-by-carrier status-by-Aβ interaction on response inhibition. Blunted CVR was associated with impaired response inhibition specifically in APOE4 carriers. Despite having greater Aβ deposition, APOE4 carriers with higher CVR demonstrated better response inhibition. Cerebrovascular interactions with individual genotype and structural brain pathology may provide a physiologically-informed target for precision-medicine approaches for early treatment and prevention of cognitive dysfunction with aging."

Some manufacturers recommend intermittent breaks to overcome these issues; however, limited evidence examining whether this is beneficial exists. The aim of this study was to examine whether taking breaks during VR gaming reduced its effect on postural sway during standing balance assessments. Twenty-five people participated in this crossover design study, performing 50 min of VR gaming either continuously or with intermittent 10 min exposure/rest intervals. Standing eyes open, two-legged balance assessments were performed immediately pre-, immediately post- and 40 min post-exposure. The primary outcome measure was total path length; secondary measures included independent axis path velocity, amplitude, standard deviation, discrete and continuous wavelet transform-derived variables, and detrended fluctuation analysis. Total path length was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced immediately post-VR gaming exposure in the intermittent rest break group both in comparison to within-condition baseline values and between-condition timepoint results. Conversely, it remained consistent across timepoints in the continuous exposure group. These changes consisted of a more clustered movement speed pattern about a lower central frequency, evidenced by signal frequency content. These findings indicate that caution is required before recommending rest breaks during VR exposure until we know more about how balance and falls risk are affected."

Regarding intervention effectiveness, muscle-strengthening (SMDs 0.87, 95% CI 0.31-1.43; rank 1), mind-body (0.76, 0.38-1.14; rank 2) and aerobic (0.34, 0.13-0.50; rank 3) were significantly better than the control group and there was no significant difference among these types of intervention . Cognitive intervention of rehearsal-based (1.33, 0.30-2.35; rank 1) and mixed (0.55, 0.00-1.11; rank 2) were significantly better than the control group and there was no significant difference among these types of intervention. Multicomponent intervention (0.32, 0.02-0.62) were significantly better than the control group but not better than the single component group. Regarding acceptability, there was no significant difference among types of intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Physical activity, cognitive, and multicomponent intervention could be provided regardless of their types and acceptability due to their effectiveness on improved cognitive function for people with MCI."

The primary outcome is walking speed. The secondary outcomes are walking endurance, disability status, and patient-reported outcomes of physical activity, walking impairment, fatigue, and quality of life. The components of the exercise program itself are similar between the groups and follow the Guidelines for Exercise in MS protocol. This includes a program manual, exercise prescription, exercise equipment, social-cognitive theory materials including newsletters, logs, and calendars, and one-on-one behavioral coaching by exercise specialists with background in MS. The main difference between groups is the coaching approach and setting for delivering the exercise training program. The outcomes will be collected by treatment-blinded assessors at baseline(week 0), mid-intervention(week 8), post-intervention(week 16), and follow-up(week 52).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The proposed study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of a novel, widely-scalable program for delivering exercise training in persons with MS who have walking dysfunction and mobility disability."

The carriage of cholesterol and lipids through the body is mediated via lipoproteins, some of which, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), are intimately linked with AD. In humans, high density lipoprotein (HDL) is regarded as a \"good\" lipid complex due to its ability to enable clearance of excess cholesterol via 'cholesterol reverse transport', although its activities in the pathogenesis of AD are poorly understood.

However, the efficacy of these interventions can vary widely, depending on the type, intensity, duration and frequency of exercise. (2) Aim: To systematically review the efficacy of exercise therapy on global cognition in patients with CI using a network meta-analysis (NMA). (3) Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Sport Discus (EBSCO) and Cochrane Library databases were electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on exercise for patients with CI from inception to 7 August 2022. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. The NMA was performed using the consistency model. (4) Results: A total of 29 RCTs comprising 2458 CI patients were included. The effects of different types of exercise on patients with CI were ranked as follows: multicomponent exercise (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.36, p = 0.002), short duration (≤45 min) (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.19, p = 0.001), vigorous intensity (SMD = 0.77, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.36, p = 0.011) and high frequency (5-7 times/week) (SMD = 1.28, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.14, p = 0.004).

After training, participants in the TT + VR arm had lower activation than the TT arm in Brodmann area 10 and the inferior frontal gyrus (cluster level familywise error-corrected [FWEcorr] p < 0.012), while the TT arm had lower activation than TT + VR in the cerebellum and middle temporal gyrus (cluster level FWEcorr p < 0.001). Changes in fall frequency and brain activation were correlated in the TT + VR arm.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Exercise modifies brain activation patterns in patients with PD in a mode-specific manner. Motor-cognitive training decreased the reliance on frontal regions, which apparently resulted in improved function, perhaps reflecting increased brain efficiency."

Older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are more likely to develop depression due to changes in family roles and separation from family members. The aim of this study was to synthesize and analyze the effects of different types of exercise and training duration on depressive symptoms of older adults in LTCFs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Relevant peer-reviewed journal articles published in English were identified through a search of six electronic databases up to June 2021.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 25 studies were included in the systematic review and 22 in the meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis showed that exercise interventions reduced depression in cognitively intact older adults and in cognitively impaired older adults. Both exercising less than 150 min per week or more than 150 min per week, reduced depressive symptoms of older adults. In terms of exercise types, mind-body exercises, exergames, and strength training reduced depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Exercise has a positive effect on reducing depressive symptoms with mind-body exercises, exergames, and strength training producing the best effect. Regardless of cognitive impairment, older adults in LTCFs benefited from exercise in reducing depressive symptoms."

The difference between intervention- and control groups shows a substantial meaningful change (>0.1 m/s). Secondly, a significant positive meta-effect of interventions with a rhythmic component on preferred gait speed of 0.07 [CI 95 % 0.03-0.10] m/s was found. Thirdly, there is a small significant positive meta-effect of progressive resistance training, combined with balance-, and endurance training of 0.05 [CI 95 % 0.00-0.09] m/s.

Sufficient muscle strength seems an important condition for improving preferred gait speed. The addition of balance-, and/or endurance training does not contribute to the significant positive effects of progressive resistance training. A promising component is exercise with a rhythmic component. Keeping time to music or rhythm possibly trains higher cognitive functions that are important for gait.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The focus of the present meta-analysis was at avoiding as much heterogeneity in exercise interventions.

            "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that both inhibition and decision-making deficits play essential roles in the development and maintenance of Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Clarifying whether impaired decision-making among individuals with IGD is related to poor inhibition will advance our understanding of IGD and contribute to intervention development. However, the relationship between these two functions remains unclear. In this study, we sought to systemically examine inhibitory processes, decision-making and the relationship between the two among individuals with IGD. Thirty-four individuals with IGD and 32 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. In comparison to HCs, IGD subjects demonstrated inhibition deficits during performance of the gaming-related Go/No-Go task and impaired decision-making under risk. In addition, errors on No-Go trials during the gaming-related Go/No-Go task were positively associated with decision-making impairments under risk but not under ambiguity among IGD subjects. These results suggest individuals with IGD are impaired in some aspects of inhibition and decision-making functions, and that decision-making deficits under risk are linked to poor inhibition specifically related to gaming cues, which has implications for the development of novel intervention."

Exercise used alongside virtual reality improves many cognitive functions, but effects on spatial navigation are still unclear. Objective: To investigate the effect of virtual reality-based physical exercise with 2D exergames on spatial navigation in institutionalized non-robust older persons. Method: A total of 14 older persons (aged ≧ 60) were randomly allocated to the exergame (EG) and active control (ACG) groups. EG performed exercises with 2D exergames, while the ACG used the same movements as the EG, but without the use of virtual reality. Spatial navigation was assessed through the Floor Maze Test, where the immediate maze time (IMT) and delayed maze time (DMT) were recorded. Results: Spatial navigation was enhanced in EG participants compared to ACG individuals.

            "abstract": "Individuals with cognitive impairments are evaluated using clinically validated cognitive assessment tools, which need to be administered by trained therapists. This serves as a major barrier for frequent and longitudinal monitoring of patients' cognitive impairment level. We introduce Neuro-World, a set of six mobile games designed to challenge visuospatial short-term memory and selective attention, which allows one to self-administer the assessment of his/her cognitive impairment level. Game performance is analyzed to estimate a widely accepted clinical measure, the mini mental state examination (MMSE), which highlights the translational impact of the system in real-world settings. We collected game-specific performance data from 12 post-stroke patients at baseline and a three-month follow-up, which were used to train supervised machine learning models to estimate the corresponding MMSE scores. The results presented herein show that the proposed approach can estimate the MMSE scores with a normalized root mean square error of 5.75%. We also validate the system's responsiveness to longitudinal changes in cognitive impairment level and demonstrate the system's positive usability in cognitively impaired individuals and their willingness to adhere to the longitudinal use. This study demonstrates that Neuro-world has great potential to be used to evaluate the cognitive impairment level and monitor its long-term change. This study enables new clinical and research opportunities for accurate, longitudinal assessment of cognitive function via mobile games."

Though many studies have highlighted navigation impairments for AD patients in virtual reality (VR) environments, the extent to which these impairments predict a patient's risk for spatial disorientation in the real world is still poorly understood. The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the spatial navigation abilities of AD patients in VR environments as well as in a real world community setting and (b) explore whether we could predict patients at a high risk for spatial disorientation in the community based on their VR navigation. Sixteen community-dwelling AD patients and 21 age/gender matched controls were assessed on their egocentric and allocentric navigation abilities in VR environments using the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST) and Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) as well as in the community using the Detour Navigation Test (DNT). When compared to controls, AD patients exhibited impairments on the VST, SHQ, and DNT. For patients, only SHQ wayfinding distance and wayfinding duration significantly predicted composite disorientation score on the DNT (β = 0.422, p = 0.034, R2 = 0.299 and β = 0.357, p = 0.046, R2 = 0.27 respectively). However, these same VR measures could not reliably predict which patients were at highest risk of spatial disorientation in the community (p > 0.1). Future studies should focus on developing VR-based tests which can predict AD patients at high risk of getting spatially disorientated in the real world."

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: The motor sequelae after a stroke are frequently persistent and cause a high degree of disability. Cortical ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes affecting the cortico-spinal pathways are known to cause a reduction of cortical excitability in the lesioned area not only for the local connectivity impairment but also due to a contralateral hemisphere inhibitory action. Non-invasive brain stimulation using high frequency repetitive magnetic transcranial stimulation (rTMS) over the lesioned hemisphere and contralateral cortical inhibition using low-frequency rTMS have been shown to increase the excitability of the lesioned hemisphere. Mental representation techniques, neurofeedback, and virtual reality have also been shown to increase cortical excitability and complement conventional rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: We aim to carry out a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial aiming to study the efficacy of immersive multimodal Brain-Computer Interfacing-Virtual Reality (BCI-VR) training after bilateral neuromodulation with rTMS on upper limb motor recovery after subacute stroke (>3 months) compared to neuromodulation combined with conventional motor imagery tasks. This study will include 42 subjects in a randomized controlled trial design. The main expected outcomes are changes in the Motricity Index of the Arm (MI), dynamometry of the upper limb, score according to Fugl-Meyer for upper limb (FMA-UE), and changes in the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The evaluation will be carried out before the intervention, after each intervention and 15 days after the last session. Conclusions: This trial will show the additive value of VR immersive motor imagery as an adjuvant therapy combined with a known effective neuromodulation approach opening new perspectives for clinical rehabilitation protocols."

Cognitive function was assessed before and after intervention using a battery of neuropsychological tests including the minimental state examination (MMSE). A significant training effect was identified only after the combined training scheme: a decrease in the post- compared to pre-training activity of precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in delta, theta, and beta bands.

We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Seventeen trials with 1067 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three included trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration, and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home.Our meta-analysis revealed that there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on cognitive functioning. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.43 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.92, P value 0.08; 9 studies, 409 participants). There was very substantial heterogeneity in this analysis (I² value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. We found a benefit of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs in six trials with 289 participants. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.68 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.27, P value 0.02). However, again we observed considerable unexplained heterogeneity (I² value 77%) in this meta-analysis, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these findings.In further analyses, in one trial we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program. The mean difference between exercise and control groups was -15.30 (95% CI -24.73 to -5.87; 1 trial, 40 participants; P value 0.001). There was no apparent risk of bias in this study. In addition, there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on neuropsychiatric symptoms (MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.22 to 3.02; 1 trial, 110 participants; P value .0.75), or depression (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.36; 5 trials, 341 participants; P value 0.16).

A study with a mixed methods design was conducted with nine older adults diagnosed with dementia. Interventions consisted of four sessions, in which the participants' engagement, psychological and behavioral symptoms, and simulation sickness symptoms were evaluated. Neuropsychiatric symptomatology and quality of life were measured pre- and post-intervention. Caregivers were interviewed regarding the effect of the approach. In most cases, participants appeared to enjoy the sessions, actively explored the 360° environment, and shared memories associated with the depicted locations, often spontaneously. There were no cases of significant increases in simulator sickness and psychological and behavioral symptoms during sessions, with only some instances of minor eyestrain, fullness of head, anxiety, irritability, and agitation being detected. Although there were no significant changes in the measured outcomes after intervention, the caregivers assessed the experience as potentially beneficial for most participants. In this study, promoting reminiscences with VR headsets was found to be a safe and engaging experience for people with dementia. However, future studies are required to better understand the added value of immersion, using VR, in reminiscence therapy."

            "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) technologies have shown promising potential in the early diagnosis of dementia by enabling accessible and regular assessment. However, previous VR studies were restricted to the analysis of behavioral responses, so information about degenerated brain dynamics could not be directly acquired. To address this issue, we provide a cognitive impairment (CI) screening tool based on a wearable EEG device integrated into a VR platform. Subjects were asked to use a hardware setup consisting of a frontal six-channel EEG device mounted on a VR device and to perform four cognitive tasks in VR. Behavioral response profiles and EEG features were extracted during the tasks, and classifiers were trained on extracted features to differentiate subjects with CI from healthy controls (HCs). Notably, the performance of the patient classification consistently improved when EEG characteristics measured during cognitive tasks were additionally included in feature attributes than when only the task scores or resting-state EEG features were used, suggesting that our protocol provides discriminative information for screening. These results propose that the integration of EEG devices into a VR framework could emerge as a powerful and synergistic strategy for constructing an easily accessible EEG-based CI screening tool."

Cognitive functions (attention, executive function, processing speed, visuospatial skill, and memory), gait speed, and demographic variables were measured. All cognitive functions and gait speed were associated with the IGF-1 level (p < 0.001). The association of IGF-1 with slow gait was weakened by adjustment for covariates, but MCI and the combination of MCI and slow gait were independently related to the IGF-1 level in multivariate analysis (p < 0.05).

So far, there are no satisfactory pharmacological approaches to address cognitive symptoms. For some time now, aerobic exercise has been demonstrated in various trials to be a promising candidate for this indication.

Additionally, we give a short overview of the effects in other conditions, like healthy subjects and patients with major depression. We conducted a focused literature search using the PubMed database, concentrating on meta-analyses which are based on a systematic search. The most recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of aerobic exercise on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia patients provides evidence that exercise has positive effects on cognitive functioning in this population. However, the effect seems not to be specific; there were positive findings regarding healthy subjects and patients with depressive disorders as well, even if they were less consistent. As most available trials have a small to modest sample size and have no consensus with regard to the intervention regime, nor to the assessment of cognition, the findings are difficult to generalize. In the future, standardized clinical trials focusing on the long-term effects of exercise are needed to evaluate whether the improvements in cognition are sustainable. ."

Impairment in cognitive function, especially in executive function, is common in patients with ESKD, and may worsen with maintenance dialysis as a result of retention of uremic toxins, recurrent cerebral ischemia, and high burden of inactivity. Cognitive impairment may lead to long-term adverse consequences, including dementia and death. Home-based and intradialytic exercise training (ET) are among the nonpharmacologic interventions identified to preserve cognitive function in ESKD. Additionally, cognitive training (CT) is an effective approach recently identified in this population. While short-term benefits of ET and CT on cognitive function were consistently observed in patients undergoing dialysis, more studies are needed to replicate these findings in diverse populations including kidney transplant recipients with long-term follow-up to better understand the health and quality of life consequences of these promising interventions. ET as well as CT are feasible interventions that may preserve or even improve cognitive function for patients with ESKD. Whether these interventions translate to improvements in quality of life and long-term health outcomes, including dementia prevention and better survival, are yet to be determined."

We collected 36 studies that used VR to provide clinical trials or therapies for patients with psychiatric disorders. In order to gain a better understanding of the management of pain and stress, we first investigate VR applications for patients to alleviate pain and stress during immersive activities in a virtual environment. VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that, exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression, cognition, even social functions. We review empirical evidence from VR-based treatments on psychiatric illnesses such as dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), schizophrenia and autism. Through cognitive training and social skill training, rehabilitation through VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Recent advances in VR technology also demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive and functional impairments in dementia. In terms of the different types of VR systems, we discuss the feasibility of the technology within different stages of dementia as well as the methodological limitations. Although there is room for improvement, its widespread adoption in psychiatry is yet to occur due to technical drawbacks such as motion sickness and dry eyes, as well as user issues such as preoccupation and addiction. However, it is worth mentioning that VR systems relatively easily deliver virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. In the future, VR systems may become an innovative clinical tool for patients with specific psychiatric symptoms."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Physical activity is linked to benefits such as increased physical fitness, cognition, emotional and social functioning, general health and well-being in older people. Some evidence suggests that this also applies to people living with dementia. However, it can be harder for them to perform physical activities, due to several barriers, such as issues with orientation and balance problems. A relatively new type of physical activity called exergaming may help them overcome these barriers. Exergaming is \"physical exercise interactively combined with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment\". The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exergaming compared to regular activities in people living with dementia, who attend day-care centres. Additionally, we want to investigate whether the exergaming activity for the person living with dementia, also (indirectly) affects the informal caregiver, as well as which facilitators and barriers to implementation of exergames for this target group exist.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), with economic and process evaluations alongside will be carried out.

The study group will consist of 224 dyads (community-dwelling participants with dementia and their informal caregivers), who are interviewed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The participant with dementia has to visit the day-care centre for at least two days per week, have a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia and have an informal caregiver present, who is willing to participate. Societal cost data will be collected during interviews, using healthcare utilization diaries, and from day-care centres.

We examined the frequency of participation in leisure activities at enrollment and derived cognitive-activity and physical-activity scales in which the units of measure were activity-days per week. Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to evaluate the risk of dementia according to the base-line level of participation in leisure activities, with adjustment for age, sex, educational level, presence or absence of chronic medical illnesses, and base-line cognitive status.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Over a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, dementia developed in 124 subjects (Alzheimer's disease in 61 subjects, vascular dementia in 30, mixed dementia in 25, and other types of dementia in 8).

We checked bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, and contacted professional associations, educational programmes and experts from around the world.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, including cross-over design and cluster-RCTs for inclusion. Studies considered had to include people with dementia, in any age group and in any setting, with interventions delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The two review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 102 studies identified through electronic searches and personal communication, after de-duplication we screened 80 at title/abstract level. We then reviewed 19 full papers, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Although three studies mentioned dance movement therapy as their intervention, they were excluded because they were not delivered by a qualified dance movement therapy practitioner. As a result, no studies were included in this review.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The functional connectivity and structural proximity of elements of the language and motor systems result in frequent co-morbidity post brain injury. Although rehabilitation services are becoming increasingly multidisciplinary and \"integrated\", treatment for language and motor functions often occurs in isolation. Thus, behavioural therapies which promote neural reorganisation do not reflect the high intersystem connectivity of the neurologically intact brain. As such, there is a pressing need for rehabilitation tools which better reflect and target the impaired cognitive networks.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this research is to develop a combined high dosage therapy tool for language and motor rehabilitation. The rehabilitation therapy tool developed, MaLT (Motor and Language Therapy), comprises a suite of computer games targeting both language and motor therapy that use the Kinect sensor as an interaction device. The games developed are intended for use in the home environment over prolonged periods of time. In order to track patients' engagement with the games and their rehabilitation progress, the game records patient performance data for the therapist to interrogate.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      MaLT incorporates Kinect-based games, a database of objects and language parameters, and a reporting tool for therapists. Games have been developed that target four major language therapy tasks involving single word comprehension, initial phoneme identification, rhyme identification and a naming task. These tasks have 8 levels each increasing in difficulty. A database of 750 objects is used to programmatically generate appropriate questions for the game, providing both targeted therapy and unique gameplay every time. The design of the games has been informed by therapists and by discussions with a Public Patient Involvement (PPI) group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pilot MaLT trials have been conducted with three stroke survivors for the duration of 6 to 8 weeks. Patients' performance is monitored through MaLT's reporting facility presented as graphs plotted from patient game data. Performance indicators include reaction time, accuracy, number of incorrect responses and hand use. The resultant games have also been tested by the PPI with a positive response and further suggestions for future modifications made.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      MaLT provides a tool that innovatively combines motor and language therapy for high dosage rehabilitation in the home. It has demonstrated that motion sensor technology can be successfully combined with a language therapy task to target both upper limb and linguistic impairment in patients following brain injury. The initial studies on stroke survivors have demonstrated that the combined therapy approach is viable and the outputs of this study will inform planned larger scale future trials."

The FIT-AD trial was a single blind, 2-parallel group, pilot randomized controlled trial. The aerobic exercise group participated in a 6-month, thrice weekly, moderate-vigorous intensity cycling intervention while control group performed stretching. Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by peak oxygen consumption from cardiopulmonary exercise test and peak walking distance from the shuttle walk test and 6-minute walk test. Aerobic exercise dose was calculated using the novel heart rate physical activity score. The aerobic exercise group significantly increased peak oxygen consumption (1.28 ml/kg/min; p=0.03) in subgroup who achieved maximal criteria on cardiopulmonary exercise test. Changes in peak oxygen consumption and peak walking distance on the shuttle walk and 6-minute walk tests did not significantly differ between aerobic exercise and stretching groups. Notably, the aerobic exercise dose was strongly and significantly correlated to change in peak oxygen consumption (r=0.60; n=16; p=0.01), in subset who met maximal test criteria.

We analyzed a sub-sample of CHS participants 876 subjects (mean age 78.3, 57.5% F, 42.5% M) who had i) energy output assessed as kilocalories (kcal) per week using the standardized Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities questionnaire, ii) cognitive assessments for clinical classification of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and iii) volumetric MR imaging of the brain. Voxel-based morphometry modeled the relationship between kcal/week and GM volumes while accounting for standard covariates including head size, age, sex, white matter hyperintensity lesions, MCI or AD status, and site. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a False Discovery Rate of 5 percent.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Higher energy output, from a variety of physical activity types, was associated with larger GM volumes in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia.

            "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) share clinical and pathological similarities. The defining features are motor parkinsonism and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by visual hallucinations, fluctuating consciousness, autonomic and sleep disturbances, and a number of other non-motor symptoms. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be identified in 15% of PD patients at time of diagnosis, and may even precede motor symptoms. MCI usually progresses further, and dementia is a common endpoint. Cognitive impairment is usually the initial symptom of DLB, and the disease course is severe. A variety of biomarkers can assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of PD and DLB, including structural and functional imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and EEG. Compared to the many treatments available for motor symptoms, relatively few systematic studies exist to guide the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD, and even less in DLB. However, there is good evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors in both DLB and PD with dementia, and some indications that memantine is helpful. Emerging evidence suggest that physical exercise and cognitive training are also effective, as are some reports of various brain stimulation techniques. Disease-modifying agents that delay the rate of cognitive decline in PD and DLB are urgently needed."

The IG underwent balance training (4 wk, twice a week) that included weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing. Real-time visual/audio lower-limb motion feedback was provided from wearable sensors. The CG received no training. User experience was measured by a questionnaire. Postintervention effects on balance (center of mass sway during standing with eyes open [EO] and eyes closed), gait (speed, variability), cognition, and fear of falling were measured. Eleven participants (92%) completed the training and expressed fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor feedback. Sway (EO, p = 0.04) and fear of falling (p = 0.02) were reduced in the IG compared to the CG. Changes in other measures were nonsignificant. Results suggest that the sensor-based training paradigm is well accepted in the target population and beneficial for improving postural control.

            "abstract": "The entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to exhibit neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, and as such identification of entorhinal cortex dysfunction may aid detection of the disease in its earliest stages. Extensive evidence demonstrates that the entorhinal cortex is critically implicated in navigation underpinned by the firing of spatially modulated neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that entorhinal-based navigation is impaired in pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease. Forty-five patients with mild cognitive impairment (26 with CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarker data: 12 biomarker-positive and 14 biomarker-negative) and 41 healthy control participants undertook an immersive virtual reality path integration test, as a measure of entorhinal-based navigation. Behavioural performance was correlated with MRI measures of entorhinal cortex volume, and the classification accuracy of the path integration task was compared with a battery of cognitive tests considered sensitive and specific for early Alzheimer's disease. Biomarker-positive patients exhibited larger errors in the navigation task than biomarker-negative patients, whose performance did not significantly differ from controls participants. Path-integration performance correlated with Alzheimer's disease molecular pathology, with levels of CSF amyloid-β and total tau contributing independently to distance error. Path integration errors were negatively correlated with the volumes of the total entorhinal cortex and of its posteromedial subdivision. The path integration task demonstrated higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for differentiating biomarker positive versus negative patients (area under the curve = 0.90) than was achieved by the best of the cognitive tests (area under the curve = 0.57). This study demonstrates that an entorhinal cortex-based virtual reality navigation task can differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment at low and high risk of developing dementia, with classification accuracy superior to reference cognitive tests considered to be highly sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease. This study provides evidence that navigation tasks may aid early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and the basis of this in animal cellular and behavioural studies provides the opportunity to answer the unmet need for translatable outcome measures for comparing treatment effect across preclinical and clinical trial phases of future anti-Alzheimer's drugs."

            "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is highly prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise training represents a promising approach for managing this clinical symptom of the disease. However, results from early randomized controlled trials of exercise on cognition in MS are equivocal, perhaps due to methodological concerns. This underscores the importance of considering the well-established literature in the general population that documents robust, beneficial effects of exercise training on cognition across the lifespan. The development of such successful interventions is based on examinations of fitness, physical activity, and acute exercise effects on cognition. Applying such an evidence-based approach in MS serves as a way of better informing exercise training interventions for improving cognition in this population. To that end, this paper provides a focused, updated review on the evidence describing exercise effects on cognition in MS, and develops a rationale and framework for examining acute exercise on cognitive outcomes in this population. This will provide keen insight for better developing exercise interventions for managing cognitive impairment in MS."

            "abstract": "Background: Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) are catastrophic. Whether they arise from natural or man-made disasters, the nature of such incidents and the multiple casualties involved can rapidly overwhelm response personnel. Mass-casualty triage training is traditionally taught via either didactic lectures or table top exercises. This training fails to provide an opportunity for practical application or experiential learning in immersive conditions. Further, large-scale simulations are heavily resource-intensive, logistically challenging, require the coordination and time of multiple personnel, and are costly to replicate. This study compared the simulation efficacy of a bespoke virtual-reality (VR) MCI simulation with an equivalent live simulation scenario designed for undergraduate paramedicine students. Methods: Both simulations involved ten injured patients resulting from a police car chase and shooting. Twenty-nine second-year paramedicine students completed the live and VR simulation in a random order. The training efficacy of the VR and live simulation was evaluated with respect to student immersion and task-difficulty, clinical decision-making (i.e. triage card allocation accuracy and timeliness), learning satisfaction, and cost of delivery. Results: While perceived physical demand was higher in the live simulation compared to VR (p < 0.001), no differences were observed across mental demand, temporal demand, performance, effort or frustration domains. No differences were found for participant satisfaction across the two platforms. No differences were observed in the number of triage cards correctly allocated to patients in each platform. However, participants were able to allocate cards far quicker in VR (p < .001). Cost of running the VR came to AUD $712.04 (staff time), compared to the live simulations which came to AUD $9,413.71 (staff time, moulage, actors, director, prop vehicle), approximately 13 times more expensive. Conclusion: The VR simulation provided near identical simulation efficacy for paramedicine students compared to the live simulation. VR MCI training resources represent an exciting new direction for authentic and cost-effective education and training for medical professionals."

If untreated early, 39.2% of people with mild cognitive impairment could progress to develop dementia. However, there are currently no approved pharmacological interventions to treat the condition, which lead researchers to explore non-pharmacological options, such as dance therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness of dance interventions on cognition, neuroplasticity, physical function, depression, and quality of life in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seven databases were systematically searched from their respective inception dates to 31 March 2020.

Computing technology such as virtual reality (VR) may have the potential to assist rehabilitation in shaping brain health. However, little is known about the potential of VR-based physical and cognitive training designed as an intervention for cognition and brain activation in elderly patients with MCI. Moreover, whether a VR program designed around functional tasks can improve their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) requires further investigation.\n## AIM\nThis study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of VR-based physical and cognitive training on cognitive function, brain activation and IADL and compared the VR intervention with combined physical and cognitive training.\n## DESIGN\nA single-blinded randomized controlled trial.\n## SETTING\nCommunities and day care centers in Taipei, Taiwan.\n## POPULATION\nOlder adults with mild cognitive impairment.\n## METHODS\nThirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomized into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assessed for their cognitive function (global cognition, executive function and verbal memory) and IADL at pre- and postintervention. Changes in prefrontal cortex activation during the global cognition test were also captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify the potential mediating pathway of the intervention.\n## RESULTS\nBoth groups showed improved executive function and verbal memory (immediate recall). However, only the VR group showed significant improvements in global cognition (P<0.001), verbal memory (delayed recall, P=0.002), and IADL (P<0.001) after the intervention. The group × time interaction effects further demonstrated that IADL were more significantly improved with VR training than with CPC training (P=0.006). The hemodynamic data revealed decreased activation in prefrontal areas after training (P=0.0015), indicative of increased neural efficiency, in the VR-trained subjects.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nVR-based physical and cognitive training improves cognitive function, IADL and neural efficiency in older adults with MCI.\n## CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT\nVR training could be implemented for older adults with MCI.\n"

Our structured review presents an up-to-date summary of the technological solutions for the (i) diagnosis, (ii) management and (iii) treatment of AD-related symptoms. To this end, we searched electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) for studies published over the last 10 years. Two authors of the review extracted data of interest. A total of eight manuscripts were included. In the last decade, a series of technological solutions across AD stages have been proposed. These include: (i) innovative strategies for the early detection of deficits in finger dexterity, visuo-spatial abilities (including spatial navigation), divided attention and instrumental autonomy; (ii) tools to activate the patient's responsiveness in terms of alertness and mood improvement; and (iii) useful interventions for retrieving memories, increasing body movements and improving spatial cognition. Methodological limitations, mainly pertaining to the paucity of randomized controlled trials and comprehensive assessments, were observed. Advances in technology currently provide the potential for designing innovative methods for evaluating, controlling and handling AD-related symptoms.

Recent investigations have proposed that an individualised exercise prescription based on ventilatory thresholds is more effective than a standardised prescription in improving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), a key mediator of FFI. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of individualised versus standardised exercise prescription on FFI in sedentary adults. Thirty-eight sedentary individuals were randomised to 12-weeks of: (1) individualised exercise training using ventilatory thresholds (n = 19) or (2) standardised exercise training using a percentage of heart rate reserve (n = 19). A convenience sample was also recruited as a control group (n=8). Participants completed CRF exercise training three days per week, for 12-weeks on a motorised treadmill. FFI was calculated as CRF in metabolic equivalents (METs), divided by fatness determined by waist to height ratio (WtHR). A graded exercise test was used to measure CRF, and anthropometric measures (height and waist circumference) were assessed to ascertain WtHR. There was a difference in FFI change between study groups, whilst controlling for baseline FFI, F (2, 42) = 19.382 p < .001, partial η2 = 0.480. The magnitude of FFI increase from baseline was significantly higher in the individualised (+15%) compared to the standardised (+10%) (p = 0.028) and control group (+4%) (p = <.001). The main finding of the present study is that individualised exercise prescription had the greatest effect on improving FFI in sedentary adults compared to a standardised prescription. Therefore, an individualised based exercise prescription should be considered a viable and practical method of improving FFI in sedentary adults."

Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous cognitive-physical programs were found in two dimensions of executive function. \"Shifting attention\" showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY versus PHYS (F[2, 68] =1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and \"working memory\" showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136] =2.71, trend P=0.051, R (2)=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at follow-up in all groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Particular executive functions benefit from simultaneous cognitive-physical training compared to exclusively physical multicomponent training. Cognitive-physical training programs may counteract widespread cognitive impairments in the elderly."

            "abstract": "The population of older adults is increasing, as is the number of older adults with dementia. However, there is a lack of integrative interventions that include both cognitive training and physical exercise for older adults with dementia. The current study conducted a 12-week integrated program for older adults with low education and mild dementia; the study modified the contents developed by the National Dementia Institute. Effects of the integrated program were examined in 30 participants (16 from the experimental group and 14 from the control group). Analysis showed that the tailored integrated program increased the cognitive function of participants in the experimental group. The findings of this study suggest that using therapeutic strategies and providing person-centered care are necessary for older adults with low educational backgrounds and low literacy levels.

            "abstract": "Analyzing the effects landmarks have on spatial learning is an active area of research in the study of human navigation processes and one that is key to understanding the links between human brain dynamics, landmark encoding, and spatial learning outcomes. This article presents a study on whether electroencephalography (EEG) signals related to virtual global landmarks combined with deep learning can be used to predict the accuracy and efficacy of spatial learning. Virtual global landmarks are silhouettes of actual landmarks projected into the navigator's vision via a heads-up display. They serve as a notable frame of reference in addition to the local landmarks we all typically use for route navigation. From a mobile virtual reality scenario involving 55 participants, the results of the study suggest that the EEG data associated with those who were exposed to global landmarks shows a visibly better capacity for predicting the quality of spatial learning levels than those who were not. As such, the EEG features associated with processing VGLs have a greater functional relation to the quality of spatial learning. This finding opens up a future direction of enquiry into landmark encoding and navigational ability. It may also provide a potential avenue for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease."

Engaging in cognitive challenges and physical exercises is effective in reducing age-related cognitive and physical decline. It is believed that physical activity in the context of cognitive challenges might enhance the process of neurogenesis in the adult brain, but how effective are such interventions? Is there enough evidence to support that dual-task training is more effective than cognitive or physical training alone?

Participants were assigned to either the MedWalk intervention or a control group (maintaining their usual diet and physical activity). The primary outcome is 12-month change in visual memory and learning assessed from errors on the Paired Associates Learning Task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Secondary outcomes include cognition, mood, cardiovascular function, biomarkers related to nutrient status and cognitive decline, MI-CBT effectiveness, Mediterranean diet adherence, physical activity, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and health economic evaluation.Progress and Discussion:Although COVID-19 impacts over two years necessitated a reduced timeline and sample size, MedWalk retains sufficient power to address its aims and hypotheses. Baseline testing has been completed with 157 participants, who will be followed over 12 months. If successful, MedWalk will inform interventions that could substantially reduce dementia incidence and ameliorate cognitive decline in the community.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ANZCTR 12620000978965 (https://www.anzctr.org.au)."
