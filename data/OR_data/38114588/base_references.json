            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Digital applications are commonly used to support mental health and well-being. However, successfully retaining and engaging users to complete digital interventions is challenging, and comorbidities such as chronic pain further reduce user engagement. Digital conversational agents (CAs) may improve user engagement by applying engagement principles that have been implemented within in-person care settings.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate user retention and engagement with an artificial intelligence-led digital mental health app (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that is customized for individuals managing mental health symptoms and coexisting chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this ancillary survival analysis of a clinical trial, participants included 51 adults who presented to a tertiary care center for chronic musculoskeletal pain, who endorsed coexisting symptoms of depression or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System score of ≥55 for depression or anxiety), and initiated onboarding to an 8-week subscription of Wysa for Chronic Pain. The study outcomes were user retention, defined as revisiting the app each week and on the last day of engagement, and user engagement, defined by the number of sessions the user completed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Users engaged in a cumulative mean of 33.3 sessions during the 8-week study period. The survival analysis depicted a median user retention period (i.e., time to complete disengagement) of 51 days, with the usage of a morning check-in feature having a significant relationship with a longer retention period (P=.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that user retention and engagement with a CBT-based CA built for users with chronic pain is higher than standard industry metrics. These results have clear implications for addressing issues of suboptimal engagement of digital health interventions and improving access to care for chronic pain. Future work should use these findings to inform the design of evidence-based interventions for individuals with chronic pain and to enhance user retention and engagement of digital health interventions more broadly.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04640090; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04640090."

The literature search was performed in June 2021 in PubMed, Central Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Scopus, and Google Scholar; without restrictions in language or publication date. Two independent authors identified studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted the data. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Whenever possible, meta-analyses were performed.

            "abstract": "Social interaction requires fast and efficient processing of another person's intentions. In face-to-face interactions, aversive or appetitive actions typically co-occur with emotional expressions, allowing an observer to anticipate action intentions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of facial emotions on the processing of action intentions. Thirty-two participants were presented with video clips showing virtual agents displaying a facial emotion (angry vs. happy) while performing an action (punch vs. fist-bump) directed towards the observer. During each trial, video clips stopped at varying durations of the unfolding action, and participants had to recognize the presented action. Naturally, participants' recognition accuracy improved with increasing duration of the unfolding actions. Interestingly, while facial emotions did not influence accuracy, there was a significant influence on participants' action judgements. Participants were more likely to judge a presented action as a punch when agents showed an angry compared to a happy facial emotion. This effect was more pronounced in short video clips, showing only the beginning of an unfolding action, than in long video clips, showing near-complete actions. These results suggest that facial emotions influence anticipatory processing of action intentions allowing for fast and adaptive responses in social interactions."

            "abstract": "Physician assistants in the Phoenix Veterans Administration Health Care System (PVAHCS) undertook a process improvement project addressing the need for over-the-counter (OTC) medication counseling for diabetic patients. Within the framework of the Kidneys-in-a-Box (KIB) program, published by the National Academy of Nephrology PAs, participants examined current practices for the six modifiable factors outlined in the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Chart review by PVAHCS found a significant lack in OTC medication education, with less than 10% of reviewed patients having been counseled on medications that may affect kidney function. OTC medication counseling and distribution of a brochure developed for the project were implemented over a three-month time frame in the daily practices of the participating PAs and the PVAHCS Nephrology Clinic. Post project chart review of 110 patient records found a statistically significant increase in patient education (50.9%). While the change in PA behavior is significant, the goal of the project moving forward is to show impact on incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the diabetic veteran population."

Anxiety can make life challenging, leading to withdrawal. Cognitive therapy, using active in vivo learning, enables people to overcome fears. These treatments are not readily available to people with psychosis. Automated virtual reality (VR) therapy is a potential route to increase accessibility. The gameChange automated VR cognitive therapy is designed to help people overcome anxious avoidance and build confidence in everyday social situations. A virtual coach guides the person through the treatment. Understanding user experience is key to facilitating future implementation. Peer research methods, in which people with lived experience of the issues being studied are involved in collecting and analyzing data, may be useful in developing this understanding.

One is a peer researcher with similar lived experience to the trial participants. The other has lived experiences of mental health issues that do not directly overlap with those of the trial participants. Interview questions will focus on an individual's experience of anxious social avoidance, experiences of participating in the gameChange VR therapy, and any changes or impact following therapy. The interview schedule was developed in collaboration with the gameChange Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP), comprising 10 project advisors with lived experience of psychosis.

Each of these methods has specific advantages, but also specific drawbacks that can result in discontinuation of treatment if users are not given adequate information about what to expect in terms of side effects. It is critical that clinicians provide adequate and accurate information along with detailed counseling to women who are considering using POCs, as well as providing periodic reinforcement of the information at regular clinic visits for those already using POCs.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      Given that a large number of pregnancies are unplanned and create a significant impact on social, economic, and health outcomes, it is important for the clinician to have a vast knowledge of contraceptive options.

We found that zebrafish in anxiolytic and anxious states, which are induced by acute and chronic repeated alcohol exposure, respectively, display distinct emotional reactions in light/dark preference tests as well as distinct learning and memory abilities in color-enhanced conditional place preference (CPP) tests. Additionally, compared with the chronic alcohol (1.0%) treatment, acute alcohol exposure had a significant, dose-dependent effect on anxiety, learning and memory (color preference) as well as locomotive activities. Acute exposure doses (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) generated an \"inverted V\" dose-dependent pattern in all of the behavioral parameters, with 1.0% having the greatest effect, while the chronic treatment had a moderate effect. Furthermore, by measuring locomotive activity, learning and memory performance, the number of dopaminergic neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and the change in the photoreceptors in the retina, we found that acute and chronic alcohol exposure induced varying degrees of Parkinson-like symptoms in zebrafish. Taken together, these results illuminated the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying the changes associated with learning and memory and the cause of potential Parkinson-like behaviors in zebrafish due to acute and chronic alcohol exposure."

            "abstract": "This study explored some quandaries concerning craving and mood as motivators to smoke. Craving and negative mood have long been associated with day-to-day smoking as two of the primary motivational forces behind the maintenance of the behavior, as well as significant barriers in smokers' attempts to quit. Craving remains a clinically relevant phenomenon, with most smokers describing craving as a troublesome problem when quitting. Smokers' self-reports of negative mood, as an antecedent for smoking, are so robustly reported that many models of nicotine dependence have incorporated a critical role for negative mood in maintaining smoking behavior. However, several naturalistic studies that collected mood ratings with hand held computers from smokers in real time, just before smoking a cigarette, have provided scant evidence that negative mood plays a major role in motivation to smoke. No study to date has examined craving and mood data as a consequence of smoking, that is, collecting the same data immediately after smoking. This study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) to collect craving and mood data immediately before smoking, immediately after smoking, and at random times of day. Nontreatment seeking smokers (N = 72) carried a PDA for an average of 10 days while they recorded their smoking behavior. Results showed that craving and negative mood ratings were lowest immediately after smoking compared with immediately before smoking and at random times of day. These findings suggest that smokers may be at least partially motivated to smoke to lower their craving and improve their mood states."

However, how immersion, Virtual Environment contents, and sense of presence (SoP) influence emotional responses remains to be clarified to efficiently foster positive emotions. Consequently, a total of 26 participants (16 women, 10 men, 22.73 ± 2.69 years old) were exposed to 360-degree videos of natural and social contents on both a highly immersive Head-Mounted Display and a low immersive computer screen. Subjective emotional responses and SoP were assessed after each video using self-reports, while a wearable wristband collected continuously electrodermal activity and heart rate to record physiological emotional responses. Findings supported the added value of immersion, as more positive emotions and greater subjective arousal were reported after viewing the videos in the highly immersive setting, regardless of the video contents. In addition to usually employed natural contents, the findings also provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of social contents in eliciting positive emotions. Finally, structural equation models shed light on the indirect effect of immersion, through spatial and spatial SoP on subjective arousal. Overall, these are encouraging results about the effectiveness of VR for fostering positive emotions. Future studies should further investigate the influence of user characteristics on VR experiences to foster efficiently positive emotions among a broad range of potential users."

Consequences, while globally severe, are acutely pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) confronting pronounced gaps in resources and clinician accessibility. Social robots are well-recognized for their potential to support mental health, yet user compliance (i.e., trust) demands seamless affective human-robot interactions; natural 'human-like' conversations are required in simple, inexpensive, deployable platforms. We present the design, development, and pilot testing of a multimodal robotic framework fusing verbal (contextual speech) and nonverbal (facial expressions) social cues, aimed to improve engagement in human-robot interaction and ultimately facilitate mental health telemedicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the design optimization of a hybrid face robot, which combines digital facial expressions based on mathematical affect space mapping with static 3D facial features. We further introduce a contextual virtual assistant with integrated cloud-based AI coupled to the robot's facial representation of emotions, such that the robot adapts its emotional response to users' speech in real-time. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions. When separated, stern and disgusted are occasionally transposed (70%+ accuracy overall) but are easily distinguishable from other emotions. A qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework. The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs. The mechanically simple and low-cost social robot has been deployed in pilot tests to support older individuals and PwD at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, India. A procedure for deployment addressing challenges in cultural acceptance, end-user acclimatization and resource allocation is further introduced. Results indicate strong promise to stimulate human-robot psychosocial interaction through the hybrid-face robotic system. Future work is targeting deployment for telemedicine to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults and PwD in both LMICs and higher income regions."

As appetite is a key PRO associated with eating behaviors, this study was done to develop an EMA scale to evaluate the within-individual variation of momentary appetite and uses this scale to discuss the relationships between appetite and various psychological factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty healthy participants (age 23.6 ± 4.2 years old) wore a watch-type computer for a week. Several times a day, including just before and after meals, they recorded their momentary psychological stress, mood states, and ten items related to appetite. In addition, they recorded everything they ate and drank into a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based food diary. Multilevel factor analysis was used to investigate the factor structure of the scale, and the reliability and validity of the scale were also explored.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Multilevel factor analyses found two factors at the within-individual level (hunger/fullness and cravings) and one factor at the between-individual level. Medians for the individually calculated Cronbach's alphas were 0.89 for hunger/fullness, 0.71 for cravings, and 0.86 for total appetite (the sum of all items). Hunger/fullness, cravings, and total appetite all decreased significantly after meals compared with those before meals, and hunger/fullness, cravings, and total appetite before meals were positively associated with energy intake. There were significant negative associations between both hunger/fullness and total appetite and anxiety and depression as well as between cravings, and depression, anxiety and stress.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The within-individual reliability of the EMA scale to assess momentary appetite was confirmed in most subjects and it was also validated as a useful tool to understand eating behaviors in daily settings. Further refinement of the scale is necessary and further investigations need to be conducted, particularly on clinical populations."

            "abstract": "During social interactions, actions and words can be expressed in different ways, for example gently, vigorously or rudely communicating the positive or negative attitude of the agent. These forms of communication are called vitality forms and play a crucial role in social relations. While the neural bases of speech and actions vitality forms have been investigated, there is no information on how we recognize others' mood/attitude by hearing the sound of their actions. In the present fMRI study we investigated the neural basis of vitality forms while participants heard action sounds in two different conditions: sounds resulting from gentle and rude actions, sounds communicating the same actions without vitality forms (control stimuli). Results showed that hearing action sounds conveying rude and gentle vitality forms respect to the control stimuli produced a specific activation of the dorso-central insula. In addition, hearing both vitality forms action sounds and control stimuli produced the activation of the parieto-frontal circuit typically involved in the observation and the execution of arm actions. In conclusion, our data indicate that, the dorso-central insula is a key region involved in the processing of vitality forms regardless of the modality by which they are conveyed."

            "abstract": "Women living with HIV (WLWH) have lower employment rates and more difficulty finding and keeping employment compared with their counterparts without HIV. These disparities affect physical, psychological, and socioeconomic outcomes, and they may compound the disadvantages associated with living with HIV. Although historical literature has emphasized the impact of clinical factors on employment, current evidence suggests that socioeconomic and psychosocial factors associated with HIV should be included for a more comprehensive view. Based on this broader inclusion, a conceptual framework is presented describing how socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics influence employment acquisition and maintenance among WLWH. The framework posits that there is a reciprocal relationship between employment acquisition and occupational productivity, and psychological health, physical health, social support, and empowerment. Implications for future research and interventions include (a) an extended conceptualization of vocational rehabilitation and (b) the use of peer support groups to increase social capital, empowerment, knowledge, and resources among WLWH."

            "abstract": "Clinical characteristics:\n        \n      \n      The 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome is characterized by variable combinations of the three following findings: structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract, maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5), and neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder). Using a method of data analysis that avoids ascertainment bias, the authors determined that multicystic kidneys and other structural and functional kidney anomalies occur in 85% to 90% of affected individuals, MODY5 in approximately 40%, and some degree of developmental delay or learning disability in approximately 50%. MODY5 is most often diagnosed before age 25 years (range: age 10-50 years).\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis is established in a proband by detection of the 1.4-megabase (Mb) heterozygous recurrent deletion at chromosome 17q12 by chromosomal microarray testing or other genomic methods.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Treatment of kidney anomalies, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, MODY5, genital tract abnormalities, liver abnormalities, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, seizures and sensorineural hearing loss should follow standard practice.\n    \n\nSurveillance: Kidneys and urinary tract: In the absence of known structural abnormalities, kidney and bladder ultrasound examination 12 months after establishing the diagnosis, then every 2-3 years in childhood/adolescence, then every 3-5 years in adulthood; presence of an abnormality may warrant more frequent monitoring. Annual monitoring of kidney function in individuals with abnormalities detected on kidney ultrasound examination; more frequent monitoring may be advised in those taking potentially nephrotoxic medications and/or known to have impaired kidney function. Routine monitoring of neurodevelopment through early childhood; full neuropsychological evaluation for children who experience difficulty with school. HbA1C annually to monitor for MODY5; self-monitoring by individuals and their families for clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, such as polydipsia and polyuria. Consider reevaluation for uterine and vaginal abnormalities related to müllerian duct aplasia in pubertal females with primary amenorrhea. Consider annual hepatic function panel (or comprehensive metabolic panel), GGT, and lipid panel. Annual ophthalmologic evaluation during early childhood. Monitor those with seizures as clinically indicated. Hearing screening throughout childhood.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Because kidney transplantation increases the risk for post-transplant diabetes mellitus, an immunosuppressive regimen that avoids tacrolimus and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and reduces corticosteroid exposure may benefit those without preexisting diabetes mellitus. Nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided by individuals with kidney or liver abnormalities. For individuals with mental health conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, careful consideration of antipsychotic agents that may lead to weight gain is recommended, as this potential increase has been associated with metabolic syndrome and the later development of diabetes mellitus, for which people with 17q12 deletions are at baseline increased risk. Likewise, the use of mood stabilizers that affect kidney function in the long term, such as lithium, should be carefully considered in the setting of potential underlying anatomic and functional abnormalities in people with 17q12 deletions.\n    \n\nEvaluation of relatives at risk: If one of the proband's parents has the 17q12 recurrent deletion, it is appropriate to test older and younger sibs of the proband and other relatives at risk in order to identify those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring for evidence of genitourinary structural or functional defects, MODY5, and developmental delays / intellectual disability.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      The 17q12 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with approximately 75% of deletions occurring de novo and approximately 25% inherited from a parent. If the 17q12 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not found in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is presumed to be lower than 1% (but slightly greater than that of the general population because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism for the deletion). Offspring of an individual with the 17q12 recurrent deletion have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing using genomic testing that will detect the 17q12 recurrent deletion are possible."

It enables the simulation of different social situations, often impossible to arrange in reality, with high control over the confounding variables. Thanks to the VR realism, the viewer of this reality behaves similarly and experiences similar emotions to those in natural conditions, which results in high ecological validity of this environment, making it useful for diagnostics and therapy. This review, conducted in a narrative way, presents the results of observational and interventional research using immersive virtual reality (VR) in exploration of mechanisms generating psychotic symptoms (mainly in the scope of paranoia), as well as cognition and social functioning (research with the use of virtual avatars) in persons diagnosed with nonaffective psychosis. The research included in the review has been divided by the authors into two categories, depending on their type and the related level of reliability of the results. Moreover, the authors discuss technological aspects of VR, including the most important ways of presenting it, the differences between VR technology and classical neurocognitive tests, and the use of this technology for diagnostic purposes. As far as the treatment of psychotic disorders is concerned, the authors discuss VR interventions focused mainly on delusions and auditory hallucinations. Finally, the prospects for further development and use of VR technology in psychiatry are discussed."

Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 SHD telenurses, covering their experiences and skills when encountering and advising callers with mental illness. Complexity science was used as an a priori theoretical framework to enhance understanding of the complex nature of telenursing. Results: SHD was described as a complex system as nurses were constantly interacting with other agents and agencies. During these interactions, dynamic processes were found between the agents in which the nurses adapted to every new situation. They were constantly aware of their impact on the care-seekers, and perceived their encounters with callers with psychiatric illness as \"balancing on a thin line\". SHD was also described as both an authority and a dumping ground. The openness of the system did not give the nurses possibility to control the number of incoming calls and the callers' intentions. Conclusions: These new insights into SHD have important implications for organization developers and nursing management in terms of overcoming linear thinking."

Secondary outcome measures included strength of preference by willingness to pay (WTP); distress, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES); anxiety and depression; satisfaction with care; experience of care; frequency and extent of symptoms including self-assessment of pain; clinical effectiveness; and complications.

Acceptability of MTOP declined with increasing gestational age. The difference in acceptability between STOP and MTOP persisted at 3 months. At 2 weeks after TOP, women in the preference arms were prepared to pay more to have their preferred option. There was no difference in anxiety or depression scores in women having MTOP or STOP. However, women randomised to MTOP had higher scores on subscales of the IES at both 2 weeks and 3 months. There was no difference in IES scores between MTOP and STOP in the preference arm. Women were more likely to be satisfied overall and with technical and interpersonal aspects of care if they had STOP rather than MTOP. Experience of care scores were lower after MTOP in both randomised and preference arms. During admission women undergoing MTOP had more symptoms and reported higher mean pain scores, and after discharge reported more nausea and diarrhoea. There were no differences in time taken to return to work between groups; around 90% had returned to work and normal activity by 2 weeks. Rates of unplanned or emergency admissions were higher after MTOP than after STOP. Overall complication rates were also higher after MTOP, although this only achieved statistical significance in the preference arm. Overall, STOP cost more than MTOP due to higher inpatient standard costs. Even though complication rates were higher with MTOP, it was still more cost-effective. DCE identified three attributes with an almost equal impact on women's preferences: provision of counselling, number of days delay to the procedure, and possibility of an overnight stay.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      MTOP was associated with more negative experiences of care and lower acceptability. Acceptability of MTOP declined with increasing gestational age. MTOP was less costly but also less effective than STOP.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: An audit of provision of MTOP and STOP in England and Wales is urgently required. Further studies exploring the barriers to offering women the choice of method of TOP are needed, together with research on the acceptability and effectiveness of (1) MTOP and manual VA in pregnancies below 9 weeks' gestation and (2) MTOP and dilatation and evacuation after 14 weeks' gestation.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN07823656."

Neurofeedback training, which enables the individuals to regulate their brain activity using a real-time feedback loop, is increasingly investigated as a potential alternative intervention for schizophrenia. This study aimed to explore the effect of short but intensive neurofeedback training for schizophrenic patients with difficulty for long-time training. A middle-aged woman with chronic schizophrenia completed the intensive training of alpha/beta2 (20-30 Hz) in four consecutive days with a total training duration of 13.5 hours. The results showed that her alpha/beta2 increased over sessions, and her behavior performance including short-term memory, mood, and speech pattern was improved at the end of neurofeedback training. Importantly, a 22-month follow-up found a dramatic improvement in both positive and negative symptoms.

We investigated the effect of early versus delayed PC on quality of life (QOL), symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Between October 2010 and March 2013, 207 patients with advanced cancer at a National Cancer Institute cancer center, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and community outreach clinics were randomly assigned to receive an in-person PC consultation, structured PC telehealth nurse coaching sessions (once per week for six sessions), and monthly follow-up either early after enrollment or 3 months later. Outcomes were QOL, symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use (hospital/intensive care unit days, emergency room visits, chemotherapy in last 14 days, and death location).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall patient-reported outcomes were not statistically significant after enrollment (QOL, P = .34; symptom impact, P = .09; mood, P = .33) or before death (QOL, P = .73; symptom impact, P = .30; mood, P = .82). Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival rates were 63% in the early group and 48% in the delayed group (difference, 15%; P = .038). Relative rates of early to delayed decedents' resource use were similar for hospital days (0.73; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.27; P = .26), intensive care unit days (0.68; 95% CI, 0.23 to 2.02; P = .49), emergency room visits (0.73; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.19; P = .21), chemotherapy in last 14 days (1.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 6.7; P = .27), and home death (27 [54%] v 28 [47%]; P = .60).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Early-entry participants' patient-reported outcomes and resource use were not statistically different; however, their survival 1-year after enrollment was improved compared with those who began 3 months later. Understanding the complex mechanisms whereby PC may improve survival remains an important research priority."

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an automated VR cognitive therapy (gameChange) to treat avoidance and distress in patients with psychosis, and to analyse how and in whom it might work.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial across nine National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or an affective diagnosis with psychotic symptoms, and had self-reported difficulties going outside due to anxiety. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either gameChange VR therapy plus usual care or usual care alone, using a permuted blocks algorithm with randomly varying block size, stratified by study site and service type. gameChange VR therapy was provided in approximately six sessions over 6 weeks. Trial assessors were masked to group allocation. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 6 (primary endpoint), and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was avoidance of, and distress in, everyday situations, assessed using the self-reported Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale (O-AS). Outcome analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants who were assigned to a study group for whom data were available). We performed planned mediation and moderation analyses to test the effects of gameChange VR therapy when added to usual care. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 17308399.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between July 25, 2019, and May 7, 2021 (with a pause in recruitment from March 16, 2020, to Sept 14, 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions), 551 patients were assessed for eligibility and 346 were enrolled. 231 (67%) patients were men and 111 (32%) were women, 294 (85%) were White, and the mean age was 37·2 years (SD 12·5). 174 patients were randomly assigned to the gameChange VR therapy group and 172 to the usual care alone group. Compared with the usual care alone group, the gameChange VR therapy group had significant reductions in agoraphobic avoidance (O-AS adjusted mean difference -0·47, 95% CI -0·88 to -0·06; n=320; Cohen's d -0·18; p=0·026) and distress (-4·33, -7·78 to -0·87; n=322; -0·26; p=0·014) at 6 weeks. Reductions in threat cognitions and within-situation defence behaviours mediated treatment outcomes. The greater the severity of anxious fears and avoidance, the greater the treatment benefits. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between the gameChange VR therapy group (12 events in nine patients) and the usual care alone group (eight events in seven patients; p=0·37).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Automated VR therapy led to significant reductions in anxious avoidance of, and distress in, everyday situations compared with usual care alone. The mediation analysis indicated that the VR therapy worked in accordance with the cognitive model by reducing anxious thoughts and associated protective behaviours. The moderation analysis indicated that the VR therapy particularly benefited patients with severe agoraphobic avoidance, such as not being able to leave the home unaccompanied. gameChange VR therapy has the potential to increase the provision of effective psychological therapy for psychosis, particularly for patients who find it difficult to leave their home, visit local amenities, or use public transport.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      National Institute of Health Research Invention for Innovation programme, National Institute of Health Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre."

It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020.

From a psychological point of view, children may experience increased feelings of anxiety and fear that can negatively influence their behavioral, cognitive, and emotional outcomes. To mitigate such adverse effects on children's mental health and well-being, interventions that might contribute to protecting the emotional domain of hospitalized children are welcome. The present case study of a single-setting intervention allowed us to evaluate the impact, on children admitted to a pediatric short-term recovery ward (N = 61), of participating in play-based activities with a CoderBot robot. The methodology spanned multiple data sources (children, parents, nurses), field observation, and a sequential (quantitative-qualitative) mixed-method approach to data analysis. We found that robot-based activities are associated with enhanced well-being (particularly positive emotions). Both the participating children and their caregivers reported that the activity was enjoyable and interesting, especially thanks to its technologically innovative nature. We critically discuss these positive findings in relation to the strengths of our pilot study, as well as its contextual and methodological limitations, and outline possible future lines of development for this kind of project."

Among all positive tweets, 218,312 (62.00%) were classified as highly positive emotions (eg, active, alert, excited, elated, happy, and pleasant), while 133,804 (38.00%) positive tweets were classified as passive positive emotions (eg, contented, serene, calm, relaxed, and subdued). Among all negative tweets, 95,870 (54.00%) were classified as subdued negative emotions (eg, sad, unhappy, depressed, and bored) while the remaining 81,667 (46.00%) negative tweets were classified as highly negative emotions (eg, tense, nervous, stressed, upset, and unpleasant). Sentiment changed drastically when comparing a corpus of tweets with social bots to one without. For example, the probability of any one tweet reflecting joy was 61.30% from the debiased (or bot free) corpus of tweets. In contrast, the probability of any one tweet reflecting joy was 16.40% from the biased corpus.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Social media data provide researchers the ability to understand public sentiment and attitudes by listening to what people are saying in their own words. Tobacco control programmers in charge of risk communication may consider targeting individuals posting positive messages about hookah on Twitter or designing messages that amplify the negative sentiments. Posts on Twitter communicating positive sentiment toward hookah could add to the normalization of hookah use and is an area of future research. Findings from this study demonstrated the importance of debiasing data when attempting to understand attitudes from Twitter data."

The IPD difference was even greater between NCs and BM patients with psychotic features (n = 11) than those without psychotic features (n = 9). Regardless of the presence of psychotic features, BM patients averted their gazes more than NCs, and even more while speaking than while listening. Our results might suggest negativistic social cognition of bipolar patients, as was previously found even during a manic phase, or the role of paranoid symptoms in avoidant social behaviors, in agreement with prior studies with schizophrenic patients. Use of proper space and gaze might have psychotherapeutic implication in developing secure, two-person relationship with bipolar patients regardless of the presence of disrupting manic symptoms."

            "abstract": "Today we are experiencing a hybrid real-virtual society in which the interaction with virtual humans is normal and \"quasi-social\". Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents' t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive processes."

Based on the high prevalence of catatonia in AE and our clinical experience, we hypothesized that catatonia might be a marker of severity requiring more aggressive treatment approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To reach a sufficient number of cases with brain-autoimmune conditions, we pooled two samples (N = 58): the first from the French National Network of Rare Psychiatric diseases and the second from the largest Italian neuro-pediatrics center for encephalopathies. Autoimmune conditions were diagnosed using a multidisciplinary approach and numerous paraclinical investigations.

By comparing two versions of a two-dimensional animated video on spinal anesthesia, this study tested the patient-avatar identification within two different narrative models. To explore the perspectives of total hip arthroplasty, we employed qualitative methods of interviews and ethnographic observation. The animated presentation of the spinal anesthesia procedure was immediately recognized by all participants as reflecting their experience of the procedure independent of the narrative form. The avatar gender did not affect this identification. We found no preference for either narrative form. This study supports the potential of animation video in health informatics as a didactic model for qualifying patient behavior. Animation video creates a high degree of identification that may work to reduce pre-surgical anxiety."

            "abstract": "Despite significant psychiatric comorbidity in problem gambling, there is little evidence on which to base treatment recommendations for subpopulations of problem gamblers with comorbid psychiatric disorders. This mini-review draws on two separate systematic searches to identify possible interventions for comorbid problem gambling and psychiatric disorders, highlight the gaps in the currently available evidence base, and stimulate further research in this area. In this mini-review, only 21 studies that have conducted post-hoc analyses to explore the influence of psychiatric disorders or problem gambling subtypes on gambling outcomes from different types of treatment were identified. The findings of these studies suggest that most gambling treatments are not contraindicated by psychiatric disorders. Moreover, only 6 randomized studies comparing the efficacy of interventions targeted towards specific comorbidity subgroups with a control/comparison group were identified. The results of these studies provide preliminary evidence for modified dialectical behavior therapy for comorbid substance use, the addition of naltrexone to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for comorbid alcohol use problems, and the addition of N-acetylcysteine to tobacco support programs and imaginal desensitisation/motivational interviewing for comorbid nicotine dependence. They also suggest that lithium for comorbid bipolar disorder, escitalopram for comorbid anxiety disorders, and the addition of CBT to standard drug treatment for comorbid schizophrenia may be effective. Future research evaluating interventions sequenced according to disorder severity or the functional relationship between the gambling behavior and comorbid symptomatology, identifying psychiatric disorders as moderators of the efficacy of problem gambling interventions, and evaluating interventions matched to client comorbidity could advance this immature field of study."

Its etiology is still largely unknown, but studies have reported a strong association between NT1 and HLA, as well as a pathogenic association with the deficiency of cerebrospinal hypocretin-1. Thus, the most reliable pathogenic hypothesis is an autoimmune process destroying hypothalamic hypocretin-producing cells. A definitive cure for narcolepsy is not available to date, and although the research in the field is highly promising, up to now, current treatments have aimed to reduce the symptoms by means of different pharmacological approaches. Moreover, overall narcolepsy symptoms management can also benefit from non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) and psychosocial interventions to improve the patients' quality of life in both adult and pediatric-affected individuals as well as the well-being of their families.

Lupus pregnancies can be successful, even in patients with renal disease, when planned in remission state; the use of low dose aspirin was shown to be an independent predictor of good outcome, so it can be suggested as a preventive measure. Pregnancies in women with Antiphospholipid Syndrome can fail even if properly treated, especially when associated with a systemic autoimmune disease, a history of both thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity, and a triple positivity of antiphospholipid antibody assays. Women with systemic sclerosis have generally a good obstetric outcome, except for an increase rate of preterm deliveries. Severe disease complications were sometimes reported, but their relationship with gestation is not clear yet. Although data on human pregnancy are still preliminary, anti-TNF agents are classified as non teratogens in contrast to methotrexate and leflunomide. So women affected by aggressive chronic arthritis may be treated with anti-TNF in the pre-conceptional period, discontinuing the drug as soon as pregnancy starts. In order to increase maternal compliance and cope with difficult cases, a multidisciplinary team (rheumatologists/internists, obstetricians and neonatologists) should take care of patients during pregnancy."

A 31-year-old primigravida with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder was treated with an antidepressant, mood stabiliser and antipsychotic. This case discusses preconception counselling, pregnancy and labour management that resulted in the delivery of a 4,200 g baby at 39 weeks by emergency caesarian section. This case highlights the collaborative approach to care that is needed in this group of women and the need for increasing awareness and knowledge in health professionals. It follows the management from preconception through to the postpartum period."

These mental health issues affect not only the well-being and quality of life of WLWH, but have implications for HIV management and transmission prevention. Despite these ramifications, WLWH are under-treated for mental health concerns and they are underrepresented in the mental health treatment literature. In this review, we illustrate the unique mental health issues faced by WLWH such as a high prevalence of physical and sexual abuse histories, caregiving stress, and elevated internalized stigma as well as myriad barriers to care. We examine the feasibility and outcomes of mental health interventions that have been tested in WLWH including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and supportive counseling. Future research is required to address individual and systemic barriers to mental health care for WLWH."

Few research studies have been able to specifically examine these influences experimentally. The present study investigated the effects of patients' sex, race, age, and pain expression on healthcare students' assessment of pain and pain-related sequelae using virtual human (VH) technology. A lens model design was employed, which is an analogue method for capturing how individuals use environmental information to make judgments. In this study, decision-making policies were captured at the nomothetic and idiographic level. Participants included 107 healthcare students who viewed 32 VH patients that differed in sex, race, age, and pain expression in an online study. Participants provided ratings on a 100-point scale on the VH pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, negative mood, coping, and need for medical treatment. Nomothetic analyses revealed that female, African-American, older, and high pain expression VH were rated higher than male, Caucasian, younger, and low pain expression VH, respectively, on most of the five ratings. Idiographic analyses revealed detailed findings for individuals' decision-making policies. VH technology and the lens model design were shown to be highly effective in examining individuals' decision-making policies. Pain assessment often varied among individuals based on patient demographic and facial expression cues. This study could serve as a model for future investigations of pain assessment and treatment in healthcare students and providers."

We presented female body images of Caucasian avatars in a continuum of common dress sizes posing seven basic facial expressions (neutral, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), and asked both male and female participants to rate the perceived body attractiveness and body size. The analysis revealed an evident modulatory role of avatar facial expressions on body attractiveness and body size ratings, but not on the amount of viewing time directed at individual body features. Specifically, happy and angry avatars attracted the highest and lowest body attractiveness ratings, respectively, and fearful and surprised avatars tended to be rated slimmer. Interestingly, the impact of facial expression on female body assessment was not further influenced by viewers' gender, suggesting a 'universal' role of common facial expressions in modifying the perception of female body appearance."

Using a virtual collaborative environment (VCS), we tested 1) whether synchronization of behavior, i.e., the spontaneous initiation of gestures that are congruent with those of an interaction partner, was impaired in individuals with schizophrenia compared with healthy participants; 2) whether mimicry of the patients' body movements by the virtual interaction partner was associated with increased behavioral synchronization and rapport. 19 patients and 19 matched controls interacted with a virtual agent who either mimicked their head and torso movements with a delay varying randomly between 0.5 s and 4 s or did not mimic, and rated feelings of rapport toward the virtual agent after each condition. Both groups exhibited a higher and similar synchronization behavior of the virtual agent forearm movements when they were in the Mimicry condition rather than in the No-mimicry condition. In addition, both groups felt more comfortable with a mimicking virtual agent rather than a virtual agent not mimicking them suggesting that mimicry is able to increase rapport in individuals with schizophrenia.

For the simulation study, HCs used Vickybot for 2 weeks to simulate different clinical situations. For feasibility and effectiveness study, people consulting PC or health care workers with mental health problems used Vickybot for 1 month. Self-assessments for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms and work-related burnout (based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory) were administered at baseline and every 2 weeks. Feasibility was determined from both subjective and objective user-engagement indicators (UEIs). Potential effectiveness was measured using paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for changes in self-assessment scores.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 40 HCs tested Vickybot simultaneously, and the data were reliably transmitted and registered. For simulation, 17 HCs (n=13, 76% female; mean age 36.5, SD 9.7 years) received 98.8% of the expected modules. Suicidal alerts were received correctly. For the feasibility and potential effectiveness study, 34 patients (15 from PC and 19 health care workers; 76% [26/34] female; mean age 35.3, SD 10.1 years) completed the first self-assessments, with 100% (34/34) presenting anxiety symptoms, 94% (32/34) depressive symptoms, and 65% (22/34) work-related burnout. In addition, 27% (9/34) of patients completed the second self-assessment after 2 weeks of use. No significant differences were found between the first and second self-assessments for anxiety (t8=1.000; P=.34) or depressive (t8=0.40; P=.70) symptoms. However, work-related burnout scores were moderately reduced (z=-2.07, P=.04, r=0.32). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a greater reduction in anxiety-depressive symptoms and work-related burnout with greater use of the chatbot. Furthermore, 9% (3/34) of patients activated the suicide alert, and the research team promptly intervened with successful outcomes. Vickybot showed high subjective UEI (acceptability, usability, and satisfaction), but low objective UEI (completion, adherence, compliance, and engagement). Vickybot was moderately feasible.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The chatbot was useful in screening for the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and for detecting suicidal risk. Potential effectiveness was shown to reduce work-related burnout but not anxiety or depressive symptoms. Subjective perceptions of use contrasted with low objective-use metrics. Our results are promising but suggest the need to adapt and enhance the smartphone-based solution to improve engagement.

Therefore, the integration of virtual reality (VR) may increase efficacy; however, it has not yet been investigated in the treatment of CUD. A novel approach, avatar intervention for CUD, uses existing therapeutic techniques from other recommended therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral methods, motivational interviewing) and allows participants to practice them in real-time. During immersive sessions, participants are invited to interact with an avatar representing a significant person related to their drug use.

The primary outcome 'non-compliance with treatment' showed no significant difference between compliance therapy and non-specific counseling (n=56, RR 1.23 CI 0.74 to 2.05). The compliance therapy did not substantially effect attitudes to treatment (n=50, WMD DAI score -2.10 CI -6.11 to 1.91). Very few people (~10%) left the study by one year (n=56, RR 0.5 CI 0.1 to 2.51). Mental state seemed unaffected by the therapy (n=50, WMD PANSS score 6.1 CI -4.54 to 16.74) as was insight (n=50, WMD SAI -0.5 CI -2.43 to 1.43), global functioning (n=50, WMD GAF -4.20 CI -16.42 to 8.02) and quality of life (n=50, WMD QLS -3.40 CI -16.25 to 9.45). At both one and two years the average number of days in hospital was non-significantly reduced for those allocated to the compliance therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is no clear evidence to suggest that compliance therapy is beneficial for people with schizophrenia and related syndromes but more randomised studies are justified and needed in order for this intervention to be fully examined."

            "abstract": "This paper presents the FACSHuman software program, a tool for creating facial expression materials (pictures and videos) based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) developed by Ekman et al. (2002). FACSHuman allows almost all the Action Units (AUs) described in the FACS Manual to be manipulated through a three-dimensional modeling software interface. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate facial expressions of emotion generated by the software and their theoretical efficiency regarding the FACS. The first study (a categorization task of facial emotions such as happiness, anger, etc.) showed that 85% of generated pictures of emotional expressions were correctly categorized. The second study showed that only 82% of the most-used AUs were correctly matched. In the third experiment, two independent FACS coders rated 47 AUs generated by FACSHuman using the standard methodology used in this kind of task (AU identification). Results showed good-to-excellent codification rates (64% and 85%). In the last experiment, 54 combinations of AU were evaluated by the same FACS coders. Results showed good-to-excellent codification rates (68-82%). Results suggested that FACSHuman could be used as experimental material for research into nonverbal communication and emotional expression."

            "abstract": "Depression is a common disorder in the primary care setting; it is associated with considerable distress and dysfunction. The management of depressed primary care patients can be complicated by the fact that these patients may lack insight into the cause of their symptoms and report only the somatic manifestations of their disorder to their physicians. Primary care patients may also be reluctant to accept a diagnosis of depression or referral to a mental health specialist. Primary care physicians may feel they lack the time or the training to adequately address their patients' depressive disorders. This paper presents a model for identifying, evaluating, and treating depression which has been specifically developed to help primary care physicians overcome these barriers."

            "abstract": "Although Adjustment Disorder (AD) is considered a marginal diagnostic category by many clinicians and researchers, all the rare studies undertaken in the last decades indicate that the prevalence of this disorder is high in psychiatric settings, but has never been investigated in general practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current prevalence of Adjustment Disorders With Anxiety (ADWA) in primary care settings and to describe the characteristics of the population, nature of the stressors and management of the disorder by General Practitioners (GPs). This French study involved 78 random liberal GPs, in 7 distinct regions (Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, Rouen, Dijon, Castres and Compiègne). GPs had to register all the consecutive attenders over 18 years old. For each physician, the registration period was over when 200 patients were registered, or 10 days of consultation were completed, or when 5 MINI had been performed. The average study period was 10 days per physician. At the first stage, they selected all the patients with psychological complaints, which were eventually associated to physical complaints. At the second stage, only the patients whose complaints were linked to a psychosocial stressor and without A1 and/or A2 DSM IV criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) were proposed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The MINI is a brief structured clinical diagnostic interview that identifies the main axis-I DSM IV diagnoses in about 15 minutes. Before starting the study, all of the GPs participated in an intensive course on AD criteria recognition and were trained to use the MINI. The GPs registered a total of 7,759 consecutive patients. Twenty-two per cent (n = 1,719) of the patients reported psychological complaints, associated or not to physical complaints. Among them, 49% (n = 844) linked their complaints to identifiable psychosocial stressors. About half of the latter (n = 450) coded positive to A1 and/or A2 criteria for MDE. At the end, a total of 314 patients agreed to complete the MINI. Among the 1,719 patients with psychological complaints, the prevalence of ADWA eventually associated to other psychiatric disorders was 9.2%. The prevalence of \"pure\" ADWA was 4.5%. When considering the whole population of consecutive patients in primary care settings, the prevalence of pure ADWA was 1.0%. Patients suffering from pure ADWA were mostly women (66.7%), young patients (mean age: 42 years), with a professional activity. Patients had a psychiatric disorder history in 53.8% of the cases (mostly anxiety disorder). The main life events cited as being responsible for the disorder were work-associated problems (23.1%), followed by family illness (9.0%) and serious personal illness or accident (7.7%). The average duration of the disorder was 2.32 months. In 91% of the cases, GPs estimated that the patient required a pharmacological or psychological treatment. In most cases, they treated the patients with drug therapy (74.0%) associated with psychological support (counselling or psychotherapy, 76%). Anxiolytic agents were usually prescribed (64.9%), followed by antidepressants (10.8%) and hypnotics (8.1%). In conclusion, this first prevalence study of ADWA in general practice demonstrates that this disorder is frequent in primary care. It seems to be more present in patients who are of working age, especially women. ADWA would thus seem to preferentially affect active subjects. In most cases, GPs treat their patients with both psychological support and drug therapy. Anxiolytic is the elicited treatment of this disorder."

Rimonabant is a cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist that promotes weight loss in the general population. We conducted a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rimonabant (20 mg/d) in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria, who were clinically stable on second-generation antipsychotics. Participants had a body mass index of 27 kg/m or higher with hyperlipidemia or body mass index of 30 kg/m or higher, and no current substance abuse/dependence (except nicotine), more than weekly cannabis use, or recent depressive symptoms/suicidality. An exercise and dietary counseling group was offered weekly. Target enrollment was 60; the trial was terminated early because of withdrawal of rimonabant from the European market. Fifteen participants were randomized (7 rimonabant, 8 placebo); 5 completed in each group. Rimonabant was associated with a greater reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score versus placebo (mean ± SE difference, -1.9 ± 0.8, P = 0.02), driven by differences in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale anxiety/depression (-1.4 ± 0.35, P = 0.0004) and hostility (-0.7 ± 0.3, P = 0.02) factors. Group differences were not significant for the Calgary Depression Scale total score (P = 0.24), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms total score (P = 0.13), weight, blood pressure, or fasting lipids or glucose. Rimonabant was well tolerated with no significant adverse events. No significant weight loss, metabolic effects, or adverse psychiatric effects were associated with the cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist rimonabant in this small sample of people with schizophrenia. The endocannabinoid system remains a promising target for pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia and obesity."

Factors such as shortened length of the medical visit, increased availability of technological approaches to care, and a more informed patient all suggest that a new paradigm is required for chronic pain management. Although much has been written about the use of electronic diaries in clinical trials, little has been presented about the use of these diaries in clinic practice and their potential for changing pain behavior. The intent of this preliminary study is to measure accessibility and usability of a software program designed for use on a personal digital assistant and to discuss how the software program may impact clinic practice and patient behavior.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We present the results of a preliminary, randomized, comparison, crossover trial of 36 chronic pain patients who were asked to monitor their pain, mood, activity interference, medication use, and pain location on either a paper or electronic diary for 2 weeks.

Importantly, patients using the electronic diary reported more frequently that a provider suggested medication change (P < 0.05) based on feedback from the electronic diary.

Key findings were replicated in an adult cohort of 2420 cases, including 127 with retrospective AAO<13. Factor and cluster analyses were carried out to identify clinical profiles. Five clinical factors were identified in each cohort: Positive, Bizarre Positive, Negative/Formal Thought Disorder, Depression and Mania. Earlier AAO predicted severity of bizarre positive symptoms in children and of bizarre and other symptoms in adults. Four clinical clusters in the child cohort were characterized by: more severe bizarre positive symptoms (N = 31); negative symptoms (N = 15); premorbid autism spectrum features and developmental delay (N = 12); and depressive symptoms with heterogeneous diagnoses and mild positive/negative symptoms (N = 25). Previous factor-analytic studies of childhood psychosis did not specifically consider bizarre positive symptoms. Here, bizarre positive symptoms emerged as clinical markers of severe, childhood-onset psychosis similar to adult schizophrenia. The four clusters are clinically meaningful and useful for treatment planning and potentially for biological research. Childhood-onset cases are rare and thus difficult to study, but additional, larger cohorts may be useful in dissecting the biological and developmental heterogeneity of psychotic disorders."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDepression has a high prevalence among young adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n## METHODS\nIn a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS).\n## RESULTS\nParticipants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in the XiaoE group compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group at both T1 (F\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic approach that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics for a mental health chatbot has been established in this study. In the future, focus on both clinical outcomes and nonclinical metrics is necessary to explore the mechanism by which mental health chatbots work on patients. Further evidence is required to confirm the long-term effectiveness of the mental health chatbot via trails replicated with a longer dose, as well as exploration of its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100052532; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=135744.\n"

Notably, Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) protocols were shown to be uniquely effective in treating symptoms for both depression and anxiety when delivered through smartphone apps. The aim of this study is to expand on that work and test the suitability of artificial intelligence-driven interventions delivered directly through popular texting apps.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study evaluated our hypothesis that using Kai.ai will result in improved well-being.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a pragmatic retrospective analysis of 2909 users who used Kai.ai on one of the top messaging apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, etc). Users' well-being levels were tracked using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index throughout the engagement with service. A 1-tailed paired samples t test was used to assess well-being levels before and after usage, and hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the change in symptoms over time.\n## RESULTS\nThe median well-being score at the last measurement was higher (median 52) than that at the start of the intervention (median 40), indicating a significant improvement (W=2682927; P<.001). Furthermore, HLM results showed that the improvement in well-being was linearly related to the number of daily messages a user sent (β=.029; t\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMobile-based ACT interventions are effective means to improve individuals' well-being. Our findings further demonstrate Kai.ai's great promise in helping individuals improve and maintain high levels of well-being and thus improve their daily lives.\n"

Of these, 59 patients participated in an 18 month weight control programme that included an educational activity about dietary and physical activity counselling as well as a structured, supervised, facility-based exercise programme. The control group consisted of 51 patients with the same baseline characteristics who did not receive the clinical programme. Anthropometric measurements, plasma lipid-lipoprotein profile, and fasting plasma glucose concentrations were assessed at 11 time-points over the study. In addition, serum concentrations of prolactin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed at four time-points. Finally, the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey were used.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The adherence rate of patients was 85%, both in the active and in the control group. Whereas the control group experienced a significant increase in bodyweight (4.1%), body mass index (BMI; 5.5%) and waist circumference (WC; 4.2%), the active group significantly reduced their bodyweight (-3.5%), BMI (-4.4%), and WC (-4.6%) at the study end-point. In addition, a significant increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (14.8%) and in triglyceride concentrations (12.3%) was observed at month 18 in the control group. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) significantly increased (21.4%), and LDL cholesterol (-13.7%), triglycerides (-26.2%), total cholesterol (-12.1%), fasting glucose concentrations (-12.0%), and HbA1c (-11.4%) significantly decreased compared to baseline in the active group. No significant changes were observed regarding serum concentrations of prolactin and TSH during the study. In regard to the changes observed in psychological measures, no between-group differences were seen in the clinical ratings of CGI and BPRS. However, the SF-36 showed that physical health was improved only for subjects in the active group at months 12 and 18 compared to baseline (p<0.05), and mental health was significantly improved for both groups at months 12 and 18 compared to baseline.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Bodyweight and metabolic risk profile in patients receiving atypical antipsychotic medications can be effectively managed with a weight control programme including physical activity."

            "abstract": "The problems of the haves differ substantially from those of the have-nots. Individuals in developing societies have to fight mainly against infectious and communicable diseases, while in the developed world the battles are mainly against lifestyle diseases. Yet, at a very fundamental level, the problems are the same-the fight is against distress, disability, and premature death; against human exploitation and for human development and self-actualisation; against the callousness to critical concerns in regimes and scientific power centres.While there has been great progress in the treatment of individual diseases, human pathology continues to increase. Sicknesses are not decreasing in number, they are only changing in type.The primary diseases of poverty like TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS-and the often co-morbid and ubiquitous malnutrition-take their toll on helpless populations in developing countries. Poverty is not just income deprivation but capability deprivation and optimism deprivation as well.While life expectancy may have increased in the haves, and infant and maternal mortality reduced, these gains have not necessarily ensured that well-being results. There are ever-multiplying numbers of individuals whose well-being is compromised due to lifestyle diseases. These diseases are the result of faulty lifestyles and the consequent crippling stress. But it serves no one's purpose to understand them as such. So, the prescription pad continues to prevail over lifestyle-change counselling or research.The struggle to achieve well-being and positive health, to ensure longevity, to combat lifestyle stress and professional burnout, and to reduce psychosomatic ailments continues unabated, with hardly an end in sight.WE THUS REALISE THAT MORBIDITY, DISABILITY, AND DEATH ASSAIL ALL THREE SOCIETIES: the ones with infectious diseases, the ones with diseases of poverty, and the ones with lifestyle diseases. If it is bacteria in their various forms that are the culprit in infectious diseases, it is poverty/deprivation in its various manifestations that is the culprit in poverty-related diseases, and it is lifestyle stress in its various avatars that is the culprit in lifestyle diseases. It is as though poverty and lifestyle stress have become the modern \"bacteria\" of developing and developed societies, respectively.For those societies afflicted with diseases of poverty, of course, the prime concern is to escape from the deadly grip of poverty-disease-deprivation-helplessness; but, while so doing, they must be careful not to land in the lap of lifestyle diseases. For the haves, the need is to seek well-being, positive health, and inner rootedness; to ask science not only to give them new pills for new ills, but to define and study how negative emotions hamper health and how positive ones promote it; to find out what is inner peace, what is the connection between spirituality and health, what is well-being, what is self-actualisation, what prevents disease, what leads to longevity, how simplicity impacts health, what attitudes help cope with chronic sicknesses, how sicknesses can be reversed (not just treated), etc. Studies on well-being, longevity, and simplicity need the concerted attention of researchers.THE TASK AHEAD IS CUT OUT FOR EACH ONE OF US: physician, patient, caregiver, biomedical researcher, writer/journalist, science administrator, policy maker, ethicist, man of religion, practitioner of alternate/complementary medicine, citizen of a world community, etc. Each one must do his or her bit to ensure freedom from disease and achieve well-being.Those in the developed world have the means to make life meaningful but, often, have lost the meaning of life itself; those in the developing world are fighting for survival but, often, have recipes to make life meaningful. This is especially true of a society like India, which is rapidly emerging from its underdeveloped status. It is an ancient civilization, with a philosophical outlook based on a robust mix of the temporal and the spiritual, with vibrant indigenous biomedical and related disciplines, for example, Ayurveda, Yoga, etc. It also has a burgeoning corpus of modern biomedical knowledge in active conversation with the rest of the world. It should be especially careful that, while it does not negate the fruits of economic development and scientific/biomedical advance that seem to beckon it in this century, it does not also forget the values that have added meaning and purpose to life; values that the ancients bequeathed it, drawn from their experiential knowledge down the centuries.The means that the developed have could combine with the recipes to make them meaningful that the developing have. That is the challenge ahead for mankind as it gropes its way out of poverty, disease, despair, alienation, anomie, and the ubiquitous all-devouring lifestyle stresses, and takes halting steps towards well-being and the glory of human development."

Methods: Medline and Embase databases were systematically searched using the keywords aripiprazole and child or adolescent over the period from 2000 to 2019. The initial screen yielded 163 publications, from which 99 studies were reviewed. Results: Aripiprazole is one of the most widely prescribed atypical antipsychotics. Like others, its use in children and adolescents is becoming commonplace and occurs in off-label indications. Aripiprazole has proven efficacy for several indications in children and adolescents, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and behavioral impairments associated with autism and intellectual disability. Adverse effects are more important in children and adolescents than adults, particularly weight gain, drowsiness, extrapyramidal effects, and metabolic effects, even though the latter may appear less important than with other atypical antipsychotics. Severe adverse effects often occur in multiple-prescription settings. At present, postprescription monitoring is very poor. Conclusion: Aripiprazole has proven efficacy for several indications in children and adolescents. However, its use requires clinical and paraclinical monitoring to assess the occurrence of adverse events that may challenge the benefit/risk ratio. In addition, off-label prescriptions should be limited, as they appear to account for a significant proportion of aripiprazole use worldwide."

Younger people were more likely to use mobile phones. Digitally excluded participants cited a lack of knowledge as a barrier to digital inclusion, and most wanted to use the Internet via computers (rather than mobile phones).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Digital exclusion is lower, but some remain excluded. Facilitating inclusion among this population means helping them develop skills and confidence in using technology, and providing them with access. Providing mobile phones without basic information technology training may be counterproductive because excluded people may be excluded from mobile technology too. An evidence-based digital inclusion strategy is needed within the National Health Service to help digitally excluded populations access Internet-enabled services."

The goals of this paper are to discuss the importance of breastmilk for the health of both the mother and infant, evaluate the impact of medication use on women's infant feeding choice, describe the transfer of drugs to breastmilk and infants, and provide a framework for clinicians to support evidence-based counseling for women treated for mood disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Recommendations:\n        \n      \n      We recommend early pregnancy counseling to discuss the benefits and risks of medications during breastfeeding. The Surgeon General's Call to Action (2011) highlights the short and long-term negative health effects of not providing breastmilk. Integrating recommendations from the pediatric and obstetric teams allows patients to make decisions based on evidence and reach their infant feeding goals.

The current study explored whether these negative emotional states, as well as hallucinations, biased reasoning style (ie, jumping to conclusions), and negative self-esteem prospectively predict the occurrence and various dimensions of delusions of control, reference, and grandiosity in real time, as they occur in daily life. One hundred and thirty community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed laboratory measures and momentary self-reports generated by a personal digital assistant multiple times per day, over 7 consecutive days. Analyses were time lagged allowing simultaneous examination of person-level and within-person time-varying relationships among the variables. Approximately, half of the participants reported having at least one delusional experience during the week, and approximately, a quarter of those individuals reported experiencing all 3 delusion subtypes. Hallucinations were a significant predictor of the occurrence of delusions of control and reference over the subsequent hours of the same day, but negative emotional states of anxiety and sadness were not. Negative self-esteem predicted the frequency of all 3 delusion subtypes during the week, and a reasoning style characterized by reduced information gathering was a significant predictor of the frequency of delusions of control.

The number of participants included in this study is 81 children: 40 TD children and 41 children with ASD. Each participant had to go through two conditions: robot interaction and human interaction in which they had performed the reversal learning task. Our primary outcomes are the number of errors from acquisition phase and from reversal phase of the task; as secondary outcomes we have measured attentional engagement and positive affect. The results of this study showed that children with ASD are more engaged in the task and they seem to enjoy more the task when interacting with the robot compared with the interaction with the adult. On the other hand their cognitive flexibility performance is, in general, similar in the robot and the human conditions with the exception of the learning phase where the robot can interfere with the performance.

            "abstract": "Appraisals can be influenced by cultural beliefs and stereotypes. In line with this, past research has shown that judgments about the emotional expression of a face are influenced by the face's sex, and vice versa that judgments about the sex of a person somewhat depend on the person's facial expression. For example, participants associate anger with male faces, and female faces with happiness or sadness. However, the strength and the bidirectionality of these effects remain debated. Moreover, the interplay of a stimulus' emotion and sex remains mostly unknown in the auditory domain. To investigate these questions, we created a novel stimulus set of 121 avatar faces and 121 human voices (available at https://bit.ly/2JkXrpy) with matched, fine-scale changes along the emotional (happy to angry) and sexual (male to female) dimensions. In a first experiment (N = 76), we found clear evidence for the mutual influence of facial emotion and sex cues on ratings, and moreover for larger implicit (task-irrelevant) effects of stimulus' emotion than of sex. These findings were replicated and extended in two preregistered studies-one laboratory categorization study using the same face stimuli (N = 108; https://osf.io/ve9an), and one online study with vocalizations (N = 72; https://osf.io/vhc9g). Overall, results show that the associations of maleness-anger and femaleness-happiness exist across sensory modalities, and suggest that emotions expressed in the face and voice cannot be entirely disregarded, even when attention is mainly focused on determining stimulus' sex. We discuss the relevance of these findings for cognitive and neural models of face and voice processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."

Adherence clubs should be promoted, being no less effective than facility-based care for stable patients. Tracing those lost to follow-up should be targeted to those who can be seen face-to-face by a peer worker. Investment is needed to promote linkage to initiating ART and for differentiated approaches to counselling for youth and for those with identified suboptimal adherence.

Identification of patients with increased levels of stress and anxiety may be helpful when treating asthma and during asthma counseling. Objective: To further characterize the relationship between asthma symptoms and perceived stress and trait anxiety in an adolescent population. Methods: Adolescents (N = 335) ages 14-17 years were recruited to examine the effect of stress on health measures. They were included in the present analysis if they reported current asthma, defined as self-reported clinician-diagnosed asthma plus one or more episodes of asthma in the past year. Asthma symptoms were assessed on a 7-point scale by using a standardized questionnaire that targets nocturnal awakening due to asthma, symptoms on awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath, time spent wheezing, and short-acting bronchodilator use. Stress was measured by using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and trait anxiety was measured by using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Linear regression was used to associate asthma symptoms with PSS and trait anxiety. Results: Thirty-eight adolescents (11.3%), with mean ± standard deviation age 16.7 ± 0.9 years, reported current asthma. Four of the six asthma symptom assessments had significant associations with PSS: symptoms on awakening (β = 4.82, p < 0.001), nocturnal awakening due to asthma (β = 4.47, p < 0.001), activity limitation (β = 2.78, p = 0.005), and shortness of breath (β = 1.73, p = 0.014). These associations remained significant after adjusting for gender, race, and the body mass index percentile. Trait anxiety had significant associations with nocturnal awakening (β = 9.28, p = 0.002) and symptoms on awakening (β = 8.74, p = 0.002). Associations remained significant after adjusting for gender, race, and body mass index percentile. Conclusion: Asthma symptom severity is associated with increased perceived stress and trait anxiety. Adolescents with asthma may represent a population that is particularly vulnerable to perceived stress and anxiety, which highlights the importance of considering these factors in asthma counseling."

A diagnosis of depression should be considered when a physically healthy child exhibits depressed mood or anhedonia, multiple somatic complaints, or behavioral changes, such as bullying, aggression, and social withdrawal. Risk factors for depression include childhood trauma, genetic susceptibility, and environmental stressors. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are the most effective treatments for adolescents with depression. Youth are at risk for the same adverse effects as adults but have an increased risk of behavioral activation, or switch, to mania and suicidal thoughts and behaviors early in treatment. Compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine has the most evidence for safety and efficacy, particularly in adolescents 12 years or older. There is very little evidence for the effectiveness of any antidepressant in children 11 years and younger. Youth receiving antidepressants should be monitored closely for new-onset or worsening suicidality, particularly during the first two weeks after starting medication, and for three months of therapy. Behavioral activation, aggression, worsening depression, anxiety, insomnia, or impulsivity can herald a switch to mania or suicidality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Depression in youth is common and treatable and responds best to multimodal treatment combining patient and family education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressant medication.

Some patients develop a psychotic illness, the etiology of which is still debated. Diagnosis may be difficult, and there are only a few reports in the psychiatric literature.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      The present case reports a 57-year-old man, double diagnosed with sensory impairment and psychosis. The severity of his psychosis required several hospitalisations in a psychiatric in-unit, even under third party decision or compulsory hospitalisation, for acute states with disruptive behaviour, aggressiveness against his mother, persecutory delusion and auditory hallucinations, self-talking, major anxiety, and depressive affects, without dissociation. Deafness had been diagnosed when he was six years old; he was able to attend school and learn to read and speak, using hearing aids, and was able to hold a job for three months. Severe psychotic symptoms appeared when he was 18 years old and contributed in confirming the diagnosis. Progressive loss of vision until blindness began later, between the age of 40 to 50. No specific abnormal results were revealed during the neuroradiological check-up. Treatment consisted in antipsychotics, notably depot, first in a mental health care in-unit and subsequently in an out-patient unit: although he denied psychotic symptoms, he became compliant with medication and could go on with treatment, associated with multidisciplinary interventions at home, in order to improve his quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Usher's syndrome is the most frequent cause of combined deafness and blindness in adults (three and five individuals per 100,000), but difficulties in communication need to increase clinical awareness of this disorder, especially for psychiatrists. Three subtypes are recognized by the International Usher Syndrome Consortium: Type 1 is characterised by profound congenital deafness, retinal degeneration beginning in childhood, and progressive vestibular dysfunction; Type 2 is characterised by moderate to severe hearing impairment, later onset of retinal degeneration, and normal vestibular function; Type 3 is characterised by progressive hearing loss and variable age of onset of retinal degeneration. Although nearly 23% may have psychotic symptoms, the aetiology remains unclear: sensory deprivation associated with environmental stress, organic changes such as cerebral abnormalities, genetic link (two genetic loci for both Usher's syndrome and psychotic illness are very close). Treatment of psychiatric symptoms is based on antipsychotics, well tolerated by the patients, who improve change of behaviour and communication abilities. Genetic counselling may be useful for parents.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Access to mental health services is particularly difficult for deaf and deaf-blind people, and difficulties in communication are a challenge for patients and for caregivers too. Antipsychotic medications are helpful for associated psychotic symptoms. Potential link between Usher syndrome and psychosis is still unclear and needs further studies."

Results show prototypical patterns of facial mimicry after correction for MR-related artifacts: enhanced M. zygomaticus major activity in response to happy and enhanced M. corrugator supercilii activity in response to sad and angry expressions. Regression analyses show that these congruent facial reactions correlate significantly with activations in the IFG, SMA, and cerebellum. Stronger zygomaticus reactions to happy faces were further associated to increased activities in the caudate, MTG, and PCC. Corrugator reactions to angry expressions were further correlated with the hippocampus, insula, and STS.

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits."

            "abstract": "The approach/inhibition theory by Keltner, Gruenfeld, and Anderson (2003) predicts that powerful people should feel more positive and less negative emotions. To date, results of studies investigating this prediction are inconsistent. We fill this gap with four studies in which we investigated the role of different conceptualizations of power: felt power and position power. In Study 1, participants were made to feel more or less powerful and we tested how their felt power was related to different emotional states. In Studies 2, 3, and 4, participants were assigned to either a high or a low power role and engaged in an interaction with a virtual human, after which participants reported on how powerful they felt and the emotions they experienced during the interaction. We meta-analytically combined the results of the four studies and found that felt power was positively related to positive emotions (happiness and serenity) and negatively to negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness), whereas position power did not show any significant overall relation with any of the emotional states. Importantly, felt power mediated the relationship between position power and emotion. In summary, we show that how powerful a person feels in a given social interaction is the driving force linking the person's position power to his or her emotional states. (PsycINFO Database Record"

            "abstract": "Although therapeutic lifestyle modification (TLM) has been recommended as a cornerstone treatment of metabolic syndrome (MetS), little is known about the biobehavioral effects of a TLM program for patients in a community. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 6-month TLM program on MetS risk factors and health-related qualities of life (HRQOL) among middle-aged and older women in a community in Korea. Fifty-two women (mean age, 62.7 +/- 9.0 years) with MetS were recruited from 3 community health centers and were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 31) or control (n = 21) groups. The patients in the intervention group participated in supervised TLM sessions for 6 months. The TLM program included health monitoring, counseling, health education, exercise, and dieting. Metabolic risk factors and HRQOL were measured at baseline, during the study (month 3), at completion (month 6), and post completion (month 12) of the TLM program. Compared with the control group, the TLM group showed significantly greater reductions in body weight (P < .001) and waist circumference (P < .001); these effects were sustained for 6 months after intervention. With regard to HRQOL, the TLM group showed greater improvements in physical function (P = .017), general health (P < .001), vitality (P = .008), and mental health (P = .027). These improvements, however, were not sustained after the intervention. The results indicate that a nurse-led systematic TLM program may be an effective strategy for managing middle-aged and older women with MetS at a community level."

Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective.

Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect.

However, it remains unclear if the risk to the child is due to psychosocial factors associated with parental age or if those at higher risk for SCZ tend to have children at an earlier or later age.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine if there is a genetic association between SCZ and age at first birth (AFB) using genetically informative but independently ascertained data sets.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      This investigation used multiple independent genome-wide association study data sets. The SCZ sample comprised 18 957 SCZ cases and 22 673 controls in a genome-wide association study from the second phase of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the AFB sample comprised 12 247 genotyped women measured for AFB from the following 4 community cohorts: Estonia (Estonian Genome Center Biobank, University of Tartu), the Netherlands (LifeLines Cohort Study), Sweden (Swedish Twin Registry), and the United Kingdom (TwinsUK). Schizophrenia genetic risk for each woman in the AFB community sample was estimated using genetic effects inferred from the SCZ genome-wide association study.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      We tested if SCZ genetic risk was a significant predictor of response variables based on published polynomial functions that described the relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring in Denmark. We substituted AFB for maternal age in these functions, one of which was corrected for the age of the father, and found that the fit was superior for the model without adjustment for the father's age.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We observed a U-shaped relationship between SCZ risk and AFB in the community cohorts, consistent with the previously reported relationship between SCZ risk in offspring and maternal age when not adjusted for the age of the father. We confirmed that SCZ risk profile scores significantly predicted the response variables (coefficient of determination R2 = 1.1E-03, P = 4.1E-04), reflecting the published relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring by McGrath et al in 2014.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      This study provides evidence for a significant overlap between genetic factors associated with risk of SCZ and genetic factors associated with AFB. It has been reported that SCZ risk associated with increased maternal age is explained by the age of the father and that de novo mutations that occur more frequently in the germline of older men are the underlying causal mechanism. This explanation may need to be revised if, as suggested herein and if replicated in future studies, there is also increased genetic risk of SCZ in older mothers."

Although there has been significant progress in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of threat-related behaviors and anxiety, little progress was made with regard to new or improved treatments for mental disorders. A possible reason for this lack of success is the unknown predictive and cross-species translational validity of animal models used in preclinical studies. Re-translational approaches, therefore, seek to establish cross-species translational validity by identifying behavioral operations shared across species. To this end, we implemented a human open field test in virtual reality and measured behavioral indices derived from animal studies in three experiments ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]). In addition, we investigated the associations between anxious traits and such behaviors. Results indicated a strong similarity in behavior across species, i.e., participants in our study-like rodents in animal studies-preferred to stay in the outer region of the open field, as indexed by multiple behavioral parameters. However, correlational analyses did not clearly indicate that these behaviors were a function of anxious traits of participants. We conclude that the realized virtual open field test is able to elicit thigmotaxis and thus demonstrates cross-species validity of this aspect of the test. Modulatory effects of anxiety on human open field behavior should be examined further by incorporating possible threats in the virtual scenario and/or by examining participants with higher anxiety levels or anxiety disorder patients."

The physical properties of muscles, emotions, or the fluid properties with sweating and tears initiators are incorporated. The action units (AUs) of facial action coding system are merged with autonomous AUs to create expressions including sadness, anger with blushing, happiness with blushing, and fear. Fluid effects such as sweat and tears are simulated using the particle system and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods which are combined with facial animation technique to produce complex facial expressions. The effects of oxygenation of the facial skin color appearance are measured using the pulse oximeter system and the 3D skin analyzer. The result shows that virtual human facial expression is enhanced by mimicking actual sweating and tears simulations for all extreme expressions. The proposed method has contribution towards the development of facial animation industry and game as well as computer graphics."

In addition to cognitive and functional decline, diverse behavioral changes manifest with increasing severity over time, presenting significant management challenges for caregivers and health care professionals. Almost all patients with AD are affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms at some point during their illness; in some cases, symptoms occur prior to diagnosis of the dementia syndrome. Further, behavioral factors have been identified, which may have their origins in particular neurobiological processes, and respond to particular management strategies. Improved clarification of causes, triggers, and presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms will guide both research and clinical decision-making. Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is most commonly by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; its utility and future development are discussed, as are the limitations and difficulties encountered when quantifying behavioral responses in clinical trials. Evidence from clinical trials of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and from neurobiological studies, provides a range of management options that can be tailored to individual needs. We suggest that non-pharmacological interventions (including psychosocial/psychological counseling, interpersonal management and environmental management) should be attempted first, followed by the least harmful medication for the shortest time possible. Pharmacological treatment options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, need careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of each drug class."

The design of socially assistive robots, however, has so far focused largely on the more hedonic aims of supporting positive affect and happiness through interactions with robots. To explore how social robots might be able to support people's ikigai, we performed (1) in-depth interviews with 12 'ikigai experts' who formally support and/or study older adults (OAs)' ikigai and (2) 5 co-design workshop sessions with 10 such experts. Our interview findings show that expert practitioners define ikigai in a holistic way in their everyday experience and practice, incorporating physical, social, and mental activities that relate not only to the individual and their behaviors, but also to their relationships with other people and to their connection with the broader community (3 levels of ikigai). Our co-design workshops showed that ikigai experts were overall positive towards the use of social robots to support OAs' ikigai, particularly in the roles of an information-provider and social enabler that connects OAs to other people and activities in their communities. They also point out areas of potential risk, including the need to maintain OAs' independence, relationships with others, and privacy, which should be considered in design.

While most in the corporate world are aware of these deficiencies, the perception is that this fragmented system is difficult to change. PPG Industries, a medium-sized, Fortune 500 company manufacturing paints, stains, and sealants, has launched a successful and comprehensive program in the workplace that has improved outcomes for depressed employees. The PPG approach is practical, addressing each step in the process one at a time. This process began by establishing a close working relationship between all entities responsible for employee health, many of which are currently carved out. This enabled the company to have a comprehensive view of their depressed population and to examine their functional outcomes as well. In an effort to help identify depressed employees, the company educated their physicians and care managers and launched a confidential Web site to reduce mental health stigma and aid in employee screening and education. A multidisciplinary team was then assembled to facilitate the treatment of these patients. All of these steps were measurable, and the preliminary results of this process are summarized.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A disease management program that incorporates a multifaceted, collaborative approach to treat depression is feasible and may improve care and decrease cost to employers."

In terms of treatment, Echo-APP provides 10 treatment units, involving awareness of addiction, motivation enhancement, emotion regulation, meditation, etc. A total of 47 patients with methamphetamine dependence were eventually enrolled in the pilot study to receive a single session of the Echo-APP-based motivational enhancement treatment. The outcomes were assessed before and after the patients' treatment, including treatment motivation, craving levels, self-perception on the importance of drug abstinence, and their confidence in stopping the drug use.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the pilot study, scores on the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale and the questionnaire on motivation for abstaining from drugs significantly increased after the Echo-APP-based treatment (P<.001, Cohen d=-0.60), while craving was reduced (P=.01, Cohen d=0.38).

            "abstract": "Video game addiction, a common behavioral problem among college students, has been more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic; at the same time, females' video game usage has also attracted considerable research attention. Against this background and under the perspective of social interaction, this study aimed to examine the relationship between relational victimization and video game addiction among female college students, as well as its underlying mechanism-the mediating roles of social anxiety and parasocial relationships with virtual characters. Female college students (N = 437) were recruited to complete a set of questionnaires voluntarily in June 2022. Through the mediating effect analysis, the results found that (1) relational victimization was positively associated with female college students' video game addiction; (2) social anxiety and parasocial relationships with virtual characters could independently mediate this relation; (3) social anxiety and parasocial relationships with virtual characters were also the serial mediators in this association. These findings not only expand previous studies by revealing the social motivation of video game usage and the underlying mechanism accounting for video game addiction, but also provide basis and guidance for the prevention and intervention of video game addiction in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "abstract": "Safe, effective and affordable contraceptives have been available for a few decades, yet, in many countries, the struggle for reproductive rights continues. Children, still, are forced to give birth to children in many nations. In most industrialized countries, where contraceptive counselling and abortions have been options, fertility rates have reached all time lows. Effective contraception improves health and well-being as well and may be used for conditions other than birth control. Young girls often initially take oral contraceptives primarily to reduce menstrual pain and blood loss; they also welcome a contraceptive that eliminates menstrual bleeding. Women using oral contraceptives and Norplant experience about 50% reduction in menstrual blood; 90% reduction in blood loss is achieved with the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Mirena). Teenagers and their parents are often misinformed about the side-effects of oral contraceptives and birth control in general, which may adversely affect compliance. Adequate, user-friendly and supportive information about contraception is necessary to ensure proper use of the pill and other birth control methods. In addition, emergency contraceptives should be easily accessible. The mortality and morbidity of young women would be dramatically reduced by the global use of medical abortion as well. Only a combined effort by policy makers, educators, parents and health-care providers can enhance the reproductive (and future!) health of both young females and males."

Patients younger than 10 years frequently require daily general anesthesia (GA), which is resource intensive, expensive, potentially toxic, and anxiety and fear provoking. Audio-Visual Assisted Therapeutic Ambience in Radiation Therapy (AVATAR), a video streaming device, has been proposed as an alternative to anesthesia in patients aged 3 to 10 years. A pilot study evaluating the efficacy of this novel innovation is accruing, but patients younger than 3 years are ineligible.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and materials:\n        \n      \n      We simulated a 2-year-old with stage IV Wilms tumor for bilateral whole-lung and left-flank irradiation without GA. Using AVATAR, we attempted to deliver RT to this patient without sedation. Patient anxiety at the time of simulation and at the beginning, middle, and end of the treatment course was characterized using the validated Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS) measurement tool.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Although the patient tolerated computed tomography simulation without GA or AVATAR use, his mYPAS of 14 out of 18 indicated significant anxiety. Using AVATAR, all treatments were delivered without GA; his mYPASs were 5 and 4 (the lowest possible) and 4 at the first, midcourse, and final treatments, indicating no significant anxiety and a decrease from the pre-AVATAR baseline. Without GA, the time to deliver RT decreased by 66% from 90 to 30 minutes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We describe an expanded, previously unreported indication for AVATAR by demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to reduce or omit anesthesia in appropriate younger patients currently excluded from ongoing trials.

Mood disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period are common and have profound implications for women and their children. These include obstetric and neonatal complications, impaired mother-infant interactions, and, at the extreme, maternal suicide and infanticide. Because obstetrician-gynecologists are often the first (and sometimes the only) point of contact for young women in the health care system, familiarity with the presentation and treatment of depressive illness in the perinatal period is imperative. The goal of this review is to synthesize essential information on depressive illness in the perinatal period with a focus on its most common and severe presentations, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder can facilitate the selection of the best possible treatment alternatives. Counseling may be sufficient for perinatal women who have mild to moderate depression, but women who are severely depressed are likely to require antidepressant treatment. Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk for relapse if mood stabilizer medication is discontinued, and they are vulnerable to relapse near the time of delivery. Comanagement of their care with psychiatrists will increase their chances of avoiding a recurrence of illness."

Considering that balance dysfunction is a very common symptom in PD, we can presume that by its management we could positively influence patient's state of mind too. This review is an analysis of nonpharmacological methods shown to be effective and successful for improving balance in patients suffering from PD. Strategies such as general exercise, robotic assisted training, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, dance (such as tango or ballet), box, virtual reality-based, or neurofeedback-based techniques and so forth can significantly improve the stability in these patients. Beside this physical outcome, many methods have also shown effect on quality of life, depression level, enjoyment, and motivation to continue in practicing the method independently.

The relationship that a pregnant woman has with her care providers may possibly affect decisions that she makes concerning her antenatal care and may, in turn, influence the quality of the care provided. A patient-provider relationship scale (PPRS) was developed in Pretoria, South Africa with two aims: first, to quantify the patient-provider relationship in an antenatal population in a resource-limited setting and provide preliminary evidence of its reliability and validity; and second, to determine whether the patient-provider relationship has an effect on PMTCT. The instrument was administrated in a cross-sectional pilot study to a group of women at discharge after delivery (n=192) at two major hospitals in South West Tshwane. Statistical analysis of the instrument showed high reliability (α=0.91) and preliminary evidence of its validity including significant associations with participants' attitudes regarding the functioning of the clinics and a single statement (the clinic staff \"know me as a person,\" R=0.47, p<0.001) that has been shown previously to have a significant association with adherence to antiretroviral treatment. For HIV-positive participants, the PPRS was significantly associated with statements related to important components of the PMTCT cascade. In addition, those with substantially inadequate antenatal care (≤2 visits) and those who did not initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy, although eligible, had significantly poorer PPRS scores. The PPRS is a potentially useful, context-appropriate instrument that could have an important role in future research focused on improving PMTCT and decreasing the risk of HIV infection in children."

            "abstract": "Initial studies with healthy subjects and individuals with high risk for psychosis have suggested that virtual reality (VR) environments may be used to investigate social and psychological mechanisms of psychosis. One small study reported that VR can safely be used in individuals with current persecutory delusions. The present pilot study investigated the feasibility and potential negative side effects of exposure to different virtual social risk environments in patients with first episode psychosis and in healthy controls. Seventeen patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) participated in four virtual experiments during which they walked for 3.5-4 minutes in a virtual café, looking for avatars with digits on their clothing. The level of paranoid thoughts, as well as psychological, physiological, and behavioral correlates of paranoid thoughts, were measured in different virtual social risk environments, manipulating two factors: population density and ethnicity of avatars. FEP and HC frequently had paranoid thoughts about avatars. Paranoia in the real world correlated strongly with paranoid thoughts about avatars in virtual environments (Spearman's ρ=0.67 and 0.54 in FEP and HC respectively, p<0.01). FEP kept a smaller distance to avatars than HC. In FEP, but not in HC, galvanic skin response was significantly stronger in virtual environments with avatars of other ethnicity than in the own ethnicity condition. These results suggest that VR is an acceptable and sufficiently realistic method to use in patients with first episode psychosis. VR research may help to increase our understanding of the social and psychological mechanisms of psychosis and to develop new treatment applications."

            "abstract": "So far, evidence for unskilled social behavior in high socially anxious individuals (HAs) is equivocal. One reason may be that shortcomings are often not directly observable. An important shortcoming would be a lack of unintentional mimicry because it communicates sympathy and rapport with the interaction partner. Therefore, we tested whether HAs show less unintentional mimicry of others. Twenty-nine HAs and 43 low socially anxious individuals (LAs)--all female--watched a virtual man (avatar) who displayed a fixed set of head movements while giving an opinionated speech. Four raters scored whether the participants mimicked the avatar's movements within 4 s. The results indicate that HAs did indeed mimic significantly less than LAs. Lacking such pro-social behavior, HAs may indeed be evaluated as less sympathetic by others, confirming their fears of being disliked."

I propose to go through the main ethical questions that have arisen; to describe how my hospital team has reorganized itself to meet the new demands and questions, in particular by opening a unit dedicated to people with autism and challenging behaviors affected by COVID-19; and to address, in a context of national discussion, how the discipline has sought to understand the conditions of a certain well-being during quarantine.

Created using a human-centered design process with young adults treated for cancer, Vivibot content includes 4 weeks of positive psychology skills, daily emotion ratings, video, and other material produced by survivors, and periodic feedback check-ins. All participants were assessed for psychosocial well-being via online surveys at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Analyses examined chatbot engagement and open-ended feedback on likability and perceived helpfulness and compared experimental and control groups with regard to anxiety and depression symptoms and positive and negative emotion changes between baseline and 4 weeks. To verify the main effects, follow-up analyses compared changes in the main outcomes between 4 and 8 weeks in the control group once participants had access to all chatbot content.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 45 young adults (36 women; mean age: 25 [SD 2.9]; experimental group: n=25; control group: n=20) were analyzed.

Several interactive technologies for mental health have been proposed and are aiming to make therapeutic service more accessible, but most of them only provide one-way passive contents for their users, such as psycho-education, health monitoring, and clinical assessment. We present a robotic coach that not only delivers interactive positive psychology interventions but also provides other useful skills to build rapport with college students. Results from our on-campus housing deployment feasibility study showed that the robotic intervention showed significant association with increases in students' psychological well-being, mood, and motivation to change. We further found that students' personality traits were associated with the intervention outcomes as well as their working alliance with the robot and their satisfaction with the interventions. Also, students' working alliance with the robot was shown to be associated with their pre-to-post change in motivation for better well-being. Analyses on students' behavioral cues showed that several verbal and nonverbal behaviors were associated with the change in self-reported intervention outcomes. The qualitative analyses on the post-study interview suggest that the robotic coach's companionship made a positive impression on students, but also revealed areas for improvement in the design of the robotic coach. Results from our feasibility study give insight into how learning users' traits and recognizing behavioral cues can help an AI agent provide personalized intervention experiences for better mental health outcomes."

She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit intubated and mechanically ventilated for postcardiac arrest management. Investigation of thyroid storm was pursued after the patient was noted to be persistently hypertensive, tachycardic and agitated despite high levels of sedation. Thyroid function tests confirmed the clinical suspicion of progressive thyrotoxicosis, with associated imaging consistent with thyroid inflammation secondary to band-like traumatic pressure to the lower half of the thyroid gland. Treatment with β-blockers and a thionamide resulted in the eventual resolution of her thyroid storm state and normalisation of her thyroid function. We conclude that traumatically induced thyroid storm should be considered in all hypermetabolic patients following blunt neck injuries including hanging, and that traditional treatment of hyperthyroidism can be successfully applied."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Most suicidality literature in Huntington disease (HD) is based on natural history studies or retrospective reviews, but reports on risk factors from clinical trials are limited.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed 609 participants from 2CARE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with up to 5 years of follow-up, for risk factors related to suicidality. The primary outcome variable was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of either suicidal ideation or attempt. We also considered time from randomization until the first suicide attempt as a secondary outcome variable.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, antidepressant or anxiolytic use, and prior suicide attempt at baseline were associated with time to ideation or attempt. Baseline employment status, marital status, CAG repeat length, tetrabenazine use, and treatment assignment (coenzyme Q10 or placebo) were not associated with suicidality. Time-dependent variables from the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Behavioral Assessment were associated with time to suicidal ideation or attempt, driven mainly by items related to depressed mood, low self-esteem/guilt, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, irritability, and compulsions. Variables associated with time to suicide attempt alone were generally similar.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These data suggest psychiatric comorbidities in HD are predictive of suicidal behavior while participating in clinical trials, reinforcing the importance of clinical surveillance and treatment towards lessening risk during participation and perhaps beyond. Designing a composite algorithm for early prediction of suicide attempts in HD may be of value, particularly given anticipated trials aimed at disease modification are likely to be long-term.\n    \n\n\n          Clinicaltrialsgov identifier:\n        \nNCT00608881."

Its central symptom is the binge, which is not followed by compensatory behaviours as in bulimia nervosa. Therefore, the patients are generally obese. The prevalence of the disorder is 1-3% in the general population, but much higher in help-seeking obese subjects. The two main goals of the therapy is body weight reduction, and the cessation of binges. In the pharmacotherapy of binge eating disorder the antidepressants are recommended mainly in the case of unsuccessful psychotherapy, and in treating comorbid depression. In the field of psychotherapy data are available mainly on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behaviour therapy, behavioural weight loss, and interpersonal therapy. Effectivity studies on new therapeutic methods and treatment combinations are needed as well as long term follow-up studies."

We start from a basic rule-based expert system and iteratively move towards a more sophisticated platform composed of specialized chatbots each aiming to assess and pre-diagnose a specific mental health disorder using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. During each iteration, user feedback from psychiatrists and patients are incorporated into the iterative design process. A survival of the fittest approach is also used to assess the continuation or removal of a specialized mental health chatbot in each generational design. We anticipate that our unique and novel approach can be used for the development of conversational mental health agents with the ultimate goal of designing a smart chatbot that delivers evidence-based care and contributes to scaling up services while decreasing the pressure on mental health care providers."

On the other hand, children with autism spectrum disorder have further complications regarding their social interactions with other humans. In this paper, a fully Robotic Social Environment (RSE), designed to simulate the needed social environment for children, especially those with autism is described. An RSE can be used to simulate many social situations, such as affective interpersonal interactions, in which observational learning can take place. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed RSE, it has been tested on a group of children with autism, who had difficulties in emotion recognition, which in turn, can influence social interaction. An A-B-A single case study was designed to show how RSE can help children with autism recognize four basic facial expressions, i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, through observing the social interactions of two robots speaking about these facial expressions. The results showed that the emotion recognition skills of the participating children were improved. Furthermore, the results showed that the children could maintain and generalize their emotion recognition skills after the intervention period. In conclusion, the study shows that the proposed RSE, along with other rehabilitation methods, can be effective in improving the emotion recognition skills of children with autism and preparing them to enter human social environments."

A literature search identified more than 100 articles pertaining to suspected immunologic influences on schizophrenia published over the past 15 years. Schizophrenia researchers have explored a wide range of potential immune system-related causal or contributory factors, including neurobiological and neuroanatomical disorders, genetic abnormalities, and environmental influences such as maternal perinatal infection. Efforts to establish an immunologic basis for schizophrenia and identify reliable immune markers continue to be hindered by sampling challenges and methodological problems. In aggregate, the available evidence indicates that at least some cases of schizophrenia have an immunologic component, suggesting that immune-focused prevention strategies (e.g., counseling of pregnant women to avoid immune stressors) and close monitoring of at-risk children are appropriate. While antipsychotics remain the standard treatments for schizophrenia, a variety of drugs with immunologic effects have been investigated as adjunctive therapies, with variable and sometimes conflicting results; these include the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib, immune-modulating agents (e.g., azathioprine and various anticytokine agents such as atlizumab, anakinra, and tumor necrosis factor-α blockers), and an investigational anti-interferon-γ agent.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The published evidence indicates that immune system dysfunction related to genetic, environmental, and neurobiological influences may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia in a subset of patients."

Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first-line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short-term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated.

Abnormal tracking eye movements are common. Recurrent seizures after the onset of gait ataxia have been reported with variable frequencies among different families. Some individuals have cognitive dysfunction, behavioral disturbances, mood disorders, mild pyramidal signs, and peripheral neuropathy. Age of onset ranges from 12 to 48 years.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      Diagnosis of SCA10 is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous ATTCT pentanucleotide-repeat expansion in ATXN10. Affected individuals have expanded alleles with up to 4,500 ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats; intermediate alleles (280 to 850 repeats) may show reduced penetrance.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily focused on control of seizures, as uncontrolled seizures may lead to potentially fatal status epilepticus. Conventional anticonvulsants such as levetiracetam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid achieve reasonable control, although occasional breakthrough seizures may occur. Treatment measures for ataxia: canes / walkers / mobilized chairs; standard home modifications; exercise and physical therapy; and weight control to avoid difficulty with ambulation and mobility. For dysphagia: percutaneous placement of a gastrostomy tube for both prevention of aspiration and maintenance of nutritional intake; vitamin supplementation. For dysarthria: speech therapy and speech/communication assistive devices. Weighted utensils and dressing hooks for upper-limb coordination issues. Mild tranquilizers may be helpful for those with anxiety.\n    \n\nSurveillance: Clinical neurology evaluation every four to six months; video esophagrams to evaluate those with dysphagia.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol and drugs that are known to adversely affect cerebellar functions; falls, which may compromise motor function; activities that are potentially dangerous to individuals with ataxia or epilepsy.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      SCA10 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the repeat expansion. The risk of developing the SCA10 phenotype in individuals with expanded alleles in the intermediate range (280-850) is uncertain because of the apparently reduced penetrance. Anticipation has been observed in some families with paternal (but not maternal) transmission of the pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the diagnosis has been established by molecular genetic testing in an affected family member."

To extend and improve on these platforms, the field of robotics has been increasingly included in conversations of how to deliver technology-assisted, interactive, and responsive mental health and psychological well-being interventions. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are robotic technology platforms with audio, visual, and movement capabilities that are being developed to interact with individuals socially while also assisting them with management of their physical and psychological well-being.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe prevalence of child and adolescent mental health issues is increasing faster than the number of services available, leading to a shortfall. Mental health chatbots are a highly scalable method to address this gap. Manage Your Life Online (MYLO) is an artificially intelligent chatbot that emulates the method of levels therapy. Method of levels is a therapy that uses curious questioning to support the sustained awareness and exploration of current problems.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a co-designed interface for MYLO in young people aged 16 to 24 years with mental health problems.\n## METHODS\nAn iterative co-design phase occurred over 4 months, in which feedback was elicited from a group of young people (n=7) with lived experiences of mental health issues. This resulted in the development of a progressive web application version of MYLO that could be used on mobile phones. We conducted a case series to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO in 13 young people over 2 weeks. During this time, the participants tested MYLO and completed surveys including clinical outcomes and acceptability measures. We then conducted focus groups and interviews and used thematic analysis to obtain feedback on MYLO and identify recommendations for further improvements.\n## RESULTS\nMost participants were positive about their experience of using MYLO and would recommend MYLO to others. The participants enjoyed the simplicity of the interface, found it easy to use, and rated it as acceptable using the System Usability Scale. Inspection of the use data found evidence that MYLO can learn and adapt its questioning in response to user input. We found a large effect size for the decrease in participants' problem-related distress and a medium effect size for the increase in their self-reported tendency to resolve goal conflicts (the proposed mechanism of change) in the testing phase. Some patients also experienced a reliable change in their clinical outcome measures over the 2 weeks.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe established the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO. The initial outcomes suggest that MYLO has the potential to support the mental health of young people and help them resolve their own problems. We aim to establish whether the use of MYLO leads to a meaningful reduction in participants' symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether these are maintained over time by conducting a randomized controlled evaluation trial.\n"

One of the major concerns raised by the family members is the safety and well-being of their elderly family members when living independently in a home environment. To address this issue, assistive technology solutions have been available in the market. Despite their availability and proliferation, these types of solutions are not popular with the elderly due to their intrusive nature, privacy-related issues, social stigma, and fear of losing human interaction. This study shares the experience in the development of a digital photo frame system that helps family members to check the well-being of the elderly, exploiting their desire to remain socially connected.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to iteratively design, implement, and assess the usability, user friendliness, and acceptability of a tablet-based system to check the well-being of the elderly.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our study methodology comprises three separate stages: initial system development, contextual assessment, and comparative case study evaluation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the first stage, requirements were elicited from the elderly to design a well-being check prototype.

These would lower their operating cost by reducing visits by care providers to the homes of the elderly. In the third stage, the results highlighted the difference (between users in India and Australia) in the levels of familiarity of the elderly with this technology. Some elderly participants at the Kalyani Institute for Study, Planning and Action for Rural Change, India latched onto this technology quickly while a few refused to use the system.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe high levels of unmet needs in relation to provision of self-care information reported by women living with breast cancer suggests that pre-chemotherapy education is suboptimal. Chatbots are emerging as a promising platform to provide education to patients helping them self-manage their symptoms at home. However, evidence from empirical studies on the effect of chatbots education on women living with breast cancer self-care behaviors and symptoms management are scarce.\n## METHODS\nThis three-arm randomized controlled trial was performed in a chemotherapy day care center within an oncology center in Egypt. A total of 150 women living with breast cancer were randomly selected and randomized into three groups: the ChemoFreeBot group (n = 50), the nurse-led education group (n = 50), and the routine care group (n = 50). In the ChemoFreeBot group, women were given a link to interact with ChemoFreeBot and ask questions about their symptoms and self-care interventions by typing questions or keywords at any time. On the same day as their first day of chemotherapy, the nurse-led education group received face to face teaching sessions from the researcher (nurse) about side effects and self-care interventions. The routine care group received general knowledge during their chemotherapy session about self-care interventions. The self-care behaviors effectiveness and the frequency, severity and distress of chemotherapy side effects were measured at baseline and postintervention for the three groups. The ChemoFreeBot's usability was assessed.\n## RESULTS\nThe mixed design repeated measures ANOVA analyses revealed a statistically significant both group effect and interaction effect of group*time, indicating a significant difference between the three groups in terms of the physical symptoms frequency (F = 76.075, p < .001, F = 147, p < .001, respectively), severity (F = 96.440, p < .001, F = 220.462, p < .001), and distress (F = 77.171, p < .001, F = 189.680, p < .001); the psychological symptoms frequency (F = 63.198, p < .001, F = 137.908, p < .001), severity (F = 62.137, p < .001), (F = 136.740, p < .001), and distress (F = 43.003, p < .001, F = 168.057, p < .001), and the effectiveness of self-care behaviors (F = 20.134, p < .001, F = 24.252, p < .001, respectively). The Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment in showed that women in the ChemoFreeBot group experienced a statistically significant less frequent, less severe and less distressing physical and psychological symptoms and higher effective self-care behaviors than those in the nurse-led education and routine care groups (p > .001).\n## CONCLUSION\nChemoFreeBot was a useful and cost-effective tool to improve increase self-care behavior and reduce chemotherapy side effects in women living with breast cancer through the provision of personalized education and the improvement of the accessibility to real-time and high-quality information compared to \"one size fits all\" approach used by nurses to provide the information. ChemoFreeBot can be an empowering tool to assist nurses to educate women with breast cancer and allow women to take an active role in managing their symptom.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThis study was retrospectively registered in the University hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Center, Clinical Trials Registry on 26/09/2022; Registration No:R000055389,Trial ID:UMIN000048955.\n"

Finally, the STAI test was administered to measure trait (TAI) and state (SAI) anxiety, both immediately after consultation, and later on, when patients returned home. We observed that the possibility to join a FPP implied important emotional aspects, and that the presence of a psychologist was helpful to integrate technical information and emotions as well as to reduce trait and state anxiety levels.

In 1989, 2.7% of all appointments were about the use of antipsychotic medication. In 2001, 7.4% of appointments were regarding antipsychotic drug use. This 170% increase was due to an increase in appointments for atypical antipsychotics as the number of appointments for conventional antipsychotics remained relatively constant over the 12-y period.

To investigate these issues, we performed fMRI while participants observed dynamic facial expressions of anger and happiness and while they executed facial muscle activity associated with angry and happy facial expressions. Conjunction analyses revealed that, in addition to neocortical regions (i.e., the right ventral premotor cortex and right supplementary motor area), bilateral amygdala, right basal ganglia, bilateral cerebellum, and right facial nerve nucleus were activated during both the observation/execution tasks. Group independent component analysis revealed that a functional network component involving the aforementioned regions were activated during both observation/execution tasks. The data suggest that the motor synchronization of emotional facial expressions involves a widespread observation/execution matching network encompassing the neocortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem."

            "abstract": "ObjectivePreliminary findings suggest that different kinds of meditation could work on diverse cognitive and psychological processes. The present study aimed at disentangling the effects of three mindfulness techniques on mental rumination and subjective time perspective. Design: 75 young healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: mindful breathing, body scan, observing-thoughts meditation and an active control condition. The meditation groups practiced mindfulness daily and attended weekly group meetings for 8 weeks, while the control group was involved in reading and discussing a book about mindfulness. Main outcome measures: Self-report measures of mindfulness skills, ruminative thinking, attitude towards time, anxiety, depression and personality traits. Results: In all meditation conditions, analysis of covariance showed a significant improvement in mindfulness skills compared to the control group. We found a specific effect of mindful breathing in reducing participants' tendency to brooding and in increasing their positive vision of the future, compared to all other conditions. Conclusions: As expected, we found some differential effects: breathing meditation helped practitioners to train more effectively their ability to disengage from maladaptive ruminative thoughts, which could be reflected in a more optimistic attitude toward the future. These results provide useful information to structure better mindfulness-based interventions."

            "abstract": "Clinical characteristics:\n        \nATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes.\n    \n\nRDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported.AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype.CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary.\n\n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3.\n\n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education.\n    \n\nPrevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided.\n    \n\nPrevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet.\n    \n\nSurveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP).\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid:\n\n\nRDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise.AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime).CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy.\n\n\nPregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \nATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP."

            "abstract": "Although short-term therapy for patients with anxiety disorders has been the accepted mode of therapy, it has become increasingly evident that certain patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and chronic illness may require longer-term therapy. Therapeutic goals for such patients include reducing anxiety symptoms, returning the patient to normal or near-normal functioning, and improving quality of life. Clinicians must choose the appropriate drug regimen with regard to duration, continuous versus intermittent treatment, and administration on a daily versus as-needed basis. Because of the nature of some anxiety disorders, intermittent therapy very often may be preferred. Benzodiazepines are highly effective and safe anxiolytics, but with continuous use these agents have demonstrated psychologic and physical dependence problems. Other agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, also relieve anxiety, although they have been shown to be unsuited for indiscriminate use. Buspirone, a newer anxiolytic, seems to be both effective and without abuse or dependence potential. In all cases, the prudent clinician should combine good patient management within the context of a good doctor-patient relationship."

Manifestations in untreated individuals vary among and within families.\n    \n\nLiver disease can include recurrent jaundice, simple acute self-limited hepatitis-like illness, autoimmune-type hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, or chronic liver disease.Neurologic presentations can include dysarthria, movement disorders (tremors, involuntary movements, chorea, choreoathetosis), dystonia (mask-like facies, rigidity, gait disturbance, pseudobulbar involvement), dysautonomia, seizures, sleep disorders, or insomnia.Psychiatric disturbances can include depression, bipolar disorder / bipolar spectrum disorder, neurotic behaviors, personality changes, or psychosis.Other multisystem involvement can include the eye (Kayser-Fleischer rings), hemolytic anemia, the kidneys, the endocrine glands, and the heart.\n\n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of Wilson disease is established in most instances by a combination of biochemical findings (low serum ceruloplasmin concentration, low serum concentration of total copper, and increased urinary copper excretion) and/or detection of biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ATP7B identified by molecular genetic testing, based on the diagnostic scoring system developed at the 8th International Meeting on Wilson Disease.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Lifelong medical interventions to prevent/treat copper accumulation need to be instituted as soon as possible in all individuals with Wilson disease whether they are asymptomatic (i.e., individuals with biallelic ATP7B pathogenic variants who have no clinical manifestations or tissue damage related to Wilson disease), clinically asymptomatic (i.e., individuals with biallelic ATP7B pathogenic variants who have no clinical manifestations of Wilson disease, but have Wilson disease-related tissue damage), or symptomatic (i.e., individuals with clinical manifestations of Wilson disease and Wilson disease-related tissue damage), regardless of age and including pregnant women. As Wilson disease treatment decisions might be complex, the consultation of disease experts (primarily hepatologists and neurologists) or Wilson disease centers of excellence is advised. The first-line therapy is copper chelating agents (D-penicillamine and trientine). Zinc salts (which interfere with absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract) cannot be used with a copper chelating agent and are most effective after initial decoppering with a chelating agent; however, in some individuals zinc salts can be used as an initial treatment. Orthotopic liver transplantation is used for individuals who fail to respond to medical therapy or present with fulminant acute liver failure.\n    \n\n      \n      The goals of supportive treatment for extrahepatic manifestations of individuals with symptomatic Wilson disease are individualized to maximize function and reduce complications. Depending on their clinical manifestations, symptomatic individuals may require specialists in neurology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physiatry, orthopedics, nutrition, speech-language pathology, social work, and psychology/psychiatry.\n    \n\nSurveillance: To assess treatment effectiveness and adherence to medical interventions that prevent/treat copper accumulation, the following are recommended:\n    \n\nAt least twice annually: assessment of serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, liver biochemistries, international normalized ratio, complete blood count, urinalysis, and physical examination including neurologic assessmentAt least once annually: measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of copper\n\n\n      \n      Monitoring the individual's response to supportive treatment for extrahepatic manifestations and the emergence of new manifestations is per the recommendations of the treating clinical specialists.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Foods very high in copper (liver, brain, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, and nuts) should be avoided, especially at the beginning of treatment.\n    \n\n      \n      In case of biochemical abnormalities in liver function tests or transaminases, alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged.\n    \n\nEvaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of medical interventions to prevent/treat copper accumulation.\n    \n\nPregnancy management: Treatment must be continued during pregnancy because of the risk for fulminant hepatic failure or irreversible neurologic deterioration. Because of possible adverse effects on the fetus from chelating agents, the dose should be kept as low as possible.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      Wilson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ATP7B pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once both ATP7B pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier and predictive genetic testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for Wilson disease are possible."

Supporting this possibility, promising work has harnessed big data and emergent technologies to automatically predict stable levels of one specific emotion, happiness, at the community (e.g., counties) and trait (i.e., people) levels. Furthermore, research in affective science has shown that nonverbal vocal bursts (e.g., sighs, gasps) and specific acoustic features (e.g., pitch, energy) can differentiate between distinct emotions (e.g., anger, happiness) and that machine-learning algorithms can detect these differences. Yet, to our knowledge, no work has tested whether computers can automatically detect normal, everyday, within-person fluctuations in one emotional state from acoustic analysis. To address this issue in the context of happy mood, across 3 studies (total N = 20,197), we asked participants to repeatedly report their state happy mood and to provide audio recordings-including both direct speech and ambient sounds-from which we extracted acoustic features. Using three different machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines) and two sets of acoustic features, we found that acoustic features yielded minimal predictive insight into happy mood above chance. Neither multilevel modeling analyses nor human coders provided additional insight into state happy mood. These findings suggest that it is not yet possible to automatically assess fluctuations in one emotional state (i.e., happy mood) from acoustic analysis, pointing to a critical future direction for affective scientists interested in acoustic analysis of emotion and automated emotion detection.

            "abstract": "Emotion has been a subject undergoing intensive research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience over several decades. Recently, more and more studies of emotion have adopted automatic rather than manual methods of facial emotion recognition to analyze images or videos of human faces. Compared to manual methods, these computer-vision-based, automatic methods can help objectively and rapidly analyze a large amount of data. These automatic methods have also been validated and believed to be accurate in their judgments. However, these automatic methods often rely on statistical learning models (e.g., deep neural networks), which are intrinsically inductive and thus suffer from problems of induction. Specifically, the models that were trained primarily on Western faces may not generalize well to accurately judge Eastern faces, which can then jeopardize the measurement invariance of emotions in cross-cultural studies. To demonstrate such a possibility, the present study carries out a cross-racial validation of two popular facial emotion recognition systems-FaceReader and DeepFace-using two Western and two Eastern face datasets. Although both systems could achieve overall high accuracies in the judgments of emotion category on the Western datasets, they performed relatively poorly on the Eastern datasets, especially in recognition of negative emotions. While these results caution the use of these automatic methods of emotion recognition on non-Western faces, the results also suggest that the measurements of happiness outputted by these automatic methods are accurate and invariant across races and hence can still be utilized for cross-cultural studies of positive psychology."

Thus, also counselling by pharmacists becomes more important in this area. This study focuses on how community pharmacists see their own role when counselling persons with prescriptions for psychotropic medication and how this differs from counselling persons with other types of prescriptions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Based on the Toronto Community Pharmacists' Questionnaire an online questionnaire was developed with the assistance of the Austrian Pharmacists Association. This instrument elicits pharmacists' attitudes toward and professional interactions with users of psychotropic drugs on the one hand and of cardiovascular medication on the other.

Overall it was reported, that new customers with psychotropic prescriptions were less often counselled than those with prescriptions for cardiovascular medication. The main reasons for this difference seem to be the lack of privacy in public pharmacies, the fear of stigmatising customers with psychotropic medication and a perceived lack of training concerning the treatment of mental disorders. In addition to improving such training, it was suggested that seminars and workshops for communication skills should be organised.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The reduced frequency in counselling new customers with psychotropic medication is related to a lack of privacy in public pharmacies, fear of stigmatising customers and a perceived need for improving the training on the treatment of mental disorders."

Therapies targeting social cognition deficits are in high demand given that these deficits are related to a loss of functioning and quality of life in several neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, affective disorders, and acquired brain injury. Therefore, developing new therapies would greatly improve the quality of life of this large cohort of patients. A questionnaire based on the second revision of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) questionnaire was used for this study. One hundred and twenty-four mental health professionals responded to the questionnaire after viewing a video presentation of the system. The results confirmed that mental health professionals showed a positive intention to use virtual reality tools to train affect recognition, as they allow manipulation of social interaction with patients. Further studies should be conducted with therapists from other countries to reach more conclusions."

The latter depends upon timing after transplant, prepregnancy kidney function, and continuation of immunosuppressive agents at appropriate levels. Graft function is not adversely affected if preconception kidney function was normal. Acute rejection, 9%-14%, must be immediately addressed, with kidney biopsy if necessary. Blood pressure should be meticulously managed; serious morbidity results from poor control. Blood pressures >130/80 mmHg require acceptable antihypertensives: beta-blockers, alpha-methyldopa, hydralazine, and calcium channel blockers. Preeclampsia requires seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate, with expeditious delivery. Screening for urinary tract infections with aggressive treatment and for opportunistic infections that may affect the fetus is essential. Surveillance for fetal anomalies, growth, and antenatal testing is important. Steroids for fetal lung maturity are indicated for preterm delivery. Vaginal birth is preferred, reserving cesarean for obstetrical indications, with pain management similar to normal laboring patients. Surveillance for infection postpartum is warranted. Conflicting information exists regarding safety of breastfeeding with immunosuppressive drugs; immunosuppressive medication must be adjusted to prepregnancy levels and contraception counseling addressed."

The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and American Psychiatric Association initially released guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care [American Psychiatric Association, 1993.

The present study provides a contemporary review of outcome data for psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in primary care and extends beyond AHCPR guidelines insofar as focusing on feasibility and process variables, including the training and proficiency of primary care treatment providers, cost-effectiveness of primary care interventions, and predictors of treatment response and relapse. Based on current guidelines, problem-solving therapy (PST-PC), interpersonal psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy would be considered efficacious interventions for major depression, with cognitive-behavioral and cognitive therapy considered possibly efficacious.

Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI).

Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate.

Along with nutritional factors, a comprehensive approach to preventing dental caries in preschool children must include improved general dietary habits, good oral hygiene, appropriate use of fluorides, and access to preventive and restorative dental care."

            "abstract": "Frequently overlooked, depression is a very common complex disorder that causes significant morbidity and mortality. This article provides a review of three commonly encountered depressive disorders in primary care settings: adjustment disorder with depressed mood, dysthymia and major depression. Since many individuals minimize the affective symptoms of depression, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion when clients present with vague somatic complaints, such as fatigue, headache, constipation and difficulty sleeping. To reach an accurate diagnosis, a thorough history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed. Numerous rating scales are presented to aid assessment. Common intervention strategies for the treatment of depressive disorders include education, drug therapy, and supportive individual and family counseling."

Patients in the isolation ward may have psychological problems due to long-term hospitalization, the development of the epidemic, and the inability to see their families. A medical assistive robot (MAR), acting as an intermediary of communication, can be deployed to address these mental pressures.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      CareDo, a MAR with telepresence and teleoperation functions, was developed in this work for remote health care.

For the telepresence system, a web real-time communications solution is used for the multiuser chat system and a convolutional neural network is used for expression recognition. For the teleoperation system, an incremental motion mapping method is used for operating the robot remotely. A clinical trial of this system was conducted at First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the clinical trials, tasks such as video chatting, emotion detection, and medical supplies delivery were performed via the CareDo robot. Seven voice commands were set for performing system wakeup, video chatting, and system exiting. Durations from 1 to 3 seconds of common commands were set to improve voice command detection. The facial expression was recorded 152 times for a patient in 1 day for the psychological intervention. The recognition accuracy reached 95% and 92.8% for happy and neutral expressions, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients and health care workers can use this MAR in the isolation ward for telehealth care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "abstract": "One motive for behaving as the agent of another's aggression appears to be anchored in as yet unelucidated mechanisms of obedience to authority. In a recent partial replication of Milgram's obedience paradigm within an immersive virtual environment, participants administered pain to a female virtual human and observed her suffering. Whether the participants' response to the latter was more akin to other-oriented empathic concern for her well-being or to a self-oriented aversive state of personal distress in response to her distress is unclear. Using the stimuli from that study, this event-related fMRI-based study analysed brain activity during observation of the victim in pain versus not in pain. This contrast revealed activation in pre-defined brain areas known to be involved in affective processing but not in those commonly associated with affect sharing (e.g., ACC and insula). We then examined whether different dimensions of dispositional empathy predict activity within the same pre-defined brain regions: While personal distress and fantasy (i.e., tendency to transpose oneself into fictional situations and characters) predicted brain activity, empathic concern and perspective taking predicted no change in neuronal response associated with pain observation. These exploratory findings suggest that there is a distinct pattern of brain activity associated with observing the pain-related behaviour of the victim within the context of this social dilemma, that this observation evoked a self-oriented aversive state of personal distress, and that the objective \"reality\" of pain is of secondary importance for this response. These findings provide a starting point for experimentally more rigorous investigation of obedience."

This study examines whether lifetime traumatic events including physical and sexual abuse, are associated with antiretroviral nonadherence. We present a cross-sectional analysis of the Coping with HIV/AIDS in the Southeast (CHASE) Study, analyzing data from the enrollment interview and medical records of study subjects. The CHASE Study is a prospective cohort study of consecutively sampled HIV-infected subjects from infectious diseases clinics in five southern states; Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Four hundred seventy-four (78%) of the 611 CHASE study subjects reported being treated with antiretroviral medications at enrollment and are included in this analysis. Nonadherence was defined as the patient's self-report of missing any doses of their antiretroviral medications over the previous 7 days. Among study subjects, 54% reported a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, 91% reported at least one lifetime traumatic event, and 24% reported nonadherence with their antiretrovirals. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the number of categories of lifetime traumatic events (p = 0.03), the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol score (p = 0.02), and being uninsured (p = 0.04) were associated with antiretroviral nonadherence. The finding that lifetime traumatic events are associated with antiretroviral nonadherence, particularly among those who have been traumatized in multiple ways, highlights the complex and often persisting manifestations of such trauma and calls for further investigation."

Maternal depressive symptomatology appears to have a significant effect on the perception of teratogenic risk and may further limit the validity of a decision-making process.

Prevalence rates range from 59 to nearly 100% depending on the clinical status of the cancer. Except for chemotherapy-induced anemia, the mechanisms responsible for CRF are not yet completely understood. Therefore, CRF may be influenced by multiple possible somatic and psychosocial factors. CRF has been shown as either a short-term side effect of adjuvant cancer therapy or a chronic long-term late effect. Compared with other symptoms, such as pain or nausea, CRF is more distressing and often long lasting, with a strong impact on daily living and quality of life. The concept of fatigue has been widely elaborated and operationalized in different dimensions within the last few decades and specific instruments assessing fatigue in cancer populations have been developed. To support patients and alleviate CRF symptoms various treatment strategies are discussed in this article, including information and counseling, enhancement of activities, exercise and sports therapy, psychosocial interventions as well as pharmacological treatment.

            "abstract": "Clinicians often believe that cachexia is caused by cancer and anorexia as a toxicity of chemotherapy or targeted anti-cancer agents. It is now recognized that chemotherapy and certain targeted agents cause sarcopenia which reduce physical function and quality of life. Pre-treatment sarcopenia predicts chemotherapy toxicity, reduced response, increased disability, poor anti-tumor response and survival. Though bioelectrical impedance and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans have been used in the past for body composition measurements, CT scan cuts at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebral body with measurement of skeletal muscle and visceral and subcutaneous fat areas has become standard. Nonpharmacological approaches to reducing sarcopenia during chemotherapy includes resistance training and dietary counselling. Pharmacologic therapies include vitamin D replacement if depleted, omega-3 fatty acids, testosterone and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS) and ghrelin. A comprehensive multimodal and multiple drug approach is likely to be better than single modalities. However, this is yet to be proven. Finally, it is not known if intervening to prevent or reverse sarcopenia will have a clinical benefit in terms of better tolerance to cancer therapy, physical function, well-being, tumor response and survival. Reversing sarcopenia and improving objective outcomes should be the goal of therapy."

            "abstract": "Since Darwin's seminal works, the universality of facial expressions of emotion has remained one of the longest standing debates in the biological and social sciences. Briefly stated, the universality hypothesis claims that all humans communicate six basic internal emotional states (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sad) using the same facial movements by virtue of their biological and evolutionary origins [Susskind JM, et al. (2008) Nat Neurosci 11:843-850]. Here, we refute this assumed universality. Using a unique computer graphics platform that combines generative grammars [Chomsky N (1965) MIT Press, Cambridge, MA] with visual perception, we accessed the mind's eye of 30 Western and Eastern culture individuals and reconstructed their mental representations of the six basic facial expressions of emotion. Cross-cultural comparisons of the mental representations challenge universality on two separate counts. First, whereas Westerners represent each of the six basic emotions with a distinct set of facial movements common to the group, Easterners do not. Second, Easterners represent emotional intensity with distinctive dynamic eye activity. By refuting the long-standing universality hypothesis, our data highlight the powerful influence of culture on shaping basic behaviors once considered biologically hardwired. Consequently, our data open a unique nature-nurture debate across broad fields from evolutionary psychology and social neuroscience to social networking via digital avatars."

The study was cross-sectional from a single blinded randomised controlled trial. Forty participants with a primary diagnosis of non-organic psychosis completed baseline and 12-week follow-up questionnaires assessing their experiences. Participants rated research interviews as moderately helpful in facilitating their therapy and talking to the interviewer as moderately helpful at baseline and 12-week follow-up. Self-report ratings of the degree of self-realisation promoted by the research questionnaires were significantly higher at 12-week follow-up compared to baseline. Participants adjusted quickly to being audio recorded and rated interviews as not at all disruptive and not at all to slightly intrusive. On average there were neutral emotional reactions, positive gains and minimal inconveniences as a result of participation. The main reasons for taking part were: 'To help myself', 'I was curious' and 'To help others'. The findings offer support to previous research reporting that individuals with mental health problems find participating in clinical trials a beneficial experience. This may alleviate concerns that participation in similar studies may be personally intrusive or harmful."

Case management services can address needs for emotional counseling and other supportive services to facilitate HIV care engagement. Using 2009-2013 North Carolina Medical Monitoring Project data from 910 persons engaged in HIV care, we estimated associations of case management utilization with \"probable current depression\" and with 100% ART dose adherence. After weighting, 53.2% of patients reported receiving case management, 21.7% reported depression, and 87.0% reported ART adherence. Depression prevalence was higher among those reporting case management (24.9%) than among other patients (17.6%) (p < 0.01). Case management was associated with depression among patients living above the poverty level [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR), 2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-3.36], and not among other patients (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI 0.72-1.43). Receipt of case management was not associated with ART adherence (aPR, 1.00; 95% CI 0.95-1.05). Our analysis indicates a need for more effective depression treatment, even among persons receiving case management services. Self-reported ART adherence was high overall, though lower among persons experiencing depression (unadjusted prevalence ratio, 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.99). Optimal HIV clinical and prevention outcomes require addressing psychological wellbeing, monitoring of ART adherence, and effective case management services."

Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of heartbeat linear and nonlinear dynamics throughout the communication of a life-threatening disease has not been performed yet. To this extent, we studied linear heartbeat dynamics through the extraction of time-frequency domain measurements, as well as heartbeat nonlinear and complex dynamics through novel approaches to compute multi-scale and multi-lag series analyses: namely, the multi-scale distribution entropy and lagged Poincaré plot symbolic analysis. Heart rate variability series were recorded from 54 healthy female subjects who were blind to the aim of the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: 27 subjects watched a video where an oncologist discloses the diagnosis of a cancer metastasis to a patient, whereas the remaining 27 watched the same video including four additional supportive comments by the clinician. Considering differences between the beginning and the end of each communication video, results from non-parametric Wilcoxon tests demonstrated that, at a group level, significant differences occurred in heartbeat linear and nonlinear dynamics, with lower complexity during nonsupportive communication. Furthermore, a support vector machine algorithm, validated using a leave-one-subject-out procedure, was able to discern the supportive experience at a single-subject level with an accuracy of 83.33% when nonlinear features were considered, dropping to 51.85% when using standard HRV features only. In conclusion, heartbeat nonlinear and complex dynamics can be a viable tool for the psycho-physiological evaluation of supportive doctor-patient communication.

Transcriptions of the interactions between psychiatrists and patients help illustrate this approach. In our experience, motivational pharmacotherapy differs substantially from standard pharmacotherapy in how it recasts clinicians and patients as equal experts, prioritizes patients' motivation to engage in treatment rather than clinicians' multiple inquiries about symptoms, encourages patients' self-efficacy to overcome barriers, and attends to the momentum of patients' language about commitment to change. We also found that motivational pharmacotherapy can be feasibly incorporated into medication treatment, can be tailored to patients' culture and disorder, and may help increase adherence to psycho-pharmacotherapy."

This update summarizes and comments on these reviews as well as on a review of psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women, and presents pooled results from reviews of cessation interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      New reviews in 2013 found: low-quality evidence that behavioural interventions with mood management components could significantly increase long-term quit rates in people with current [risk ratio (RR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-1.92) and past (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.13-1.77] depression; evidence from network meta-analysis that varenicline and combined forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are associated with higher quit rates than bupropion or single-form NRT (varenicline versus single-form NRT odds ratio (OR) = 1.57, 95% credibility interval (CredI) = 1.29-1.91; versus bupropion OR = 1.59, 95% CredI = 1.29-1.96); and no evidence of a significant increase in serious adverse events in trial participants randomized to varenicline or bupropion when compared to placebo controls. New evidence emerging from updated reviews suggests that counselling interventions can increase quit rates in pregnant women and that school-based smoking programmes with social competence curricula can lead to a significant reduction in uptake of smoking at more than a year. Updated reviews also suggested that naltrexone, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and St John's wort do not have a significant effect on long-term smoking cessation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cochrane systematic review evidence from 2013 suggests that adding mood management to behavioural support may improve cessation outcomes in smokers with current or past depression and strengthens evidence for previous conclusions, including the safety of varenicline and bupropion and the benefits of behavioural support for smoking cessation in pregnancy."

            "abstract": "Detecting emotional facial expressions is an initial and indispensable component of face-to-face communication. Neuropsychological studies on the neural substrates of this process have shown that bilateral amygdala lesions impaired the detection of emotional facial expressions. However, the findings were inconsistent, possibly due to the limited number of patients examined. Furthermore, whether this processing is based on emotional or visual factors of facial expressions remains unknown. To investigate this issue, we tested a group of patients (n = 23) with unilateral resection of medial temporal lobe structures, including the amygdala, and compared their performance under resected- and intact-hemisphere stimulation conditions. The participants were asked to detect normal facial expressions of anger and happiness, and artificially created anti-expressions, among a crowd with neutral expressions. Reaction times for the detection of normal expressions versus anti-expressions were shorter when the target faces were presented to the visual field contralateral to the intact hemisphere (i.e., stimulation of the intact hemisphere; e.g., right visual field for patients with right hemispheric resection) compared with the visual field contralateral to the resected hemisphere (i.e., stimulation of the resected hemisphere). Our findings imply that the medial temporal lobe structures, including the amygdala, play an essential role in the detection of emotional facial expressions, according to the emotional significance of the expressions."

Sensory seeking behavior occurs as compensation for SOR, and individuals may seek sensory input in one sensory domain to compensate for SOR. Tactile seeking behavior is sufficient to decrease social anxiety in communicating with unfamiliar people. We assessed the effectiveness of hugging a huggable device before a conversation for reducing the psychological stress associated with speaking to an unfamiliar person or robot. Our analysis showed a significant effect, with Hugvie contributing to decreased stress for both interlocutors. Thus, this study demonstrated the efficacy of hugging it before conversation, which emphasizes the importance of tactile seeking for individuals with ASD."

            "abstract": "The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach can be used to develop mathematical models for predicting the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of administered drugs in virtual human populations. Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic drug with a narrow therapeutic index and is commonly used in the management of several medical conditions, including psychotic disorders. Due to the large interindividual variability among patients taking haloperidol, it is very likely for them to experience either toxic or subtherapeutic effects. We intend to develop a haloperidol PBPK model for identifying the potential sources of pharmacokinetic (PK) variability after intravenous and oral administration by using the population-based simulator, PK-Sim. The model was initially developed and evaluated to predict the PK of haloperidol and its reduced metabolite in adult healthy population after intravenous and oral administration. After evaluating the developed PBPK model in healthy adults, it was used to predict haloperidol-rifampicin drug-drug interaction and was extended to tuberculosis patients. The model evaluation was performed using visual assessments, prediction error, and mean fold error of the ratio of the observed-to-predicted values of the PK parameters. The predicted PK values were in good agreement with the corresponding reported values. The effects of the pathophysiological changes and enzyme induction associated with tuberculosis and its treatment, respectively, on haloperidol PK, have been predicted precisely. For all clinical scenarios that were evaluated, the predicted values were within the acceptable two-fold error range."

Multimedia, high quality media such as TV broadcast, looks expensive because it requires broadband network with 100-200 Mpbs bandwidth or 3,700 analog telephone lines. However, thanks to the existing digital-line called N-ISDN (Narrow Integrated Service Digital Network) and PictureTel's audio/video compression technologies, it becomes far less expensive. N-ISDN provides 128 Kbps bandwidth, over twice wider than analog line. PictureTel's technology instantly compress audio/video signal into 1/1,000 in size. This means, with ISDN and PictureTel technology. Multimedia is materialized over even single ISDN line. This will allow doctor to remotely meet face-to-face with a medical specialist or patients to interview, conduct physical examinations, review records, and prescribe treatments. Bonding multiple ISDN lines will further improve video quality that enables remote surgery. Surgeon can perform an operation on internal organ by projecting motion video from Endoscope's CCD camera to large display monitor. Also, PictureTel provides advanced technologies of eliminating background noise generated by surgical knives or scalpels during surgery. This will allow sound of the breath or heartbeat be clearly transmitted to the remote site. Thus, Multimedia eliminates the barrier of distance, enabling people to be just at home, to be anywhere in the world, to undergo up-to-date medical treatment by expertise. This will reduce medical cost and allow people to live in the suburbs, in less pollution, closer to the nature. People will foster more open and collaborative environment by participating in local activities. Such community-oriented life-style will atone for mass consumption, materialistic economy in the past, then bring true happiness and welfare into our life after all."

Questions remain about whether and how late initiation of ANC in pregnancy is related to adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the era of national dolutegravir roll-out.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study employed a qualitative design involving individual interviews and focus group discussions conducted between August 2018 and March 2019. We interviewed 37 pregnant and lactating women living with HIV selected purposively for early or late presentation to ANC from poor urban communities in South Africa and Uganda. Additionally, we carried out seven focused group discussions involving 67 participants in both countries. Data were analysed thematically in NVivo12.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Women described common underlying factors influencing both late ANC initiation and poor ART adherence in South Africa and Uganda. These included poverty and time constraints; inadequate health knowledge; perceived low health risk; stigma of HIV in pregnancy; lack of disclosure; and negative provider attitudes. Most late ANC presenters reported relationship problems, lack of autonomy and the limited ability to dialogue with their partners to influence household decisions on health and resource allocation. Perception of poor privacy and confidentiality in maternity clinics was rife among women in both study settings and compounded risks associated with early disclosure of pregnancy and HIV. Women who initiated ANC late and were then diagnosed with HIV appeared to be more susceptible to poor ART adherence. They were often reprimanded by health workers for presenting late which hampered their participation in treatment counselling and festered provider mistrust and subsequent disengagement in care. Positive HIV diagnosis in late pregnancy complicated women's ability to disclose their status to significant others which deprived them of essential social support for treatment adherence. Further, it appeared to adversely affect women's mental health and treatment knowledge and self-efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found clear links between late initiation of ANC and the potential for poor adherence to ART based on common structural barriers shaping both health seeking behaviours, and the adverse impact of late HIV diagnosis on women's mental health and treatment knowledge and efficacy. Women who present late are a potential target group for better access to antiretrovirals that are easy to take and decrease viral load rapidly, and counselling support with adherence and partner disclosure. A combination of strengthened health literacy, economic empowerment, improved privacy and patient-provider relationships as well as community interventions that tackle inimical cultural practices on pregnancy and unfair gender norms may be required."

Therefore, health care providers are more frequently encountering very young children with IBD, a chronic and incurable condition requiring life-long therapy. These children are living long lives with IBD and therefore knowledge of long-term outcomes is increasingly important to better counsel families and determine the best course of treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge and literature surrounding long-term outcomes of pediatric IBD, with emphasis on the following areas: need for surgery due to complicated disease behavior, risk of disease remission and recurrence, mental health and psychosocial well-being, educational outcomes, linear growth impairment, cancer risk, and mortality. In addition, we review recent research about predicting negative long-term outcomes in children with IBD."

            "abstract": "Findings in this study support earlier investigations in attesting to the antipsychotic efficacy and relatively low toxicity of pipotiazine palmitate. Results with all efficacy measures utilized were consistent in indicating a high level of efficacy for this investigational compound. Pipotiazine palmitate apparently has an average duration of action that extends beyond 4 weeks in severely ill schizophrenic patients. This particular long acting IM antipsychotic preparation appears to have an even longer duration of activity than some of the other available standard long acting agents. The optimal dosage range for severely ill schizophrenic patients appears to be between 100 and 600 mg once monthly. While this type of drug (as is the case with many antipsychotic drugs) does reduce the psychotic symptomatology and improves the thought associations sufficient to enable the patient to leave the hospital, it should be re-emphasized that socioeconomic and guidance counseling services are necessary to maintain the patient in the community. The availability of this type of long acting preparation is not only economical in terms of nursing care and hospital cost but it should also increase the efficacy of psychopharmacologic treatment of schizophrenics by reducing both patient errors and staff errors in administration of medication. In addition, this IM preparation should prove to be of invaluable help in maintaining the schizophrenic patient in his community by reducing the relapse and the rehospitalization rates. It should be noted that there are schizophrenic patients who either absorb compounds from the gastrointestinal tract in a very poor manner or too rapidly metabolize the antipsychotic agents with resultant suboptimal blood levels and these subjects may be called \"drug refractory.\" This type of long acting medication is an ideal preparation for the schizophrenic patient who has these types of absorption or metabolic problems since the \"circulatory pass\" through the liver is minimal after IM medication as compared to that encountered by an orally administered agent. The clinical disadvantage of pipotiazine palmitate is the delay in onset of therapeutic activity after injection. Significant improvement is first noted after 3 to 4 days after the highest IM dosage administration. Therefore, it may be necessary to use an oral or IM preparation of a neuroleptic with a more rapid onset of activity or utilize an oral dosage of the pipotiazine salt during the first week following IM administration of pipotiazine palmitate."

The investigation concerned how perception varies according to the strength of facial expression, as well as according to an avatar's gender. To accomplish these goals, we generated a male and a female virtual avatar with five levels of intensity of happiness and anger using a morphing technique. We then recruited 16 normal healthy subjects and measured each subject's emotional reaction by scoring affective arousal and valence after showing them the avatar's face. Through this study, we were able to investigate human perceptual characteristics evoked by male and female avatars' graduated facial expressions of happiness and anger. In addition, we were able to identify that a virtual avatar's facial expression could affect human emotion in different ways according to the avatar's gender and the intensity of its facial expressions. However, we could also see that virtual faces have some limitations because they are not real, so subjects recognized the expressions well, but were not influenced to the same extent. Although a virtual avatar has some limitations in conveying its emotion using facial expressions, this study is significant in that it shows that a new potential exists to use or manipulate emotional intensity by controlling a virtual avatar's facial expression linearly using a morphing technique. Therefore, it is predicted that this technique may be used for assessing emotional characteristics of humans, and may be of particular benefit for work with people with emotional disorders through a presentation of dynamic expression of various emotional intensities."

Several anxiety-related behavioral paradigms, which rest upon the presentation of live predatorial stimuli, may yield inconsistent results due to fatigue, habituation, or idiosyncratic responses exhibited by the stimulus itself. To overcome these limitations, we designed and manufactured a fully controllable robot inspired by a natural aquatic predator (Indian leaf fish, Nandus nandus) of zebrafish. We report that this robot elicits aversive antipredatorial reactions in a preference test and that data obtained therein correlate with data observed in traditional anxiety- and fear-related tests (light/dark preference and shelter-seeking). Finally, ethanol administration (0.25; 0.50; 1.00%) exerts anxiolytic effects, thus supporting the view that robotic stimuli can be used in the analysis of anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish."

            "abstract": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising strategy to reduce HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM). How and when PrEP is used could in part be influenced by its impact on the sexual well-being of its users. Yet, the impact of PrEP on sexual well-being has received little attention in current literature and is not well-understood. We conducted 43 in-depth interviews (June 2017-June 2018) with HIV-negative MSM who started PrEP within the Amsterdam PrEP study. We used purposive sampling to select participants who (1) reported changes on well-being indicators; (2) switched between PrEP-dosing regimens; (3) neither changed regimens nor changed on well-being indicators. Transcribed interviews were qualitatively analyzed by means of an open-coding process. Results showed that PrEP minimized HIV-related fear, increased self-esteem, and reduced stigma and shame about having condomless anal sex. The psychological relief provided by PrEP also enabled relaxation which reduced pain during anal sex. PrEP use increased the diversity of partner choices and improved the perceived quality of sexual relationships and the ability to develop relationships. Along with this positive impact, almost half of interviewees reported concurrent negative experiences. In some cases, PrEP triggered more extreme sexual behaviors and/or problematic increases in preoccupation with sex and drug use. These were perceived as having a negative impact on sexual relationships, sexual well-being, PrEP adherence, and general health. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PrEP contributes to improvements in sexual well-being that go beyond protection from HIV. Counseling strategies should be devised to help PrEP users mitigate possible co-existing negative consequences of PrEP use."

It aims to cover the pharmacology of this frequently prescribed SSRI antidepressant in terms of its indications, efficacy and adverse effects. Overall, paroxetine is a well-tolerated and safe first-line SSRI antidepressant with anxiolytic qualities. It has been found useful in depression, anxiety and other conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The antidepressant has some advantages over earlier tricyclic medication in terms of a lack of cardiovascular side-effects and relative safety in overdose. Cessation of use, however, is associated with withdrawal or discontinuation symptoms and patients should be counselled as to how these might be avoided. A 3- or 4-week graded withdrawal regimen, perhaps with concomitant fluoxetine to cover serotonergic discontinuation symptoms, may be advisable."

            "abstract": "Driving cessation for some older adults can exacerbate physical, cognitive, and mental health challenges due to loss of independence and social isolation. Fully autonomous vehicles may offer an alternative transport solution, increasing social contact and encouraging independence. However, there are gaps in understanding the impact of older adults' passive role on safe human-vehicle interaction, and on their well-being. 37 older adults (mean age ± SD = 68.35 ± 8.49 years) participated in an experiment where they experienced fully autonomous journeys consisting of a distinct stop (an unexpected event versus an expected event). The autonomous behavior of the vehicle was achieved using the Wizard of Oz approach. Subjective ratings of trust and reliability, and driver state monitoring including visual attention strategies (fixation duration and count) and physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate), were captured during the journeys. Results revealed that subjective trust and reliability ratings were high after journeys for both types of events. During an unexpected stop, overt visual attention was allocated toward the event, whereas during an expected stop, visual attention was directed toward the human-machine interface (HMI) and distributed across the central and peripheral driving environment. Elevated skin conductance level reflecting increased arousal persisted only after the unexpected event. These results suggest that safety-critical events occurring during passive fully automated driving may narrow visual attention and elevate arousal mechanisms. To improve in-vehicle user experience for older adults, a driver state monitoring system could examine such psychophysiological indices to evaluate functional state and well-being. This information could then be used to make informed decisions on vehicle behavior and offer reassurance during elevated arousal during unexpected events."

We conducted a prospective study to determine if showing patients their radiotherapy plan in VR improves patient education and/or reduces anxiety about treatment. A total of 43 patients were enrolled. The most common plans were 3D breast tangents and intensity-modulated radiotherapy prostate plans. Patients were administered pre- and post-experience questionnaires. Thirty-two patients (74%) indicated that they \"strongly agree\" that the VR session gave them a better understanding of how radiotherapy will be used to treat their cancer. Of the 21 patients who expressed any anxiety about radiotherapy beforehand, 12 (57%) said that the VR session helped decrease their anxiety about undergoing radiotherapy.

Side effects may be predicted by the pharmacologic binding profiles of antipsychotics to certain neuroreceptors. Data from 7 recently completed randomized placebo-controlled trials in adolescent schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that included a total of 1480 patients extend prior results and provide numbers-needed-to-harm as a clinically useful measure of risk. Results from these pediatric studies indicate that adverse effect profiles differ among commonly used antipsychotics. However, more detailed data are needed, as information is lacking regarding carryover or withdrawal effects from prior medications and regarding the masking of effects by adjunctive treatments used to treat agitation, insomnia, or extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia in these studies. Moreover, randomized head-to-head trials and large-scale studies that investigate predictors of adverse effects as well as the safety and efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing and reversing negative effects of antipsychotics with relevant impact on psychological, psychiatric, and physical functioning are lacking. When choosing an antipsychotic treatment, patients and their families should be included in a careful risk-benefit assessment. Consideration of adverse effects, as well as dietary and lifestyle counseling, should be part of any antipsychotic treatment initiation and continuation. Routine, proactive monitoring of side effects is essential to optimize patient outcomes. In all treatment decisions, the benefits of improving often severe and debilitating manic, psychotic, and aggressive symptomatology must be balanced against the varying risks of adverse effects associated with specific antipsychotic agents in child and adolescent patients."

Eight electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis and random effects meta-regression was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 software. Overall effect was measured using Hedges's g and determined using z statistics at significance level p < .05. Assessment of heterogeneity was done using χ2 and I2 tests. A meta-analysis of 11 trials revealed that chatbot-delivered psychotherapy significantly improved depressive symptoms (g = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [-0.66, -0.42], p < .001). Although no significant subgroup differences were detected, results revealed larger effect sizes for samples of clinically diagnosed anxiety or depression, chatbots with an embodiment, a combination of types of input and output formats, less than 10 sessions, problem-solving therapy, off-line platforms, and in different regions of the United States than their counterparts.

Among patients who use antidepressants (N = 166), the stronger pros and weaker cons of discontinuation and self-efficacy predicted more proximal goal intentions. Goal intentions predicted discontinuation after 9 months. Among patients who had used antidepressants in the past (N = 73), stronger pros of discontinuation and the weaker perceived functions of antidepressants predicted a more positive evaluation of their present state, compared with when they still used antidepressants. These temporal comparisons, in turn, predicted renewed use of antidepressants after 9 months.

            "title": "HAPPY: Hip Arthroscopy Portal Placement Using Augmented Reality.",
            "abstract": "Correct positioning of the endoscope is crucial for successful hip arthroscopy. Only with adequate alignment can the anatomical target area be visualized and the procedure be successfully performed. Conventionally, surgeons rely on anatomical landmarks such as bone structure, and on intraoperative X-ray imaging, to correctly place the surgical trocar and insert the endoscope to gain access to the surgical site. One factor complicating the placement is deformable soft tissue, as it can obscure important anatomical landmarks. In addition, the commonly used endoscopes with an angled camera complicate hand-eye coordination and, thus, navigation to the target area. Adjusting for an incorrectly positioned endoscope prolongs surgery time, requires a further incision and increases the radiation exposure as well as the risk of infection. In this work, we propose an augmented reality system to support endoscope placement during arthroscopy. Our method comprises the augmentation of a tracked endoscope with a virtual augmented frustum to indicate the reachable working volume. This is further combined with an in situ visualization of the patient anatomy to improve perception of the target area. For this purpose, we highlight the anatomy that is visible in the endoscopic camera frustum and use an automatic colorization method to improve spatial perception. Our system was implemented and visualized on a head-mounted display. The results of our user study indicate the benefit of the proposed system compared to baseline positioning without additional support, such as an increased alignment speed, improved positioning error and reduced mental effort. The proposed approach might aid in the positioning of an angled endoscope, and may result in better access to the surgical area, reduced surgery time, less patient trauma, and less X-ray exposure during surgery."

            "abstract": "Many studies of persons who exchange sex for money or drugs have focused on their HIV acquisition risk, and are often limited to select populations and/or geographical locations. National estimates of exchange sex among people living with HIV (PLWH) who are in medical care, and its correlates, are lacking. To address these gaps, we analyzed data from the Medical Monitoring Project, a surveillance system that produces nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical characteristics of PLWH receiving medical care in the United States, to estimate the weighted prevalence of exchange sex overall, and by selected socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics. We found 3.6% of sexually active adults reported exchange sex in the past 12 months. We found a higher prevalence of exchange sex among transgender persons, those who experienced homelessness, and those with unmet needs for social and medical services. Persons who exchanged sex were more likely to report depression and substance use than those who did not exchange sex. We found a higher prevalence of sexual behaviors that increase the risk of HIV transmission and lower viral suppression among persons who exchanged sex. PLWH who exchanged sex had a higher prevalence of not being prescribed ART, and not being ART adherent than those who did not exchange sex. We identify several areas for intervention, including: provision of or referral to services for unmet needs (such as housing or shelter), enhanced delivery of mental health and substance abuse screening and treatment, risk-reduction counseling, and ART prescription and adherence support services."

To equalize clinical contact across treatments, all patients were seen weekly for 6 months and then biweekly for 18 months. Subsequent to randomization, unmasked clinicians at each site could make any interventions necessary to prevent the occurrence of suicide attempts. Suicidal behavior was assessed at each visit. Primary end points included suicide attempts (including those that led to death), hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and a rating of \"much worsening of suicidality\" from baseline.

Of great concern is the possibility of HIV transmission during the assault, but adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been varied and low. We developed a telephonic psycho-social support, leaflet and adherence diary intervention for rape victims and tested its impact on adherence to PEP. A randomised control trial was conducted in the Western and Eastern Cape and 279 rape survivors were enrolled in two arms. The intervention involved the providing of an information leaflet including an adherence diary and follow-up support through telephone calls by a counsellor during the 28 days of taking the PEP. The controls received the leaflet. Follow-up interviews and tablet checks were done with 253 participants to assess adherence. The primary outcome was completion of 28 days of PEP with no more than three missed doses (94% adherence). There was more adherence in the intervention arm (38.2% vs. 31.9%), but the estimated intervention effect of 6.5% (95% CI: -4.6 to 17.6%) was not statistically significant, p=0.13. The intervention was associated with the reading of the pamphlet (p=0.07) and an increased use of the diary (p=0.01), but did not reduce depressive psychopathology. Overall adherence was greater amongst those who read the leaflet and used the medication diary. The study showed that the intervention was not effective in significantly improving adherence and adherence levels were low in both study arms. Further research to understand reasons for non-adherence is needed before further interventions are developed."

We used a new virtual reality paradigm to experimentally investigate the impact of contingent behavior on trust along the paranoia continuum. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly allocated to have a social interaction with a pleasant virtual human (avatar) programmed to be highly responsive or not (high/low contingency). Perceived trustworthiness and trusting behavior were assessed alongside control variables attachment and anxiety. Higher paranoia and dismissive attachment were associated with larger interpersonal distances. Unexpectedly, extremely paranoid individuals experienced the highly contingent avatar as more trustworthy than their low contingency counterpart. Higher dismissive attachment was also associated with more subjective trust in both conditions. Extreme paranoia is associated with hypersensitivity to noncontingent behavior, which might explain experiences of mistrust when others are not highly responsive in everyday social situations."

The three sources of information agree that anti-psychotic drugs are the principal treatment during the active phase of the disorder. As schizophrenia is so often a serious and disabling chronic illness, the treatment recommendations stress the need for continuity of care during the post-acute and residual phases in order to prevent relapse and minimise residual deficits.

It is an agent system leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to aid mentally distressed persons through speech conversation. The system terminals are connected to servers by the Internet exploiting Cloud-nativeness, so that anyone who has any type of terminal can use it from anywhere. Despite a promising voice communication interface, VICA shows limitations in conversation continuity on conventional 4G networks. Concretely, the use of the current 4G networks produces word dropping, delayed response, and the occasional connection failure. The objective of this paper is to mitigate these issues by leveraging a 5G/6G slice inclusive of mobile/multiple edge computing (MEC). First, we propose and partly implement the enhanced and advanced version of VICA. Servers of enhanced versions collaborate to increase speech recognition reliability. Although it significantly increases generated data volume, the advanced version enables a recognition of the facial expressions to greatly enhance counseling quality. Then, we propose a quality assurance mechanism using multiple levels of catalog, as well as 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC, and conduct experiments to uncover issues related to the 4G. Results indicate that the number of speech recognition errors in Internet Cloud is more than twofold compared to edge computing, implying that quality assurance using 5G/6G in conjunction with VICA Counseling (ro)bot has higher efficiency."

However, autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety, AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers, but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative, but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly, to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly, to understand how persuasive techniques, mediated by a virtual agent, can facilitate self-referral.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a formative phase, interviews with experts, alongside a literature review, were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral, the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent, who either directly facilitated referral, tried to persuade the user, or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation, participants rated their intention to self-refer, to chat with the agent again, and their feeling of being heard by the agent.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Whether the virtual agent facilitated, persuaded or accepted, influenced all of these measures.

Avatar Therapy compared with treatment as usual When Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual average endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Positive (PANSS-P) scores were not different between treatment groups (MD -1.93, 95% CI -5.10 to 1.24; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). A measure of insight (Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire; BAVQ-R) showed an effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -5.97, 95% CI -10.98 to -0.96; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No one was rehospitalised in either group in the short term (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.20; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). Numbers leaving the study early from each group were not clearly different - although more did leave from the Avatar Therapy group (6/14 versus 0/12; RR 11.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 181.41; studies = 1, participants = 26; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in anxiety between treatment groups (RR 5.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 89.80; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). For quality of life, average Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLESQ-SF) scores favoured Avatar Therapy (MD 9.99, 95% CI 3.89 to 16.09; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported data for functioning. 2. Avatar Therapy compared with supportive counselling When Avatar Therapy was compared with supportive counselling (all short-term), general mental state (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)) scores favoured the Avatar Therapy group (MD -4.74, 95% CI -8.01 to -1.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). For insight (BAVQ-R), there was a small effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -8.39, 95% CI -14.31 to -2.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). Around 20% of each group left the study early (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89; studies = 1, participants = 150; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of quality of life scores (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA)) showed no clear difference between groups (MD 2.69, 95% CI -1.48 to 6.86; studies = 1, participants = 120; low-certainty evidence). No data were available for rehospitalisation rates, adverse events or functioning.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our analyses of available data shows few, if any, consistent effects of Avatar Therapy for people living with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations. Where there are effects, or suggestions of effects, we are uncertain because of their risk of bias and their unclear clinical meaning. The theory behind Avatar Therapy is compelling but the practice needs testing in large, long, well-designed, well-reported randomised trials undertaken with help from - but not under the direction of - Avatar Therapy pioneers."

            "abstract": "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) will affect about one in three patients with schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only treatment approved for TRS, and patients should be treated as soon as possible to improve their chances of achieving remission. Despite its effectiveness, concern over side effects, monitoring requirements, and inexperience with prescribing often result in long delays that can expose patients to unnecessary risks and compromise their chances of achieving favorable long-term outcomes. We critically reviewed the literature on clozapine use in TRS, focusing on guidelines, systematic reviews, and algorithms to identify strategies for improving clozapine safety and tolerability. Based on this, we have provided an overview of strategies to support early initiation of clozapine in patients with TRS based on the latest evidence and our clinical experience, and have summarized the key elements in a practical, evidence-based checklist for identifying and managing patients with TRS, with the aim of increasing confidence in prescribing and monitoring clozapine therapy."

As such, it is presumed to be important in community suicide prevention programs. In Australia there have been a number of government, professional, and charitable organizations as well as pharmaceutical company suicide prevention initiatives which have been designed to enhance public and professional knowledge about mental disorders, particularly depression. This naturalistic study conducted between 1998 and 2004 in a random and representative population sample examined the changes in mental health literacy and treatment seeking of those with major depression, both with and without suicidal ideation, and those who were neither depressed nor suicidal. Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation). Furthermore, there were fewer changes in appropriate treatment seeking in those with major depression and suicidal ideation. These findings are consistent with literature reporting limited problem solving and decision making in those who are suicidal, and indicate that there are limits to broadbased community education programs.

From time to time in scientific literature there are descriptions of a diagnosis of psychotic disorders in persons previously diagnosed and treated as transsexuals, in whom the transsexual thinking disappears after using antipsychotic agents. Coexistence of transsexualism and schizophrenia causes a lot of doubt--it is observed in scientists opinions but also in the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10. Moreover, delusions of sex change are probably more frequent than it is thought. It causes, that in some cases the differential diagnosis of psychosis and gender identity disorders may be very difficult. Transsexuals treatment is on one hand connected with expected effects but on the other hand with many serious, often irreversible health consequences (e.g. cardiovascular disease, risk of neoplasma development, infertility, consequences of surgical sex reassignment).

The Illumina DNA methylation profiling and bisulfite sequencing of representative samples were used to identify methylation status of the DTNBP1 promoter region. Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was employed to assess methylation of DTNBP1 promoter CpGs flanking a SP1 binding site in the saliva of SCZ patients, their first-degree relatives and control subjects (30, 15, and 30/group, respectively) as well as in post-mortem brains of patients with SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD) versus controls (35/group). qRT-PCR was used to assess DTNBP1 expression. We found DNA hypermethylation of DTNBP1 promoter in the saliva of SCZ patients (∼12.5%, P = 0.036), particularly in drug-naïve patients (∼20%, P = 0.011), and a trend toward hypermethylation in their first-degree relatives (P = 0.085) versus controls. Analysis of post-mortem brain samples revealed an inverse correlation between DTNBP1 methylation and expression, and normalization of this epigenetic change by classic antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, BD patients with psychotic depression exhibited higher degree of methylation versus other BD patients (∼80%, P = 0.025).

Some students are susceptible to the strikes of failures and are inexperienced with or fearful of dealing with setbacks. When these negative emotions gradually accumulate without resolution, they can cause long-term negative effects on students’ physical and mental health. Some potential health problems include depression, anxiety, and disorders such as eating disorders. Universities commonly offer counseling services; however, the demand often exceeds the counseling capacities due to limited numbers of counsellors/psychologists. Thus, students may not receive immediate counseling or treatments. If students are not treated, some repercussions may lead to severe abnormal behavior and even suicide. In this study, combining immersive virtual reality (VR) technique with psychological knowledge base, we developed a VR empathy-centric counseling chatbot (VRECC) that can complementarily support troubled students when counsellors cannot provide immediate support. Through multi-turn (verbal or text) conversations with the chatbot, the system can demonstrate empathy and give therapist-like responses to the users. During the study, more than 120 students were required to complete a questionnaire and 34 subjects with an above-median stress level were randomly drawn for the VRECC experiment. We observed decreasing average stress level and psychological sensitivity scores among subjects after the experiment. Although the system did not yield improvement in life-impact scores (e.g., behavioral and physical impacts), the significant outcomes of lowering stress level and psychological sensitivity have given us a very positive outlook for continuing to integrate VR, AI sentimental natural language process, and counseling chatbot for advanced VRECC research in helping students improve their psychological well-being and life quality at schools."

The superior safety and tolerability of SSRIs provide strong justification for their first-line use despite higher drug acquisition costs. Evidence has similarly emerged concerning the use of several novel pharmacotherapies and focused psychotherapies for people with alcoholism. These newer therapeutic options complement more traditional intervention such as chemical dependence counseling, disulfiram, and Alcoholics Anonymous so that it is now possible for a majority of depressed alcoholics to be treated effectively. The availability of effective treatments provides further impetus for health care professionals to improve recognition of comorbid alcoholism and depressive disorders. Improved recognition and treatment will save lives, and the benefits are likely to extend across generations."

            "abstract": "Persons who suffer from schizophrenia have difficulties in recognizing emotions in others' facial expressions, which affects their capabilities for social interaction and hinders their social integration. Photographic images have traditionally been used to explore emotion recognition impairments in schizophrenia patients, but they lack of the dynamism that is inherent to facial expressiveness. In order to overcome those inconveniences, over the last years different authors have proposed the use of virtual avatars. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study that explored the possibilities of using a realistic-looking avatar for the assessment of emotion recognition deficits in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. In the study, 20 subjects with schizophrenia of long evolution and 20 control subjects were invited to recognize a set of facial expressions of emotions showed by both the said virtual avatar and static images. Our results show that schizophrenic patients exhibit recognition deficits in emotion recognition from facial expressions regardless the type of stimuli (avatar or images), and that those deficits are related with the psychopathology. Finally, some improvements in recognition rates (RRs) for the patient group when using the avatar were observed for sadness or surprise expressions, and they even outperform the control group in the recognition of the happiness expression. This leads to conclude that, apart from the dynamism of the shown expression, the RRs for schizophrenia patients when employing animated avatars may depend on other factors which need to be further explored."

In this paper, the authors propose to assess the differences between the expression of emotion regarding the expressed intensity (low, middle, high and exaggerated). We observed two professional actors perform emotive walking, with different intensities and we analyzed the recorded data. For each emotion, we analyzed characteristic features which can be used in the future to model gait patterns and to recognize emotions from the gait parameters. Additionally, we found characteristics which can be used to create new emotion expression for our biped robot Kobian, improving the human-robot interaction."

These agents could increase availability and reduce the relative costs of mental health support. The provided support can be divided into two main types: cognitive and emotional. Existing work on this topic mainly focuses on constructing agents that adopt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. Such agents operate based on pre-defined templates and exercises to provide cognitive support. However, research on emotional support using such agents is limited. In addition, most of the constructed agents operate in English, highlighting the importance of conducting such studies in China. To this end, we introduce Emohaa, a conversational agent that provides cognitive support through CBT-Bot exercises and guided conversations. It also emotionally supports users through ES-Bot, enabling them to vent their emotional problems.

            "abstract": "In recent years, early intervention services have attempted to identify people with a first episode of psychosis as early as possible, reducing the duration of untreated psychosis and changing the timing of delivery of interventions. The logic of early intervention is based partly on accessing people in a more treatment responsive stage of illness in which psychosocial damage is less extensive, and partly on remediating a putatively active process of neuroprogression that leads to pathophysiological, symptomatic and structural changes, hence improving symptomatic and functional outcomes. However, as in other areas of health care, earlier identification of new patients may mean that different treatment approaches are indicated. The corollary of early detection is that the sequence and complexion of treatment strategies for first episode psychosis has been revaluated. Examples include the minimal effective dosage of antipsychotic medication and the content of psychosocial interventions. With the substantial reductions of DUP now seen in many early psychosis services, based on clinical staging and stepped care principles, it is even possible that the immediate introduction of antipsychotic medication may not be necessary for all first episode psychosis cases, but that potentially safer interventions, which may be more acceptable to many patients, such as comprehensive psychosocial intervention, may constitute effective treatment at least for a subgroup of patients. In this paper, we review this theoretical background and describe a randomised controlled trial currently underway at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Melbourne designed to test outcomes for first episode psychosis patients in response to two different treatments: intensive psychosocial intervention plus antipsychotic medication versus intensive psychosocial intervention plus placebo. This is a theoretically and pragmatically novel study in that it will provide evidence as to whether intensive psychosocial intervention alone is sufficient for a subgroup of first episode psychosis patients in a specialised early intervention service, and provide a test of the heuristic clinical staging model. By experimentally manipulating duration of untreated psychosis, the study will also provide a methodologically strong test of the effect of delaying the introduction of antipsychotic medication, as well as helping to disentangle the effects of antipsychotic medications and the putative neurobiological processes associated with brain changes and symptom profiles in the early phase of psychotic disorders. The study has been carefully crafted to satisfy critical ethical demands in this challenging research domain."

Participants were also presented with a mental rotation task to assess their visuospatial abilities, and with a facial emotion recognition task tapping social cognition. Results revealed that participants with schizophrenia performed overall worse than controls both in discriminating communicative from non-communicative actions (task A) and in selecting which of the 5 response alternatives best described the observed actions (task B). Interestingly, the impaired performance of schizophrenic participants was mainly due to misclassification of non-communicative stimuli as communicative actions.

In contrast to counseling approaches with method effectiveness as the organizing principle, participants preferred counseling centered on personalized assessments of needs and preferences. Many, particularly older, less educated women, highly valued hearing provider opinions about what method they should use, based on those personalized assessments. Participants highlighted the necessity of clinical assessments or physical exams to inform provider recommendations for appropriate methods. This desire was largely due to beliefs that more exhaustive medical exams could help prevent negative contraceptive outcomes perceived to be common, in particular expulsion of intra-uterine devices (IUDs), by identifying methods compatible with a woman's body. Trust in provider, built in various ways, was seen as essential to women's contraceptive needs being met.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings shed light on under-represented perspectives of clients related to counseling preferences.

Findings suggest interventions to improve provider counseling should prioritize a focus on relationship-building to foster trust, and needs assessment skills to facilitate personalization of decision-making support without imposition of a provider's personal opinions. Trust is particularly important to address in family planning given historical abuses against women's autonomy that may still influence perspectives on contraceptive programs.

All 60 encounters were audio-recorded and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a quantitative coding system that characterizes communication behaviors through discrete categories. A patient-centeredness score was calculated for each encounter.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The majority of pharmacist communication was biomedical in nature (50.7%), and focused on providing therapeutic information and advice on the antidepressant regimen. In contrast, only 5.4% of pharmacist communication was related to lifestyle/psychosocial exchanges. There were also few instances of emotional rapport-building behaviors (8.6%) or information gathering (6.6%). Patient-centered scores were highest in the scenario involving a first-time antidepressant user, as compared to other scenarios involving issues with continued therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Community pharmacists appeared to adopt a \"medication-centered\" approach when counseling on antidepressant issues. There is scope for improvement in patient-centered communication behaviors, particularly lifestyle/psychosocial discussions, facilitating patient participation, and emotional rapport-building. The RIAS appears suited to characterize brief consultations in community pharmacies and can provide a framework in guiding communication training efforts. Further research is needed to assess the impact of pharmacist communication behaviors on patient care outcomes."

            "abstract": "All human beings are biologic, psychological, and sociologic creatures. The treatment program for agoraphobia at the University of Kansas Medical Center School of Medicine, Kansas City, is designed to deal effectively with problems in these three areas. The biologic area is dealt with by medication; tricyclic antidepressants are used to block panic attacks, and benzodiazepines are given, as needed, for anticipatory anxiety. Group therapy is particularly effective in the areas of individual psychopathology and social anxiety. We have not found agoraphobia difficult to treat and have demonstrated that it can be cured. The track record of primary care physicians and specialists in diagnosing and managing agoraphobia so far leaves much to be desired. If physicians obtain the appropriate history at initial contact with a patient and administer appropriate treatment, it may be possible to prevent full-blown agoraphobia from developing."

However, there is a disconnect between recommended guidelines and current practice. Our study aims to investigate: (1) the feasibility of a community pharmacist-led physical health monitoring for metabolic parameters in consumers with mental illness currently taking second generation antipsychotics and (2) the potential outcomes of the intervention (eg, rates and outcome of referrals to general practitioners, relationship between the pharmacist's lifestyle counselling advice and change in metabolic parameters).\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We propose a longitudinal metabolic monitoring study led by community pharmacists with one-to-one consultations between trained pharmacists and participants at set intervals over a 12-month period.

Unfortunately, scientific literature has not identified what specific types of emotions in Contact Center applications are relevant to the activities they perform. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to develop an Emotion Classification for Machine Detection of Affect-Tinged Conversational Contents dedicated directly to the Contact Center industry. In the conducted study, Contact Center voice and text channels were considered, taking into account the following families of emotions: anger, fear, happiness, sadness vs. affective neutrality of the statements. The obtained results confirmed the usefulness of the proposed classification-for the voice channel, the highest efficiency was obtained using the Convolutional Neural Network (accuracy, 67.5%; precision, 80.3; F1-Score, 74.5%), while for the text channel, the Support Vector Machine algorithm proved to be the most efficient (accuracy, 65.9%; precision, 58.5; F1-Score, 61.7%)."

We next identify the fronto-temporal network of PH by combining MR-compatible robotics (and sensorimotor stimulation in healthy participants) and lesion network mapping (neurological patients without PD). This PH-network was selectively disrupted in an additional and independent cohort of patients with PD, predicted the presence of symptomatic PH, and associated with cognitive decline. These robotics-neuroimaging findings extend existing sensorimotor hallucination models to PD and reveal the pathological cortical sensorimotor processes of PH in PD, potentially indicating a more severe form of PD that has been associated with psychosis and cognitive decline."

We address interindividual versus person-dependent recognition, recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions, and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect. Principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, linear discriminant analysis, and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification. Although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion, person-dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches 95% accuracy based on the observation of a single stride. In particular, different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait. It is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect. Application scenarios include monitoring in high-security areas, human-robot interaction, and cognitive home environments."

However, its ubiquitous presence in human life does not allow the study of social touch deprivation 'in the wild'.

In this study, 1746 participants completed an online survey to examine intimate, friendly and professional touch experiences during COVID-19-related restrictions, their impact on mental health and the extent to which touch deprivation results in craving touch. We found that intimate touch deprivation during COVID-19-related restrictions is associated with higher anxiety and greater loneliness even though this type of touch is still the most experienced during the pandemic. Moreover, intimate touch is reported as the type of touch most craved during this period, thus being more prominent as the days practising social distancing increase. However, our results also show that the degree to which individuals crave touch during this period depends on individual differences in attachment style: the more anxiously attached, the more touch is craved; with the reverse pattern for avoidantly attached.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with symptoms that can severely affect patients' quality of life. While drug administration inhibits most of the positive symptoms, it fails to effectively treat the negative symptoms and in turn relies on rehabilitation therapies. With technological progress, virtual reality (VR) has been the target of recent studies in terms of mental health rehabilitation and has been shown to be a tool with ecological validity in order to introduce the individual to situations similar to their daily life.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From July to August 2021, we conducted a systematic review with the purpose of understanding the impact of virtual reality rehabilitation on negative symptoms and psychosocial rehabilitation in the schizophrenia spectrum.

            "abstract": "People with schizophrenia have difficulty recognizing the emotions in the facial expressions of others, which affects their social interaction and functioning in the community. Static stimuli such as photographs have been used traditionally to examine deficiencies in the recognition of emotions in patients with schizophrenia, which has been criticized by some authors for lacking the dynamism that real facial stimuli have. With the aim of overcoming these drawbacks, in recent years, the creation and validation of virtual humans has been developed. This work presents the results of a study that evaluated facial recognition of emotions through a new set of dynamic virtual humans previously designed by the research team, in patients diagnosed of schizophrenia. The study included 56 stable patients, compared with 56 healthy controls. Our results showed that patients with schizophrenia present a deficit in facial affect recognition, compared to healthy controls (average hit rate 71.6% for patients vs 90.0% for controls). Facial expressions with greater dynamism (compared to less dynamic ones), as well as those presented from frontal view (compared to profile view) were better recognized in both groups. Regarding clinical and sociodemographic variables, the number of hospitalizations throughout life did not correlate with recognition rates. There was also no correlation between functioning or quality of life and recognition. A trend showed a reduction in the emotional recognition rate as a result of increases in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), being statistically significant for negative PANSS. Patients presented a learning effect during the progression of the task, slightly greater in comparison to the control group. This finding is relevant when designing training interventions for people with schizophrenia. Maintaining the attention of patients and getting them to improve in the proposed tasks is a challenge for today's psychiatry."

However, it remains unclear which spatio-temporal characteristics of facial movements serve as critical cues to the perceived genuineness of facial expressions. This study focused on observable spatio-temporal differences between perceived-as-genuine and deliberate expressions of happiness and anger expressions. In this experiment, 89 Japanese participants were asked to judge the perceived genuineness of faces in videos showing happiness or anger expressions. To identify diagnostic facial cues to the perceived genuineness of the facial expressions, we analyzed a total of 128 face videos using an automated facial action detection system; thereby, moment-to-moment activations in facial action units were annotated, and nonnegative matrix factorization extracted sparse and meaningful components from all action units data. The results showed that genuineness judgments reduced when more spatial patterns were observed in facial expressions. As for the temporal features, the perceived-as-deliberate expressions of happiness generally had faster onsets to the peak than the perceived-as-genuine expressions of happiness. Moreover, opening the mouth negatively contributed to the perceived-as-genuine expressions, irrespective of the type of facial expressions. These findings provide the first evidence for dynamic facial cues to the perceived genuineness of happiness and anger expressions."

Natural language processing enables quantification of language connectedness, which may be lower in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Here, we investigated connectedness of spontaneous speech in schizophrenia-spectrum patients and controls and determine its accuracy in classification. Using a semi-structured interview, speech of 50 patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and 50 controls was recorded. Language connectedness in a semantic word2vec model was calculated using consecutive word similarity in moving windows of increasing sizes (2-20 words). Mean, minimal and variance of similarity were calculated per window size and used in a random forest classifier to distinguish patients and healthy controls. Classification based on connectedness reached 85% cross-validated accuracy, with 84% specificity and 86% sensitivity. Features that best discriminated patients from controls were variance of similarity at window sizes between 5 and 10. We show impaired connectedness in spontaneous speech of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders even in patients with low ratings of positive symptoms. Effects were most prominent at the level of sentence connectedness. The high sensitivity, specificity and tolerability of this method show that language analysis is an accurate and feasible digital assistant in diagnosing schizophrenia-spectrum disorders."

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of an 8-week exercise program and motivation on physical activity levels, self-motivation, and mental well-being of adolescents in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the impact of virtual coaching on physical, emotional, and mental health after an eight-week exercise program was examined. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven participants, 18 females (67%) and 9 males (33%), with a mean age of 14 ± 2.38 years, were enrolled in eight weeks of pre- and post-intervention between June and August of 2021. The physical activity scale, situational motivation scale, mental health continuum short form, and baseline assessments were completed before and after the eight-week program. The program recommended that adolescents practice aerobic, resistance, and weight-bearing exercises for 60 min daily. Paired mean t-tests were used to compare pre-and post-test results. Results: Participants showed an acceptable physical activity level (5.5 ± 1.4) on a 10-point scale with a significant improvement after the eight-week program (7 ± 1.5; p = 0.013). The situational motivation scale improved from 38.1 ± 16 to 26 ± 19.6 (p = 0.042). The mental health continuum (social and psychological well-being) also significantly improved. Participants who received weekly phone calls showed similar improvement patterns but were not significantly different from those who did not receive calls. Conclusions: A virtually delivered 8-week exercise program for adolescents improved their physical, motivational, and mental health. Providing additional weekly phone calls does not provide additional improvement. Providing adolescents with the needed supervision and motivation enhances their physical activity and mental health."

Most of these social robots have provided timely stimuli to the elderly at home and in care centres, including keeping them active and boosting their mood. However, previous investigations have registered shortcomings in these robots, particularly in their ability to satisfy an essential human need: the need for companionship. Reports show that the elderly tend to lose interests in these social robots after the initial excitement as the novelty wears out and the monotonous familiarity becomes all too familiar. This paper presents our research facilitating conversations between a social humanoid robot, Nadine, and cognitively impaired elderly at a nursing home. We analysed the effectiveness of human-humanoid interactions between our robot and 14 elderly over 29 sessions. We used both objective tools (based on computer vision methods) and subjective tools (based on observational scales) to evaluate the recorded videos. Our findings showed that our subjects engaged positively with Nadine, suggesting that their interaction with the robot could improve their well-being by compensating for some of their emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial deficiencies. We detected emotions associated with cognitively impaired elderly during these interactions. This study could help understand the expectations of the elderly and the current limitations of Social Assistive Robots.

Twenty-two schizophrenia patients and twenty-two matched healthy controls underwent a collaborative motor synchrony task with the iCub humanoid robot. Results revealed that positive social feedback had a facilitatory effect on motor coordination in the control participants compared to non-social positive feedback. This facilitatory effect was not present in schizophrenia patients, whose social-motor coordination was similarly impaired in social and non-social feedback conditions. Furthermore, patients' cognitive flexibility impairment and antipsychotic dosing were negatively correlated with patients' ability to synchronize hand movements with iCub.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      One personality type associated with poor health outcomes is distressed (Type D) personality which involves high levels of both social inhibition (SI) and negative affectivity (NA). Type D is also linked to psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and depression. One mechanism through which personality temperament may result in these psychopathologies is avoidance. Recently, a computer-based measure designed to assess avoidant behaviors, in which the participant guides the behavior of an avatar interacting with strangers in social situations, has been found to be related to various forms of avoidance. In the current study, we extended this work with the avatar avoidance task to determine its relationship to distressed (Type D) personality. We hypothesized that Type D personality, along with SI, but not NA, would be positively related to avatar avoidance scores. We also hypothesized that avatar avoidance scores would be higher in Type D individuals than non-Type D individuals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 302 undergraduates completed the Distressed Type D Personality Scale (DS-14), and a computer-based avatar avoidance task.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Type D and SI, and NA to a lesser degree, were positively correlated with avoidance scores on the avatar task. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that Type D and SI scores were best predicted by a model including avoidance scores and education level while NA scores were best predicted by a model including avoidance scores. Standard cut-off scores on the DS-14 scale resulted in four groups (i.e., low SI and NA, high SI, high NA, and Type D) which significantly differed in avoidance scores. Specifically, Type D individuals had higher avoidance scores than the other three groups. Taken together these findings support a role for avoidance in Type D personality. The computer-based avatar avoidance task may be particularly relevant as an ecologically valid measure to identify avoidance in a virtual setting for use with individuals expressing Type D personality who may be unwilling or unable to accurately self-report or describe their own avoidant tendencies."

            "abstract": "People routinely wear face masks during the pandemic, but little is known about their impact on body perception. In this online study, we presented female body images of Caucasian avatars in common dress sizes displaying happy, angry, and neutral facial expressions with and without face masks, and asked women to rate the perceived body attractiveness and body size. In comparison with mask-off condition, mask-on decreased body attractiveness ratings for happy avatars but did not affect ratings for neutral avatars irrespective of avatar dress sizes. For avatars displaying angry expressions, mask-on increased body attractiveness ratings for slimmer avatars but did not affect ratings for larger avatars. On the other hand, body size estimation was not systematically affected by face masks and facial expressions. It appears that face masks mainly show an expression-dependent influence on body attractiveness judgement, possibly through suppressing the perceived facial expressions."

In this article I examine local genres of anger expression in Beijing, China, particularly among marginalized workers, and address culturally specific responses to them. Through majie (rant), xiangpi ren (silenced rage), and nande hutu (muddledness as a more difficult kind of smartness), workers strategically employ anger to seek redress for injustices and legitimate their moral indignation while challenging official psychotherapeutic interventions. Those who seek to regulate anger, mostly psychosocial workers acting as arm's-length agents of the state, use mixed methods that draw on Western psychotherapy and indigenous psychological resources to frame, medicalize or appease workers' anger in the name of health and social stability. I demonstrate how the two processes--anger expression and responses to it--create tensions and result in an ambiguous and multivalent social terrain which Chinese subjects must negotiate and which the state attempts to govern. I argue that the ambivalence and multi-valence of anger expressions and state-sponsored reactions to them render this emotion both subversive vis-à-vis power and subject to manipulations that maintain social order."

This study focuses on the assessment of facial recognition of emotions in patients with depression through a new set of dynamic virtual faces (DVFs). The sample consisted of 54 stable patients compared to 54 healthy controls. The experiment consisted in an emotion recognition task using non-immersive virtual reality (VR) with DVFs of six basic emotions and neutral expression. Patients with depression showed a worst performance in facial affect recognition compared to healthy controls. Age of onset was negatively correlated with emotion recognition and no correlation was observed for duration of illness or number of lifetime hospitalizations. There was no correlation for the depression group between emotion recognition and degree of psychopathology, excessive rumination, degree of functioning, or quality of life. Hence, it is important to improve and validate VR tools for emotion recognition to achieve greater methodological homogeneity of studies and to be able to establish more conclusive results."

To date, it remains unknown whether these two movement abnormalities, possibly associated with hypo- and hyper-dopaminergia, respectively, co-existed in one sample with PLEs and interrelated in the early stage of psychotic progression. Therefore, this study was to examine if facial and upper-limb slow movements and irregular muscle contraction co-existed in individuals with PLEs, interrelated, and were associated with PLEs. A total of 26 individuals with PLEs, who were identified using the 16-item Prodromal Questionnaire, and 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received the facial and upper-limb movement measurement. A motion capture system was used to record the movement procedure and thus calculate kinematic variables that represented severity of slow movements and irregular muscle contraction. Results showed that facial and upper-limb slow movements and facial irregular muscle contraction existed in individuals with PLEs. For the total sample, slower facial movements were associated with less regular facial muscle contraction; slower upper-limb movements were associated with less regular upper-limb muscle contraction. Slower and less regular facial and upper-limb movements were associated with more severe PLEs. Compensatory changes in dopaminergic neural pathways in response to elevated dopamine might explain connection between slow movements and irregular muscle contraction. Because of the ability to detect facial and upper-limb movement abnormalities objectively and sensitively, motion analysis has great applicability to sensorimotor studies for people in the psychosis continuum."

The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effects of robotic training with the Ekso-GT on body representation (BR) and on the quality of life in patients with SCI. The trial was designed as a pilot, assessor-blinded study. Forty-two inpatients with a diagnosis of SCI, classified as either American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), were enrolled in this study and randomized into either a control (CG: n = 21) or an experimental (EG: n = 21) group. Patients in the EG received rehabilitation training with the Ekso-GT device, whereas the CG patients were trained with conventional physical therapy (CPT), which consisted of physical and occupational therapy and psychological support. We considered as a primary outcome the modified Body Uneasiness Test (MBUT), focusing on three specific subscales on the patient's perception of BR, i.e., the Global Severity Index (MBUT-GSI), which is an indicator of body suffering; the Positive Symptom Distress Index (MBUT-PSDI) that expresses an individual's psychological distress; and the Lower Limb MBUT (MBUT-LL), which indicates the subject's perception of their thighs/legs. The Short-Form-12 Health Status Questionnaire (SF12) and the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) were used as secondary outcomes to evaluate the effect of the training on the quality of life and the psychological status. Non-parametric statistical analysis showed that the effect of the two treatments was significantly different on MBUT (BR), SF-12 (quality of life), and, partially, BDI (mood). Particularly, patients belonging to the EG achieved a major improvement in nearly all test scores compared to those in the CG. Our data suggest that the Ekso-GT training could be helpful in achieving positive changes in BR in patients with chronic SCI, especially in reducing psychological distress (PSDI) and thigh/leg perception (MBUT-LL) with an overall improvement in quality of life (SF-12)."

Barriers exist to accessing perinatal mental health services, including limited availability, time, and cost. Automated conversational agents (chatbots) can deliver evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy content through text message-based conversations and reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in select populations. Such digital mental health technologies are poised to overcome barriers to mental health care access but need to be evaluated for efficacy, as well as for preliminary feasibility and acceptability among perinatal populations.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mental health chatbot for mood management in a general postpartum population.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic center. English-speaking postpartum women aged 18 years or above with a live birth and access to a smartphone were eligible for enrollment prior to discharge from delivery hospitalization. Baseline surveys were administered to all participants prior to randomization to a mental health chatbot intervention or to usual care only. The intervention group downloaded the mental health chatbot smartphone application with perinatal-specific content, in addition to continuing usual care. Usual care consisted of routine postpartum follow up and mental health care as dictated by the patient's obstetric provider. Surveys were administered during delivery hospitalization (baseline) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks postpartum to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms at 6-weeks as measured using two depression screening tools: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and satisfaction and acceptability using validated scales. Based on a prior study, we estimated a sample size of 130 would have sufficient (80%) power to detect a moderate effect size (d=.4) in between group difference on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 192 women were randomized equally 1:1 to the chatbot or usual care; of these, 152 women completed the 6-week survey (n=68 chatbot, n=84 usual care) and were included in the final analysis. Mean baseline mental health assessment scores were below positive screening thresholds. At 6-weeks, there was a greater decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores among the chatbot group compared to the usual care group (mean decrease=1.32, standard deviation=3.4 vs mean decrease=0.13, standard deviation=3.01, respectively). 6-week mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores did not differ between groups and were similar to baseline. 91% (n=62) of the chatbot users were satisfied or highly satisfied with the chatbot, and 74% (n=50) of the intervention group reported use of the chatbot at least once in 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey. 80% of study participants reported being comfortable with the use of a mobile smartphone application for mood management.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Use of a chatbot was acceptable to women in the early postpartum period. The sample did not screen positive for depression at baseline and thus the potential of the chatbot to reduce depressive symptoms in this population was limited.

With the pandemic further challenging mental health and increasing the barriers to maintaining optimal diabetes self-management, it is vital that this population has access to remotely deliverable, evidence-based interventions to improve psychological and diabetes outcomes. Chatbots, defined as digital conversational agents, offer these unique advantages, as well as the ability to engage in empathetic and personalized conversations 24-7. Building on previous work developing a self-compassion program for adolescents with T1D, a self-compassion chatbot (COMPASS) was developed for adolescents with T1D to address these concerns. However, the acceptability and potential clinical usability of a chatbot to deliver self-compassion coping tools to adolescents with T1D remained unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This qualitative study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and potential clinical utility of COMPASS among adolescents aged 12 to 16 years with T1D and diabetes health care professionals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Potential adolescent participants were recruited from previous participant lists, and on the web and in-clinic study flyers, whereas health care professionals were recruited via clinic emails and from diabetes research special interest groups. Qualitative Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) interviews exploring views on COMPASS were conducted with 19 adolescents (in 4 focus groups) and 11 diabetes health care professionals (in 2 focus groups and 6 individual interviews) from March 2022 to April 2022.

Health care professionals represented a range of disciplines, including diabetes nurse specialists (3/11, 27%), health psychologists (3/11, 27%), dieticians (3/11, 27%), and endocrinologists (2/11, 18%). The findings offer insight into what adolescents with T1D and their health care professionals see as the shared advantages of COMPASS and desired future additions, such as personalization (mentioned by all 19 adolescents), self-management support (mentioned by 13/19, 68% of adolescents), clinical utility (mentioned by all 11 health care professionals), and breadth and flexibility of tools (mentioned by 10/11, 91% of health care professionals).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Early data suggest that COMPASS is acceptable, is relevant to common difficulties, and has clinical utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shared desired features among both groups, including problem-solving and integration with diabetes technology to support self-management; creating a safe peer-to-peer sense of community; and broadening the representation of cultures, lived experience stories, and diabetes challenges, could further improve the potential of the chatbot. On the basis of these findings, COMPASS is currently being improved to be tested in a feasibility study."

After the COVID-19 pandemic, one out of five young people is experiencing mental health problems worldwide. New ways to face this burden are now needed. Young people search for low-burden services in terms of costs and time, paired with high flexibility and easy accessibility. Mobile applications meet these principles by providing new ways to inform, monitor, educate, and enable self-help, thus reinventing mental health care in youth. In this perspective, we explore the existing literature reviews on mobile assessments and interventions in youth through data collected passively (e.g., digital phenotyping) and actively (e.g., using Ecological Momentary Assessments-EMAs). The richness of such approaches relies on assessing mental health dynamically by extending beyond the confines of traditional methods and diagnostic criteria, and the integration of sensor data from multiple channels, thus allowing the cross-validation of symptoms through multiple information. However, we also acknowledge the promises and pitfalls of such approaches, including the problem of interpreting small effects combined with different data sources and the real benefits in terms of outcome prediction when compared to gold-standard methods. We also explore a new promising and complementary approach, using chatbots and conversational agents, that encourages interaction while tracing health and providing interventions. Finally, we suggest that it is important to continue to move beyond the ill-being framework by giving more importance to intervention fostering well-being, e.g., using positive psychology."

The current study examined not only whether employer-provided coaching is an effective strategy to improve mental health and wellbeing in employees; but also how this intervention changes wellbeing in stages over time.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The goal of this study was to determine whether BetterUp, a longitudinal one-on-one virtual coaching intervention, improves components of mental health and psychological wellbeing and whether the magnitude of changes vary in stages over time. This is the first research study to evaluate the effectiveness of professional coaching through three repeated assessments, moving beyond a pre- to post-intervention design. The outcomes of this study will enable coaches and employers to design more targeted interventions by outlining when to expect maximal growth in specific outcomes throughout the coaching engagement.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Three identical assessments were completed by 391 users of BetterUp - prior to the start of coaching, after approximately 3-4 months of coaching, and again after 6-7 months of coaching. Three scales were used to evaluate psychological and behavioral dimensions that support management of mental health - stress management, resilience, and life satisfaction. Six additional scales assessed psychological wellbeing - emotional regulation, prospection ability, finding purpose and meaning, self-awareness, self-efficacy, and social connection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Using mixed effects modeling, varying rates of change were observed in several dimensions of mental health and psychological wellbeing. Initial rapid improvements in the first half of the intervention, followed by slower growth in the second half of the intervention, were found for prospection ability, self-awareness, self-efficacy, social connection, emotional regulation, and a reduction in stress (range of unstandardized βs for each assessment: .10-.19). Life satisfaction improved continuously throughout the full intervention period (β: .13). Finding purpose in meaning at work and building resilience both grew continuously throughout the coaching intervention, but larger gains were experienced in the second half of the intervention (βs: .08-.18), requiring the full length of the intervention to realize maximal growth.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BetterUp virtual one-on-one coaching to improve psychological wellbeing, while mitigating threats to mental health such as excessive and prolonged stress, low resilience, and poor satisfaction with life. The improvements across the collection of outcomes were time-dependent and provide important insights to users and practitioners about how and when to expect maximal improvements in a range of interrelated personal and professional outcomes."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDepression impacts the lives of a large number of university students. Mobile-based therapy chatbots are increasingly being used to help young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still in lack.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression.\n## METHODS\nAn unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected.\n## RESULTS\nParticipants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; \n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants.\n"

            "abstract": "Performance anxiety can profoundly affect motor performance, even in experts such as professional athletes and musicians. Previously, the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety-induced performance deterioration have predominantly been investigated for individual one-shot actions. Sports and music, however, are characterized by action sequences, where many individual actions are assembled to develop a performance. Here, utilizing a novel differential sequential motor learning paradigm, we first show that performance at the junctions between pre-learnt action sequences is particularly prone to anxiety. Next, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we reveal that performance deterioration at the junctions is parametrically correlated with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Finally, we show that 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the dACC attenuates the performance deterioration at the junctions. These results demonstrate causality between dACC activity and impairment of sequential motor performance due to anxiety, and suggest new intervention techniques against the deterioration."

Observational learning of anxious behavior from parents with anxiety disorders plays an important role in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety. We investigated the link between parental anxiety (parental lifetime anxiety disorders and expressed parental anxiety) and toddler fear/avoidance during social referencing (SR) situations.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Toddlers (N = 117) participated with both parents (with lifetime social anxiety disorder, other nonsocial anxiety disorders, lifetime comorbid social and other anxiety disorders, or without anxiety disorders) in a longitudinal study. Behavioral inhibition (BI) was measured at 12 months via observational tasks. At 30 months, children were confronted with a stranger and a remote-control robot in SR situations, separately with each parent. Children's fear and avoidance, and parents' expressions of anxiety, encouragement, and overcontrol were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Toddlers of parents with lifetime social anxiety disorder (alone and comorbid with other anxiety disorders) showed more fear/avoidance in SR situations than toddlers of parents without anxiety disorders, while the effect of other anxiety disorders alone was not significant. Although expressed parental anxiety at 30 months in SR situations did not significantly predict toddlers' fear/avoidance, higher levels of expressed anxiety at 12 months in SR situations by parents with comorbid social and other anxiety disorders predicted higher levels of fear/avoidance. BI at 12 months predicted toddlers' fear/avoidance only with mothers, but not with fathers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Parental lifetime social anxiety disorders may be a stronger predictor of children's fear/avoidance than parents' expressions of anxiety in SR situations in toddlerhood. End of infancy may be a sensitive time for learning of anxiety from parents with comorbid lifetime social and nonsocial anxiety disorders in SR situations. Fathers are as important as mothers in the transmission of anxiety via SR. Furthermore, children may act relatively free of their early temperament in SR situations with fathers."

With the shortage of accessible healthcare facilities and resources, the community is turning to technology-based mental healthcare interventions such as telemental health systems, online support groups, self-service web and mobile applications, and chatbots. In this study, we assessed the extent in which the daily interaction with the chatbot Wysa can influence the well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students evaluated the usability and effectiveness of Wysa’s clinical interventions which include the talk therapy, gratitude journal, self-care practices and mindfulness exercise throughout the duration of the week-long experiment. They provided their perception on the quality of the chatbot’s response, affect and human-likeness, and shared attributes that would motivate self-disclosure and openness to communicate with the chatbot. Our findings can shed insights on the effectiveness of mental health apps as a coping mechanism in a time of social isolation and provide suggestions on how such technologies can be improved in order to maximize well-being benefits as well as user satisfaction."

Although previous psychological research has examined how human needs can be met by anthropomorphized agents, it has neglected virtual romantic relationships. This paper introduces the concept of romantic anthropomorphism (i.e. giving a non-human agent human-like characteristics in a romantic context) to help understand virtual romance. In three laboratory studies, we used romantic video games (RVGs) to examine how romantic anthropomorphism predicts relationship authenticity, desire for real-world relationship and mood (Studies 1A, 1B and 2) as well as real-world interpersonal behaviour (Study 2). Study 1A revealed that romantic anthropomorphism of a virtual agent predicted desire for a real-world relationship with the virtual agent and greater positive affect via feeling that the relationship built with the virtual agent was authentic. Study 1B replicated these results using a larger sample and a different RVG. Study 2 replicated these results, but revealed that playing RVGs failed to predict real-world behaviour in a subsequent interaction with a human confederate. This research identifies a unique way that people find connection in the modern world and provides novel insight into the fields of anthropomorphism, virtual interactions and relationship science."

However, because of fear of societal stigma, students may find it more difficult to approach others about the stress they experience. A chatbot can provide an alternative avenue for students to freely share the stressful situations they are experiencing. In this study, we investigated the use of Woebot as a mechanism to help senior high school students alleviate stress from academic workload. 25 participants who engaged in daily conversations with Woebot for a two-week period rated the chatbot’s likeness to a human with a mean score of 5.56 out of 8, while its ability to understand the feelings of the participants and empathize with them had a mean score of 5.61. An analysis of the chat logs showed that the participants valued Woebot’s lessons and stories while they faced challenges in cases when the chatbot generated inappropriate responses. We discuss our findings and provide design suggestions that could make conversational agents like Woebot be more useful in helping the general student population cope with stress."

Here, we examined microstate dynamics in resting-state recordings of unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia, patients with schizophrenia, healthy controls, and patients with first episodes of psychosis (FEP). Patients with schizophrenia and their siblings showed increased presence of microstate class C and decreased presence of microstate class D compared to controls.

Overall, the therapy set-up, with its digital components and its distinctive features as compared with common face-to-face talking therapies, was satisfactory. The inclusion of technology was well accepted as both a means to deliver the therapy and a tool to create a digital representation of the person's distressing voice.

Depression can be treated with counselling and pharmacotherapy. Tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely used, but there is still need for controlled clinical trials. Management of psychosis in PD is complex and includes elimination of identifiable risk factors, reduction of polypharmacy and administration of atypical neuroleptics, which can alleviate psychotic symptoms without worsening motor functions. Clozapine is the best documented atypical neuroleptic shown to be effective against psychosis in PD patients. Cholinesterase inhibitors may prove additional benefit in psychotic PD patients.

Data on the clinical and behavioral characteristics of persons receiving medical care for HIV infection are critical to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality and for program planning to allocate services and resources, guide prevention planning, assess unmet medical and ancillary service needs, and help develop intervention programs and health policies at the local, state, and national levels.\n    \n\n\n          Reporting period covered:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected during June 2007-September 2008 for patients who received medical care in 2007 (sampled from January 1-April 30).\n    \n\n\n          Description of the system:\n        \n      \n      The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is an ongoing, multisite supplemental surveillance project that assesses behaviors, clinical characteristics, and quality of care of HIV-infected persons who are receiving medical care. Participants must be aged ≥ 18 years and have received medical care at sampled facilities that provide HIV medical care within participating MMP project areas. Self-reported behavioral and selected clinical data are collected using an in-person interview. A total of 26 project areas in 19 states and Puerto Rico were funded to collect data during the 2007 MMP data collection cycle.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The results from the 2007 MMP cycle indicated that among 3,643 participants, a total of 3,040 (84%) had some form of health insurance or coverage during the 12 months before the interview; of these, 45% reported having Medicaid, 37% reported having private health insurance or coverage through a health maintenance organization, and 30% reported having Medicare. A total of 3,091 (85%) of the participants were currently taking antiretroviral medications. Among 3,609 participants who reported ever having a CD4 T-lymphocyte test, 2,996 (83%) reported having three or more CD4 T-lymphocyte tests in the 12 months before the interview. Among 3,567 participants who reported ever having an HIV viral load test, 2,946 (83%) reported having three or more HIV viral load tests in the 12 months before the interview. Among 3,643 participants, 45% needed HIV case management, 33% needed mental health counseling, and 32% needed assistance finding dental services during the 12 months before the interview; 8%, 13%, and 25% of these participants who needed the services, respectively, had not received these services by the time of the interview. Noninjection drugs were used for nonmedical purposes by 1,117 (31%) participants during the 12 months before the interview, and 122 (3%) participants had used injection drugs for nonmedical purposes. Unprotected anal intercourse was reported by 527 (54%) of 970 men who reported having anal sex with a man during the 12 months before the interview. Unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse was reported by 176 (32%) of the 553 men who reported having anal or vaginal intercourse with a woman during the 12 months before the interview. Unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse was reported by 216 (42%) of the 516 women who reported having anal or vaginal intercourse with a man during the 12 months before the interview.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      The findings in this report indicate that in 2007, most persons with HIV infection who were receiving medical care were taking antiretroviral therapy and had some form of health insurance or coverage; however, some persons were not receiving needed critical ancillary services, such as HIV case management or help finding dental services. In addition, some persons living with HIV infection engaged in behaviors, such as unprotected sex, that increase the risk for transmitting HIV to sexual partners, and some used noninjection or injection drugs for nonmedical purposes, which might decrease adherence to antiretroviral therapy and increase health-risk behaviors.\n    \n\n\n          Public health actions:\n        \n      \n      MMP data can be used to monitor the national HIV/AIDS strategy goal of increasing access to care and optimizing health outcomes among persons living with HIV. Persons infected with HIV who are not receiving needed ancillary services highlight missed opportunities for access to care and other supportive services, information that can be used to advocate for additional resources. Drug use among persons with HIV infection underscores the continued need for substance abuse treatment services for this population. In addition, prevention services and programs are needed to decrease the number of HIV-infected persons engaging in unprotected sex. The data in this report can be included in local, state, and national HIV/AIDS epidemiologic profiles and shared with community stakeholders. Although data from the 2007 MMP cycle might not be representative of all persons receiving medical care for HIV infection in the United States or in the individual project areas, future MMP cycles are expected to yield weighted national estimates representing all HIV-infected persons receiving medical care in the United States."

            "abstract": "Major depression is a serious, potentially life-threatening illness that can cause significant pain and suffering. It afflicts up to 50% of patients who are seen in the primary care setting. However, it is a remarkably treatable disorder, once it is recognized. The mainstay of treatment is education about the illness, brief supportive counseling, and antidepressant medication. This monograph is a synopsis of a book, Outpatient Management of the Depressed Patient, recently published on this subject. We focus on how to diagnose and treat major depression in the primary care setting, in which the vast majority of patients with this condition are seen. We review the condition itself, how to establish the diagnosis, what education and brief supportive counseling are needed and how to provide them, how to select an antidepressant, and how to use the drug to induce and maintain remission."

            "abstract": "During adolescence, some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) engage in severe challenging behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, disruption, agitation and tantrums. We aimed to assess risk factors associated with very acute behavioral crises in adolescents with ASD admitted to a dedicated neurobehavioral unit. We included retrospectively in 2008 and 2009 29 adolescents and young adults with ASD hospitalized for severe challenging behaviors and proposed a guideline (Perisse et al., 2010) that we applied prospectively for 29 patients recruited for the same indications between 2010 and 2012. In total, 58 patients were admitted (n=70 hospitalizations, mean age=15.66 (±4.07) years, 76% male). We systematically collected data describing socio-demographic characteristics, clinical variables (severity, presence of language, cognitive level), comorbid organic conditions, etiologic diagnosis of the episode, and treatments. We explored predictors of Global Assessment Functioning Scale (GAFS) score and duration of hospitalization at discharge. All but 2 patients exhibited severe autistic symptoms and intellectual disability (ID), and two-thirds had no functional verbal language. During the inpatient stay (mean=84.3 (±94.9) days), patients doubled on average their GAFS scores (mean=17.66 (±9.05) at admission vs. mean=31.4 (±9.48) at discharge). Most common etiologies for acute behavioral crises were organic causes [n=20 (28%), including epilepsy: n=10 (14%) and painful medical conditions: n=10 (14%)], environmental causes [n=17 (25%) including lack of treatment: n=11 (16%) and adjustment disorder: n=6 (9%)], and non-ASD psychiatric condition [n=33 (48%) including catatonia: n=5 (7%), major depressive episode: n=6 (9%), bipolar disorder: n=4 (6%), schizophrenia: n=6 (9%), other/unknown diagnosis: n=12 (17%)]. We found no influence of age, gender, socio-economic status, migration, level of ID, or history of seizure on improvement of GAFS score at discharge. Severity of autism at admission was the only negative predictor (p<.001). Painful medical conditions (p=.04), non-ASD psychiatric diagnoses (p=.001), prior usage of specialized ASD care programs (p=.004), functional language (p=.007), as well as a higher number of challenging behaviors upon admission (p=.001) were associated with higher GAFS scores at discharge. Clinical severity at admission, based on the number of challenging behaviors (r=.35, p=.003) and GAFS score (r=-.32, p=.008) was correlated with a longer inpatient stay. Longer hospitalization was however correlated (r=.27, p=.03) with higher GAFS score at discharge even after adjustment for confounding factors. Challenging behaviors among adolescents with ASD may stem from diverse risk factors, including environmental problems, comorbid acute psychiatric conditions, or somatic illness such as epilepsy or acute pain. The management of these behavioral challenges requires a unified, multidisciplinary approach."

            "abstract": "Clinical characteristics:\n        \n      \n      Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic calcium deposits in the basal ganglia and other brain areas visualized on neuroimaging. Most affected individuals are in good health during childhood and young adulthood and typically present in the fourth to fifth decade with a gradually progressive movement disorder and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The movement disorder first manifests as clumsiness, fatigability, unsteady gait, slow or slurred speech, dysphagia, involuntary movements, or muscle cramping. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, often the first or most prominent manifestations, range from mild difficulty with concentration and memory to changes in personality and/or behavior, to psychosis and dementia. Seizures of various types occur frequently, some individuals experience chronic headache and vertigo; urinary urgency or incontinence may be present.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of PFBC relies on: visualization of bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging; presence of progressive neurologic dysfunction; and absence of metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause. A family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance is often found as well. Thus, the diagnosis of PFBC should be left for those cases where other neurologic or systemic disorders potentially associated with ectopic calcium deposits have not been identified after appropriate examinations. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in PDGFB, PDGFRB, SLC20A2, or XPR1 has been identified in a little more than half of those individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PFBC.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Pharmacologic treatment to improve anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, as well as for movement disorders (e.g., tremors) or dystonia; anticholinergics for urinary incontinence; anti-seizure medication for seizures.\n    \n\nSurveillance: Annual neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessments.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Cautious use of neuroleptic medications as they may exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      PFBC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with PFBC have an affected parent identified either clinically or by brain CT scan. However, the transmitting parent may be clinically asymptomatic throughout life or may develop disease manifestations that are later in onset or less severe than those in the proband. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to be heterozygous for a PFBC-related pathogenic variant, sibs of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant; however, the risk to sibs of being clinically affected may be slightly lower due to reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member."

            "abstract": "Cartoon faces are widely used in social media, animation production, and social robots because of their attractive ability to convey different emotional information. Despite their popular applications, the mechanisms of recognizing emotional expressions in cartoon faces are still unclear. Therefore, three experiments were conducted in this study to systematically explore a recognition process for emotional cartoon expressions (happy, sad, and neutral) and to examine the influence of key facial features (mouth, eyes, and eyebrows) on emotion recognition. Across the experiments, three presentation conditions were employed: (1) a full face; (2) individual feature only (with two other features concealed); and (3) one feature concealed with two other features presented. The cartoon face images used in this study were converted from a set of real faces acted by Chinese posers, and the observers were Chinese. The results show that happy cartoon expressions were recognized more accurately than neutral and sad expressions, which was consistent with the happiness recognition advantage revealed in real face studies. Compared with real facial expressions, sad cartoon expressions were perceived as sadder, and happy cartoon expressions were perceived as less happy, regardless of whether full-face or single facial features were viewed. For cartoon faces, the mouth was demonstrated to be a feature that is sufficient and necessary for the recognition of happiness, and the eyebrows were sufficient and necessary for the recognition of sadness. This study helps to clarify the perception mechanism underlying emotion recognition in cartoon faces and sheds some light on directions for future research on intelligent human-computer interactions."

This innovative technology has become increasingly common in practical implementation. However, empirical support has not kept pace with the robots' growing popularity. The present study set out to provide an empirical test of the stress-buffering capability of this technology. We examined the effects of the presence of an SAR on self-reported measures of stress in a community sample of 70 children (40 girls, 30 boys) between the ages of 7 and 10 years old. Child participants were randomly assigned to either a robot-present or a robot-absent condition during the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Contrary to our predictions, we did not detect a stress-buffering effect of the presence of the robot. Instead, the primary analysis showed that the robot's presence led to a larger decrease in positive affect following the task. However, further analyses found no significant difference in positive affect when accounting for baseline group differences. Exploratory analyses of the nature of children's interactions with the SAR during the stressful task found that higher levels of parent-reported social anxiety were associated with greater prosocial behaviors towards the SAR, thus signifying a potential target for future interventions. Further work on SARs is needed to determine the optimal timing and robotic specifications that would maximize the potential of this developing technology to improve children's mental health care."

Needed information identified by this study included technical information about the drugs themselves and their mechanisms of action, roles and responsibilities of health personnel, and descriptions of other women's experiences with mifepristone. A multiplicity of factors entered the decision-making process, demonstrating at the same time a complexity and flexibility of thought. In their hypothetical evaluation of mifepristone, women weighed such factors as experience with childbirth, spontaneous abortion and vacuum aspiration, specific issues for teenagers, lack of a support system, experience with herbal emenagogues and nonprescription drugs intended as abortifacients, and the relative dependence on health care providers. Social, personal, and cultural factors entered into women's interpretation of the different options. These socio-cultural contexts can profoundly influence decisions and potentially affect clinical outcomes. If health care professionals are not proactive, do not fully provide answers to questions (even if unasked), and fail to probe for specific life circumstances, then poor choices and poor outcomes may follow with long term negative consequences for clients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We report psychosocial needs of pHIV youth identified using the \"Youth Counseling Needs Survey\" (YCS) and during individual counseling (IC) sessions. pHIV youth receiving care at two tertiary-care hospitals in Bangkok or at an orphanage in Lopburi province were invited to participate IC sessions. The youths' psychosocial needs were assessed using instructive IC sessions in four main areas: general health, reproductive health, mood, and psychosocial concerns. Prior to the IC session youth were asked to complete the YCS in which their concerns in the four areas were investigated. Issues identified from the YCS and the IC sessions were compared. During October 2010-July 2011, 150 (68.2%) of 220 eligible youths participated in the IC sessions and completed the YCS. Median age was 14 (range 11-18) years and 92 (61.3%) were female. Mean duration of the IC sessions was 36.5 minutes. One-hundred and thirty (86.7%) youths reported having at least one psychosocial problem discovered by either the IC session or the YCS. The most common problems identified during the IC session were poor health attitude and self-care (48.0%), lack of life skills (44.0%), lack of communication skills (40.0%), poor antiretroviral (ARV) adherence (38.7%), and low self-value (34.7%). The most common problems identified by the YCS were lack of communication skills (21.3%), poor health attitude and self-care (14.0%), and poor ARV adherence (12.7%). Youth were less likely to report psychosocial problems in the YCS than in the IC session. Common psychosocial needs among HIV-infected youth were issues about life skills, communication skills, knowledge on self-care, ARV adherence, and self-value.

            "abstract": "The large number of persons living with HIV in Southern Africa has implications for mental health services for this population. Data have emerged in recent years showing that a substantial number of persons living with HIV also have mental health problems. Yet, the practice of routine screening for psychiatric disorders in the context of HIV care is controversial. Moreover, common mental health problems, if left undetected and untreated, may have severe consequences for adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which in turn will likely lead to severe health consequences for patients. There are high costs associated with employing professional psychologists, counsellors, and social workers to provide psychosocial support to ART users. As a result, in many contexts lay counsellors and patient advocates have been employed as a less costly alternative. High standards of training of lay counsellors, as well as on-going supervision and support to patient advocates is necessary to ensure optimal outcomes/results."

            "abstract": "When should we use antidepressant medications in children? Antidepressant medication may not be considered as a first-line treatment in children; psychotherapeutic treatments should always be preferentially used. At this age, the efficacy of SSRI is regarded as low to moderate for depression, but moderate to high for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders. When an antidepressant medication is prescribed, a SSRI should always be used first. In particular, fluoxetine is the most studied SSRI and the only medication who received approval by the French regulatory authority. Sertraline and fluvoxamine which have been approved for OCD should preferentially be used for that purpose. During the first 4 weeks, clinicians should actively monitor the onset of side effects, especially mood swings and suicidal behavior. The onset or increase of suicidal thoughts during SSRI treatment would concern about 1 out of 100 young patients treated. This risk is maximal during the first four weeks following the introduction of the SSRI and should progressively decrease after one month. When used in children, antidepressant medication can only be used in association with psychotherapeutic treatments and psychosocial interventions targeting the maintaining factors perpetuating the cycle of affective symptoms."

Loneliness is linked with depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, weakened immune system, poor physical health, poor quality of life and mortality. The use of robotic assistance may help mitigate social isolation and loneliness. Although telepresence robots have been used in healthcare settings, a comprehensive review of studies focusing on their use in aged care for reducing social isolation requires further investigation. This scoping review will focus on the use of telepresence robots to support social connection of older people in care settings.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      This scoping review will follow Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. The review team consists of patient partners and family partners, a nurse researcher and a group of students. In the scoping review, we will search the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, PsycINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. Google and Google Scholar will be used to search for additional literature. A handsearch will be conducted using the reference lists of included studies to identify additional relevant articles.

PD-dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are second to Alzheimer's disease in causing degenerative dementia in the elderly. The nosological distinction of the conditions has remained controversial because of broad clinical and pathological overlap. Treatment issues in both clinical settings are virtually identical. Treatment of Parkinsonism is often complicated by drug-induced psychosis and reduced levodopa responsiveness. Cognition, alertness, attention, as well as apathy or aggressive behavior have been shown to respond to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in randomized controlled trials both in DLB and PDD. Such treatment may also improve hallucinosis, but many patients will require add-on treatment with atypical neuroleptics to control drug-induced psychotic reactions. Clozapine and quetiapine are the drugs most commonly used and, contrary to classic neuroleptics, risperidone or olanzapine do not seem to cause severe side effects according to published data."

From the psychological point of view, the patients are offered to aquire relaxation and stress coping techniques, to take part in non-smoking courses and to use individual psychological counselling in case of depression or panic. In addition, all HIV-infected patients are offered individual advice on their disease and necessary changes in lifestyle. Finally, the programme includes social medical evaluation and counselling. As the majority of the patients are still working or are of working age, evaluating the capacity for work and potential introduction of occupational rehabilitation measures are prominent. Almost 70 percent of the HIV-infected patients who had been treated in our clinic over the last few years were fully capable of returning to their previous occupation. Our experiences demonstrate that statements such as rehabilitation of AIDS patients being useless because of its missing prospects of success, are not up-to-date any longer.

Depression during pregnancy or the presence of risk factors suggests the need for careful follow-up. If postpartum depression develops, psychotherapy is the first-line treatment.

            "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a life-long, debilitating psychotic disorder with poor outcome that affects about 1% of the population. Although pharmacotherapy can alleviate some of the acute psychotic symptoms, residual social impairments present a significant barrier that prevents successful rehabilitation. With limited resources and access to social skills training opportunities, innovative technology has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for intervention. In this paper, we present a novel virtual reality (VR)-based system for understanding facial emotion processing impairments that may lead to poor social outcome in schizophrenia. We henceforth call it a VR System for Affect Analysis in Facial Expressions (VR-SAAFE). This system integrates a VR-based task presentation platform that can minutely control facial expressions of an avatar with or without accompanying verbal interaction, with an eye-tracker to quantitatively measure a participants real-time gaze and a set of physiological sensors to infer his/her affective states to allow in-depth understanding of the emotion recognition mechanism of patients with schizophrenia based on quantitative metrics. A usability study with 12 patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls was conducted to examine processing of the emotional faces. Preliminary results indicated that there were significant differences in the way patients with schizophrenia processed and responded towards the emotional faces presented in the VR environment compared with healthy control participants. The preliminary results underscore the utility of such a VR-based system that enables precise and quantitative assessment of social skill deficits in patients with schizophrenia."

            "abstract": "Fatigue is the most common symptom in patients with advanced cancer. It is a subjective sensation with physical, cognitive, and affective modes of expression. The etiology is often unclear, and multiple potential etiologic factors for fatigue may coexist. Assessing fatigue involves characterizing its severity, temporal features, exacerbating and relieving factors, associated distress, and impact on daily life. Potential factors contributing to fatigue are the cancer itself, cancer treatment, cancer or treatment complications, medications, and other physical and psychosocial conditions. Many fatigue assessment tools exist. Fatigue management involves specific (targeting potentially reversible causes of fatigue) and symptomatic (targeting symptoms because no obvious etiology or reversible cause for fatigue can be identified) intervention and treatment measures. Specific interventions include treating anemia or metabolic and endocrine abnormalities, as well as managing pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Symptomatic treatment involves education, counseling, and pharmacologic, and nonpharmacologic measures. Pharmacologic agents that have been investigated for use in treating fatigue include corticosteroids, progestational agents, and psychostimulants. Agents that modulate cytokine activity are future treatment possibilities."

Theoretical models a, b, and c govern the choice of drug therapy for anorexia nervosa, and models d and e govern the choice of drug therapy for bulimia. Drugs used to treat anorexia nervosa and bulimia include tricyclic antidepressants and lithium carbonate. Chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, cyproheptadine, and clomiphene citrate have also been prescribed for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat bulimia. Fenfluramine has the potential to be of therapeutic value in patients with bulimia. Although drug therapy plays a limited role in the treatment of eating disorders, drugs are commonly prescribed.

Low-cost, sustainable, and effective service models that integrate depression care into the management of ACS patients to reduce depression and improve ACS outcomes are critically needed. Integrating Depression Care in ACS patients in Low Resource Hospitals in China (I-CARE) is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an 11-month integrated care (IC) intervention compared to usual care (UC) in management of ACS patients. Four thousand inpatients will be recruited and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an IC intervention consisting of nurse-led risk factor management, group-based counseling supplemented by individual problem-solving therapy, and antidepressant medications as needed, or to UC. The primary outcomes are depression symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints include anxiety measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; quality of life measured by the EQ-5D at 6 and 12 months; and major adverse events including the combined end point of all-cause death, suicide attempts, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and all-cause rehospitalization at yearly intervals for a median follow-up of 2 years. Analyses of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of IC also will be performed.

            "abstract": "Facial expression is one of the most significant elements which can tell us about the mental state of any person. A human can convey approximately 55% of information nonverbally and the remaining almost 45% through verbal communication. Automatic facial expression recognition is presently one of the most difficult tasks in the computer science field. Applications of facial expression recognition (FER) are not just limited to understanding human behavior and monitoring person's mood and the mental state of humans. It is also penetrating into other fields such as criminology, holographic, smart healthcare systems, security systems, education, robotics, entertainment, and stress detection. Currently, facial expressions are playing an important role in medical sciences, particularly helping the patients with bipolar disease, whose mood changes very frequently. In this study, an algorithm, automated framework for facial detection using a convolutional neural network (FD-CNN) is proposed with four convolution layers and two hidden layers to improve accuracy. An extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset is used that includes facial images of different males and females with expressions such as anger, fear, disgust, contempt, neutral, happy, sad, and surprise. In this study, FD-CNN is performed in three major steps that include preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. By using this proposed method, an accuracy of 94% is obtained in FER. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, K-fold cross-validation is performed. After validation, sensitivity and specificity are calculated which are 94.02% and 99.14%, respectively. Furthermore, the f1 score, recall, and precision are calculated to validate the quality of the model which is 84.07%, 78.22%, and 94.09%, respectively."

We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants&#146; emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient&#146;s medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient.

            "title": "A clinician guide to patients afraid of dental injections and numbness.",
            "abstract": "Fears of dental injections remain a clinical problem often requiring cognitive behavioural psychology counselling and sedation in order to carry out needed dental treatment. This study, based on a national survey in Australia, compared patient concerns about numbness caused by local anaesthesia and fears of the injection itself. It also examined associations between dental fearfulness and avoidance associated with patient self-reported negative experiences and treatment need. Clinical advice on how to approach such patients is offered. Relatively high levels of dental anxiety and fear have been reported in several industrialised Western societies (McGrath & Bedi, 2004; Armfield, Spencer & Stewart, 2006; Lahti et al., 2007; Enkling, Marwinski Jöhren, 2006). In the U.K., almost one in three adults consider themselves to always be anxious about going to the dentist (Nuttall et al., 2001). Of concern is that this dental fear may be passed on to the children of anxious adults (Nuttall, Gilbert & Morris, 2008), leading to an inter-generational perpetuation of the problem. There is considerable evidence that dental fear is related to poorer oral health, reduced dental attendance and increased treatment stress for the attending dentist. There are many aspects of going to a dentist that might elicit feelings of apprehension, concern or anxiety in prospective patients (Liddell & Gosse, 1998; Oosterink, de Jongh & Aartman, 2008). One of the most commonly reported concerns relates to receiving injections. Indeed, fear of needles and the treatment of injection fear has been an important focus of a research in the U.K. (Boyle, Newton & Milgrom, 2010). Needle fear, in particular, is a major issue given that the delivery of local anaesthesia via injection is the central plank of pain relief techniques in dentistry (Malamed, 2009) and dentists as well as patients often avoid difficult injections as a consequence, resulting in poor pain control. A less well described anxiety of receiving dental treatment is fear of numbness associated with the dental injection (Morse & Cohen, 1983). Certainly, many dentists believe that their patients avoid local anaesthesia because of a wish to avoid the disturbing effects of numbness (Moore et al., 1998). Milgrom et al. (1997) found that fears about the numbness associated with receiving local anaesthesia significantly differentiated avoiders and non-avoiders of dental treatment. However, these concerns appeared to be much less common than those concerning the perceived pain of injections and fear of bodily injury resulting from the injection (Milgrom et al., 1997; Kaako et al., 1998). Consistent with these findings, whereas 43% of English patients asked to imagine undergoing future third molar surgery expressed concerns primarily about pain, only 6% of patients indicated concern about numbness as their worst fear (Earl, 1994). More recently, a study of Dutch people found that the feeling of numbness from the anaesthesia was rated as the 41st most feared dental stimulus out of a list of 67 possible stimuli, and that only 1.5% of the general population regarded numbness as extremely anxiety provoking (Oosterink, de Jongh & Aartman, 2008). However, it is important for a clinician to differentiate between those who dislike the sensation of temporary numbness versus those who may worry that it may never wear off. Such problem thinking can be an issue irrespective of whether a patient overcomes the fear of needles with sedation or not. A large number of patients dislike the sensation of numbness enough for manufacturers to respond with a partial antidote in alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine mesylate (OraVerse Sanofi-Aventis, Hersh & Lindemeyer, 2010). Approval of this agent, which shortens the length of soft tissue anaesthesia after inferior alveolar block, is pending in the UK and other European countries. In other cases, dentists resort to using local anaesthetics without vasoconstrictors to shorten the period of anaesthesia (Fiset, Getz, Milgrom & Weinstein, 1989). While the association between dental fear and fear of injections has received considerable attention, the relationship between dental fear and numbness has received less attention. In particular, the nature of the associations between dental fear and avoidance and anxiety over numbness has not been studied. There has also been no research into whether or not concerns over numbness are independent of injection concerns. Finally, the association between fear of numbness and injections and dental avoidance and treatment needs has not been investigated. This study, based on survey work in Australia, aimed to compare patient concerns about numbness caused by receiving anaesthesia to that of anxiety over the receipt of needles and injections. Associations with dental fear and avoidance as well as negative experiences and treatment needs were also explored."

Male physicians had more fixed opinions, both positive and negative, than female physicians.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Finnish physicians are still quite critical about community pharmacists involvement in counselling patients on psychotropic medication.

            "abstract": "The clinical severity, impact on development, and poor prognosis of childhood onset schizophrenia may represent a more homogeneous group. Positive symptoms in children are necessary for the diagnosis and hallucinations are more often multimodal. In healthy children and children with a variety of other psychiatric illnesses, hallucinations are not uncommon and diagnosis should not be based on these alone. Childhood onset schizophrenia is an extraordinarily rare illness that is poorly understood but seems continuous with the adult onset disorder. Once a diagnosis is affirmed, aggressive medication treatment combined with family education and individual counseling may defer further deterioration."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Many patients with psychosis experience everyday social situations as anxiety-provoking. The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075).

In this article we analyze what it would mean for a robot to have emotion, distinguishing emotional expression for communication from emotion as a mechanism for the organization of behavior. Research on the neurobiology of emotion yields a deepening understanding of interacting brain structures and neural mechanisms rooted in neuromodulation that underlie emotions in humans and other animals. However, the chemical basis of animal function differs greatly from the mechanics and computations of current machines. We therefore abstract from biology a functional characterization of emotion that does not depend on physical substrate or evolutionary history, and is broad enough to encompass the possible emotions of robots."

It is now clear that virtually all recently remitted patients should receive 4 to 6 months of continuation therapy. Moreover, this phase of treatment should continue until the patient has achieved a clear-cut, durable period of recovery. Further, an extended course of maintenance pharmacotherapy is recommended for those patients at risk for subsequent recurrent episodes. In this paper, the rationale for long-term treatment is presented and common strategies are reviewed. Depressive disorders appear to become more autonomous, severe, and potentially refractory with each new episode. Thus, prevention of recurrent depression remains the best available strategy to ensure an optimal long-term outcome for patients with recurrent affective disorders."

            "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects an estimated 21 million people worldwide. The literature establishes that electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-implemented means of studying and diagnosing mental disorders. However, it is known that speech and language provide unique and essential information about human thought. Semantic and emotional content, semantic coherence, syntactic structure, and complexity can thus be combined in a machine learning process to detect schizophrenia. Several studies show that early identification is crucial to prevent the onset of illness or mitigate possible complications. Therefore, it is necessary to identify disease-specific biomarkers for an early diagnosis support system. This work contributes to improving our knowledge about schizophrenia and the features that can identify this mental illness via speech and EEG. The emotional state is a specific characteristic of schizophrenia that can be identified with speech emotion analysis. The most used features of speech found in the literature review are fundamental frequency (F0), intensity/loudness (I), frequency formants (F1, F2, and F3), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC's), the duration of pauses and sentences (SD), and the duration of silence between words. Combining at least two feature categories achieved high accuracy in the schizophrenia classification. Prosodic and spectral or temporal features achieved the highest accuracy. The work with higher accuracy used the prosodic and spectral features QEVA, SDVV, and SSDL, which were derived from the F0 and spectrogram. The emotional state can be identified with most of the features previously mentioned (F0, I, F1, F2, F3, MFCCs, and SD), linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCC), linear spectral features (LSF), and the pause rate. Using the event-related potentials (ERP), the most promissory features found in the literature are mismatch negativity (MMN), P2, P3, P50, N1, and N2. The EEG features with higher accuracy in schizophrenia classification subjects are the nonlinear features, such as Cx, HFD, and Lya."

There are currently six brands of pills marketed in the United States that can be prescribed to, conform to the FDA-approved regimen. When emergency contraceptive pills are initiated within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, they reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75%. Contraindications are the same as those used for ongoing contraceptive pills. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, menstrual disturbances, breast tenderness, abdominal cramping, dizziness, headache, and mood changes.

In this study, we thoroughly investigate how the perception of emotions affects postural control and action tendencies, by contrasting two types of stimuli (emotional static faces or emotional videos) expressing different types of basic emotions (happy, fear, angry, sad, disgust and neutral). We also take into account some other contributing factors relying on stable individual traits (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, empathy, etc) and emotional state (e.g., anxiety). Our results show that dynamic stimuli have a greater impact than static stimuli on postural control. Moreover, a crucial aspect of our work lay in the modulation of the relationship between emotions and posture, by stable individual traits."

Recently, many researches have shown that the virtual avatar technology has been enhanced and the avatar could be perceived like real human. A virtual avatar, standing in a virtual room, was designed for this study. Tasks to approach, initiate a talk, and answer to avatar's questions was assigned to the 11 patients with schizophrenia. As behavioral parameters in the virtual environment, the interpersonal distance and the verbal response time were acquired. In addition, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for patients was administered in order to investigate the relationship between patients' symptomatic characteristics and behavior parameters. The interpersonal distance was negatively correlated with the negative syndrome scale, a subscale of PANSS, which is consistent with previous research reporting the relationship between interpersonal distance and a real person's image. The verbal response time, however, was not correlated with any other subscale of PANSS.

In Study 2, a total of 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with a history of suicidal ideation in the past 36 months were enrolled in a 2-year industry-sponsored suicide prevention study. At baseline, these patients were administered the ISST and the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) by the Principal Investigator (PI) and by a blinded rater (BR), who also administered the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS), and the Scale of Functioning (SOF).

            "abstract": "The desire for an even skin tone pervades all cultures and regions of the world. Uniform skin color is considered a sign of beauty and youth. Pigmentation abnormalities can arise idiopathically with genetic predetermination, with injury and environmental exposures, and with advancing age, and can, therefore, be distressing to patients, leading them to seek a variety of treatments with professional assistance. In this short report, we describe the trends in the use of prescription lightening creams, particularly in patients with darker skin types residing in the US. Amongst 404 participants, skin hyperpigmentation had a moderate effect on patients' quality of life, and the most common diagnosis associated with the use of a prescription product was melasma (60.8%). The most common agent prescribed was hydroquinone (62.9%), followed by triple combination cream (31.4%). It is the dermatologist's duty to gauge the effect of the pigmentation disease on patients' life in order to counsel, tailor, and decide on the most appropriate treatment option."

To date, interventions to improve adherence to ART have had limited success, perhaps because they have failed to systematically elicit and address both perceptual and practical barriers to adherence. The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Supporting UPtake and Adherence (SUPA) intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study comprises 2 phases. Phase 1 is an observational cohort study, in which PLWH who are ART naïve and recommended to take ART by their clinician complete a questionnaire assessing their beliefs about ART over 12 months. Phase 2 is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) nested within the observational cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of the SUPA intervention on adherence to ART. PLWH at risk of nonadherence (based on their beliefs about ART) will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to the intervention (SUPA intervention + usual care) and control (usual care) arms. The SUPA intervention involves 4 tailored treatment support sessions delivered by a Research Nurse utilising a collaborative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) approach. Sessions are tailored to individual needs and preferences based on the individual patient's perceptions and practical barriers to ART. An animation series and intervention manual have been developed to communicate a rationale for the personal necessity for ART and illustrate concerns and potential solutions. The primary outcome is adherence to ART measured using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Three hundred seventy-two patients will be sufficient to detect a 15% difference in adherence with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Costs will be compared between intervention and control groups. Costs will be combined with the primary outcome in cost-effectiveness analyses.

            "abstract": "Balancing efficacy with tolerability and safety of prescribed treatments is critical to optimizing antipsychotic treatment outcomes in the mentally ill. Symptom control, symptom remission, and functional recovery are only realistic goals when treatments are both effective and well tolerated. The consideration of predictable differences in antipsychotic adverse-effect profiles is central to successful illness management. Minimizing adverse effects on alertness, motivation, cognition, sexual/reproductive functioning, and physical health enhances mental health outcomes, partly through improving treatment adherence. Neuroendocrine and metabolic side effects of antipsychotics for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality need to be addressed proactively and aggressively. In view of the widespread lack of primary care engagement and the adverse effects of psychotropic medications on cardiovascular health, psychiatric care providers should function as key facilitators of an integrated mental and physical health management approach. In addition to psychoeducation and healthy lifestyle counseling, clinicians can improve psychiatric and physical health by selecting medications carefully, routinely screening and monitoring for reversible cardiovascular risk factors, and playing an active role in the prevention and interdisciplinary management of cardiovascular risk factors and medical illness in the vulnerable mentally ill."

            "abstract": "Current optical see-through displays in the field of augmented reality are limited in their ability to display colors with low lightness in the hue, saturation, lightness (HSL) color space, causing such colors to appear transparent. This hardware limitation may add unintended bias into scenarios with virtual humans. Humans have varying skin tones including HSL colors with low lightness. When virtual humans are displayed with optical see-through devices, people with low lightness skin tones may be displayed semi-transparently while those with high lightness skin tones will be displayed more opaquely. For example, a Black avatar may appear semi-transparent in the same scene as a White avatar who will appear more opaque. We present an exploratory user study ( N=160) investigating whether differing opacity levels result in dehumanizing avatar and human faces. Results support that dehumanization occurs as opacity decreases. This suggests that in similar lighting, low lightness skin tones (e.g., Black faces) will be viewed as less human than high lightness skin tones (e.g., White faces). Additionally, the perceived emotionality of virtual human faces also predicts perceived humanness. Angry faces were seen overall as less human, and at lower opacity levels happy faces were seen as more human. Our results suggest that additional research is needed to understand the effects and interactions of emotionality and opacity on dehumanization. Further, we provide evidence that unintentional racial bias may be added when developing for optical see-through devices using virtual humans. We highlight the potential bias and discuss implications and directions for future research."

Research shows that schizophrenic men and women are still interested in sexual relations but do not know how to bring their feelings into the open. They also may be resisting neuroleptic drugs because the medication causes varying sexual dysfunction.

Evidence suggests that interventions for people living with HIV infection that include, in combination, antiretroviral therapy (ART), peer support and economic empowerment are likely to be more effective than if used alone. We report a qualitative study in West Nile Uganda that explored perceptions of HIV stigma among fifty-four HIV-positive women who had similar access to ART and HIV peer support programmes, but varying levels of participation (full-time, intermittent, none) in economic empowerment programmes. Our study found that access to ART, peer support groups, and economic empowerment programmes helped to curb perceptions of deep-seated HIV stigma for participants. More expressions of usefulness, hope and psychological well-being prevailed with participants who had increased participation in economic empowerment programmes. Our findings underscore the value of HIV outreach programmes which combine ART, peer support and economic empowerment to alleviate HIV stigma. Further research to quantify the interaction of these factors is warranted."

            "abstract": "Hyperprolactinaemia is a frequent but often neglected side effect of typical, but also of many atypical antipsychotics such as amisulpiride, risperidone or ziprasidone. Besides galactorrhoea, potential consequences are suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis with hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, infertility and in women also irregularities of the menstrual cycle and amenorrhoea. Potential long term consequences are mainly osteopenia and osteoporosis with an enhanced risk of fractures. Hyperprolactinaemia, if not clearly caused by a prolactin inducing antipsychotic, should always be thoroughly investigated. Ideally, prolactin should be measured before starting a patient on a new antipsychotic. Furthermore, before neuroleptic treatment is begun, and also in regular intervals after that, patients should be asked about potential clinical signs of hyperprolactinaemia. Hyperprolactinaemia which is clearly due to antipsychotics but without clinical symptoms only requires regular controls of bone mineral density. However, if clinical symptoms occur, switching to a prolactin sparing antipsychotic may be necessary. In these cases fertility is often regained and the women concerned have to be informed about the enhanced risk of pregnancy and counselled regarding contraception. If switching is not possible, estradiol has to be substituted in women. Also in men with hypogonadism hormonesubstitution (with testosterone) is usually indicated. Generally hyperprolactinaemia in psychiatric patients should be taken more seriously in the future."

            "abstract": "Low adherence remains a struggle in hypertension management, despite improvement efforts. Presuming that increased patient participation is a possible approach, we collaborated with patients and healthcare professionals to design a self-report system to support self-management. The study aimed to explore and describe relevant aspects of hypertension and hypertension treatment, for use in the development of an interactive mobile phone self-report system. It further aimed to suggest which clinical measures, lifestyle measures, symptoms and side-effects of treatment would be meaningful to include in such a system. Five focus group interviews were performed with 15 patients and 12 healthcare professionals, and data was analysed using thematic analysis. Patients suggested trust, a good relationship with caregivers, and well-being as important aspects of hypertension self-management. Furthermore, they regarded blood pressure, dizziness, stress, headache and tiredness as important outcomes to include. Patients sought to understand interconnections between symptoms and variations in blood pressure, whilst healthcare professionals doubted patients' ability to do so. Healthcare professionals emphasized accessibility, clear and consistent counselling, complication prevention and educational efforts. The study presents aspects of importance for follow-up to understand the interplay between blood pressure and daily life experiences for patients with hypertension."

A single-group pretest and posttest design was used to measure outcomes. Twenty-one patients participated in the study as voluntary subjects, all of whom completed two sessions of Buddhist counseling interventions. The individual Buddhist counseling program was developed by the investigators based on the Buddhist doctrine. The outcomes were evaluated with the use of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data were analyzed using the Friedman test, which provides an indicator for evidence-based outcomes related to anxiety reduction scores. The results revealed that the scores on the state anxiety test in relation to the trait anxiety test had been reduced at the 1-month follow-up. The findings from content analysis showed that when the patients practiced mindfulness, they were able to accept unpleasant situations calmly. Sixteen patients were prescribed lower doses of antianxiety medications. Furthermore, medication was discontinued for two patients, and three other patients continued their prescribed medication regimen completely. The study indicates that counseling as a basis from Buddhist principles has the potential to benefit patients with emotional anxiety-based problems."

The authors assert that many roles and duties traditionally attributed to clinicians can and often should be performed not only by mental health professionals, but by line staff such as correctional officers and nurses. Moreover, the optimal climate for effective treatment is one in which mental health professionals and line staff work collaboratively, especially since line staff alone are in contact with inmates 24 hours per day. The specific activities which comprise mental health treatment in prison are described as: 1) counseling and psychotherapy-talking with inmates, 2) consultation-talking about inmates, 3) special housing, activities, and behavioral programs, and 4) medication. Case examples demonstrate how correctional officers, nurses, and other line staff perform each of these activities. Recognition and nurturance of these activities will improve the quality of services and reduce stress on staff and inmates alike. Consultation with line staff, joint training, and use of multi-disciplinary treatment teams are advocated as methods of reaching these goals."

Gamma-band ASSRs may indicate GABAergic interneuron dysfunction. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether abnormal gamma-band ASSRs are present before the onset of psychosis. Subjects were 15 ultra-high-risk (UHR) individuals, 13 FES patients, and 21 healthy control (HC) subjects. We performed electroencephalogram recordings and measured ASSRs in each group as they were presented with click trains at 20, 30, and 40 Hz. We then conducted time-frequency analyses and calculated intertrial phase coherence and event-related spectral perturbation. The time course of gamma-band ASSRs showed significantly different features among groups. Compared with the HC group, the UHR group was characterized by intact early-latency (0-100 ms) and reduced late-latency (300-500 ms) ASSRs. In contrast, both early- and late-latency ASSRs were significantly reduced in the FES group. Gamma-band ASSRs were correlated with clinical symptoms and attentional functioning in FES (|rs| > 0.70). These results suggest differential alterations of gamma-band ASSRs between UHR and FES groups. The late-latency ASSR alteration may represent a biomarker for early detection of psychosis, while the early-latency ASSR abnormality may develop through the onset of psychosis."

Given the shortage of and uneven distribution of psychiatrists who have completed specialized fellowships in child and adolescent psychiatry, a significant number of depressed youth will receive their pharmacotherapy from general psychiatrists and other prescribers with varying degrees of interest, training, and even willingness to treat children and adolescents. For general psychiatrists who will prescribe antidepressants for minors, knowledge of the training and expertise of nonphysician mental health professionals, the psychotherapies they may employ, and familiarity with school services are essential. Physicians who typically work only with adults will also need familiarity with differing ethical, legal, and regulatory issues and standards applicable to pediatric psychopharmacology.

We applied an explorative thematic analysis of data collected via video recordings of the workshops. The results of the analyses revealed that visual identity, communication style and personality was important for acceptability. Users favored a more human like agent that primarily communicated with the team via text messages. Users disliked emoticons and humor because these features clashed with the seriousness of the topic. Finally, users highlighted that Susa helped structure organizational change processes, develop concrete action plans, and stay on track.

            "abstract": "The recent explosion in neuroscience research has markedly increased our understanding of the neurobiological correlates of many psychiatric illnesses, but this has unfortunately not translated into more effective pharmacologic treatments for these conditions. At the same time, researchers have increasingly sought out biological markers, or biomarkers, as a way to categorize psychiatric illness, as these are felt to be closer to underlying genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities. While biomarker-based drug discovery approaches have tended to employ in vivo (e.g., rodent) or in vitro test systems, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of computational, or in silico, methodologies. Here we describe such a methodology, using as an example a biophysically detailed computational model of hippocampus that is made to generate putative schizophrenia biomarkers by the inclusion of a number of neuropathological changes that have been associated with the illness (NMDA system deficit, decreased neural connectivity, hyperdopaminergia). We use the specific inability to attune to gamma band (40 Hz) auditory stimulus as our illness biomarker. We expose this system to a large number of virtual medications, defined by systematic variation of model parameters corresponding to five cellular-level effects. The potential efficacy of virtual medications is determined by a wellness metric (WM) that we have developed. We identify a number of virtual agents that consist of combinations of mechanisms, which are not simply reversals of the causative lesions. The manner in which this methodology could be extended to other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, and fragile X syndrome, is discussed."

On the other hand, it has been shown that particularly atypical antipsychotic agents are differentially responsible for high rates of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes. Therefore, a standardized evaluation of corresponding parameters is indicated in every patient. If needed, modulation of the medication regimen has to be performed. Additionally, a dietary counselling of the patient and his family should be offered. Besides pharmacological approaches to normalize dyslipidemia, specific behavioural therapy programmes are an option that may alter metabolic parameters. Threatening cardiac complications in long-term treatment of schizophrenia may also be the result of direct side effects under treatment with antipsychotics, like QT-prolongation triggering major arrhythmias. For prevention, predisposing risk factors like electrolyte disturbances, pre-existing cardiac diseases, co-medication with QT prolonging drugs and medication with potential cytochrome P450 interaction have to be taken into consideration."

Although a comprehensive understanding of the adverse effect of BPA on behaviors and physiology have been proven, the potential impact of low-dose BPA on altering the basic ability of aquatic organism in adapting to the surrounded complex environment still remains elusive. In this research, we report that treatment of adult male zebrafish with chronic (7 weeks) low-dose (0.22 nM-2.2 nM) BPA, altered the ability in adapting the complex environment by disturbing the natural color preference patterns. In addition, chronic 50 ng/L (0.22 nM) BPA exposure alleviated the anxiety behavior of male zebrafish confronted with the novel environment by enhancing the preference towards light in the light/dark preference test. This phenotype was associated with less expression of serotonin (5-TH) in the hypothalamus and the down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in brain tissues. As such, our results show that low-dose BPA remnant in surface waters altered zebrafish behavior that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences.\n    \n\n\n          Highlights:\n        \n      \n      Here we reported that the impact of chronic low-dose BPA exposure on the basic capability of zebrafish to adapt to the environmental complexity.

These findings revealed the ecological effect of low-dose BPA and regular BPA concentration standard are not necessarily safe.

            "abstract": "Therapy for public speaking phobia using virtual reality exposure (VRE) has focused on distress arousal rather than distress habituation. Understanding habituation will help optimise session duration, making treatment more affordable and accessible. This pilot study utilised within-speech repeated measures to examine distress habituation during three brief public speaking scenarios in a non-clinical sample (n = 19; 18-76 years). VRE elicited significant distress in all three scenarios. Although within-scenario distress habituation was not observed, between-scenario habituation was partially supported. An increase in distress during the second scenario indicated that three consecutive speech performances were critical in achieving habituation. Brief repeated VRE scenarios using an agent audience were effective in eliciting public speaking distress, as well as habituation."

            "abstract": "Recent research revealed that emotional content can be successfully decoded from human dance movement. Most previous studies made use of videos of actors or dancers portraying emotions through choreography. The current study applies emotion induction techniques and free movement in order to examine the recognition of emotional content from dance. Observers (N = 30) watched a set of silent videos showing depersonalized avatars of dancers moving to an emotionally neutral musical stimulus after emotions of either sadness or happiness had been induced. Each of the video clips consisted of two dance performances which were presented side-by-side and were played simultaneously; one of a dancer in the happy condition and one of the same individual in the sad condition. After every film clip, the observers were asked to make forced-choices concerning the emotional state of the dancer. Results revealed that observers were able to identify the emotional state of the dancers with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, emotions were more often recognized for female dancers than for their male counterparts. In addition, the results of eye tracking measurements unveiled that observers primarily focus on movements of the chest when decoding emotional information from dance movement. The findings of our study show that not merely portrayed emotions, but also induced emotions can be successfully recognized from free dance movement."

Between February and September 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 34 PWLHIV within one month of receiving VITAL Start. The participants reported that VITAL Start was acceptable and feasible and had good fidelity of delivery. They also reported that the video had a positive impact on their lives, encouraging them to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners who, in turn, supported them to adhere to ART. The participants suggested using a similar intervention to provide health-related education/counseling to people with long term conditions. Our findings suggest that video-based interventions may be an acceptable, feasible approach to optimizing ART retention and adherence amongst PWLHIV, and they can be delivered with high fidelity.

            "abstract": "A limited number of studies have evaluated sexual functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Most patients show an interest in sex that differs little from the general population. By contrast, psychiatric symptoms, institutionalization, and psychotropic medication contribute to frequently occurring impairments in sexual functioning. Women with schizophrenia have a better social outcome, longer lasting (sexual) relationships, and more offspring than men with schizophrenia. Still, in both sexes social and interpersonal impairments limit the development of stable sexual relationships. Although patients consider sexual problems to be highly relevant, patients and clinicians not easily discuss these spontaneously, leading to an underestimation of their prevalence and contributing to decreased adherence to treatment. Studies using structured interviews or questionnaires result in many more patients reporting sexual dysfunctions. Although sexual functioning can be impaired by different factors, the use of antipsychotic medication seems to be an important factor. A comparison of different antipsychotics showed high frequencies of sexual dysfunction for risperidone and classical antipsychotics, and lower frequencies for clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Postsynaptic dopamine antagonism, prolactin elevation, and α1-receptor blockade may be the most relevant factors in the pathogenesis of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction. Psychosocial strategies to treat antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction include psychoeducation and relationship counseling. Pharmacological strategies include lowering the dose or switching to a prolactin sparing antipsychotic. Also, the addition of a dopamine agonist, aripiprazole, or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor has shown some promising results, but evidence is currently scarce."

Therefore, the relationship between cortical activity measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task, and GMV in the Broca's area assessed using a manual tracing in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which considers individual structural variation, was examined for 57 subjects (23 UHR/18 FES/16 controls).

Previous studies have focused on stimuli taken from everyday life. Here, we investigated event-related potentials in response to happy vs neutral stimuli of human and non-humanoid robots. At the behavioural level, emotion shortened reaction times similarly for robotic and human stimuli. Early P1 wave was enhanced in response to happy compared to neutral expressions for robotic as well as for human stimuli, suggesting that emotion from robots is encoded as early as human emotion expression. Congruent with their lower faceness properties compared to human stimuli, robots elicited a later and lower N170 component than human stimuli.

Taken together, such results suggest that the early brain processing of emotional expressions is not bounded to human-like arrangements embodying emotion."

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer ranks second among male cancers in the United States in terms of death rate. Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) is now offered as the standard surgical procedure performed for radical prostatectomy. Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction were common complications after RAS prostatectomy. Patients felt ill-prepared after surgery, resulting in negative impacts on their quality of life. Pelvic floor muscle exercise is prioritized for patients with mild-to-moderate incontinence. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using resistance band pelvic floor muscle exercise for patients after RAS prostatectomy. A preexperimental single-group study was conducted for this study. A total of 43 patients completed the program. Urinary incontinence scale, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were assessed at 0.5 months, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after urinary catheter removal. The results revealed that urinary incontinence, life impact, and depression and anxiety improved significantly as time went on. This study suggests that using simple and easy-to-learn resistance band pelvic floor muscle exercise program at home can benefit patients financially and reduce travel time."

            "abstract": "According to embodied simulation theory, understanding other people's emotions is fostered by facial mimicry. However, studies assessing the effect of facial mimicry on the recognition of emotion are still controversial. In Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most distinctive clinical features is facial amimia, a reduction in facial expressiveness, but patients also show emotional disturbances. The present study used the pathological model of PD to examine the role of facial mimicry on emotion recognition by investigating EMG responses in PD patients during a facial emotion recognition task (anger, joy, neutral). Our results evidenced a significant decrease in facial mimicry for joy in PD, essentially linked to the absence of reaction of the zygomaticus major and the orbicularis oculi muscles in response to happy avatars, whereas facial mimicry for expressions of anger was relatively preserved. We also confirmed that PD patients were less accurate in recognizing positive and neutral facial expressions and highlighted a beneficial effect of facial mimicry on the recognition of emotion. We thus provide additional arguments for embodied simulation theory suggesting that facial mimicry is a potential lever for therapeutic actions in PD even if it seems not to be necessarily required in recognizing emotion as such."

This systematic review aims to provide an examination of the acceptability and feasibility of technology-based mental health interventions provided to stroke patients and evaluate any barriers to their adoption. A total of 13 studies were included investigating interventions targeting non-specific mental health, depression or anxiety. The delivery technologies were: video conferencing, computer programmes, telephones, DVDs, CDs, robot-assisted devices, and personal digital assistants. Rates of refusal to participate were low (7.9-25%). Where satisfaction was reported, this was generally high. Many studies achieved high levels of adherence (up to 89.6%). This was lower for some technologies (e.g., robotic assistive devices). Where dropout occurred, this was for reasons including a decline in health as well as technical difficulties.

Our theoretical model views these delusions as unfounded threat beliefs which persist due to defence behaviours (e.g. avoidance) that prevent disconfirmatory evidence being processed. The treatment implications are that patients need to (1) go into feared situations and (2) not use defence behaviours. This enables relearning of safety and hence paranoia diminution. However, this is very difficult for patients due to their severe anxiety. A solution is to use virtual reality (VR) social situations, which are graded in difficulty and which patients find much easier to enter. We have now automated the provision of cognitive therapy within VR using an avatar coach, so that a therapist is not required and the treatment is scalable.

            "abstract": "Health behaviors such as retention in HIV medical care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) pose major challenges to reducing new HIV infections, addressing health disparities, and improving health outcomes. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use provides a conceptual framework for understanding how patient and environmental factors affect health behaviors and outcomes, which can inform the design of intervention strategies. Factors affecting retention and adherence among persons with HIV include patient predisposing factors (e.g., mental illness, substance abuse), patient-enabling factors (e.g., social support, reminder strategies, medication characteristics, transportation, housing, insurance), and healthcare environment factors (e.g., pharmacy services, clinic experiences, provider characteristics). Evidence-based recommendations for improving retention and adherence include (1) systematic monitoring of clinic attendance and ART adherence; (2) use of peer or paraprofessional navigators to re-engage patients in care and help them remain in care; (3) optimization of ART regimens and pharmaceutical supply chain management systems; (4) provision of reminder devices and tools; (5) general education and counseling; (6) engagement of peer, family, and community support groups; (7) case management; and (8) targeting patients with substance abuse and mental illness. Further research is needed on effective monitoring strategies and interventions that focus on improving retention and adherence, with specific attention to the healthcare environment."

Against a backdrop of punitive government policies, including mandatory detention of IDUs and sex workers, and widespread stigma and discrimination, many PLWHA lived with the fear of discovery and the threat of abandonment.

However, in the absence of affordable, quality care and access to anti-retroviral therapy, IDUs are unlikely to see testing as worthwhile. Efforts to scale up also need to address structural barriers including stigma and discrimination, poverty and institutional capacity. Finally, PLWHA in Vietnam are a significant but underutilised resource and consideration should be given to overcoming barriers to building confidence and capacity within affected communities."

These data were collected using a semi structured guide and were analysed using an inductive approach. Several themes describing family influence on AYAs' PrEP use emerged including family support; family attitude towards PrEP; and the family's ability to obviate PrEP disclosure challenges. In addition, dimensions of family closeness, categorized as 'close', 'in-between' and 'loose-knit,' appeared important in contextualizing family influence on AYAs' PrEP use. We found that family remains a proximal and fundamental social system in which AYA are socialized and greater family engagement could aid PrEP implementation in this priority population."

Volunteers who were conscious, mentally healthy, without primary sleep disorders, without chronic uncontrolled diseases, 18 years of age or older, able to understand verbal warnings, and who agreed to participate in the study after being informed about the purpose of the study were included in the study. A total of 80 patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKR and 87 patients who underwent manual TKR were participated in the study. Data were collected using the \"Patient Description Form\" Visual Analog Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale, and State Anxiety Scale. All patients were operated on by the same physicians and received standard perioperative care. In the study, a statistically significant difference was found between the education level of the patients and the type of surgery (p = 0.007). According to the average scores, it was observed that the patients in the robotic group had higher pain levels, better sleep quality, and higher anxiety levels compared to the manual group. There was a significant correlation between the level of pain felt on the 1st and 2nd day (p = < 0.001) and state anxiety levels with gender (p = 0.010) in the robotic group. For the robotic group, pain on day 2 was mostly affected by pain on day 1 and state anxiety. For the manual group, pain on day 2 was mostly affected by pain on day 1. According to our results, patients who underwent robotic-assisted TKR had higher pain levels, better sleep quality, and higher anxiety levels than patients who underwent manual TKR."

Such spontaneous perspective taking processes are not yet explored in SZ. In the current fMRI experiment, 24 healthy and 24 schizophrenic participants performed a visual perspective taking task in the scanner. Either a social or a non-social stimulus was presented and their visual perspectives were consistent or inconsistent with the self-perspective of the participant. We replicated previous findings showing that healthy participants show increased reaction times when the human avatar's perspective is inconsistent to the self-perspective. Patients with SZ, however, did not show this effect, neither in the social nor in the non-social condition.

Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

The metaverse, a term formed by combining meta and universe, could open a new era in mental health, mainly in psychological disorders, where the creation of a full-body illusion via digital avatar could promote healthcare and personal well-being. Patients affected by body dysmorphism symptoms (i.e., eating disorders), social deficits (i.e. autism) could greatly benefit from this kind of technology. However, it is not clear which advantage the metaverse would have in treating psychological disorders with respect to the well-known and effective virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy. Indeed, in the last twenty years, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of VR technology in reducing symptoms of pain, anxiety, stress, as well as, in improving cognitive and social skills. We hypothesize that the metaverse will offer more opportunities, such as a more complex, virtual realm where sensory inputs, and recurrent feedback, mediated by a \"federation\" of multiple technologies - e.g., artificial intelligence, tangible interfaces, Internet of Things and blockchain, can be reinterpreted for facilitating a new kind of communication overcoming self-body representation. However, nowadays a clear starting point does not exist. For this reason, it is worth defining a theoretical framework for applying this new kind of technology in a social neuroscience context for developing accurate solutions to mental health in the future."

Anorexia/cachexia syndrome is characterized by lipolysis and the loss of lean body mass, and is not reversible by increasing caloric intake.

Cancer patients require routine screening for cachexia and, ideally, interventions should be initiated in the early stages of weight loss. No guidelines exist for the treatment of cancer cachexia. Appetite stimulants, such as megestrol acetate and glucocorticoids, have been shown to increase appetite and weight; however, single pharmaceutical interventions alone for cachexia do not result in meaningful functional outcomes. In the future, clinicians should consider multimodality treatment that is personalized for each patient. These interventions would include nutritional counseling, assessing and treating symptoms that have an impact on caloric intake, and a rational combination of pharmacologic approaches directed at underlying pathophysiology. Use of an appetite stimulant could be considered for patients who exhibit decreased appetite. Treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent should be considered for patients with elevated C-reactive protein, and hormonal alterations resulting from anti-cachexia therapy should be thoughtfully addressed."

Additional challenges include psychiatric comorbidities and adverse events related to medication that can lead to secondary negative and cognitive symptoms and nonadherence, all of which can worsen outcomes. Treatment modalities that target cognition and functional rehabilitation without introducing tolerability issues are needed. In general, pharmacologic interventions should be combined with evidence-based nonpharmacologic treatments, and patient-reported outcomes as well as measurement-based care should be employed, ideally in a coordinated specialty care framework.

However, olanzapine is marred by an equally substantial literature demonstrating a metabolic burden of olanzapine, particularly for weight gain. With the publication of successful strategies to limit olanzapine induced weight gain, a reassessment of the clinical utility of olanzapine appears warranted. The purpose of this paper is to review recent evidence for olanzapine, highlighting use in both schizophrenia and other conditions, safety and supporting the use of olanzapine above 20 mg/day, focusing on studies published since our previous reviews in 2008 and 2009.Data Sources: The US National Library of Medicine's PubMed resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) was searched using the text word 'olanzapine' for all English-language articles published between 2008 to July 2019, inclusive with a specific focus on double-blind randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. In addition, we examined the review articles for other reports of interest that may have been missed by our initial search.Data Extraction: The studies were evaluated based on efficacy and safety data.Results: Use of olanzapine may be decreasing but remains common overall. Evidence continues to support both the relative efficacy advantage and weight gain/metabolic disadvantages of olanzapine in schizophrenia, and recent research supports olanzapine's use in treating anorexia nervosa and chemotherapy-induced nausea. The evidence for high dose olanzapine dosages >20 mg remains limited. Non-pharmacological options, such as dietary counseling and exercise, appear to be efficacious in addressing antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Topiramate, metformin and possibly the olanzapine-samidorphan combination also appear helpful.Conclusions: Olanzapine remains a useful antipsychotic, but requires with careful monitoring. Further research is needed to compare the different options available to mitigate olanzapine-induced weight gain and to evaluate potential synergism between pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments."

Avoidance can be expressed behaviorally as well as cognitively. Most personality assessments for avoidance involve self-report inventories which are susceptible to biased responding. The avatar task (Myers et al., 2016a) was developed as an objective measure of behavioral inhibition (BI) which is defined as a tendency for avoidance of unfamiliar people and situations. The avatar task has been demonstrated to screen avoidant behaviors related to BI, PTSD, as well as harm avoidance (HA) as measured by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). In the current work, the avatar task was tested with cognitive as well as behavioral avoidance as measured by the cognitive-behavioral avoidance scale (CBAS; Ottenbreit & Dobson, 2004). The CBAS includes four subscales which measure behavioral social (BS) avoidance, behavioral non-social (BN) avoidance, cognitive social (CS) avoidance, and cognitive non-social (CN) avoidance. It was hypothesized that avatar scores would be significantly positively related to behavioral, but not cognitive, avoidance. In addition, it was also hypothesized that performance on the avatar task would be more related to social than non-social behavioral avoidance. Participants completed the avatar task, the HA scale of the TPQ and the CBAS. Pearson's product moment correlations revealed that avatar scores were significantly related to CBAS total scores as well as BS and BN scores, but not CS and CN scores. In addition, BS has a stronger relationship with avatar scores than BN avoidance which fits with the social aspects of the scenarios in the avatar task. A median split of the avatar scores produced a significant difference in scores on the behavioral but not the cognitive subscales. Overall, the current results supported the idea that the avatar task is measuring behavioral avoidance, specifically in social situations, rather than cognitive avoidance. Future work could adapt the avatar task to include scenarios similar to the cognitive items on the CBAS to create an objective measure of cognitive avoidance which may be relevant in measuring avoidance in depression and behavioral avoidance associated with PTSD as well as anxiety disorders."

Yet, the level of adherence to these behaviours varies considerably in many settings. As a way to achieve optimal adherence in rural KwaZulu-Natal, caregivers are required to attend routine counselling sessions at HIV treatment clinics that are centred on imparting information, motivation, and behavioural skills related to medication administration. According to the information-motivation-behavioural skills model, information related to adherence, motivation, and behavioural skills are necessary and fundamental determinants of adherence to ART. The purpose of the study was to observe and document the content of adherence counselling sessions that caregivers attending rural clinics in KwaZulu Natal receive. We observed 25 adherence counselling sessions, which lasted on average 8.1 minutes. Counselling typically consisted of counsellors recording patient attendance, reporting CD4 count and viral load results to caregivers, emphasising dose times, and asking caregivers to name their medications and dosage amounts. Patients were seldom asked to demonstrate how they measure the medication. They were also not probed for problems regarding treatment, even when an unsuppressed VL was reported to a caregiver. This paper calls attention to the sub-optimal level of counselling provided to patients on ART and the urgent need to standardise and improve the training, support, and debriefing provided to counsellors."

Results: Demographic features were widely heterogeneous across studies (total N = 480, 58% male, mean age = 15.0 ± 1.8). Case reports/series presented positive therapeutic outcomes in noncompliant youths with severe mental illness. Three open-label one-arm studies supported the clinical efficacy of risperidone long-acting injection in patients previously stabilized with oral risperidone. One study showed lower clinical symptoms and higher functioning at 12 months in youths treated for an acute psychotic episode with paliperidone palmitate compared to oral risperidone. The types and rates of side effects of LLA were comparable to those observed for oral antipsychotics. Two studies suggested better metabolic and neurological tolerance of LLA compared to an oral form. Preliminary evidence supported a satisfactory level of treatment satisfaction in patients treated with LLA and their families, while concerns were raised regarding practical administration in outpatient services. However, the average quality of the evidence based on the RoB2 tool was low. Conclusions: The level of evidence was low for the efficacy of LLA in pediatric populations and very low for the tolerance and acceptance. It concerned mostly the effect of risperidone long-acting injection in adolescents with psychotic disorders. Randomized maintenance clinical trials using noninferiority analysis would be more appropriate for further research."

            "title": "Management of schizophrenia in children and adolescents: focus on pharmacotherapy.",
            "abstract": "Schizophrenia in subjects younger than 13 years is defined as very-early-onset schizophrenia, and its prevalence is estimated at 1 in 10 000, while early-onset schizophrenia occurs between 13 and 17 years, and its prevalence is about 0.5%. Only a minority of youths show a complete recovery, and the majority of patients present a moderate to severe impairment at the outset. Treatment of schizophrenia always needs both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. Nonpharmacological interventions include counselling for the patients and the family, psychological support, behavioural treatments, social and cognitive rehabilitation, assistance in social and scholastic activities, enhancement of social skills and family support. Pharmacological treatment is necessary for remission and control of positive and negative symptoms. Furthermore, proper pharmacotherapy can greatly increase the efficacy of psychosocial interventions. Available literature on pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents with schizophrenia is critically reviewed, including both first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Data on efficacy and safety are reported for all the marketed atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole), based on randomized, placebo-controlled studies and the most relevant open-label or naturalistic studies. Adverse effects of concern are closely analysed, such as extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, metabolic syndrome (including hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia), weight gain, hyperprolactinaemia, hepatotoxicity, seizures, and cardiovascular and haematological adverse effects. Finally, practical guidelines for the management of specific clinical situations are provided: the first phases and the long-term approach to pharmacotherapy, the treatment refractoriness and the use of clozapine in youths, the agitated adolescent and the treatment of negative symptoms and of affective co-morbidity. Current experience indicates that, based on low rates of remission, low effect size of medications and frequent adverse effects, mainly metabolic syndrome, further research is warranted, with both randomized, placebo-controlled studies and long-term, naturalistic follow-up of large samples of patients with different age ranges."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The success of internet-based mental health interventions in practice-that is, in the wild-depends on the uptake and retention of the application and the user's focused attention in the moment of use. Incorporating game-based motivational design into digital interventions delivered in the wild has been shown to increase uptake and retention in internet-based training; however, there are outstanding questions about the potential of game-based motivational strategies to increase engagement with a task in the moment of use and the effect on intervention efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Designers of internet-based interventions need to know whether game-based motivational design strategies can increase in-the-moment engagement and thus improve digital interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 motivational design strategy (avatar customization) in an example mental health intervention (computerized cognitive training for attention bias modification).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assigned 317 participants to either a customized avatar or an assigned avatar condition. After measuring state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), we randomly assigned half of the participants in each condition to either an attentional retraining condition (Attention Bias Modification Training) or a control condition. After training, participants were exposed to a negative mood induction using images with strong negative valance (International Affective Picture System), after which we measured state anxiety again.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Avatar customization decreased posttraining state anxiety when controlling for baseline state anxiety for those in the attentional retraining condition; however, those who did not train experienced decreased resilience to the negative mood induction (F1,252=6.86, P=.009, ηp2=.027). This interaction effect suggests that customization increased task engagement with the intervention in the moment of use. Avatar customization also increased avatar identification (F5,252=12.46, P<.001, R2=.23), regardless of condition (F1,252=.79, P=.38). Avatar identification reduced anxiety after the negative mood induction for participants who underwent training but increased poststimulus anxiety for participants who did not undergo training, further suggesting that customization increases engagement in the task (F1,252=6.19, P=.01). The beneficial effect of avatar customization on training was driven by participants who were low in their basic satisfaction of relatedness (F10,248=18.5, P<.001, R2=.43), which is important because these are the participants who are most likely in need of digital interventions for mental health.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results suggest that applying motivational design-specifically avatar customization-is a viable strategy to increase engagement and subsequently training efficacy in a computerized cognitive task."

            "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) presents itself in two forms: insulin-dependent (type 1 DM) and non-insulin-dependent (type 2 DM). Although type 2 DM usually has an adult onset, in recent years there has been a significant rise in the number of children diagnosed with type 2 DM in the United States. Reasons for this increased frequency are believed to be a larger percentage of children who are overweight, a family history of diabetes, and a considerable increase in the use of psychotropic medication in children. The diagnosis of DM is a significant stressor not only for patients but also for their environment. Children with DM are sometimes stigmatized by their peers and relatives who do not understand the illness or are frightened by it. Some children also may need to alter several of their customary routines and are often scared to participate in activities in which they were previously engaged. The family's response to the diagnosis of DM may have a negative effect on glycemic control. Differences have been found in the way patients with type 1 DM and type 2 DM cope with and adapt to their diagnosis."

The current study investigated the impact of menarche on the determinants of quality of life in healthy female adolescents. Data were collected from 361 healthy female adolescents divided into two groups: pre- and post-menarcheal event. Participants, according the AVATAR project, completed Italian version of KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaires on health-related quality of life. Pre-menarcheal females had the higher score in psychological well-being and mood than post-menarcheal females. As concerns self-perception, post-menarcheal females exhibited lower score compared to pre-menarcheal females. In social context, pre-menarcheal females perceived a better school environment, also when we considered it in terms of social acceptance.Conclusion: Menarche event affects all the components of quality of life, from mood, self-esteem to social relationships, underlining how this hormonal variation is responsible of psychological and emotional changes, opening up the opportunity for preventive approaches aimed not only at traditional risk factors but according a more integrated perspective.What is Known:• Adolescence is a time of increasing behavioural divergence between males and females, probably due to the different hormonal development.• There is a possible link between menarche and the health-related quality of life variables.What is New:• Menarche condition affects all the components of quality of life, from mood to social relationships.• Post-menarcheal condition is associated to psychosocial and emotional changes, with possible multiple pathways to post-pubertal depressive symptoms."

            "abstract": "Previous research involving healthy participants has reported that seeing a moving virtual body from the first person perspective induces the illusion of ownership and agency over that virtual body. When a person is sitting and the virtual body runs, it is possible to measure physiological, behavioral and cognitive reactions that are comparable to those that occur during actual movement. Capitalizing on this evidence, we hypothesized that virtual training could also induce neuroendocrine effects that prompt a decreased psychosocial stress response, as occurs after physical training. While sitting, 26 healthy young adults watched a virtual avatar running for 30 min from the first person perspective (experimental group), while another 26 participants watched the virtual body from the third person perspective (control group). We found a decreased salivary alpha-amylase concentration (a biomarker for the stress response) after the virtual training among the experimental group only, as well as a decreased subjective feeling of state anxiety (but no difference in heart rate). We argue that the virtual illusion of a moving body from the first person perspective can initiate a cascade of events, from the perception of the visual illusion to physiological activation that triggers other biological effects, such as the neuroendocrine stress response."

Studies also show that, even when people know they are dealing with robots, they often treat the robot as though it is a real pet with genuine emotions. This disconnect between beliefs and behavior occurs not just for people living with dementia, but with cognitively healthy adults, including those who are knowledgeable about how robots work. One possible explanation is that robot pets prompt contradictory beliefs, and so the use of robot pets encourages self-deception. Sparrow argues that this makes the use of robot pets in dementia care morally objectionable. We disagree. We argue that Gendler's concept of alief offers a better explanation of the belief-behavior disconnect observed when people interact with robot pets. An alief is a mental state composed of an automatic, arational, emotional, and behavioral response to representational input. Aliefs are not beliefs and are not subject to truth norms. Thus, on our view, harms associated with the use of robot pets in dementia care are not likely to include the self-deceptions that Sparrow suggests. It might seem like philosophical hair-splitting to claim that deception has not occurred because discordant aliefs rather than false beliefs have been formed, but this distinction matters. We argue that aliefs carry their own risks. These risks are important to consider when using robot pets in dementia care."

            "abstract": "Fever in a child is one of the most common clinical symptoms managed by pediatricians and other health care providers and a frequent cause of parental concern. Many parents administer antipyretics even when there is minimal or no fever, because they are concerned that the child must maintain a \"normal\" temperature. Fever, however, is not the primary illness but is a physiologic mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. There is no evidence that fever itself worsens the course of an illness or that it causes long-term neurologic complications. Thus, the primary goal of treating the febrile child should be to improve the child's overall comfort rather than focus on the normalization of body temperature. When counseling the parents or caregivers of a febrile child, the general well-being of the child, the importance of monitoring activity, observing for signs of serious illness, encouraging appropriate fluid intake, and the safe storage of antipyretics should be emphasized. Current evidence suggests that there is no substantial difference in the safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in the care of a generally healthy child with fever. There is evidence that combining these 2 products is more effective than the use of a single agent alone; however, there are concerns that combined treatment may be more complicated and contribute to the unsafe use of these drugs. Pediatricians should also promote patient safety by advocating for simplified formulations, dosing instructions, and dosing devices."

To build the descriptive model, 1324 potential patients were asked a series of questions about demographics, attitudes, opinions, and personalities. Results indicate that perceived value, familiarity, wariness of new technologies, fear of surgery, openness, anger, fear, and happiness are all significant predictors of willingness to undergo RS. A regression equation was developed and then used to predict scores in a second study with 1335 potential patients. The scores from both studies were compared for model fit. Several methods were used to validate the regression model, including correlational analyses, a t test, and calculation of the cross-validity coefficient. All three stringent tests showed strong model fit, explaining 62% of the variance in the model.

In this qualitative study, a purposive sample of 14 nurses participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Five key themes emerged: (1) physical and psychological distress of nurses, (2) willingness to work, (3) the essential role of support mechanisms, (4) educational and informational needs of nurses and (5) the role of modern technology in COVID-19 care. Although the provision of care led to physical and psychological distress among nurses, with their commitment and professional obligation, it is a new experience that leads to personal satisfaction. Guilty feeling related to inefficiency of care, witnessing the suffering of patients, discomfort associated with wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), work-related issues (e.g., long hour shifts), negative impact to the family and rejection by others are the leading distress factors. Religious beliefs, including keeping trust in good and bad merits, have become a strong coping mechanism. Addressing distress among nurses is essential. The reported learning needs of nurses included skills related to donning and doffing PPE, skills in performing nursing procedures and breaking bad news. Nurse managers need to pay special attention to expanding training opportunities as well as support mechanisms, for example, welfare, appreciations and counselling services for nurses. Modern technology, particularly robots and telecommunication, can perform an essential role in COVID-19 care. The establishment of timely policies and strategies to protect health workers during a national disaster like COVID-19 is needed."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Brain health is neglected in public health, receiving attention after something goes wrong. Neuroplasticity research illustrates that preventive steps strengthen the brain's component systems; however, this information is not widely known. Actionable steps are needed to scale proven population-level interventions. Objectives: This pilot tested two main objectives: (1) the feasibility/ease of use of an online platform to measure brain health, deliver training, and offer virtual coaching to healthy adults and (2) to develop a data driven index of brain health. Methods: 180 participants, ages 18-87, enrolled in this 12-week pilot. Participants took a BrainHealth Index™ (BHI), a composite of assessments encompassing cognition, well-being, daily-life and social, pre-post training. Participants engaged in online training with three coaching sessions. We assessed changes in BHI, effects of training utilization and demographics, contributions of sub-domain measures to the BHI and development of a factor analytic structure of latent BrainHealth constructs. Results: The results indicated that 75% of participants showed at least a 5-point gain on their BHI which did not depend on age, education, or gender. The contribution to these gains were from all sub-domains, including stress, anxiety and resilience, even though training focused largely on cognition. Some individuals improved due to increased resilience and decreased anxiety, whereas others improved due to increased innovation and social engagement. Larger gains depended on module utilization, especially strategy training. An exploratory factor analytic solution to the correlation matrix of online assessments identified three latent constructs. Discussion/Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of an online platform to assess changes on a composite BrainHealth Index and efficacy in delivering training modules and coaching. We found that adults, college age to late life, were motivated to learn about their brain and engage in virtual-training with coaching to improve their brain health. This effort intends to scale up to thousands, thus the pilot data, tested by an impending imaging pilot, will be utilized in ongoing machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a precision brain health model. This pilot is a first step in scaling evidence-based brain health protocols to reach individuals and positively affect public health globally."

In all, 154 women with early pregnancy failure confirmed at ultrasonography who had been managed expectantly unsuccessfully for > or =1 week were randomly assigned to undergo either treatment with misoprostol (n=79) or curettage (n=75). The main outcome measures were health-related quality of life and satisfaction with treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the misoprostol strategy 47% of the women needed additional curettage, as compared to 4% after curettage. In both groups, health-related quality of life was impaired most severely 2 days after treatment. In the misoprostol group, health-related quality of life was more severely impaired; after 2 days this was due to more pain and after 2 and 6 weeks this was due to a worse general health perception. Health-related quality of life was temporarily significantly more impaired in women in whom misoprostol failed as compared to women in whom misoprostol treatment was successful. In both treatment groups, an equal percentage of women (58%) would choose the same treatment in the future. In women treated with misoprostol, however, this choice depended on the initial success of misoprostol: in cases where misoprostol had caused complete evacuation, 76% of the women would opt for the same treatment, whereas only 38% of women who needed curettage after unsuccessful misoprostol would do so (P<0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study shows that, although both the misoprostol strategy and the curettage strategy resulted in complete evacuation in the end, women are willing to accept some disadvantages of misoprostol to avoid curettage. A treatment inconvenience using misoprostol is accepted as long as initial evacuation rate is high. This finding should be an integral part of counselling women when deciding upon management of early pregnancy failure."

Their reluctance may be shaped by cultural beliefs and stigma about mental health. The present study examined how beliefs and stigma about depression (e.g. disbelief in depression as a health-related condition, perception of depression as a normal part of aging, and/or depression as a sign of personal weakness/family shame) pose barriers to older Korean Americans' willingness to use mental health counseling and antidepressants.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Data were drawn from surveys with 420 Korean American older adults (Mage= 71.6, SD = 7.6) living in the New York City metropolitan area in 2010.

Based on Andersen's behavioral health service use model, the analysis was conducted in consideration of predisposing characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education, and acculturation), mental health needs (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and self-rated mental health), and enabling/hindering factors (beliefs and stigma).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Similar proportions of the sample (69-70%) indicated their willingness to use mental health counseling or antidepressants.

The patient was admitted and monitored. No adverse effects were observed. A review of the literature showed very few reported azathioprine overdoses. Lupus patients are at risk of developing low mood and depression (and related self-harm including overdose of medication). This can be as a consequence of the disease process itself or in reaction to the stresses of living with a chronic disease, which are perhaps particularly acute in some adolescents with the disease. An intentional overdose in a patient with lupus is clearly a cry for help and should be appropriately managed. Counselling of young people and their parents about possible mood disorders is an important part of the management of this chronic disease. Despite the theoretical risk of significant myelosuppression as well as other potential adverse effects, azathioprine in acute overdose seems to be generally well tolerated."

The current study sought to examine if key within-person factors (i.e., implementation intentions, social support, affect and self-efficacy) would be associated with walking and if perceived access to supportive environments (e.g., access to nice walking paths) and perceived environmental barriers (e.g., bad weather and safety issues) were uniquely associated with walking after controlling for other constructs. Participants (N = 14, 50.0% men, 78.6% White, M age = 59.4 ± 6.4) were in the intervention arm of an 8-week controlled trial promoting walking via personal digital assistants. Participants completed electronic surveys twice a day (total entries = 804) in which they reported brisk walking levels and psychosocial and environmental factors. Multilevel modelling was used to examine within-person variations in constructs as determinants of walking. Results suggested that daily variations in implementation intentions, social support and positive affect were positively associated with walking. Further, perceived access to supportive environments, though not perceived environmental barriers, was positively associated with walking after controlling for other constructs (p < 0.05). Future research should explore intervention components that target context-specific information about perceived access to supportive environments as part of a broader perspective on intervention development."

This is now a global industry that covers the preferential activity of adolescents. But for some, the practice goes beyond a game and becomes an addictive functioning. Clinical practice is then faced with a new problem. It is important to understand the special bond that develops between a player and his/her video game in order to understand the addictive process.\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      The game consists of a virtual world, a graphical construction that is a simulation of reality and which reinvents the laws that govern it. It also consists of a character embodied by the player who controls it: the avatar. Through the virtual world and avatar, the game offers the player a virtual personification that matches his/her expectations and projected ideal.

Moreover, adolescents addicted perceive their lives as less satisfying than others'. Hence, virtual life is perceived as more satisfying than real life among teenagers addicted to video games. Finally, this virtual experience is thus one of the factors that explain the addiction to video games. Through the game, the teenager can \"live\" a new version of him/herself, becoming secondarily alienating. The virtual world supplants real life and becomes the source of a clash of identity."

            "abstract": "Several studies have found a delay in the development of facial emotion recognition and expression in children with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). Several interventions have been designed to help children to fill this gap. Most of them adopt technological devices (i.e., robots, computers, and avatars) as social mediators and reported evidence of improvement. Few interventions have aimed at promoting emotion recognition and expression abilities and, among these, most have focused on emotion recognition. Moreover, a crucial point is the generalization of the ability acquired during treatment to naturalistic interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two technological-based interventions focused on the expression of basic emotions comparing a robot-based type of training with a \"hybrid\" computer-based one. Furthermore, we explored the engagement of the hybrid technological device introduced in the study as an intermediate step to facilitate the generalization of the acquired competencies in naturalistic settings. A two-group pre-post-test design was applied to a sample of 12 children (M = 9.33; ds = 2.19) with autism. The children were included in one of the two groups: group 1 received a robot-based type of training (n = 6); and group 2 received a computer-based type of training (n = 6). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations (i.e., time) of facial expression and production of four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) were performed. Non-parametric ANOVAs found significant time effects between pre- and post-interventions on the ability to recognize sadness [t (1) = 7.35, p = 0.006; pre: M (ds) = 4.58 (0.51); post: M (ds) = 5], and to express happiness [t (1) = 5.72, p = 0.016; pre: M (ds) = 3.25 (1.81); post: M (ds) = 4.25 (1.76)], and sadness [t (1) = 10.89, p < 0; pre: M (ds) = 1.5 (1.32); post: M (ds) = 3.42 (1.78)]. The group*time interactions were significant for fear [t (1) = 1.019, p = 0.03] and anger expression [t (1) = 1.039, p = 0.03]. However, Mann-Whitney comparisons did not show significant differences between robot-based and computer-based training. Finally, no difference was found in the levels of engagement comparing the two groups in terms of the number of voice prompts given during interventions. Albeit the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, this study suggests that two types of technology-based training, one mediated via a humanoid robot and the other via a pre-settled video of a peer, perform similarly in promoting facial recognition and expression of basic emotions in children with an ASC. The findings represent the first step to generalize the abilities acquired in a laboratory-trained situation to naturalistic interactions."

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to test the potential efficacy of topiramate plus motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for treating cannabis use among adolescents. Sixty-six heavy cannabis users, ages 15 to 24 years, were randomized to one of two 6-week treatment conditions: topiramate plus MET or placebo plus MET. Topiramate was titrated over 4 weeks then stabilized at 200 mg/day for 2 weeks. MET was delivered biweekly for a total of three sessions. Only 48 percent of youths randomized to topiramate completed the 6-week trial (n = 19), compared with 77 percent of youths in the placebo condition (n = 20). Adverse medication side effects were the most common reason for withdrawal among participants in the topiramate group. Latent growth models showed that topiramate was superior to placebo for reducing the number of grams smoked per use day, but it did not improve abstinence rates. The same pattern of results was found when values for missing outcomes were imputed. We show that topiramate combined with MET demonstrated efficacy for reducing how much cannabis adolescents smoked when they used but did not affect abstinence rates. The magnitude of this effect was modest, however, and topiramate was poorly tolerated by youths, which calls into question the clinical importance of these findings."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Problems in social functioning (e.g., unemployment, social isolation), are common in people with a psychotic disorder. Social cognition is a treatment target to improve social functioning, as it is a proximal predictor of social functioning. Social Cognition Training (SCT) improves social cognition, but may not generalize (enduringly) to social functioning, perhaps due to insufficient opportunity to practice in daily-life social situations. Using virtual reality (VR) for SCT could address this problem, as VR is customizable, accessible, and interactive. We will test the effect of a VR SCT, 'DiSCoVR', on social cognition and social functioning in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In total 100 people with a psychotic disorder and deficits in social cognition will be recruited for this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to VR SCT (DiSCoVR) or VR relaxation training (VRelax; active control). DiSCoVR is a 16-session individual SCT, consisting of three modules: 1) emotion perception (recognizing facial emotions in a virtual shopping street); 2) social perception and theory of mind (observing social interactions between virtual characters and assessing their behavior, emotions and thoughts); and 3) application of higher-order social cognition in social interaction (role-playing personalized situations in VR). People receiving VRelax complete sixteen individual sessions, in which they receive psycho-education about stress, identify personal stressors, learn relaxation techniques, and explore relaxing immersive virtual environments. Assessments will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are emotion perception (Ekman 60 Faces), social perception and theory of mind (The Awareness of Social Inference Test). Secondary outcomes include social functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale), experiences and social interactions in daily life (experience sampling of emotions, social participation and subjective experience of social situations), psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, perceived stress, anxiety, positive and negative symptoms) and self-esteem.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT testing the efficacy of VR SCT. It will also investigate generalization to daily life social situations, the durability of treatment effects, and moderators and mediators of treatment success.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      On December 5, 2017, this trial was registered prospectively in the Dutch Trial Register as NTR6863 ."

            "abstract": "Schizophrenia patients always show cognitive impairment, which is proved to be related to hypo-connectivity or hyper-connectivity. Further, individuals with an ultra-high risk for psychosis also show abnormal functional connectivity-related cognitive impairment, especially in the alpha rhythm. Thus, the identification of functional networks is essential to our understanding of the disorder. We investigated the resting-state functional connectivity of the alpha rhythm measured by electroencephalography (EEG) to reveal the relation between functional network and clinical symptoms. The participants included 28 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), 28 individuals with ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR), and 28 healthy controls (HC). After the professional clinical symptoms evaluation, all the participants were instructed to keep eyes closed for 3-min resting-state EEG recording. The 3-min EEG data were segmented into artefact-free epochs (the length was 3 s), and the functional connectivity of the alpha phase was estimated using the phase lag index (PLI), which measures the phase differences of EEG signals. The FES and UHR groups displayed increased resting-state PLI connectivity compared with the HC group [F(2,74) = 10.804, p < 0.001]. Significant increases in the global efficiency, the local efficiency, and the path length were found in the FES and UHR groups compared with those of the HC group. FES and UHR showed an increased degree of connectivity compared with HC. The degree of the left occipital lobe area was higher in the UHR group than in the FES group. The hypothesis of disconnection is confirmed. Furthermore, differences between the UHR and FES group were found, which is valuable for producing clinical significance before the onset of schizophrenia."

Playful strategies can stimulate treatment compliance and have been used to provide psychosocial support and health education; they can involve gamification, virtual reality, robotics, and healthcare environments. This study aims to identify how playfulness, whenever applicable, can be used as a strategy to improve the subjective well-being of pediatric cancer patients in the Brazilian Unified Health System.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen volunteers with experience in pediatric oncology participated in the study.

Such strategies are not limited to using playfulness as a way of \"having fun\"; they privilege ludic interfaces, such as toys, to support psychosocial care and health education. They aim to address cancer and develop communication across families and staff in a humanized manner, educate families about the disease, and design children-friendly environments. Volunteers also generated strategies to help children cope with perceptions of death, pain, and their bodies. Such strategies aim to support understanding the meaning of life and death, comprehend pain beyond physicality, help re-signify cancer and children's changing bodies, and give patients active voices during the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The paper proposes strategies that can improve the well-being of pediatric cancer patients in the Brazilian Unified Health System.

            "abstract": "We sought to integrate a brief computer and counseling support intervention into the routine practices of HIV clinics and evaluate effects on patients' viral loads. The project targeted HIV patients in care whose viral loads exceeded 1000 copies/ml at the time of recruitment. Three HIV clinics initiated the intervention immediately, and three other HIV clinics delayed onset for 16 months and served as concurrent controls for evaluating outcomes. The intervention components included a brief computer-based intervention (CBI) focused on antiretroviral therapy adherence; health coaching from project counselors for participants whose viral loads did not improve after doing the CBI; and behavioral screening and palm cards with empowering messages available to all patients at intervention clinics regardless of viral load level. The analytic cohort included 982 patients at intervention clinics and 946 patients at control clinics. Viral loads were assessed at 270 days before recruitment, at time of recruitment, and +270 days later. Results indicated that both the control and intervention groups had significant reductions in viral load, ending with approximately the same viral level at +270 days. There was no evidence that the CBI or the targeted health coaching was responsible for the viral reduction in the intervention group. Results may stem partially from statistical regression to the mean in both groups. Also, clinical providers at control and intervention clinics may have taken action (e.g., conversations with patients, referrals to case managers, adherence counselors, mental health, substance use specialists) to help their patients reduce their viral loads. In conclusion, neither a brief computer-based nor targeted health coaching intervention reduced patients' viral loads beyond levels achieved with standard of care services available to patients at well-resourced HIV clinics."

            "abstract": "Although women with serious mental illness have high rates of lifetime sexual partners, they infrequently use contraception. Consequently, the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections is high in this population. In addition, while the overall rate of pregnancy in women with schizophrenia of child-bearing age is lower than in the general population, the percentage of pregnancies that are unwanted is higher than that in the general population. The objective of this paper is to help clinicians explore knowledge of appropriate methods of contraception for women who suffer from schizophrenia. The authors reviewed recent literature on the use of contraceptive methods by women with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic and adjunctive medications. Contraceptive counseling to women and their partners is an important part of comprehensive care for women with serious and persistent mental illness. Women with schizophrenia who smoke, are overweight, or have diabetes, migraine, cardiovascular disease, or a family history of breast cancer should be offered non-hormonal contraception. Women with more than one sexual partner should be advised on barrier methods in addition to any other contraceptive measures they are using. Clinicians should be alert for potential interactions among oral hormonal contraceptives, smoking, and therapeutic drugs. Long-lasting contraceptive methods, such as intrauterine devices, progesterone depot injections, or tubal ligation are reasonable options for women having no wish to further expand their families."

In the aging literature, it is well established that the recognition of emotion in facial expressions declines with advancing age, and this also occurs with vocal expressions. By contrast, crossmodal integration processing in healthy aging individuals is less documented. Here, we investigated the age-related effects on emotion recognition when faces and voices were presented alone or simultaneously, allowing for crossmodal integration. In this study, 31 young adults (M = 25.8 years) and 31 older adults (M = 67.2 years) were instructed to identify several basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust) and a neutral expression, which were displayed as visual (facial expressions), auditory (non-verbal affective vocalizations) or crossmodal (simultaneous, congruent facial and vocal affective expressions) stimuli. The results showed that older adults performed slower and worse than younger adults at recognizing negative emotions from isolated faces and voices. In the crossmodal condition, although slower, older adults were as accurate as younger except for anger. Importantly, additional analyses using the \"race model\" demonstrate that older adults benefited to the same extent as younger adults from the combination of facial and vocal emotional stimuli. These results help explain some conflicting results in the literature and may clarify emotional abilities related to daily life that are partially spared among older adults."

Researchers suggest inclusion of rest breaks within vigilance tasks improve overall performance (Helton & Russell, 2015; Ross, Russell, & Helton, 2014), while different types of breaks demonstrate different effects. Some literature suggests exposure to natural movements/stimuli helps restore attention (Herzog, Black, Fountaine, & Knotts, 1997; Kaplan, 1995). Participants were randomly assigned to one experimental condition: dog video breaks, robot video breaks, countdown breaks or continuous vigilance. We assessed task performance and subjective reports of stress/workload. The continuous group displayed worst performance, suggesting breaks help restore attention.

However, little is known about HIV risk or prevention behavior during this critical time of transition. The current study investigated STI and HIV risk and prevention behavior and recent use of prevention and treatment services (i.e., education, testing, medication) among homeless persons preparing to move into PSH. Data come from interviews with 421 homeless adults before they moved into PSH. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents were sexually active; of those, 75.7% reported unprotected sex. Nearly two-thirds (64%) reported past year HIV testing and 40% reported testing for another STI. Fewer than one-third (31%) of respondents reported receiving posttest counseling at their last HIV test. HIV seropositivity was self-reported by 10%. Among those persons who were HIV-positive, 57.1% reported less than 100% antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. Among HIV-negative respondents, less than 1% had been prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Less than half (46.4%) of the sample reported any HIV prevention education in the past year. This population of homeless adults about to move into PSH report high rates of HIV risk behavior, but low rates of HIV prevention education and very little PrEP utilization. Further, low rates of ARV adherence among HIV-positive respondents indicate significant risk for HIV transmission and acquisition. Entering PSH is a period of transition for homeless persons when integrated care is critically important to ensure positive health outcomes, but these data suggest that PrEP and other HIV prevention services are poorly accessed among this population. As such, multipronged services that integrate PrEP and other HIV prevention services are needed to prevent transmission and acquisition of HIV in this high-risk, vulnerable population and ensure the health and wellbeing of PSH residents."

What if the hypnotized simulated hypnosis solely to please him? From Charcot and Richet to Martin Orne, by way of Bernheim or Freud, the response of researchers to this disquieting question has always been the same: the subject cannot be simulating, because he is hypnotized, asleep, unconscious. The hypothesis of a psychic unconscious (or of unconsciousness), which determined the very concept of hypnosis from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards is nothing more than a postulate required to guarantee the objectivity of hypnotic and, more broadly, psychological phenomena, by preventing the latter from being seen as simple artifacts of the experimental or clinical situation. The present paper examines several historical avatars of this postulate, including psychoanalysis, and proposes that it be abandoned in favor of a conception of psychology and psychotherapy which is constructivist and no longer objectivist, recognizing the artifactual character of psychic productions instead of denying it."

Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, traditional treatment for endometrial cancer, causes loss of fertility and ovarian function, both of which can significantly negatively impact a young woman's physical and mental well-being. Recently, conservative management with progestational agents has been reported with success from both oncologic and reproductive perspectives. However, there are no randomized trials comparing conservative versus surgical therapy. Patients who are candidates for conservative therapy must be extensively counseled regarding the risks and must comply with close surveillance."

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the defense style of hospitalized depressed adults improved over the course of treatment. Thirty-one inpatients (24 women and 7 men) with an admitting diagnosis of major depression completed the 40-item Defense Style Questionnaire and the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Participants completed the Defense Style Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale within 48 hours after admission and within 24 hours before or after discharge. The average admission and discharge Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale ratings (+/-SD) were 41.93+/-9.93 and 26.45+/-12.19, respectively. The average hospital length of stay was 7.1+/-2.8 days. Two-tailed t-test comparisons of the Defense Style Questionnaire admission and discharge ratings showed significantly higher discharge mature ratings, significantly lower discharge immature ratings, and stable neurotic ratings. We concluded that for some depressed women and men, improvement in defense style can occur within days after the initiation of standard inpatient treatment."

Clinical cardiology has largely focused on AF treatment and associated stroke prevention rather than preventing AF itself. To reduce the global consequences and associated costs of AF, it is critical to now embrace prevention as a priority. Proactively addressing the risk factors for AF and the underlying unhealthy lifestyle habits that contribute to them, using research-based counseling approaches, represents a complementary and adjunctive alternative in combatting this disease burden.\n    \n\n\n          Observations:\n        \n      \n      Encouraging and sustaining patient involvement to reduce AF incidence and improve outcomes begins with screening to identify risk factors, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and characteristics associated with failed attempts at favorably modifying these causalities. Modulators of and common barriers to achieving risk reduction and lifestyle change include self-efficacy, social support, age, sex, marital and socioeconomic status, education, employment, and psychosocial factors such as depression, isolation, anxiety and chronic life stress. Focused behavioral counseling approaches, including assessing the patient's readiness to change, motivational interviewing and using the 5 A's (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange), along with employing initial downscaled goals to overcome inertia, are proven methodologies to overcome these common barriers to favorably modifying risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle habits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      To complement and enhance the current armamentarium for the medical management of cardiac arrhythmias, there is an urgent need to proactively address the causative factors triggering new-onset, recurrent and persistent AF.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of robotic neurorehabilitation using Lokomat with virtual reality (VR) on attention processes and executive functions in patients with TBI.Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. Fifty-six TBI patients have been included in the analysis, using an electronic recovery data system. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups: the experimental group (LPG) underwent rehabilitation training with Lokomat Pro, equipped with a VR screen, whereas the control group (LNG) performed rehabilitation training using Lokomat Nanos, without VR. The two groups matched for age, sex, education, brain lesions, interval from TBI. The rehabilitation protocol consisted of a total of 40 training sessions.Results: LPG and LNG had a significant improvement in mood and in the perception of physical well-being. However, only the LPG had a significant improvement in global cognitive, executive and attention functions. Furthermore, LPG presented a significant enhancement of the quality of life, with regard to the perception of the mental and physical state.Conclusion: Our study supports the idea that Lokomat is a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with TBI; in particular, the integration of the VR device can implement the cognitive and behavioral functions of TBI patients, enhancing also their physical and mental well-being."

            "abstract": "Reconstructing a \"forma mentis\", a mindset, and its changes, means capturing how individuals perceive topics, trends and experiences over time. To this aim we use forma mentis networks (FMNs), which enable direct, microscopic access to how individuals conceptually perceive knowledge and sentiment around a topic, providing richer contextual information than machine learning. FMNs build cognitive representations of stances through psycholinguistic tools like conceptual associations from semantic memory (free associations, i.e., one concept eliciting another) and affect norms (valence, i.e., how attractive a concept is). We test FMNs by investigating how Norwegian nursing and engineering students perceived innovation and health before and after a 2-month research project in e-health. We built and analysed FMNs by six individuals, based on 75 cues about innovation and health, and leading to 1,000 associations between 730 concepts. We repeated this procedure before and after the project. When investigating changes over time, individual FMNs highlighted drastic improvements in all students' stances towards \"teamwork\", \"collaboration\", \"engineering\" and \"future\", indicating the acquisition and strengthening of a positive belief about innovation. Nursing students improved their perception of 'robots\" and \"technology\" and related them to the future of nursing. A group-level analysis related these changes to the emergence, during the project, of conceptual associations about openness towards multidisciplinary collaboration, and a positive, leadership-oriented group dynamics. The whole group identified \"mathematics\" and \"coding\" as highly relevant concepts after the project. When investigating persistent associations, characterising the core of students' mindsets, network distance entropy and closeness identified as pivotal in the students' mindsets concepts related to \"personal well-being\", \"professional growth\" and \"teamwork\". This result aligns with and extends previous studies reporting the relevance of teamwork and personal well-being for Norwegian healthcare professionals, also within the novel e-health sector. Our analysis indicates that forma mentis networks are powerful proxies for detecting individual- and group-level mindset changes due to professional growth. FMNs open new scenarios for data-informed, multidisciplinary interventions aimed at professional training in innovation."

The algorithm's goal is to identify and treat all patients with fatigue that causes distress or interferes with daily activities or functioning. Management of fatigue begins with primary oncology team members who perform the initial screening and either provide basic education and counseling or expand the initial screening to a more focused evaluation for moderate or higher levels of fatigue. At this point the patient is assessed for the five primary factors known to be associated with fatigue: pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, anemia, and hypothyroidism. If any of these conditions are present, it should be treated according to practice guidelines, and the patient's fatigue should be reevaluated regularly. If none of the primary factors is present or the fatigue is unresolved, a more comprehensive assessment is indicated--with referral to other care providers as appropriate. The comprehensive assessment should include a thorough review of systems, review of medications, assessment of comorbidities, nutritional/metabolic evaluation, and assessment of activity level. Management of fatigue is cause-specific when conditions known to cause fatigue can be identified and treated. When specific causes, such as infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction, cannot be identified and corrected, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of the fatigue should be considered. Nonpharmacologic interventions may include a moderate exercise program to improve functional capacity and activity tolerance, restorative therapies to decrease cognitive alterations and improve mood state, and nutritional and sleep interventions for patients with disturbances in eating or sleeping. Pharmacologic therapy may include drugs such as antidepressants for depression or erythropoietin for anemia. A few clinical reports of the use of corticosteroids and psychostimulants suggest the need for further research on these agents as a potential treatment modalities in managing fatigue. Basic to these interventions, the effective management of cancer-related fatigue involves an informed and supportive oncology care team that assesses patients' fatigue levels regularly and systematically and incorporates education and counseling regarding strategies for coping with fatigue (Johnson, 1999), as well as using institutional fatigue management experts for referral of patients with unresolved fatigue."

The relatively recent development of validated and reliable criteria for identifying young people at \"ultra\" high-risk (UHR) of psychosis has enabled the process of illness onset to be studied more closely than was previously possible.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      This longitudinal study compared the experiences of stress and coping between a UHR cohort (N=143) and a healthy comparison group (HC group, N=32).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The UHR group experienced significantly fewer life events over a 12-month period than the HC group, but there was no difference in the experience of minor events or \"hassles\". However, the UHR group reported feeling significantly more distressed by events, felt they coped more poorly and utilized different coping strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The appraisals made about stressors differentiated the groups and was associated with differences in coping and distress levels. This suggests that treatment strategies focusing on stress management and enhancing coping skills might be important components of preventive interventions."

            "abstract": "Background: Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent, yet access to support is limited by barriers of stigma, cost, and availability. These issues are even more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, and digital technology is one potential way to overcome these barriers. Digital mental health interventions are effective but often struggle with low engagement rates, particularly in the absence of human support. Chatbots could offer a scalable solution, simulating human support at a lower cost. Objective: To complete a preliminary evaluation of engagement and effectiveness of Vitalk, a mental health chatbot, at reducing anxiety, depression and stress. Methods: Real world data was analyzed from 3,629 Vitalk users who had completed the first phase of a Vitalk program (\"less anxiety,\" \"less stress\" or \"better mood\"). Programs were delivered through written conversation with a chatbot. Engagement was calculated from the number of responses sent to the chatbot divided by days in the program. Results: Users sent an average of 8.17 responses per day. For all three programs, target outcome scores reduced between baseline and follow up with large effect sizes for anxiety (Cohen's d = -0.85), depression (Cohen's d = -0.91) and stress (Cohen's d = -0.81). Increased engagement resulted in improved post-intervention values for anxiety and depression. Conclusion: This study highlights a chatbot's potential to reduce mental health symptoms in the general population within Brazil. While findings show promise, further research is required."

Discontinuers, on the other hand, seemed to be less involved in decision making and often appeared to have little confidence in their GPs. Most discontinuers felt that they lacked knowledge, and their attitude toward taking SSRIs was rather negative.

Pooled evidence demonstrated that non-pharmacological interventions using information and communication technologies exerted a large effect on depression (SMD = -1.088, 95% CI -1.983 to -0.193, p = 0.017), a moderate effect on overall behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (SMD = -0.664, 95% CI -0.990 to -0.338, p < 0.001), and agitation (SMD = -0.586, 95% CI -1.130 to -0.042, p = 0.035).

In this context, virtual coaches (VCs) have assumed a central role in supporting and treating common barriers related to adherence. However, most of them are mainly focused on medical and physical purposes, such as the monitoring of blood glucose levels or following a healthy diet.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a VC intervention for psychosocial support before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The intent of this VC is to motivate adults with type 1 DM and type 2 DM to adopt and cultivate healthy coping strategies to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and diabetes-related emotional distress, while also improving their well-being.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 13 Italian adults with DM (18-51 years) interacted with a VC, called Motibot (motivational bot) using the Telegram messaging app. The interaction covered 12 sessions, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes, during which the user could dialogue with the VC by inputting text or tapping an option on their smartphone screen. Motibot is developed within the transtheoretical model of change to deliver the most appropriate psychoeducational intervention based on the user's motivation to change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Results showed that over the 12 sessions, there were no significant changes before and after the intervention and at follow-up regarding psychosocial factors.

In addition, users felt motivated, involved, encouraged, emotionally understood, and stimulated by Motibot during the interaction. Indeed, the analyses of semistructured interviews, using a text mining approach, showed that most users reported a perceived reduction in anxiety, depression, and/or stress symptoms. Moreover, users indicated the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating them to find a mindful moment for themselves and to reflect on their own emotions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Motibot was well accepted by users, particularly because of the inclusion of mindfulness practices, which motivated them to adopt healthy coping skills. To this extent, Motibot provided psychosocial support for adults with DM, particularly for those with mild and moderate symptoms, whereas those with severe symptoms may benefit more from face-to-face psychotherapy."

            "abstract": "Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well treatable, many people do not get the desired treatment due to barriers to care (such as stigma and cost). This paper presents a system that bridges this gap by enabling patients to follow therapy at home. A therapist is only involved remotely, to monitor progress and serve as a safety net. With this system, patients can recollect their memories in a digital diary and recreate them in a 3D WorldBuilder. Throughout the therapy, a virtual agent is present to inform and guide patients through the sessions, employing an ontology-based question module for recollecting traumatic memories to further elicit a detailed memory recollection. In a usability study with former PTSD patients (n = 4), these questions were found useful for memory recollection. Moreover, the usability of the whole system was rated positively. This system has the potential to be a valuable addition to the spectrum of PTSD treatments, offering a novel type of home therapy assisted by a virtual agent."

Anomalies in these skills may result in empathy deficits, social interaction difficulties and premorbid emotional problems in children and adolescents with schizophrenia. Twenty-six subjects with early onset schizophrenia spectrum (EOSS) disorders and twenty-eight matched healthy controls (HC) were instructed to identify five basic emotions and a neutral expression. The assessment entailed presenting visual, auditory and congruent cross-modal stimuli. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we found no significant association for handedness, age or gender. However, significant associations emerged for emotion type, perception modality, and group. EOSS patients performed worse than HC in uni- and cross-modal emotional tasks with a specific negative emotion processing impairment pattern. There was no relationship between emotion identification scores and positive or negative symptoms, self-reported empathy traits or a positive history of developmental disorders. However, we found a significant association between emotional identification scores and nonverbal communication impairments. We conclude that cumulative dysfunctions in both nonverbal communication and emotion processing contribute to the social vulnerability and morbidity found in youths who display EOSS disorder."

Many individuals experience a lower quality of life as a result of their epilepsy diagnosis and are more likely to develop mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. Medical interventions for this client group tend to focus on the treatment of seizures, whereas mental health disorders often remain undiagnosed and untreated. Early identification and treatment of mental health difficulties in people with epilepsy are vital to ensure better outcomes and improvements in quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this exploratory randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention delivered through a mobile app-ThinkNinja for Epilepsy-is a clinically effective tool to improve quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being in a large sample of people with epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study aims to recruit 184 individuals, 18 to 65 years of age, with a self-reported diagnosis of epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression.

Primary health-care team must receive information about the patient's disease, and the family should be informed about the disease itself and the social resources they can ask for. It is advisable to formulate a therapeutic scheme including some counsels to improve the suitability of environment, social help measures, behaviour therapy, cognitive stimulation and pharmacological treatment. Atypical antipsychotics have improved \"positive symptoms\" as logorrhoea, wandering, agitation and aggression, without impairing cognitive function. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve depressive symptoms, compulsions, food craving and disinhibition. A few reports suggest that idazoxan (alpha 2-noradrenergic antagonist) can improve attention, verbal fluency and planning efficiency. In some cases with \"FTD and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17\" it could be justified to perform a genetic analysis to the offspring, in order to know if genetic counseling is necessary. An inflammatory reaction has been observed in brain damaged areas, and therefore antiinflammatory treatment efficacy should be investigated. It would also be interesting to look for neuroprotective agents that lessen the tau protein abnormality. All types of receptors which are involved in FTD should be identified, and then their selective agonists or antagonists could be administered in synergic combinations. We hope that all genetic alterations producing or facilitating FTD are eventually known, and harmless curative means are developed."

CHS is categorized by Rome IV classification as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. It is characterized by stereotypical episodic vomiting in the setting of chronic, daily cannabis use, with cycles decreasing by the cessation of cannabis. CHS is also associated with abdominal pain reduced by hot baths and showers with comparative well-being between attacks. Thus, its clinical presentation resembles 'classic' cyclic vomiting syndrome, but eliciting a cannabis history is crucial in diagnosing this entity. In acute attacks, parenteral benzodiazepines are very effective. For prevention and long-term management, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are the mainstay of therapy requiring doses in the range of 50-200 mg/d to achieve symptom control. In addition, counseling to achieve marijuana cessation, accompanied by antianxiety medications, is necessary for sustaining clinical outcomes. Once the patient is in remission and off marijuana for a period of 6-12 months, then tapering the dose of amitriptyline can be implemented, with the goal of no therapy being achieved in the majority of patients over time. With the legalization of marijuana in many states, CHS will become an increasingly prevalent clinical entity, so educating about CHS is an important goal, particularly for emergency department physicians who generally first encounter these patients."

We excluded people who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) remotely using computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratified by depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of <19 vs ≥19], antidepressant use, and recruitment site) to BA from junior mental health workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was given open label, but outcome assessors were masked.

            "abstract": "Social isolation has affected people globally during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a major impact on older adult's well-being. Chatbot interventions may be a way to provide support to address loneliness and social isolation in older adults. The aims of the current study were to (1) understand the distribution of a chatbot's net promoter scores, (2) conduct a thematic analysis on qualitative elaborations to the net promoter scores, (3) understand the distribution of net promoter scores per theme, and (4) conduct a single word analysis to understand the frequency of words present in the qualitative feedback. A total of 7,099 adults and older adults consented to participate in a chatbot intervention on reducing social isolation and loneliness. The average net promoter score (NPS) was 8.67 out of 10. Qualitative feedback was provided by 766 (10.79%) participants which amounted to 898 total responses. Most themes were rated as positive (517), followed by neutral (311) and a minor portion as negative (70). The following five themes were found across the qualitative responses: positive outcome (277, 30.8%), user did not address question (262, 29.2%), bonding with the chatbot (240, 26.7%), negative technical aspects (70, 7.8%), and ambiguous outcome (49, 5.5%). Themes with a positive valence were found to be associated with a higher NPS. The word \"help\" and it's variations were found to be the most frequently used words, which is consistent with the thematic analysis. These results show that a chatbot for social isolation and loneliness was perceived positively by most participants. More specifically, users were likely to personify the chatbot (e.g., \"Cause I feel like I have a new friend!\") and perceive positive personality features such as being non-judgmental, caring, and open to listen. A minor portion of the users reported dissatisfaction with chatting with a machine. Implications will be discussed."

It is envisaged that the inhabitants of future planetary habitats will be exposed to concomitant confinement, reduced gravity and hypoxia. We examined the independent and combined effects of a 21-day inactivity/unloading and normobaric hypoxia under confined conditions on various psychological factors. Eleven healthy men participated in three 21-day experimental campaigns designed in a cross-over manner: (1) Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement, (2) Normobaric hypoxic bed rest and (3) Normobaric normoxic bed rest. The Profile of Mood States, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule were employed to assess the participants' psychological responses before (Pre), during (Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21) and after (Post) the confinements. The most negative psychological profile appeared on days 14 and 21 of the hypoxic bed rest campaign. A significant increase in depression, tension, and confusion was noted on days 14 and 21 of the hypoxic bed rest condition. Concomitantly, a decrease, albeit not statistically significant, in positive psychological responses was observed. The psychological profile returned to the initial level at Post following all confinements. These data suggest that the combined effect of hypoxia and bed rest induced the most negative effects on an individual's mood. However, significant intra- and inter-individual differences in psychological responses were noted and should be taken into consideration."

Some of the side effects commonly associated with SGAs such as weight gain and metabolic disorders have potentially devastating effects on health and well-being, increasing cardiovascular risk and the incidence of diabetes. The Well-Being Support Programme (WSP), a nurse-led service, was designed to provide a care delivery system whereby physical problems could be identified and appropriate treatment and monitoring initiated by prompt referral to suitable specialist services or general practitioners, forging strong links between primary and secondary care and ensuring that mentally ill patients with physical health problems were receiving holistic care packages. Other problems such as unhealthy lifestyles and obesity were managed by the Nurse Advisor running the programme. Interventions such as weight counselling and groups, and structured exercise programmes were beneficial in terms of encouraging healthier lifestyles, managing obesity and improving self-esteem. This paper describes the manner in which the service was set up and implemented, demonstrating an effective model for identifying and managing physical health problems in the mentally ill."

            "abstract": "Ischemic colitis is a rare adverse effect of antipsychotic medications and is most commonly associated with the phenothiazine class of antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine. The risk is further increased when antipsychotics are taken in conjunction with anticholinergics. A 27-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder and depression presented to the emergency department with 6 days of constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, and nonbloody vomiting. He later developed multiple episodes of hematochezia and fever. Within the preceding 2 weeks, his medication regimen of divalproex sodium, aripiprazole, and trihexyphenidyl, had been changed to olanzapine, benztropine, and bupropion. The patient's physical examination showed diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and distension and laboratory tests revealed a leukocytosis. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed colitis extending from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon, without evidence of perforation. A colonoscopy revealed severe ischemic colitis involving the descending and sigmoid colon, which was confirmed on biopsy. Given the temporal association between the new medications and onset of symptoms, the patient's ischemic colitis was likely caused by olanzapine or the combination of olanzapine and benztropine, likely secondary to their anticholinergic properties. Thus, providers should take a thorough history and counsel patients regarding the risks of constipation when starting antipsychotic medications, particularly those with anticholinergic activity. Despite the fact that ischemic colitis is such a rare adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, it is important to consider because of its potentially fatal outcomes."

Implications for Rehabilitation Participants whose formal therapy services had ended either because they had exhausted their benefits or because traveling to outpatient therapy was too cumbersome due to distance were able to perform therapeutic activities in the home daily (or at least multiple times per week). Participants who were still receiving formal therapy services either in-home or in the clinic were able to perform therapeutic activities in the home on the days they were not attending/receiving formal therapy. Based on the feedback from these veterans and their caregivers, the manufacturing company is working on modifying the devices to be less cumbersome and more user-friendly (lighter-weight, more mobile, changing software, etc.), as well as more adaptable to participants' homes. Removing these specific barriers will potentially allow participants to utilize the device more easily and more frequently. Since participants expressed that they wished they could have the device in their homes longer than the 3-month usage period required for this pilot project, the project team is working on a proposal to extend this project to a wider area and the new paradigm would extend the usage period until the patient reaches a plateau in progress or no longer wants to use the device."

These nonmotor symptoms are a significant cause of disability at all stages of illness. Cognitive dysfunction spans a continuum from circumscribed cognitive impairments to severe global dementia which can occur in up to 10-30% of advanced PD patients. Psychosis develops in 20-30% of PD patients receiving chronic antiparkinsonian therapy. Visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions are the most frequent symptoms. The gradual elimination of drugs of lesser priority that may affect cognition and/or cloud the sensorium constitutes the first step in the management of cognitive and psychotic symptoms. Atypical neuroleptic agents are an invaluable tool in those cases in which maximum drug regimen simplification is not adequate or results in unacceptable immobility. Depression and anxiety often go unrecognized although they are eminently treatable and may be important contributors to the morbidity of PD. They are present in 30-40% of PD patients and frequently occur together in association with other nonmotor symptoms such as apathy, fatigue and sleep disturbance. A combination of early recognition, counseling, antidepressant therapy, antianxiety and well-balanced antiparkinsonian therapy sets the stage for improved quality of life for patients with PD."

The objective of this study was to compare two counseling techniques for treating patients with Medication-overuse headache (MOH). This was a randomized, blind, controlled clinical trial that compared a structured (FRAMES) and unstructured counseling, for the treatment of MOH. Patients were assessed before the counseling and then again four and eight weeks after it. Semi-structured interview, headache diary, the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used. Primary endpoints were the following: number of patients who stopped medication overuse; days with acute medication use; HIT-6; the number of patients who returned for consultations. Secondary endpoints were as follows: days per month of headache; 50% reduction in monthly days with acute medication use; the number of patients with less than 15 days of headache. Thirty-seven patients were allocated to the \"FRAMES Group\" and 33 to the \"Control Group\". There was no difference regarding primary or secondary outcomes between the two groups.

            "abstract": "The use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics continues to excite controversy. Views differ from expert to expert and from country to country as to the extent of the problem, or even whether long-term benzodiazepine use actually constitutes a problem. The adverse effects of these drugs have been extensively documented and their effectiveness is being increasingly questioned. Discontinuation is usually beneficial as it is followed by improved psychomotor and cognitive functioning, particularly in the elderly. The potential for dependence and addiction have also become more apparent. The licensing of SSRIs for anxiety disorders has widened the prescribers' therapeutic choices (although this group of medications also have their own adverse effects). Melatonin agonists show promise in some forms of insomnia. Accordingly, it is now even more imperative that long-term benzodiazepine users be reviewed with respect to possible discontinuation. Strategies for discontinuation start with primary-care practitioners, who are still the main prescribers.This review sets out the stratagems that have been evaluated, concentrating on those of a pharmacological nature. Simple interventions include basic monitoring of repeat prescriptions and assessment by the doctor. Even a letter from the primary-care practitioner pointing out the continuing usage of benzodiazepines and questioning their need can result in reduction or cessation of use. Pharmacists also have a role to play in monitoring the use of benzodiazepines, although mobilizing their assistance is not yet routine. Such stratagems can avoid the use of specialist back-up services such as psychiatrists, home care, and addiction and alcohol misuse treatment facilities.Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine dependence have been reviewed in detail in a recent Cochrane review, but only eight studies proved adequate for analysis. Carbamazepine was the only drug that appeared to have any useful adjunctive properties for assisting in the discontinuation of benzodiazepines but the available data are insufficient for recommendations to be made regarding its use. Antidepressants can help if the patient is depressed before withdrawal or develops a depressive syndrome during withdrawal. The clearest strategy was to taper the medication; abrupt cessation can only be justified if a very serious adverse effect supervenes during treatment. No clear evidence suggests the optimum rate of tapering, and schedules vary from 4 weeks to several years. Our recommendation is to aim for withdrawal in <6 months, otherwise the withdrawal process can become the morbid focus of the patient's existence. Substitution of diazepam for another benzodiazepine can be helpful, at least logistically, as diazepam is available in a liquid formulation.Psychological interventions range from simple support through counselling to expert cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Group therapy may be helpful as it at least provides support from other patients. The value of counselling is not established and it can be quite time consuming. CBT needs to be administered by fully trained and experienced personnel but seems effective, particularly in obviating relapse.The outcome of successful withdrawal is gratifying, both in terms of improved functioning and abstinence from the benzodiazepine usage. Economic benefits also ensue.Some of the principles of withdrawing benzodiazepines are listed. Antidepressants may be helpful, as may some symptomatic remedies. Care must be taken not to substitute one drug dependence problem for the original one."

Nineteen high function children with higher functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD) and 23 age, gender, and IQ matched children with typical development (TD) used a joy stick to position themselves closer or further from virtual avatars while attempting to identify six emotions expressed by the avatars, happiness, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and surprise that were expressed at different levels of intensity. The results indicated that children with HFASD displayed significantly less approach behavior to the positive happy expression than did children with TD, who displayed increases in approach behavior to higher intensities of happy expressions. Alternatively, all groups tended to withdraw from negative emotions to the same extent and there were no diagnostic group differences in accuracy of recognition of any of the six emotions. This pattern of results is consistent with theory that suggests that some children with HFASD display atypical social-approach motivation, or sensitivity to the positive reward value of positive social-emotional events. Conversely, there was little evidence that a tendency to withdraw from social-emotional stimuli, or a failure to process social emotional stimuli, was a component of social behavior task performance in this sample of children with HFASD."

In recent years, brief cognitive behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be efficacious, and the public has become more familiar with these techniques through media exposure and self-help books.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Depressed primary care patients were surveyed regarding the extent to which cognitive behavioral (CB) techniques were suggested during the primary care visit in which antidepressant medication was initially prescribed.

Physician recommendations regarding planning pleasurable activities, problem solving, challenging depressive thoughts, and planning activities that boost confidence were reported by 22% to 40% of study patients. Older patients reported fewer interactions about CB strategies. Primary care physicians' suggestion of CB strategies was associated with both patient use of CB strategies in the months following the visit and better adherence to recommended medication therapy during the first month of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Many patients seem to recognize the occurrence of psychotherapeutic interactions during visits to their primary care physician in which an antidepressant medication was prescribed, and patients' recognition of these interactions is associated with increased adherence to the recommended course of antidepressant prescriptions."

The present study evaluates the feasibility of the software agent \"SISU\" aiming to uplift psychological wellbeing. Methods: Within a one-group pretest-posttest trial, N = 30 German-speaking participants were recruited. Assessments took place before (t1), during (t2) and after (t3) the intervention. The ability of SISU to guide participants through the intervention, acceptability, and negative effects were investigated. Data analyses are based on intention-to-treat principles. Linear mixed models will be used to investigate short-term changes over time in mood, depression, anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention:\n        \n      \n      The intervention consists of two sessions.

Further, the influence of socioemotional cues on food reward is little explored. We examined these issues in overweight/obese (OW/OB) and normal-weight (NW) participants who watched food images varying in palatability in the same time as videoclips of avatars looking at the food images while displaying facial expressions (happy, disgust or neutral) with their gaze directed only toward the food or consecutively toward the food and participants. We measured heart rate (HR) deceleration as an index of attentional/incentive salience, facial EMG activity as an index of hedonic or disgust reactions, and self-report of wanting and liking. OW/OB participants exhibited a larger HR deceleration to palatable food pictures than NW participants suggesting that they attributed greater incentive salience to food cues. However, in contrast to NW participants, they did not display increased hedonic facial reactions to the liked food cues. Subjective ratings of wanting and liking did not differentiate the two groups. Further, OW/OB participants had more pronounced HR deceleration than NW participants to palatable food cues when they watched avatars' happy faces gazing at the food. In line with the \"incentive-sensitization\" hypothesis, our data suggest that incentive salience attribution and not hedonic reactivity is increased in OW/OB individuals and that happy faces, as social reward cues, potentiate implicit wanting in OW/OB people."

The median age was 44 years (interquartile range, 32-58 years) for those with depression and 56 years (interquartile range, 43-71 years) for those with epilepsy. Significantly more patients with depression (144 373 [63%] were women, and 84 791 [37%] were men; P < .001) or epilepsy (54 419 [56%] were women, and 42 758 [44%] were men; P < .001) were female. Incident epilepsy was associated with an increased hazard of developing depression (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04 [95% CI, 1.97-2.09]; P < .001), and incident depression was associated with an increased hazard of developing epilepsy (HR, 2.55 [95% CI, 2.49-2.60]; P < .001) There was an incremental hazard according to depression treatment type with lowest risk for those receiving counselling alone (HR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.30-2.59]; P < .001), an intermediate risk for those receiving antidepressants alone (HR, 3.43 [95% CI, 3.37-3.47]; P < .001), and the highest risk for those receiving both (HR, 9.85 [95% CI, 5.74-16.90]; P < .001).

            "abstract": "Others' movements inform us about their current activities as well as their intentions and emotions. Research on the distinct mechanisms underlying action recognition and emotion inferences has been limited due to a lack of suitable comparative stimulus material. Problematic confounds can derive from low-level physical features (e.g., luminance), as well as from higher-level psychological features (e.g., stimulus difficulty). Here we present a standardized stimulus dataset, which allows to address both action and emotion recognition with identical stimuli. The stimulus set consists of 792 computer animations with a neutral avatar based on full body motion capture protocols. Motion capture was performed on 22 human volunteers, instructed to perform six everyday activities (mopping, sweeping, painting with a roller, painting with a brush, wiping, sanding) in three different moods (angry, happy, sad). Five-second clips of each motion protocol were rendered into AVI-files using two virtual camera perspectives for each clip. In contrast to video stimuli, the computer animations allowed to standardize the physical appearance of the avatar and to control lighting and coloring conditions, thus reducing the stimulus variation to mere movement. To control for low level optical features of the stimuli, we developed and applied a set of MATLAB routines extracting basic physical features of the stimuli, including average background-foreground proportion and frame-by-frame pixel change dynamics. This information was used to identify outliers and to homogenize the stimuli across action and emotion categories. This led to a smaller stimulus subset (n = 83 animations within the 792 clip database) which only contained two different actions (mopping, sweeping) and two different moods (angry, happy). To further homogenize this stimulus subset with regard to psychological criteria we conducted an online observer study (N = 112 participants) to assess the recognition rates for actions and moods, which led to a final sub-selection of 32 clips (eight per category) within the database. The ACASS database and its subsets provide unique opportunities for research applications in social psychology, social neuroscience, and applied clinical studies on communication disorders. All 792 AVI-files, selected subsets, MATLAB code, annotations, and motion capture data (FBX-files) are available online."

            "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition has been found to be impaired in schizophrenia, although overall results have been inconclusive. A new set of facial emotion stimuli with Chinese faces was developed, using static and dynamic avatars, the identification of which were subsequently validated in 562 healthy control subjects. This test was then used to identify facial emotion recognition accuracy in 44 patients with schizophrenia and 41 healthy controls. Overall, patients identified facial emotions significantly worse than healthy controls (p = 0.018) with a significant main effect for type of emotion (p = 0.016). Patients performed significantly worse in fear (p = 0.029) and sadness (p = 0.037), and marginally worse in anger (p = 0.052). No significant differences were evident in contempt (p = 0.254) or happiness (p = 0.943). Regarding error rates of misattribution, patients overidentified contempt (p = 0.035) and sadness (p = 0.01), but not anger, fear, or happiness. Conclusion, patients of Chinese ethnicity with schizophrenia may have significantly greater difficulties identifying negative, but not positive emotions."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Mental health contact centers (also known as Hotlines) offer crisis intervention and counselling by phone calls and online chats. These mental health helplines have shown great success in improving the mental state of the callers, and are increasingly becoming popular in Israel and worldwide. Unfortunately, our knowledge about how to conduct successful routing of callers to counselling agents has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the interactions. To date, many of these contact centers are overwhelmed by chat requests and operate in a simple first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy which, combined, may lead to many callers receiving suboptimal counselling or abandoning the service before being treated. In this work our goal is to improve the efficiency of mental health contact centers by using a novel machine-learning based routing policy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We present a large-scale machine learning-based analysis of real-world data from the online contact center of ERAN, the Israeli Association for Emotional First Aid. The data includes over 35,000 conversations over a 2-years period. Based on this analysis, we present a novel call routing method, that integrates advanced AI-techniques including the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. We conducted an experiment that included various realistic simulations of incoming calls to contact centers, based on data from ERAN. We divided the simulations into two common settings: standard call flow and heavy call flow. In order to establish a baseline, we compared our proposed solution to two baseline methods: (1) The FCFS method; and (2) a greedy solution based on machine learning predictions. Our comparison focuses on two metrics - the number of calls served and the average feedback of the callers (i.e., quality of the chats).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the preliminary analysis, we identify indicative features that significantly contribute to the effectiveness of a conversation and demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the expected duration and the callers' feedback. In the routing methods evaluation, we find that in heavy call flow settings, our proposed method significantly outperforms the other methods in both the quantity of served calls and average feedback. Most notably, we find that in the heavy call flow settings, our method improves the average feedback by 24% compared to FCFS and by 4% compared to the greedy solution. Regarding the standard-flow setting, we find that our proposed method significantly outperforms the FCFS method in the callers' average feedback with a 12% improvement. However, in this setting, we did not find a significant difference between all methods in the quantity of served-calls and no significant difference was found between our proposed method and the greedy solution.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The proposed routing policy has the potential to significantly improve the performance of mental health contact centers, especially in peak hours. Leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, combined with real-world data can bring about a significant and necessary leap forward in the way mental health hotlines operate and consequently reduce the burden of mental illnesses on health systems. However, implementation and evaluation in an operational contact center is necessary in order to verify that the results replicate in practice."

            "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur in the wake of exposure to a traumatic event. Currently, PTSD symptoms are assessed mainly through self-report in the form of questionnaire or clinical interview. Self-report has inherent limitations, particularly in psychiatric populations who may have limited awareness of deficit, reduced attention span, or poor vocabulary and/or literacy skills. Diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy would be aided by behavioral measures. A viable alternative may be virtual environments, in which the participant guides an on-screen \"avatar\" through a series of onscreen events meant to simulate real-world situations. Here, a sample of 82 veterans, self-assessed for PTSD symptoms was administered such a task, in which the avatar was confronted with situations that might evoke avoidant behavior, a core feature of PTSD. Results showed a strong correlation between PTSD symptom burden and task performance; in fact, the ability to predict PTSD symptom burden based on simple demographic variables (age, sex, combat exposure) was significantly improved by adding task score as a predictor variable. The results therefore suggest that virtual environments may provide a new way to assess PTSD symptoms, while avoiding at least some of the limitations associated with symptom self-report, and thus might be a useful complement to questionnaire or clinical interview, potentially facilitating both diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy."

The aim of this study was to determine whether inpatient adolescents with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) have more motor and/or language impairments compared to patients with other psychiatric disorders. A retrospective chart review of all consecutive cases admitted in two adolescent inpatient units between January 2017 and December 2018 was conducted (N = 191). All patients received multi-disciplinary clinical and developmental assessments. For a subtest of subjects, additional standardized tests were used to document motor and language impairments. In this clinical chart 53 adolescents with a DMDD (mean age 13.6 ± 1.5, min 12, max 16, 70% males) were compared to patients with a major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 64, mean age 15.3 ± 1.6, 52% males) and patients with a non-mood disorder (NMD, n = 61, mean age 14.4 ± 1.55, 59% males). Among inpatients with DMDD, 71% had an associated motor and/or language disorder, with combined forms in around two-thirds of cases. Compared to youths with MDD, participants with DMDD were more likely to have an associated developmental coordination disorder (67% vs. 22%, OR = 4.7) and a written language disorder (35% vs. 10%, OR = 4.6). While 31% of inpatients with DMDD had an associated communication/oral language disorder, this rate was not statistically different from those observed in the MDD group (11%, OR = 3.2). The frequencies of motor and language impairments were not statistically different between participants in the DMDD group and in the NMD group. The high rate of motor and written language disorders found in DMDD patients may partly account for their academic difficulties. Such finding, if confirmed, supports systematic screening of motor and written language impairments in youths with chronic irritability and suggests remediation potential."

In particular, a multiscale entropy analysis was applied to the R-R interval series, that were derived from electrocardiographic (ECG) signals for a group of nineteen subjects comprised of eight patients and eleven healthy control subjects. They were monitored using a textile-based sensorized t-shirt during the day and overnight for a total of 47 diurnal and 27 nocturnal recordings. Patients showed three different mood states: depression, hypomania and euthymia. Results show a clear loss of complexity during depressive and hypomanic states as compared to euthymic and healthy control states. In addition, we observed that a more significant complexity modulation among healthy and pathological mood states occurs during the night. These findings suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with an enhanced sleep-related dysregulation of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, and that heartbeat complex dynamics may serve as a viable marker of pathological conditions in mental health."

            "abstract": "Advances in antiretroviral medications have resulted in precipitous declines in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality; however, high levels of adherence are crucial to the success of HIV therapies. This article reviews published studies in the United States on HIV-infected youth (ages 13 to 24 years), focusing on adherence to antiretroviral regimens and interventions designed to enhance adherence. A systematic search yielded 21 articles published between 1999 and 2008 that reported data on medication adherence in HIV-infected youth, of which 7 described unique interventions to enhance medication adherence. Five thematic areas were identified to classify factors associated with adherence. Findings suggest psychosocial factors, in particular depression and anxiety, were consistently associated with poorer adherence across studies. Three types of adherence interventions with HIV-infected youth were found. Results suggest that examining adherence within the broader contextual issues present in the lives of youth, including HIV stigma and disclosure, caregiver stress, peer relations, mental health and substance use, and length of time on medications, may be most important to understanding how best to intervene with adherence among this population. Secondary HIV prevention interventions for youth represent a possible mode through which to deliver individually tailored adherence skill building and counseling to improve medication adherence."

However, nonadherence is prevalent after discharge, often leading to re-admission. Several strategies exist to reduce nonadherence. The current project uses clinical practice improvement methodologies to test and adjust strategies to improve medication adherence at the Institute of Mental Health in Singapore.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two focus groups (one of which involved nonadherent individuals and the other adherent individuals) were conducted to explore the root cause of our service users' nonadherence. On the basis of the causes identified, the team developed and implemented a person-centered medication adherence counseling intervention, incorporating motivational interviewing and psychoeducation. Data from all service users (n=156) who were nonadherent to psychotropic medications upon admission to our men's ward between October 2017 and December 2018 were examined, with 63 of the men serving as the baseline sample and 93 receiving the adherence intervention. The team also reduced medication frequency and actively explored patients' willingness to switch to long-acting injectable antipsychotics. A validated visual analogue self-reporting scale was used to measure adherence at screening and 30 days after discharge. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the effects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After an intervention involving 3 specific strategies that addressed the concerns identified during the focus groups, the percentage of people who adhered to their treatment regimen 30 days after discharge increased by 33% (95% confidence interval: 15%-51%, P=0.001). Our balance measure (a secondary outcome that may be negatively or positively affected by efforts to influence the primary outcome), which was the percentage of people readmitted within 30 days of their discharge, showed a significant improvement (ie, a decrease in percentage readmitted).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Quality improvement methodologies can be used to solve common problems with context-specific solutions.

            "abstract": "Attributional style means how people typically infer the causes of emotional behaviors. No study has shown neural basis of attributional style in schizophrenia, although it was suggested as a major area of social cognition research of schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing three (happy, angry, and neutral) conditions of attribution task. Each condition included inferring situational causes of an avatar' (virtual character) emotional or neutral behavior. In the between-groups contrast maps of the happy conditions, the patient group compared to the control group showed decreased activations in the inferior frontal (BA 44) and the ventral premotor cortex (BA 6), in which the % signal changes were associated with negative symptoms. In the angry conditions, the patient group compared to the control group exhibited increased activations in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (Pcu/PCC) (BA 7/31), in which the % signal changes were related to positive symptoms. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia may have functional deficits in mirror neuron system when attributing positive behaviors, which may be related to a lack of inner simulation and empathy and negative symptoms. In contrast, patients may have increased activation in the Pcu/PCC related to self-representations while attributing negative behaviors, which may be related to failures in self- and source-monitoring and positive symptoms."

            "abstract": "One in three university students experiences mental health problems during their study. A similar percentage leaves higher education without obtaining the degree for which they enrolled. Research suggests that both mental health problems and academic underperformance could be caused by students lacking control and purpose while they are adjusting to tertiary education. Currently, universities are not designed to cater to all the personal needs and mental health problems of large numbers of students at the start of their studies. Within the literature aimed at preventing mental health problems among students (e.g., anxiety or depression), digital forms of therapy recently have been suggested as potentially scalable solutions to address these problems. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of a chatbot, for example, shows great potential as an evidence-based solution. At the same time, within the literature aimed at improving academic performance, the online life-crafting intervention in which students write about values and passions, goals, and goal-attainment plans has shown to improve the academic performance and retention rates of students. Because the life-crafting intervention is delivered through the curriculum and doesn't bear the stigma that is associated with therapy, it can reach larger populations of students. But life-crafting lacks the means for follow-up or the interactiveness that online AI-guided therapy can offer. In this narrative review, we propose to integrate the current literature on chatbot interventions aimed at the mental health of students with research about a life-crafting intervention that uses an inclusive curriculum-wide approach. When a chatbot asks students to prioritize both academic as well as social and health-related goals and provides personalized follow-up coaching, this can prevent -often interrelated- academic and mental health problems. Right on-time delivery, and personalized follow-up questions enhance the effects of both -originally separated- intervention types. Research on this new combination of interventions should use design principles that increase user-friendliness and monitor the technology acceptance of its participants."

Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and SPSS to analyze the psychological and behavioral responses of people in different regions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to check for the presence of \"psychological typhoon eye\" (PTE) effects. The questionnaires adopted three measurement subscales, namely, the risk cognitive subscale, stress response subscale, and behavioral response subscale, and these were administered online (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological and behavioral conduct of respondents from three areas that have been affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. Exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis were conducted to explore the factorial structure of these subscales, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to explore the structural validity of the questionnaires. The analysis results were used to build a revised 18-item questionnaire which validity was evaluated via ANOVA and LSD. Results: Results confirm the presence of PTE in the research areas during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and highlight some significant differences in the cognition and emotions of the residents in these areas. PTE affected the cognition, emotions, and cognitive and emotional responses of the respondents but did not affect their behavioral responses. Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgency of providing sustainable mental health care services across different areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. The residents of those areas worst hit by the pandemic, who may not have taken the situation seriously, require emotional guidance the most. Meanwhile, the residents of other areas, who showed the most negative psychological reactions to the pandemic, require a sense of security, a timely \"disconnection\" from negative information, an accurate cognition of stress, and an acceptance of self-responses."

We investigated the indices of psychological strain during three 10-day conditions, designed to assess the separate and combined effects of inactivity/unloading and normobaric hypoxia on several physiological systems. Eleven male participants underwent three 10-day campaigns in a randomised manner: 1) normobaric normoxic bed rest (NBR), 2) normobaric hypoxic bed rest (HBR) and 3) normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB). The most negative psychological profile appeared on day 10 of the HBR and HAMB (hypoxic) conditions. Concomitantly, a decrease in positive emotions was observed from baseline to day 10 of the HBR and NBR conditions.

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities."

The vast majority of ED is primarily of organic and vascular cause, although psychological factors also play a role in most cases. ED has been shown to compromise overall quality of life and is associated with depression, anxiety, and loss of self-esteem. It may also signal serious underlying disease, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, questions regarding sexual functioning should be a routine part of the medical history. In the early 1990s, with the growing number of nonspecific and effective as well as less invasive tests, a new algorithm was developed that tailored evaluation to the treatment goals of the patient and his partner.

The episodic form is a physiologic response to stress, anxiety, depression, emotional conflicts, fatigue, or repressed hostility. Treatment focuses on the use of over-the-counter or prescribed simple analgesics for pain relief. Successful treatment of the chronic form depends on recognition of depression or persistent anxiety states. Primary care physicians can effectively manage most of these patients with nonhabituating anxiolytic or antidepressant medications; however, referrals for psychotherapy may be required in some cases. When tension-type headaches occur in children and adolescents, the physician must explore the patient's family and social relationships as well as school performance. In addition to nonhabituating drug therapies, family counseling and biofeedback may be helpful. In coexisting migraine and tension-type headaches, nonhabituating analgesics may be used for the relief of acute pain; the use of ergotamine and triptans should be restricted to relief of the hard or sick headache. Tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors are the gold standards for prophylaxis, although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be indicated in less severe cases. Several forms of biofeedback have also proved effective. Nonetheless, some patients with this form of headache may require psychiatric treatment for severe depression."

We tested the hypothesis that physician and patient characteristics influence cholesterol management.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used a stratified, random sample of 2,332 office-based physicians providing 56,215 visits to adults in the 1991-1992 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys. We investigated physicians' reporting of cholesterol-related screening, counseling or medications during office visits and used multiple logistic regression to assess independent predictors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      An estimated 1.12 billion adult office visits occurred in 1991 and 1992 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18 billion). For the 1.03 billion visits by patients without reported hyperlipidemia, cholesterol screening (2.8% of visits) and counseling (1.2%) were not frequent. The likelihood of screening increased with older age, cardiovascular disease risk factors, white race and private insurance. We estimate that only 1 in 12 adults received cholesterol screening annually. In the 85 million visits by patients with hyperlipidemia, cholesterol testing was reported in 22.9%, cholesterol counseling in 34.4% and lipid-lowering medications in 23.1%. Testing was more likely in diabetic and nonobese patients. Counseling was more likely with younger age, cardiovascular disease and private insurance. Medications use was associated with cardiovascular disease, Northeast region of the United States, nonobese patients and visits to internists. Physician practices did not differ by patient gender.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although clinical conditions strongly influence cholesterol management, the appropriateness of variations noted by payment source, geographic region and physician specialty deserve further evaluation. These variations and the low estimated volume of services suggest that physicians have not fully adopted recommended cholesterol management practices."

            "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, robotic training partner is becoming a reality, which is a substitute for human training partner. Socially anxious individuals feel uncomfortable in front of unfamiliar people or when being observed by others. Playing with robotic training partners can avoid face-to-face interaction with other people. It is unclear whether social anxiety affects the adoption of robotic training partners. This study investigates the effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partners among university students. Study 1 confirmed that university students with higher social anxiety are more likely to choose robotic training partners than human training partners. Mediation analysis in Study 2 supported the mediating role of sense of relaxation with robotic training partner in the positive effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partner. This study shows that developing training partner robots is a meaningful thing for corporate profits and the health of socially anxious people."

No studies have so far tested the effect of human-robot emotional touch on experimentally induced pain ratings, on mood and on oxytocin levels in healthy young adults. Here, we assessed the effect of touching the robot PARO on pain perception, on mood and on salivary oxytocin levels, in 83 young adults. We measured their perceived pain, happiness state, and salivary oxytocin. For the 63 participants in the PARO group, pain was assessed in three conditions: Baseline, Touch (touching PARO) and No-Touch (PARO present). The control group (20 participants) underwent the same measurements without ever encountering PARO. There was a decrease in pain ratings and in oxytocin levels and an increase in happiness ratings compared to baseline only in the PARO group. The Touch condition yielded a larger decrease in pain ratings compared to No-Touch. These effects correlated with the participants' positive perceptions of the interaction with PARO. Participants with higher perceived ability to communicate with PARO experienced a greater hypoalgesic effect when touching PARO. We show that human-robot social touch is effective in reducing pain ratings, improving mood and - surprisingly - reducing salivary oxytocin levels in adults."

Empirical studies do not show uniform results, but it appears that diabetic women experience more frequent sexual dysfunction in general than age-matched healthy controls, independent of the sociocultural environment. The most frequently cited dysfunctions are desire and arousal disorders, such as lubrication difficulties, while orgasmic capacity appears to be less affected. Direct pathophysiological effects on lubrication are proven, but the impact on mental arousal is unclear. The role of diabetic complications is controversial. The comorbidity with depression plays a major role. Individual coping with the disease and the quality of the relationship are also contributing factors. Patients should be encouraged to talk about their sexual problems, as both biomedical and psychosocial factors have to be explored. Therapeutic interventions include basic counseling, biomedical treatment of atrophy and lubrication difficulties, as well as treatment of comorbidities and/or sex therapy."

Great efforts are made to understand the underlying genetical, neurophysiological, and cognitive mechanisms, which eventually may explain the clinical outcome. One tacit assumption of these \"deep rooting\" approaches is that paradigms tap into common and representative aspects of the disorder. Here, we analyzed the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of 121 schizophrenia patients and 75 controls. Using multiple signal processing methods, we extracted 194 EEG features. Sixty-nine out of the 194 EEG features showed a significant difference between patients and controls, indicating that these features detect an important aspect of schizophrenia. Surprisingly, the correlations between these features were very low. We discuss several explanations to our results and propose that complementing \"deep\" with \"shallow\" rooting approaches might help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disorder."

Most of these women can have successful pregnancy when thoroughly informed and instructed on several different issues. Disease activity should be in stable remission prior to pregnancy in order to reduce the chance for flare during pregnancy. To this purpose, medications must be modulated: \"safe\" drugs should be continued throughout pregnancy, embryotoxic/foetotoxic drugs should be withdrawn timely, and beneficial drugs such as low dose aspirin and heparin should be added for prophylaxis of maternal and foetal outcome, especially in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The safety profile of anti-rheumatic drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be kept constantly updated, as new data from inadvertent exposure accumulates and new drugs (especially biological agents) are available. Patients may carry autoantibodies that can negatively affect the baby, being neonatal lupus the prototypical case of passively acquired autoimmunity. Research has been greatly active in this field and more information on risk stratification and management are now available for counselling. The effect of both autoantibodies and drug exposure has been evaluated in the offspring: some concerns about learning disabilities have been raised, but these are treatable conditions that are likely to be overcome. To counsel a woman with SLE/APS during childbearing age means also to deal with contraception. Despite the \"preferred choice\" - combined oral contraceptive - may not be suitable for most of the patients, other options are available and should be offered and discussed with the patient. Fertility is not generally affected in SLE/APS patients, but those cases who require assisted reproduction techniques should be carefully evaluated and managed."

Four key themes developed from the interview data: communication between the patient and the inserter; technique of device insertion; competence of the inserter; and location of the device. These themes informed practical ways that nurses might improve the patient experience, including: consultation with patients regarding device insertion preferences; siting the PVC in locations other than the antecubital fossa and hand; ensuring experienced and confident inserters are available to insert PVCs."

The present pragmatic clinical trial randomized acutely injured trauma survivors who screened positive on an automated electronic medical record PTSD assessment to collaborative care intervention (n = 60) and usual care control (n = 61) conditions. The stepped measurement-based intervention included care management, psychopharmacology, and psychotherapy elements. Embedded within the intervention were a series of information technology (IT) components. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist at baseline prerandomization and again, 1-, 3-, and 6-months postinjury. IT utilization was also assessed. The technology-assisted intervention required a median of 2.25 hours (interquartile range = 1.57 hours) per patient. The intervention was associated with modest symptom reductions, but beyond the margin of statistical significance in the unadjusted model: F(2, 204) = 2.95, p = .055. The covariate adjusted regression was significant: F(2, 204) = 3.06, p = .049.

Two avatars displayed emotional interactions (angry, sad, affectionate, happy) in a \"pictorial\" condition depicting the emotional interactive partners on a screen within a virtual environment and a \"visual\" condition allowing participants to share space with the avatars, thereby enhancing co-presence and agency. Subsequently to stimulus presentation, explicit valence perception and response tendency (i.e. the explicit tendency to avoid or approach the situation) were assessed on rating scales. Implicit responses, i.e. postural and autonomic responses towards the observed interactions were measured by means of postural displacement and changes in skin conductance. Results showed that self-reported presence differed between pictorial and visual conditions, however, it was not correlated with skin conductance responses. Valence perception was only marginally influenced by the virtual condition and not at all by explicit response behavior. There were gender-mediated effects on postural response tendencies as well as gender differences in explicit response behavior but not in valence perception. Exploratory analyses revealed a link between valence perception and preferred behavioral response in women but not in men. We conclude that the display condition seems to influence automatic motivational tendencies but not higher level cognitive evaluations. Moreover, intragroup differences in explicit and implicit response behavior highlight the importance of individual factors beyond gender."

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Male volunteers entered an immersive virtual reality that depicted a party, where they were approached by a lone virtual woman who initiated a conversation. The goal was to study how socially anxious and socially confident men would react to this event. Interest focused on whether the socially anxious participants would exhibit sustained anxiety during the conversation or whether this would diminish over time, and differ from the responses of the more socially confident men.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      The scenario was a party with five virtual characters, four sitting at a distance from the participant and talking amongst themselves and one lone woman standing closer. The woman approached the participant, introduced herself and initiated a conversation that was first about mundane matters and then became more personal and intimate. Participants were men who were either relatively socially confident (18) or socially anxious in their relationships with women (18). A second experimental factor was whether or not the other four characters occasionally looked towards the participant. There was a post-trial questionnaire about social anxiety in relation to the experience, and skin conductance and ECG physiological measures were recorded. Our expectation was that the socially anxious participants would show greater anxiety throughout.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compared to baseline readings both socially confident and socially anxious groups on average showed signs of significantly increased stress at the initial approach of the virtual woman. The stress then diminished once the conversation entered into the mundane phase and then did not significantly change. Comparing pre- and post-questionnaire anxiety scores there was no change for the more confident participants but a significant decrease in average score amongst the anxious group. The methodology of placing socially anxious participants in a virtual reality where they can gain experience of how to act in a stressful situation promises a novel way forward for treating social anxiety."

A total of 94 participants completed a randomized controlled trial in which they were randomized to either customization or no customization version of the app. Customization involved personalizing a virtual avatar and a travel vehicle to one's own preferences and use of one's name throughout the app. Participants completed a 14-day trial using a novel CBT-based mental health app called AirHeart. Self-report scores for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Postintervention survey measures also included usability and avatar identification questionnaires.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 94 enrolled participants, 83 (88%) completed the intervention and postintervention assessments. AirHeart app use significantly reduced symptoms of depression (P=.006) from baseline to the end of the 2-week intervention period for all participants, regardless of the customization condition. However, no differences in depressive symptoms (P=.17) or adherence (P=.80) were observed between the customization (39/83, 47%) and no customization (44/83, 53%) conditions. The frequency of journaling, usefulness of mood tracking, and helpfulness of reminders were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms or adherence (P>.05). Exploratory analyses showed that there were 3 moderate positive correlations between avatar identification and depressive symptoms (identification: r=-0.312, P=.02; connection: r=-0.305, P=.02; and lack of relatability: r=0.338, P=.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results indicate that CBT mental health apps, such as AirHeart, have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms over a short intervention period. The randomized controlled trial results demonstrated that customization of app features, such as avatars, does not further reduce depressive symptoms over and above the CBT modules and standard app features, including journal, reminders, and mood tracking. However, further research elucidating the relationship between virtual avatar identification and mental health systems is needed as society becomes increasingly more digitized. These findings have potential implications for improving the optimization of mental health app designs.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Open Science Framework t28gm; https://osf.io/t28gm."

While there is strong evidence for the efficacy of exposure therapy in VR (VRET) to treat anxiety disorders, new opportunities for using VR to treat mental health disorders are emerging. In this chapter, we first describe the value of VRET for the treatment of several anxiety disorders. Next, we introduce some recent developments in research using VR investigating schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental disorders, and eating disorders. This includes therapeutic strategies beyond VRET, including avatar-based therapies or those combining VR with biofeedback approaches. Although VR offers many convincing advantages, contraindications in treatment must be considered when implementing VR-supported therapy in clinical practice. Finally, we provide an outlook for future research, highlighting the integration of augmented reality and automation processes in VR environments to create more efficient and tailored therapeutic tools. Further, future treatments will benefit from the gamification approach, which integrates elements of computer games and narratives that promote patients' motivation and enables methods to reduce drop-outs during psychological therapy."

The participants were exposed to videos of avatars looking at food and displaying facial expressions with their gaze directed either toward the food only or toward the food and participants consecutively. We recorded eye-tracking responses, heart rate, facial electromyography (zygomatic, corrugator, and levator labii regions), and food wanting/liking. The avatars' joy faces increased the participants' zygomatic reactions and food liking, with mutual eye contact boosting attentional responses. Eye contact also fostered disgust reactions to disliked food, regardless of the avatars' expressions. The findings show that joint attention for food accompanied by face-to-face emotional communication elicits differential attentional and affective responses. The findings appear consistent with the appraisal theories of emotion."

The nature and frequency of psychotic symptoms varies over the course of illness, but in most patients, these symptoms occur more often in the later stages of disease. Management of psychosis requires a comprehensive nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approach, including an accurate assessment of symptoms, awareness of the environment in which they occur, and identification of precipitants and how they affect patients and their caregivers. Nonpharmacologic interventions include counseling the caregiver about the nonintentional nature of the psychotic features and offering coping strategies. Approaches for the patient involve behavior modification; appropriate use of sensory intervention; environmental safety; and maintenance of routines such as providing meals, exercise, and sleep on a consistent basis. Pharmacologic treatments should be governed by a \"start low, go slow\" philosophy; a monosequential approach is recommended, in which a single agent is titrated until the targeted behavior is reduced, side effects become intolerable, or the maximal dosage is achieved. Atypical antipsychotics have the greatest effectiveness and are best tolerated. Second-line medications include typical antipsychotics for short-term therapy; and, less often, anticonvulsants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, antidepressants, and anxiolytics.

Second, the observation of emotional laughing activates a series of subcortical structures known to be related to emotions. Furthermore, a region of interest analysis carried out in these structures reveals a significant modulation of the blood-oxygen-leveldependent (BOLD) signal during the processing of different vitality forms exclusively in the right amygdala, right anterior thalamus/hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray.

DP patients showed a lower frequency of 'good' mood and a higher frequency of 'bad' mood than CTs when using the MoMo device. However, although the two depressed populations showed comparable scores on these validated scales, CB-DP patients showed impaired self-awareness of the mood experience in 'the here and now', as evidenced by the absence of significant differences, compared with CTs, in the subjective mood evaluation performed with the MoMo device.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The number of CB patients and inhomogeneity across MRI scans were study limitations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Cerebellar dysfunction might slow the data integration necessary for mood state awareness, resulting in difficulty of depressed CB patients in explicitly recognizing their mood \"in the here and now\"."

            "abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection, which responds well to antibiotic therapy in the overwhelming majority of cases. However, despite adequate antibiotic treatment some patients report persisting symptoms which are commonly summarised as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). In 2005, the Swiss Society of Infectious Diseases published a case definition for PTLDS. We aimed to review the scientific literature with a special emphasis on the last 10 years, questioning whether the definitions from 2005 are still valid in the light of current knowledge. Furthermore, we describe the clinical history of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the estimated prevalence of PTLDS, the possible pathogenesis of PTLDS, and treatment options with an emphasis on clinical studies. In summary, we were unable to find a scientific reason for modification of the PTLDS definitions published in 2005. Thus, the diagnostic criteria remain unchanged, namely documented clinical and laboratory evidence of previous infection with B. burgdorferi, a completed course of appropriate antibiotic therapy, symptoms including fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, cognitive dysfunction or radicular pain persisting for >6 months, a plausible timely association between documented B. burgdorferi infection and onset of symptoms (i.e., persistent or recurrent symptoms that began within 6 months of completion of a recommended antibiotic therapy for early or late Lyme borreliosis), and exclusion of other somatic or psychiatric causes of symptoms. The main therapeutic options remain cognitive behavioural therapy and low-impact aerobic exercise programmes. Growing and unequivocal evidence confirms that prolonged or repeated antibiotic therapy for PTLDS is not beneficial, but potentially harmful and therefore contraindicated. The Guidelines of the Swiss Society of Infectious Diseases offer an evidence based, diagnostic and therapeutic framework for physicians caring for patients suffering from presumptive PTLDS in Switzerland."

            "abstract": "Visual backward masking (VBM) deficits are candidate endophenotypes of schizophrenia indexing genetic liability of the disorder. In VBM, a target is followed by a mask that deteriorates target perception. Schizophrenia patients and, to a lesser extent, their unaffected relatives show strong and reproducible VBM deficits. In patients, VBM deficits are associated with strongly decreased amplitudes in the evoked-related potentials (ERPs). Here, to unveil the neural mechanisms of VBM in schizophrenia, circumventing illness-specific confounds, we investigated the electroencephalogram correlates of VBM in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. We tested 110 schizophrenia patients, 60 siblings, and 83 healthy controls. As in previous studies, patients showed strong behavioral deficits and decreased ERP amplitudes compared to controls. Surprisingly, the ERP amplitudes of siblings were even higher than the ones of controls, while their performances were similar. ERP amplitudes in siblings were found to correlate with performance. These results suggest that VBM is deteriorated in patients and siblings. However, siblings, unlike patients, can partially compensate for the deficits by over-activating a network of brain regions."

From November 2000 through August 2003, 33 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic (n = 14) and robotic (n = 19) adrenalectomy. Data were obtained prospectively during management and by patient questionnaire (SF36, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) preoperatively and postoperatively, at day 4 and at 6 weeks. Physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, and bodily pain (Physical SF36 scores) were decreased at day 4 (p = 0.004) in all patients when compared to preoperative levels; and became similar to preoperative levels after 6 weeks. Patients who underwent robotic adrenalectomy had an increased score at 6 weeks of role limitations due to emotional problems (Mental SF36 score) (p = 0.03). No other significant difference was observed between patients after laparoscopic or robotic adrenalectomy. Although state anxiety was decreased postoperatively at day 4 and at 6 weeks (p = 0.01) in all patients, there was no significant difference between laparoscopic and robotic adrenalectomy. Postoperative pain was similar in both groups but had a tendency to be higher when patients underwent a left adrenalectomy (p = 0.07). Similarly, state anxiety had a tendency to be higher postoperatively at day 4 in patients after left adrenalectomies (p = 0.06). This study provides an evaluation of perioperative quality of life in patients after minimally invasive (laparoscopic and/or robotic) adrenalectomy. We observed no major difference between patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic adrenalectomy. Thus, patients' perioperative quality of life is not a justifiable parameter on which to base promotion of robotic adrenalectomies."

Primary outcomes include the proportion of women who reach a postpartum weight goal and total weight change. Secondary outcomes include postpartum glycemia, blood pressure, depression, percent of calories from fat, total caloric intake and physical activity levels.

The utility of the approach is demonstrated for two data sets from two different cultures and languages, based on corpora of vocal emotion enactment by professional actors and emotion inference by naïve listeners. Lens model equations, hierarchical regression, and multivariate path analysis are used to compare the relative contributions of objectively measured acoustic cues in the enacted expressions and subjective voice cues as perceived by listeners to the variance in emotion inference from vocal expressions for four emotion families (fear, anger, happiness, and sadness). While the results confirm the central role of arousal in vocal emotion communication, the utility of applying an extended path modeling framework is demonstrated by the identification of unique combinations of distal cues and proximal percepts carrying information about specific emotion families, independent of arousal. The statistical models generated show that more sophisticated acoustic parameters need to be developed to explain the distal underpinnings of subjective voice quality percepts that account for much of the variance in emotion inference, in particular voice instability and roughness. The general approach advocated here, as well as the specific results, open up new research strategies for work in psychology (specifically emotion and social perception research) and engineering and computer science (specifically research and development in the domain of affective computing, particularly on automatic emotion detection and synthetic emotion expression in avatars)."

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a cardiac adverse drug reaction is a multifactorial symptomatic disorder, the development of which is influenced by modifying factors (APs' dose, duration of APs therapy, APs polytherapy, and monotherapy, etc.) and non-modifying factors (genetic predisposition, gender, age, etc.). The genetic predisposition to AP-induced LQTS may be due to several causes, including causal mutations in the genes responsible for monoheme forms of LQTS, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the candidate genes encoding voltage-dependent ion channels expressed both in the brain and in the heart, and SNVs of candidate genes encoding key enzymes of APs metabolism. This narrative review summarizes the results of genetic studies on AP-induced LQTS and proposes a new personalized approach to assessing the risk of its development (low, moderate, high).

Genetic and environmental factors increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, and substance use disorder (particularly cannabis) may have the strongest link. Schizophrenia typically develops in young adulthood and is characterized by the presence of positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms include blunted affect, alogia, avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Symptoms must be present for at least six months and be severe for at least one month to make a diagnosis. Because schizophrenia is debilitating, it should be treated with antipsychotics, and early treatment decreases long-term disability. Treatment should be individualized, and monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects is important. Patients with a first episode of psychosis who receive a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia should be treated in a coordinated specialty care program. Second-generation antipsychotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they cause fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients with schizophrenia who are treated with second-generation antipsychotics are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and should receive at least annual metabolic screening and counseling with interventions to prevent weight gain and encourage smoking cessation. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia should be treated with clozapine. Adjunctive treatments include electroconvulsive therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis.

However, linkage rates across the HIV treatment cascade are typically low and little is known about what might facilitate or hinder care-seeking behavior. This qualitative study was conducted within a home-based HIV counseling and testing (HBHCT) intervention in South Africa. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 HBHCT clients who tested HIV positive to explore what influenced their care-seeking behavior. A set of field notes for 196 additional HBHCT clients who tested HIV positive at home were also reviewed and analyzed. Content analysis showed that linkage to care is influenced by a myriad of factors at the individual, relationship, community, and health system levels. These factors subtly interact and at times reinforce each other. While some factors such as belief in test results, coping ability, social support, and prior experiences with the health system affect clients' desire and motivation to seek care, others such as limited time and resources affect their agency to do so.

Primary nocturnal enuresis is caused by a disparity between bladder capacity and nocturnal urine production and failure of the child to awaken in response to a full bladder. Less commonly, enuresis is secondary to a medical, psychological, or behavioral problem. A diagnosis usually can be made with a history focusing on enuresis and a physical examination followed by urinalysis. Imaging and urodynamic studies generally are not needed unless specifically indicated (e.g., to exclude suspected neurologic or urologic disease). Primary nocturnal enuresis almost always resolves spontaneously over time. Treatment should be delayed until the child is able and willing to adhere to the treatment program; medications are rarely indicated in children younger than seven years. If the condition is not distressing to the child, treatment is not needed. However, parents should be reassured about their child's physical and emotional health and counseled about eliminating guilt, shame, and punishment. Enuresis alarms are effective in children with primary nocturnal enuresis and should be considered for older, motivated children from cooperative families when behavioral measures are unsuccessful. Desmopressin is most effective in children with nocturnal polyuria and normal bladder capacity. Patients respond to desmopressin more quickly than to alarm systems.

An innovative methodological approach that has shown great promise in the study of chronic health problems characterized by reported temporal and/or situational variability in symptoms and distress is known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA involves the real-time measurement of states, situational factors, and symptoms by individuals as they go about their day-to-day activities. The objective of this pilot investigation was to explore the feasibility of using EMA methods to examine within- and between-day effects of tinnitus.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      This study was conducted in three phases: (1) design and development of an EMA methodology that could be used to assess effects of tinnitus; (2) refinement of the methodology through the use of two focus groups; and (3) field-test the methodology with individuals who experienced bothersome tinnitus. For Phase 3, each of the 24 participants wore, throughout their waking hours for 2 weeks, a personal digital assistant that produced alerts four times a day. The alerts prompted participants to respond to 19 questions, including 9 relating to situational and mood factors and 10 comprising the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory-Screening version (THI-S). To evaluate for potential reactive effects of performing the EMA protocol, each participant completed the paper-and-pencil version of the full 25-item THI before and after the 2-week EMA period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants responded to the alerts with a 90% compliance rate, providing a total of 1210 completed surveys. At the time of their response, participants indicated that they were in their house or apartment (67.7%), alone (50.2%), happy (50%), and calm (54.5%). Across most responses, participants could hear their tinnitus (97%), and the loudness of their tinnitus averaged 4.7 on a 7-point increasing-loudness scale. The mean THI-S index score (out of a possible maximum 40 points for greatest tinnitus severity) was 17.0 (moderate self-perceived tinnitus handicap).

There has been little direct comparison of cultural differences between countries and the effect any differences may exert on the outcome of caregiver interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      The aims of the three-country study (USA, Australia and the UK) were to assess whether caregiver interventions can still be successful when anti-dementia drugs are provided to patients, and whether a caregiver intervention can be successfully implemented using the same methods in three different English-speaking countries. In this paper, the cultural differences and similarities between the three countries are examined.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Randomised, controlled trial involving 158 patients and their caregivers (divided equally across three centres, New York, Sydney and Manchester) with all the patients receiving donepezil and the caregivers randomised to a caregiver intervention or treatment as usual.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were few differences between countries in the main outcome measures, and no differences between the treatment-as-usual group and the intervention, but interesting cultural nuances were observed between groups. Despite these differences, the caregiver intervention was associated with positive results on caregiver depression across all the countries.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This first multinational carer intervention study has emphasised the similarities between the three countries whilst highlighting crucial differences which may be important when planning cross-cultural studies in the future. The positive results achieved on caregiver depression were replicated across the three centres."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The positive effects of both antipsychotic medication and cognitive behavioral therapy in psychosis (CBTp) for people who are distressed by their experience of hearing voices remain limited. As a result, there has been a recent surge in talk-based individual approaches. Many of these continue not to be very well known nor implemented in practice. Some of the approaches may focus more on understanding and dealing constructively with voices, an element that has been identified as potentially helpful by voice hearers. Existing barriers to a wider implementation include both the widespread pathologization of hearing voices and a lack of mental health professionals who have been trained and trusted to carry out these new interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This scoping review aimed to identify and describe a current synthesis of talk-based individual approaches for people who hear voices, including studies independently of method of study or approach, diagnosis of voice hearers nor of the professional background of interventionists.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Nine different talk-based approaches were identified. These included: (1) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp); (2) AVATAR therapy; (3) Making Sense of Voices (MsV) aka Experience Focused Counselling (EFC); (4) Relating Therapy; (5) Acceptance and Commitment Therapy; (6) Smartphone-based Coping-focused Intervention; (7) Prolonged and Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; (8) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and (9) Individual Mindfulness-based Program for Voice Hearing. The different approaches differed greatly in relation to the number of sessions, length of time offered and the scientific evidence on efficacy. Psychologists represented the main professional group of interventionists. CBTp and the MsV/EFC approach also included health professionals, like nurses, as implementers. Most of the approaches showed positive outcomes in relation to voice related distress levels. None identified overall or voice specific deteriorations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There appears to be a strong case for the implementation of a broader heterogeneity of approaches in practice. This would also be in line with recommendations for recovery focused services and requirements of voice hearers. A greater emphasis on whole systems implementation and thus the involvement of frontline staff, like nurses, in the delivery of these approaches would likely reduce the research-practice implementation gap."

            "abstract": "Character customization is a prominent feature in digital games, affording users the ability to tailor one's virtual self-representation (avatar) to match aspects of their actual or ideal self, influencing psychological well-being. The mental health implications of character customization can be partially explained by self-discrepancy theory, which argues that achieving congruence with one's avatar reduces cognitive dissonance. However, the role of undesirable self-concepts such as mental health ailments have largely been overlooked in this context despite forming part of one's identity. In theory, customization of an avatar representing undesirable self-concepts presents a self-regulatory paradox: individuals desire to reduce discrepancies with a self-representation, yet they also desire to enlarge discrepancies with a disliked-self. To reconcile this, two experiments explored the psychological implications of imbuing avatars with undesirable self-concepts. In Study 1 (N = 90), participants customized an avatar to represent anxiety within themselves (i.e., an anxiety avatar). Customization significantly reduced state anxiety compared to a control group, supporting the proposed discrepancy-reduction mechanism. Study 2 (N = 122) employed a 2 (customization: yes, no) × 2 (destruction: yes, no) between-subjects design, with participants either destroying or observing an anxiety avatar. Destruction of customized anxiety avatars resulted in the largest reduction in anxiety among all conditions, supporting the proposed discrepancy-enlargement mechanism. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of avatar-based e-mental health interventions are discussed."

Decisional conflict was assessed using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) among pregnant women considering antidepressant medication treatment (N = 40). Overall DCS and subscale scores were compared between women who were antidepressant users and non-users. Semi-structured interviews (N = 10) explored barriers and facilitators of decision-making. Twenty-one women (52 %) had moderate or high decisional conflict (DCS ≥ 25). Overall DCS scores did not differ between groups, but antidepressant use was associated with feeling more adequately informed (subscale mean 17.5, SD 17.9 vs. 42.1, SD 23.8, p = 0.001) and clear about values (subscale mean 16.7, SD 15.1 vs. 29.8, SD 24.0, p = 0.043). Barriers to decision-making were (1) difficulty weighing maternal versus infant health, (2) lack of high quality information, (3) negative external influences, and (4) emotional reactions to decision-making. Facilitators were (1) interpersonal supports, (2) accessible subspecialty care, and (3) severe depressive symptoms. Many pregnant women facing decisions regarding antidepressant medication use experience decisional conflict. Interventions that provide accurate information, assistance with weighing risks and benefits of treatment, management of problematic external influences, and emotional support may reduce decisional conflict and facilitate the decision-making process."

Argentina was one of the first Latin American countries to guarantee HIV prevention, diagnosis and comprehensive care services, including antiretroviral medication, which removed cost and access as barriers. Yet, dropout occurs at every stage of the HIV continuum. An estimated 110,000 individuals are HIV-infected in Argentina; of these, 70% have been diagnosed and 54% were linked to care. However, only 36% have achieved viral suppression and 31% of those diagnosed delayed entry to care. To achieve meaningful reductions in HIV infection at the community level, innovative strategies must be developed to re-engage patients. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach and has been used by therapists in Central and South America to enhance motivation and commitment in substance use and risk reduction. Our pilot feasibility study utilized culturally tailored MI in physicians to target patients not retained in treatment in public and private clinics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Results demonstrated that a physician-based MI intervention was feasible and effective in enhanced and sustained patient adherence, viral suppression, and patient-physician communication and attitudes about treatment among these patients at 6 and 9 months post baseline.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This clinical trial seeks to extend these findings in public and private clinics in four urban population centers in Argentina, in which clinics (n = 6 clinics, six MDs per clinic site) are randomized to experimental (physician MI Intervention) (n = 3) or control (physician Standard of Care) (n = 3) conditions in a 3:3 ratio.

            "abstract": "Psychological distress often causes suffering in terminally ill patients and their families and poses challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Increased attention to diagnosis and treatment of depression can improve the coping mechanisms of patients and families. This paper reviews the clinical characteristics of normal grief and clinical depression and explains strategies for differential diagnosis. Although some literature discusses the psychological issues facing elderly patients and terminally ill patients with cancer, less is known about patients with end-stage pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and neurologic disease. Data on the effectiveness of interventions in terminally ill patients are lacking. Treatment recommendations in this paper represent extrapolations from existing literature and expert opinion. Diagnosing and treating depression in terminally ill patients involve unique challenges. Evidence of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt, and suicidal ideation are better indicators of depression in this context than neurovegetative symptoms. Although terminally ill patients often have suicidal thoughts, they are usually fleeting. Sustained suicidal ideation should prompt a comprehensive evaluation. Clinicians should have a low threshold for treating depression in terminally ill patients. Psychostimulants, because of their rapid onset of action, are useful agents and are generally well tolerated. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants may also be used. Psychological interventions-including eliciting concerns and conveying the potential for connection, meaning, reconciliation, and closure in the dying process-can also facilitate coping."

The Lokomat is a robotic that has been used widely for gait rehabilitation in several movement disorders, especially in the acute and subacute phases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of gait robotic rehabilitation in patients affected by chronic stroke. Psychological impact was also taken into consideration. Thirty patients (13 women and 17 men) affected by chronic stroke entered the study. All participants underwent neurological examination with respect to ambulation, Ashworth, Functional Independence Measure, and Tinetti scales to assess their physical status, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Psychological General Well-being Index, and Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced to evaluate the Lokomat-related psychological impact before and after either a conventional treatment or the robotic training. During each rehabilitation period (separated by a no-treatment period), patients underwent a total of 40 1 h training sessions (i.e. five times a week for 8 weeks). After the conventional treatment, the patients did not achieve a significant improvement in the functional status, except balance (P<0.001) and walking ability (P<0.01), as per the Tinetti scale. Indeed, after the robotic rehabilitation, significant improvements were detected in almost all the motor and psychological scales that we investigated, particularly for Psychological General Well-being Index and Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced. Manual and robotic-assisted body weight-supported treadmill training optimizes the sensory inputs relevant to step training, repeated practice, as well as neuroplasticity. Several controlled trials have shown a superior effect of Lokomat treatment in stroke patients' walking ability and velocity in particular. Therefore, our preliminary results proved that active robotic training not only facilitates gait and physical function but also the psychological status, even in patients affected by chronic stroke."

Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations, with high participant satisfaction. Therefore, mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness, with future research in establishing efficacy, cost effectiveness, and ethical and safety protocols."

Bayesian and predictive processing are promising approaches for computational modeling of the \"active self\". We evaluate their implementation and challenges in computational psychiatry and cognitive developmental robotics. We describe how and why embodied robotic systems provide a valuable tool in psychiatry to assess, validate, and simulate mechanisms of self-disorders. Specifically, mechanisms involving sensorimotor learning, prediction, and self-other distinction, can be assessed with artificial agents.

The use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) increases not only the risk for venous thromboembolism, but also for arterial thromboembolism. The risk for thromboembolism is the same for non-oral CHC (patches, vaginal rings) as for oral CHC. Risk factors such as age >35, obesity, smoking and a positive family history need to be recognized and considered in contraceptive counselling. Elaborate information concerning risks and benefits is mandatory. This applies to first-time as well as long-term users. Careful investigation of the history is required, and the risk factors need to be re-evaluated at yearly prescription. It is also very important to inform the patients about the early symptoms of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, so that therapy can be started immediately. Apart from these risks, CHC may have beneficial effects on organs such as the ovaries, the endometrium and the general well-being for many women. When prescribing a CHC for the first time or when changing to another preparation, one should always weigh up whether certain benefits justify prescribing a preparation with a slightly higher risk of thrombosis compared to the second-generation pill or preparations with Estradiol/Nomegestrolacetat. Women who are already using a third-generation pill or a pill with drospirenone or cyproterone acetate and feel comfortable with it do not need to switch to another preparation (provided no new risk factors have arisen). For women with increased risks, i.e. several relative contraindications or one absolute contraindication, safe alternatives to CHC include progestogen-only preparations, intrauterine devices containing copper or levonorgestrel or, after family planning has been completed, surgical methods (sterilisation/vasectomy)."

A multidisciplinary team developed the first version of the app via five face-to-face meetings. After app launch, a second qualitative study of 21 patients and a users' test of 13 patients and 3 rheumatologists led to the app's current version. The number of app installations, current users and comments were collected from the Google Play store and the Apple store.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The qualitative study revealed needs for counselling, patient-health professional partnership, and skills to cope with risk situations; 86.8% participants would be ready to use an app primarily on their rheumatologist's recommendation. Six functionalities were implemented: a safety checklist before treatment administration, aids in daily life situations based on the French academic recommendations, treatment reminders, global well-being self-assessment, periodic counselling messages, and a diary. The Hiboot app was installed 20,500 times from September 2017 to October 2020, with 4300 regular current users.

Antipsychotic drugs are an important part of the treatment of psychotic illnesses; however, their safety with pregnant or breastfeeding women has not been fully established. Given that these drugs will be ordered for pregnant or breastfeeding women diagnosed with a psychosis or with a pre-existing psychiatric condition, it is imperative that mental health nurses and others administering the drugs, or caring for those taking the drugs, be aware of their consequences. A review of the available evidence, albeit at times contradictory, is presented along with a discussion of the implications for mental health nurses. Recommendations for consideration when administering or counselling women regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs in pregnancy or when breastfeeding, are also included."

            "abstract": "The analysis of human facial expressions from the thermal images captured by the Infrared Thermal Imaging (IRTI) cameras has recently gained importance compared to images captured by the standard cameras using light having a wavelength in the visible spectrum. It is because infrared cameras work well in low-light conditions and also infrared spectrum captures thermal distribution that is very useful for building systems like Robot interaction systems, quantifying the cognitive responses from facial expressions, disease control, etc. In this paper, a deep learning model called IRFacExNet (InfraRed Facial Expression Network) has been proposed for facial expression recognition (FER) from infrared images. It utilizes two building blocks namely Residual unit and Transformation unit which extract dominant features from the input images specific to the expressions. The extracted features help to detect the emotion of the subjects in consideration accurately. The Snapshot ensemble technique is adopted with a Cosine annealing learning rate scheduler to improve the overall performance. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated on a publicly available dataset, namely IRDatabase developed by RWTH Aachen University. The facial expressions present in the dataset are Fear, Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. The proposed model produces 88.43% recognition accuracy, better than some state-of-the-art methods considered here for comparison. Our model provides a robust framework for the detection of accurate expression in the absence of visible light."

            "abstract": "Smokers attempting to quit often attribute smoking relapse to negative affect, craving, and other nicotine withdrawal symptoms. In addition, there is evidence that smoking relapse can increase these symptoms, particularly negative affect. To address this issue, we analyzed data from an 11-week smoking cessation clinical trial in which smokers (n = 1,246) were randomized to receive either nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, or placebo, combined with behavioral counseling. Using cross-lagged analyses, we examined the temporal bidirectional relationships between self-reported measures of affect, craving, and composite withdrawal symptoms and biochemically verified smoking abstinence. The relative strength of these temporal relationships was examined by comparing the explained variances of the models. The results showed that higher negative affect, craving, and composite withdrawal symptoms increased the likelihood of subsequent smoking relapse, and that smoking relapse led to subsequent increases in these same symptoms. A comparison of the explained variances found symptom predicting subsequent relapse models to be stronger than those where relapse predicted subsequent symptoms. Although the explained variance findings generally support a negative reinforcement conceptualization of nicotine dependence, the bidirectional relationship between symptoms and smoking relapse suggests that struggling with quitting smoking leads to significant negative affect, craving, and other withdrawal symptoms that do not quickly resolve. These findings highlight the importance of addressing specific symptoms within the context of smoking cessation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

Patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiotherapy were randomly assigned to the nutritional counseling group (n = 32, 52.45%) and the control group (n = 29, 47.54%) according to their treatment patterns. In the nutritional counseling group, registered dietitians provided face-to-face counseling during the antineoplastic treatment course at least every two weeks. Nutrient intake amount, relevant nutritional indexes, quality of life, and the degree of anxiety and depression were compared between the two groups. We observed a decrease in the calorie and protein intake amount in both groups, while the decrease in the control group is even worse. The weight loss is more obvious in the control group. The HADS scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The level of serum total protein, serum albumin, transferrin, and the thickness of the triceps skin fold decreased less in the intervention group (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that nutrition counseling is essential for the maintenance of calorie and protein intake in HNC suffers, which contributes to an improvement in the physical and psychological states.

We have operationalized social perception as the ratings of strangeness for different avatars in a virtual reality study. The use of avatars ensured maximal control over the interlocutor's behaviour and a clear dimension along which to manipulate social perceptions toward this interlocutor. Our results suggest an inverted U-shaped curve in structural priming magnitude for passives as a function of strangeness: the participants showed the largest priming effects for the intermediately strange, with a decrease when interacting with the least- or most-strange avatars. The relationship between social perception and priming magnitude may thus be non-linear. There seems to be a 'happy medium' in strangeness, evoking the largest priming effect.

Informed by literacy theorists who have argued convincingly that narrators address different audiences in different ways, we used IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing software (IBM Watson NLP) to examine how users' expression of emotion on a well-being app differed depending on the audience. Our findings demonstrate that audience was strongly associated with the way users' expressed emotions in writing.

            "abstract": "The ability to recognize and adequately interpret emotional states in others plays a fundamental role in regulating social interaction. Body language presents an essential element of nonverbal communication which is often perceived prior to mimic expression. However, the neural networks that underlie the processing of emotionally expressive body movement and body posture are poorly understood. 33 healthy subjects have been investigated using the optically based imaging method functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the performance of a newly developed emotion discrimination paradigm consisting of faceless avatars expressing fearful, angry, sad, happy or neutral gait patterns. Participants were instructed to judge (a) the presented emotional state (emotion task) and (b) the observed walking speed of the respective avatar (speed task). We measured increases in cortical oxygenated haemoglobin (O2HB) in response to visual stimulation during emotion discrimination. These O2HB concentration changes were enhanced for negative emotions in contrast to neutral gait sequences in right occipito-temporal and left temporal and temporo-parietal brain regions. Moreover, fearful and angry bodies elicited higher activation increases during the emotion task compared to the speed task. Haemodynamic responses were correlated with a number of behavioural measures, whereby a positive relationship between emotion regulation strategy preference and O2HB concentration increases after sad walks was mediated by the ability to accurately categorize sad walks. Our results support the idea of a distributed brain network involved in the recognition of bodily emotion expression that comprises visual association areas as well as body/movement perception specific cortical regions that are also sensitive to emotion. This network is activated less when the emotion is not intentionally processed (i.e. during the speed task). Furthermore, activity of this perceptive network is, mediated by the ability to correctly recognize emotions, indirectly connected to active emotion regulation processes. We conclude that a full understanding of emotion perception and its neural substrate requires the investigation of dynamic representations and means of expression other than the face."

As theoretical approaches to underlying processes (i.e., automatic motor mimicry, communicative intent, and emotional appraisal) make different predictions about whether facial responses to others' facial expressions are influenced by perceived gaze behavior, we examined the impact of gaze direction and dynamic facial expressions on observers' autonomic and rapid facial reactions (RFRs). We recorded facial electromyography activity over 4 muscle regions (Corrugator Supercilli, Zygomaticus Major, Lateral Frontalis, and Depressor Anguli Oris), skin conductance response and heart rate changes in participants passively exposed to virtual characters displaying approach-oriented (anger and happiness), and avoidance-oriented (fear and sadness) emotion expressions with gaze either directed at or averted from the observer. Consistent with appraisal theories, RFRs were potentiated by mutual eye contact when participants viewed happy and angry expressions, while RFRs occurred only to fear expressions with averted gaze. RFRs to sad expressions were not affected by gaze direction. The interaction between emotional expressions and gaze direction was moderated by participants' gender. The pattern of autonomic reactivity was consistent with the view that salient social stimuli increase physiological arousal and attentional resources, with gaze direction, nature of emotion, and gender having moderating effects. These results suggest the critical role of self-relevance appraisal of senders' contextual perceptual cues and individual characteristics to account for interpersonal matching of facial displays."

He is responsible for futile overtreatment as well as for successful treatment. Today, in futile situations in the intensive care unit (ICU), it is possible to change the goal from curative treatment to palliative care. This is a consequent further development from critical care medicine. In end-of-life situations in the intensive care unit, emotional care and empathy are mandatory using intensive dialogues with the family. Despite great workload stress enough time for such conversation should be taken, because the physician will generously be repaid by the way he sees his medical activity.

Twenty-eight participants of the topiramate group (52.8%) and 25 participants of the placebo group (47.2%) completed the study. Averaged over the trial period, there was no significant difference between groups on the mean percentages of heavy drinking days [1.96 (-1.62 to 5.54), p=.28]. Log rank survival analysis found no difference of time to first day of heavy drinking between topiramate and placebo groups (61.8 vs. 57.5 days, respectively; χ(2)=0.61, d.f.=1, p=.81). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      By using a conservative model for data analysis, we could not detect the effectiveness of topiramate in this particular population.

            "abstract": "Research concerning the complex interplay between factors that contribute to poor social functioning in schizophrenia has been hampered by limitations of traditional measures, most notably the ecological validity and accuracy of retrospective self-report and interview measures. Computerized Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAc) permits the real-time assessment of relationships between daily life experiences, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In the current study, EMAc was used to record daily social interactions, subjective performance appraisals of these interactions (e.g., \"I succeeded/failed\"; \"I was liked/rejected\"), and affect in 145 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants completed electronic questionnaires on a personal digital assistant (PDA) four times per day for one week. Time-lagged multilevel modeling of the data revealed that more positive interaction appraisals at any point in a day were associated with greater positive affect which, in turn, was a strong predictor of more social interactions over subsequent hours. Social functioning, therefore, was linked to positive performance beliefs about social interactions that were associated with greater positive affect. The findings suggest a useful treatment target for cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychosocial interventions that can be used to challenge defeatist beliefs and increase positive affect to enhance social functioning in schizophrenia."

            "abstract": "The partial volume effect (PVE) arises in volumetric images when more than one tissue type occurs in a voxel. In such cases, the voxel intensity depends not only on the imaging sequence and tissue properties, but also on the proportions of each tissue type present in the voxel. We have demonstrated in previous work that ignoring this effect by establishing binary voxel-based segmentations introduces significant errors in quantitative measurements, such as estimations of the volumes of brain structures. In this paper, we provide a statistical estimation framework to quantify PVE and to propagate voxel-based estimates in order to compute global magnitudes, such as volume, with associated estimates of uncertainty. Validation is performed on ground truth synthetic images and MRI phantoms, and a clinical study is reported. Results show that the method allows for robust morphometric studies and provides resolution unattainable to date."

Generally, social skills training designed to help patients develop social skills includes role-playing, but this form of training has typical shortcomings, which are largely due to a trainer's difficulties to project emotion. Virtual reality (VR)-based techniques have the potential to solve these difficulties, because they provide a computer-generated but realistic three-dimensional world and humanlike avatars that can provide emotional stimuli. In this paper, we report on a method of implementing virtual environments (VEs) in order to train people with schizophrenia to develop conversational skills in specific situations, which could overcome the shortcomings of or complement conventional role-playing techniques.

For human-computer collaboration, data-driven animation, and communication between humans and robots to be successful, the capacity to recognize emotional states in facial expressions must be developed and implemented. Recently published studies have found that deep learning is becoming increasingly popular in the field of image categorization. As a result, to resolve the problem of facial expression recognition (FER) using convolutional neural networks (CNN), increasingly substantial efforts have been made in recent years. Facial expressions may be acquired from databases like CK+ and JAFFE using this novel FER technique based on activations, optimizations, and regularization parameters. The model recognized emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and neutrality. The performance of the model was evaluated using a variety of methodologies, including activation, optimization, and regularization, as well as other hyperparameters, as detailed in this study. In experiments, the FER technique may be used to recognize emotions with an Adam, Softmax, and Dropout Ratio of 0.1 to 0.2 when combined with other techniques. It also outperforms current FER techniques that rely on handcrafted features and only one channel, as well as has superior network performance compared to the present state-of-the-art techniques."

Thus, it is not surprising that we are highly skilled at recognizing the emotions of others. Here we aimed to examine the neuronal correlates of emotion recognition from gait. To this end we created highly controlled dynamic body-movement stimuli based on real human motion-capture data (Roether et al., 2009). These animated avatars displayed gait in four emotional (happy, angry, fearful, and sad) and speed-matched neutral styles. For each emotional gait and its equivalent neutral gait, avatars were displayed at five morphing levels between the two. Subjects underwent fMRI scanning while classifying the emotions and the emotional intensity levels expressed by the avatars. Our results revealed robust brain selectivity to emotional compared to neutral gait stimuli in brain regions which are involved in emotion and biological motion processing, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the amygdala (AMG). Brain activity in the amygdala reflected emotional awareness: for visually identical stimuli it showed amplified stronger response when the stimulus was perceived as emotional. Notably, in avatars gradually morphed along an emotional expression axis there was a parametric correlation between amygdala activity and emotional intensity. This study extends the mapping of emotional decoding in the human brain to the domain of highly controlled dynamic biological motion. Our results highlight an extensive level of brain processing of emotional information related to body language, which relies mostly on body kinematics."

Which combination of people's desires should a decision-maker serve? To provide a potential answer, we turned to psychology: What do people think is best when multiple people have different utilities over options? We developed a quantitative model of what people consider desirable behavior, characterizing participants' preferences by inferring which combination of \"metrics\" (maximax, maxsum, maximin, or inequality aversion [IA]) best explained participants' decisions in a drink-choosing task. We found that participants' behavior was best described by the maximin metric, describing the desire to maximize the happiness of the worst-off person, though participant behavior was also consistent with maximizing group utility (the maxsum metric) and the IA metric to a lesser extent. Participant behavior was consistent across variation in the agents involved and tended to become more maxsum-oriented when participants were told they were players in the task (Experiment 1). In later experiments, participants maintained maximin behavior across multi-step tasks rather than shortsightedly focusing on the individual steps therein (Experiment 2, Experiment 3). By repeatedly asking participants what choices they would hope for in an optimal, just decision-maker, and carefully disambiguating which quantitative metrics describe these nuanced choices, we help constrain the space of what behavior we desire in leaders, artificial intelligence systems helping decision-makers, and the assistive robots and decision-makers of the future."

The results showed that females induced stronger TF power and PLI values than males in only the alpha band over the whole brain regarding the vMMN.

            "abstract": "Blood platelets accumulate, store and release a variety of biogenic amines including norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine (DA) which are known to act as neurotransmitter substances. Platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) shares many biochemical properties with the mitochondrial MAO present in brain tissue. For these reasons it has been suggested that platelets might serve as a diagnostic and research model for nerve cells in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In some patients with schizophrenia and manic depressive phychoses, platelet MAO activity is significantly decreased. Central nervous system inhibition of MAO could lead to excess accumulation of monoamines in the brain; this would be consistent with the DA hypothesis of schizophrenia. Disturbances of monoamines and enzyme kinetics in the hereditary ataxias and in Huntington disease have been described, but these findings are unproven and controversal. If platelet models for human neuropsychiatric disease can be established, they will be immensely important in preclinical diagnosis, therapy and genetic counseling."

            "abstract": "To provide effective counseling for patients receiving drug therapy for depression, one must understand the natural course of mood disorders, the appropriate dose and duration of antidepressant therapy, and how to individualize the discussion of potential adverse effects and use of alcohol. Patients must understand that effective antidepressant treatment requires several weeks before onset of clinical effect, and 6-12 months of therapy is necessary to prevent relapse. Discussion of adverse effects must address what the patient should do if an adverse effect occurs, with the focus on common, expectable effects of the particular drug. Rather than merely telling patients not to drink alcohol, appropriate counseling should focus on the possible consequences of drinking while taking antidepressant drugs."

While prior works leveraged the role of pupil response for screening ASD, limited works have been carried out to find the influence of emotion stimuli on pupil response for ASD screening. We, in this paper, design, develop, and evaluate a light-weight LSTM (Long-short Term Memory) model that captures pupil responses (pupil diameter, fixation duration, and fixation location) based on the social interaction with a virtual agent and detects ASD sessions based on short interactions. Our findings demonstrate that all the pupil responses vary significantly in the ASD sessions in response to the different emotion (angry, happy, neutral) stimuli applied. These findings reinforce the ASD screening with an average accuracy of 77%, while the accuracy improves further (>80%) with respect to angry and happy emotion stimuli."

The present study combined cue-reactivity with ecological momentary assessment (CREMA) to evaluate smokers' cue reactions in natural environments as a further validation and extension of this procedure. A total of 66 daily cigarette smokers carried a personal digital assistant (PDA) and had the opportunity to respond to 32 cue-reactivity sessions across 8 days. Cues were presented through in vivo and photographic modes. During in vivo sessions, participants handled and looked at a cigarette or neutral object, while during photographic sessions, participants looked at a smoking-related or neutral photograph on the PDA. Craving and mood were assessed before and after cue presentations. Cues were also presented in the laboratory both before (Lab I) and after (Lab II) the 8-day CREMA procedure. Participants completed over 90% of cue-reactivity sessions delivered with the CREMA procedure. Analyses revealed robust cue-reactivity in the natural environment and laboratory across both modes of presentation. Photographic cues elicited significantly stronger cue-reactivity effects than in vivo cues across all sessions. The CREMA procedure has been shown to elicit robust cue-reactivity effects across multiple modes of cue presentation.

FC of brain regions of interest, known to be involved in affective-cognitive processes, and independent component analysis of RS-fMRI data to explore brain networks were employed. Compared to HC, all FD patients showed reduced FC between the majority of affective-cognitive seeds of interest and the fronto-subcortical and limbic circuits; enhanced FC between the right affective-cognitive part of the cerebellum and the bilateral associative parietal cortex; enhanced FC of the bilateral amygdala with the subcortical and posterior cortical brain regions; and altered FC between the left medial dorsal nucleus and the sensorimotor and associative brain regions (enhanced in MobFD and reduced in FixFD). Compared with yHC and MobFD patients, FixFD patients had an extensive pattern of reduced FC within the cerebellar network, and between the majority of affective-cognitive seeds of interest and the sensorimotor and high-order function (\"cognitive\") areas with a unique involvement of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex connectivity. Brain FC within the affective-cognitive network is altered in FD and presented specific features associated with each FD phenotype, suggesting an interaction between brain connectivity and clinical expression of the disease."

Once retired, older adults can be invaluable resources for the community as family carers, as volunteers, or by returning to work. Healthy aging is one of the main conditions for being able to work longer and being active after retirement. The latter, indeed, represents a very sensitive life transition, which can entail psychological and social difficulties. Interventions for promoting older workers' health and well-being and supporting the transition to retirement are on the top of the policy agenda of most European countries. Recently, computer-based and digital health interventions have been seen as promising means to reach this purpose.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic literature review aimed to explore studies on digital health coaching programs for older workers that followed a user-centered design approach and evaluated their effectiveness in providing older adults with guidance for adopting a healthy lifestyle and being active in the community.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The search identified 1931 papers, and 2 relevant articles were selected by applying specific eligibility criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      To our knowledge, only few digital health coaching programs have targeted the population of older workers to date; there is an insufficient number of studies on the efficacy of such programs.

Future digital health coaching programs should adopt the healthy aging paradigm as a multidimensional lens for interpreting the impact of eHealth technology on aging and retirement. The literature around this issue remains at an embryonic state, and this gap needs to be filled by further investigations that apply a user-centered approach for designing the technology, test innovative research methodologies, and adopt new technical solutions for high-quality interaction design.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Further digital health coaching programs aimed at supporting healthy and active living for older workers and retirees are necessary.

In a binary preference test, we studied the response of caffeine-treated zebrafish to a replica of a shoal of conspecifics moving in the tank. A purely data-driven information theoretic approach was used to infer the influence of the replica on zebrafish behavior as a function of caffeine concentration. Our results demonstrate that acute caffeine administration modulates both the average speed and the interaction with the replica. Specifically, zebrafish exposed to elevated doses of caffeine show reduced locomotion and increased sensitivity to the motion of the replica.

            "abstract": "Goal-directed human behavior is enabled by hierarchically-organized neural systems that process executive commands associated with higher brain areas in response to sensory and motor signals from lower brain areas. Psychiatric diseases and psychotic conditions are postulated to involve disturbances in these hierarchical network interactions, but the mechanism for how aberrant disease signals are generated in networks, and a systems-level framework linking disease signals to specific psychiatric symptoms remains undetermined. In this study, we show that neural networks containing schizophrenia-like deficits can spontaneously generate uncompensated error signals with properties that explain psychiatric disease symptoms, including fictive perception, altered sense of self, and unpredictable behavior. To distinguish dysfunction at the behavioral versus network level, we monitored the interactive behavior of a humanoid robot driven by the network. Mild perturbations in network connectivity resulted in the spontaneous appearance of uncompensated prediction errors and altered interactions within the network without external changes in behavior, correlating to the fictive sensations and agency experienced by episodic disease patients. In contrast, more severe deficits resulted in unstable network dynamics resulting in overt changes in behavior similar to those observed in chronic disease patients. These findings demonstrate that prediction error disequilibrium may represent an intrinsic property of schizophrenic brain networks reporting the severity and variability of disease symptoms. Moreover, these results support a systems-level model for psychiatric disease that features the spontaneous generation of maladaptive signals in hierarchical neural networks."

The intervention arm received four services over a 2-y period: 1) up to six FP counseling sessions; 2) free transportation to an FP clinic; 3) free FP services at the clinic or financial reimbursement for FP services obtained elsewhere; and 4) treatment for contraceptive-related side effects. Contraceptive use after 2 y of intervention exposure increased by 5.9 percentage points, mainly through an increased use of contraceptive implants. The intervention group’s hazard of pregnancy was 43.5% lower 24 mo after the index birth. Our results highlight the positive impact of increased access to FP on a woman’s contraceptive use. In addition, we show that exposure to the FP intervention led to a prolongation of birth intervals among intervention women relative to control women and increased her control over birth spacing and postpartum fertility, which, in turn, may contribute to her longer-term health and well-being."

            "abstract": "The impact of social environments on mental states is difficult to assess, limiting the understanding of which aspects of the social environment contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms and how individual characteristics moderate this outcome. This study aimed to test sensitivity to environmental social stress as a mechanism of psychosis using Virtual Reality (VR) experiments. Fifty-five patients with recent onset psychotic disorder, 20 patients at ultra high risk for psychosis, 42 siblings of patients with psychosis, and 53 controls walked 5 times in a virtual bar with different levels of environmental social stress. Virtual social stressors were population density, ethnic density and hostility. Paranoia about virtual humans and subjective distress in response to virtual social stress exposures were measured with State Social Paranoia Scale (SSPS) and self-rated momentary subjective distress (SUD), respectively. Pre-existing (subclinical) symptoms were assessed with the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE), Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Paranoia and subjective distress increased with degree of social stress in the environment. Psychosis liability and pre-existing symptoms, in particular negative affect, positively impacted the level of paranoia and distress in response to social stress. These results provide experimental evidence that heightened sensitivity to environmental social stress may play an important role in the onset and course of psychosis."

            "abstract": "Face-to-face social interactions are characterized by the reciprocal exchange of facial emotions between interaction partners. Typically, facial emotional expressions have been studied in passive observation paradigms, while interactive mechanisms remain unknown. In the current study we investigate how sending a facial emotional expression influenced the evaluation of an emotional expression received in return. Sixty-eight participants were cued to direct a facial emotional expression (happy, angry, neutral) towards a virtual agent in front of them. The virtual agent then responded with either the same or another emotional expression (happy, angry). Evaluation of the response expressions was measured via ratings of valence and arousal as well as EMG recordings of the M. corrugator supercilii and the M. zygomaticus major. Results revealed a significant interaction between the emotion of the initial facial expression and the response expression. Valence of happy response expressions were increased when participants had initially displayed a smile compared to a neutral expression or a frown. This was also reflected in the EMG responses. Initiating an interaction with a smile increased Zygomaticus activation for happy relative to angry response expressions compared to when the interaction was initiated with a frown. In contrast, no interplay of the initial and the response expression was observed in the Corrugator. These findings demonstrate that smiling or frowning at another person can modulate socio-emotional processing of subsequent social cues. Therefore, the present study highlights the interactive nature of facial emotional expressions."

Advances in the field of social robotics have provided a promising route to deliver AAI while avoiding these aforementioned obstacles. Although there has been promising initial research on social robotics in older adults, to date there has been no such research conducted with a veteran population. The present pilot study followed 23 veteran residents of a Veterans Affairs (VA) geropsychiatric long-term care facility over the span of approximately a year and a half. It was found that use of Paro, a social robot, resulted in increased observed positive affective and behavioral indicators, with concomitant decreases observed in negative affective and behavioral indicators. The authors concluded that Paro is likely an effective nonpharmacological approach for managing dementia-related mood and behavior problems with veterans in VA long term care facilities. They additionally observed that Paro is best presented to residents who are relatively calm and approachable, as opposed to actively exhibiting behavior or mood problems. Future research directions are discussed in light of both the positive results noted and the inherent limitations of our pilot study. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Children were confronted with a stranger and a robot, separately with their father and mother at 1 (N = 122), at 2.5 (N = 117), and at 4.5 (N = 111) years of age. Behavioral inhibition (BI) was separately observed at 1 and 2.5 years. Parents' social anxiety disorder (SAD) severity was assessed via interviews prenatally and at 4.5 years. More expressed anxiety by parents at 4.5 years was not significantly linked to more fear or avoidance at 4.5 years. High BI children were more avoidant at 4.5 years if their parents expressed more anxiety at 2.5 years, and they were more fearful if the parents had more severe forms of lifetime SAD. More severe lifetime forms of SAD were also related to more pronounced increases in child fear and avoidance over time, whereas parents' expressions of anxiety predicted more pronounced increases in avoidance only from 2.5 to 4.5 years. High BI toddlers of parents with higher state and trait anxiety become more avoidant of novelty as preschoolers, illustrating the importance of considering child temperamental dispositions in the links between child and parent anxiety. Moreover, children of parents with more trait and state anxiety showed more pronounced increases in fear and avoidance over time, highlighting the importance of early interventions targeting parents' SAD."

A literature search was conducted using several databases for published (PubMed, PsycINFO) and ongoing (clinical trial registries) studies conducted in youths who met NIMH's criteria for Severe Mood Dysregulation (SMD) or the DSM-5 diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). Eight completed studies were identified: three randomized trials, four open pilot studies and one case report. Seven ongoing studies were found in trial registries. The available evidence suggests potential efficacy of psychotherapies which have previously been developed for internalizing and externalizing disorders. The two main pharmacological strategies tested are, first, a monotherapy of psychostimulant or atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone, already used in the treatment of severe irritability in youths with developmental disorders; and second, the use of a serotonergic antidepressant as an add-on therapy in youths treated with psychostimulant. Ongoing studies will further clarify the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions for DMDD individuals and whether they should be given alone or in conjunction with other treatments. The short duration of the trials for a chronic disorder, the low number of studies, the lack of placebo or active comparator arm, and restrictive inclusion criteria in most of the controlled trials dramatically limit the interpretation of the results. Finally, future research should be conducted across multiple sites, with standardized procedures to measure DMDD symptoms reduction, and include a run-in period to limit placebo effect."

However, since this program has not significantly reduced rates of pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin, new strategies for reducing rates of isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies are needed.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To explore women's experiences with counseling about isotretinoin risk reduction.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      Structured interviews were conducted between January and September 2012. Two independent coders performed content analysis using a grounded theory approach. The study participants were 16 women who had used isotretinoin to treat severe skin disease and who were recruited from a single urban community via flyers displayed on college campuses, at dermatology clinics, and at student health facilities.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      Perceptions of isotretinoin-associated risks and understanding of ways teratogenic risks can be avoided.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants clearly understood that isotretinoin is teratogenic but had less understanding of contraceptive methods that effectively prevent pregnancy. Most described the counseling they received as anxiety provoking. Few were counseled about highly effective reversible contraceptives such as the subdermal implant or intrauterine contraception; most counseling focused on oral contraceptives. Women cited multiple influences on their contraceptive choices, including friends, family, physicians, the internet, and other media; however, some expressed concerns about the accuracy of these sources of information. For many, iPLEDGE was their first introduction to contraception. When presented with evidence-based information on the relative effectiveness of available contraceptives, participants expressed surprise that this was not part of the iPLEDGE materials.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      Since few clinicians provide women information on highly effective (ie, intrauterine or subdermal) contraceptives, the iPLEDGE program increases anxiety about isotretinoin more than it helps women feel protected from the teratogenic risks of isotretinoin."

            "abstract": "Current practice suggests that primary care physicians are in the best position to identify initially and treat depression in the ambulatory setting. Educating primary care physicians about depression is essential for identifying and adequately caring for depressed patients. Depression is commonly seen and easily treated in primary care settings. A structured, consistent approach to the depressed patient is essential and should include patient education; eliciting information about symptoms; clinical observation about the examination; a history of previous psychiatric episodes; family history of affective disorders; history from relatives, other providers, or other clinics if necessary; aggressive use of medication alone or in combination with psychotherapeutic techniques; and appropriate referral. Depression is associated with significant suffering and disability and increased utilization of health care services. Depressed patients can present with a variety of somatic and cognitive symptoms. Primary care physicians should be alert for denial and minimization of symptoms as well as for the presence of stigmatization. The biologic, psychological, and social aspects of depression should be expanded on as needed according to the patient's illness beliefs. A medical model such as that used for explaining diabetes or coronary artery disease may be useful. Primary care physicians miss the diagnosis of depression in as any as two out of three cases, and when the diagnosis is made, patients are often undertreated and given antidepressants at subtherapeutic dosages and for only short periods of time. Treatment of depression can be extremely satisfying and gratifying for patients and physicians, who need to have a high index of suspicion for depression. All antidepressants have the same efficacy, and the selection is based primarily on their side-effect profile. The new generation of antidepressants are better tolerated, relieve symptoms of depression, improve the quality of life, and probably improve morbidity and mortality. In many cases, depression is chronic and recurrent, and treatment should be long-term to prevent relapses. As with other chronic diseases, if a patient requires treatment that the primary care provider cannot render alone, it needs to be coordinated. In particular, consultants may need to be called in for psychotherapy. Primary care physicians should feel confident that, given enough time and cooperation, they can almost always find a treatment regimen that succeeds in alleviating and perhaps preventing the great suffering and risk occasioned by depression in medically ill ambulatory patients."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the day-to-day associations between partner support, pain catastrophizing and pain intensity in individuals with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. In this microlongitudinal cohort study, participants (N = 124) with end-stage knee osteoarthritis completed baseline measures of trait pain catastrophizing and negative affect. Participants also provided daily diary assessments of partner support, pain catastrophizing and pain intensity for a period of 7 days using a personal digital assistant. Multilevel analyses revealed that day-to-day fluctuations in pain catastrophizing were associated with pain intensity. Data from multilevel analyses indicated that the main effect of partner support was not significantly associated with pain intensity. Results also indicated the interactions between partner support and both trait and state pain catastrophizing were significant, suggesting that both trait and state pain catastrophizing moderated the relationship between daily partner support and pain intensity. That is, on days when participants experienced low levels of partner support, high catastrophizers reported higher levels of pain intensity than low catastrophizers. In the presence of higher levels of partner support, pain intensity did not differ between high and low catastrophizers. These results are consistent with the Communal Coping Model of pain catastrophizing, and highlight the interpersonal context within which pain catastrophizing impacts pain outcomes. These findings also suggest that future interventions designed to specifically target the dynamic between pain catastrophizing and partner support may improve pain outcomes in individuals with end-stage knee OA."

A sexual rights approach puts women and men with HIV in charge of their sexual health. Accurate, accessible information to make informed choices and safe, pleasurable sexual relationships possible is best delivered through peer education and health professionals trained in empathetic approaches to sensitive issues. Young people with HIV especially need appropriate sex education and support for dealing with sexuality and self-identity with HIV. Women and men with HIV need condoms, appropriate services for sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunction and management of cervical and anogenital cancers. Interventions based on positive prevention, that combine protection of personal health with avoiding HIV/STI transmission to partners, are recommended. HIV counselling following a positive test has increased condom use and decreased coercive sex and outside sexual contacts among discordant couples. HIV treatment and care have reduced stigma and increased uptake of HIV testing and disclosure of positive status to partners. High adherence to antiretroviral therapy and safer sexual behaviour must go hand-in-hand. Sexual health services have worked with peer educators and volunteer groups to reach those at higher risk, such as sex workers. Technological advances in diagnosis of STIs, microbicide development and screening and vaccination for human papillomavirus must be available in developing countries and for those with the highest need globally."

We explored how contact with social robot PLEO could positively affect a child's well-being. To this end, we performed a multiple case study on the paediatric ward of two hospitals. Child life specialists offered PLEO as a therapeutic activity to children in a personalised way for a well-being related purpose in three to five play like activity sessions during hospital visits/stay. Robot-child interaction was observed; care professionals, children and parents were interviewed. Applying direct content analysis revealed six categories of interest: interaction with PLEO, role of the adults, preferences for PLEO, PLEO as buddy, attainment of predetermined goal(s) and deployment of PLEO. Four girls and five boys, aged 4-13, had PLEO offered as a relief from stress or boredom or for physical stimulation. All but one started interacting with PLEO and showed behaviours like hugging, caring or technical exploration, promoting relaxation, activation and/or making contact. Interaction with PLEO contributed to achieving the well-being related purpose for six of them. PLEO was perceived as attractive to elicit play. Although data are limited, promising results emerge that the well-being of hospitalised children might be fostered by a personalised PLEO offer."

These could be due to anxiety, depression, somatization or a manifestation of illness behaviour. Somatic symptoms can also arise out of treatments for the cancer like radiation treatment or chemotherapy. Cancer related somatic symptoms have cognitive, psychological, and physiological causes, each of which is amenable to treatment. The occurrence of somatoform disorders in cancer patients is likely to complicate the treatment and outcome of the cancer. Common somatic symptoms in cancer have been found to be pain, fatigue, anorexia, tiredness or exhaustion, weakness, reduced energy, lethargy, and tremors. Breathlessness, muscle pain, dizziness, and palpitation are common symptoms of anxiety and panic attack which have also been noted in cancer patients. Somatic concern and preoccupation are also common. These symptoms create difficulty in diagnosing depression and anxiety in cancer patients, and leads to the need for modification of the standard diagnostic criteria. Somatic symptoms in cancer respond to counselling and psychopharmacotherapy. More research are needed on this area to understand the process of somatization in a somatic disease."

Analysis was conducted on patients from the intervention arm (n=268) of an randomized controlled trial that evaluated the impact of a clinical pharmacist on the outcomes for depressed primary care patients from nine metropolitan Boston practices. The main outcome measure was the amount of intervention time spent with patients, physicians, and other activities. Details of the behavioral intervention and a categorization of the activities are offered. Pharmacists reported 978 encounters with 268 patients in 6 months. Eighty percent of patient encounters occurred by telephone. Initial encounters took 45 min if in person and 13.3 min if by telephone. Subsequent encounters followed a similar pattern. Follow-up visits occurred 2.3 times per patient. Physician contact took considerably less time. In total, the pharmacist intervention took 70.3 min per patient over 6 months; 42.2% of encounters involved an activity related to non-antidepressant medication and 85% of encounters involved general support. Other activities (education, advocating antidepressants, and motivating adherence) occurred in at least 50% of encounters. Pharmacists repeated intervention activities in the same category approximately two to three times. Interventions to improve the care of depression in primary care patients must anticipate encountering intense needs for information, personal support, and help negotiating the healthcare system.

The hypothesized models of mediation effect of social engagement and moderation effect of avatar customization were tested between avatar identification and enjoyment. Results indicated that social engagement mediates the relationship between avatar identification and enjoyment in metaverse participation. Furthermore, the significant moderation effect implied that the degree of avatar customization affected the relationship between avatar identification and enjoyment in the metaverse.

Growing evidence demonstrates that relationships involving IPV and women's decisionmaking about violence represent complex phenomena, best studied as complex adaptive systems. Unfortunately, that complexity limits our ability to fully understand it. This paper presents findings from a series of agent-based models (ABMs) that were created from studies involving multiple time series of couples' daily reports of violence, perceptions and behaviors. To identify potential influencing variables, we modeled the impact that random stress and intentional behavior of the women could have on men's violence and stalking. ABM models of IPV noted the lack of violence at baseline without influence, and found that three variable parameters (Distance-Distance+, HerViolence-HerViolence+, Distance-Distance-) accounted for most patterns of violence development. Random stress and arguments had little effect and the nature of the alcoholviolence relationship remained unclear, however, her violence could increase his violence and stalking. One important difference between ABMs was the importance of the persistence of her concern about the effects of violence on children. Although only modeled in the second ABM, it proved critical to results. When modeling women's decision-making, her abstinence from arguments, alcohol use and violence had no effect on whether to seek help, take legal action or leave; random stress and her daily violence did not affect seeking counseling. However, daily arguments, forgiveness and heavy alcohol use did impact actiontaking, increasing counseling, legal action and leaving generally. The addition of catastrophe equations could alter these outcomes, resulting in more counseling but less legal action. In addition, children are very important when considering decision-making; concern for children affects violence while number of children affects decision-making. In conclusion, ABM can yield important insights into IPV and have clinical implications. It can provide greater understanding of the phenomenon and allow us to test the nature of correlations. (i.e., between alcohol use and violence). ABM can clarify the inherent complexity within violent couples and facilitate sense-making. Finally, it can allow clinicians to test interventions in vitro without risk to vulnerable women."

Classification of tinnitus is oriented to the duration of symptoms and their severity, the latter taking into account the victim's distress both at work and during leisure time. Acute tinnitus is often caused by an ear condition or psychosocial stress. Chronic tinnitus can be caused by persistent exposure to noise, whiplash injuries or functional disorders of the cervical spine. The diagnosis is based on audiometric and otoneurologic investigations, possibly magnetic resonance tomography and serology when an infection is suspected. Acute tinnitus is treated with infusions--mostly with cortisone or pentoxifylline--or a short-term oral medication with these substances. Since no causal therapy is available for chronictinnitus, therapeutic counseling has a particular role to play with emphasis on informing the patient on the results of investigations and suggesting coping strategies. Following an appropriate diagnostic work-up, the patient should be advised of the harmless nature of the noises and encouraged to adopt a positively motivated approach to the symptoms. Tinnitus retraining therapy aims to permanently suppress conscious awareness of the noises in the ear. For this purpose, a noise generator, generally worn within the ear auricle, is employed among other things. The prognosis is dependent not only on the presence or otherwise of organic disease but also--almost always--on such aspects as perception and coping by the individual patient."

Here, we tested whether masking deficits and associated EEG changes are also found in patients with major depressive disorder. First, we replicated previous findings showing that depressive patients exhibit, at most, only weak masking deficits. Second, we found that the EEG amplitudes of depressive patients were reduced compared to controls and slightly increased compared to schizophrenia patients. As a secondary analysis, we compared the performance in the masking paradigm with three cognitive tasks, namely: the Wisconsin card sorting test, a verbal fluency test and a degraded continuous performance test.

            "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, straining, urgency, incomplete evacuation, nausea, and bloating) that occur alongside bowel function alterations (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, or both). Patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also experience comorbid anxiety and depression. Irritable bowel syndrome is common, with a prevalence estimated between 3% and 28%, affecting patient health and quality of life. Patients with moderate or severe irritable bowel syndrome generally seek medical care, whereas those with milder symptoms may choose self-management. Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome receive outpatient care, but irritable bowel syndrome-related hospitalizations do occur. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial (i.e. genetics, immune components, changes in the gut microbiota, disturbances in physiologic stress response systems, and psychosocial factors). Management of irritable bowel syndrome can include lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, counseling, psychologic medication, and agents that affect gastrointestinal motility. A number of therapies have emerged in recent years with clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy and safety for patients with irritable bowel syndrome, including agents that target gastrointestinal motility (i.e. linaclotide), gastrointestinal opioid receptors (i.e. asimadoline, eluxadoline), and gut microbiota (i.e. rifaximin). Linaclotide has been shown to significantly improve stool frequency and abdominal pain compared with placebo in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (number needed to treat, 5.1). Asimadoline shows efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome-related pain. Rifaximin provided adequate relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms versus placebo for a significantly greater percentage of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (p < 0.001). Management that encompasses all aspects of irritable bowel syndrome (gastrointestinal symptoms) and comorbid psychologic symptoms (e.g. anxiety or depression) is important for improving overall patient health and well-being."

            "abstract": "Emotionally-responsive chatbots are marketed as agents with which one can form emotional connections. They can also become weak ties in the outer layers of one’s acquaintance network and available for social support. In this experiment, which was designed to study the acquaintance process, we randomly assigned 417 participants into three conditions: face-to-face (FTF) chat with a human, online chat with a human, and online chat with a commercially-available, emotionally-responsive chatbot, Replika. After a 20-min getting-acquainted chat, participants reported their affective state and relational evaluations of the chat. Additionally, all chats were recorded and text analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. In all conditions, participants reported moderate levels of positive emotions and low levels of negative emotions. Those who chatted FTF with a human reported significantly more negative emotions than those who chatted with a bot. However, those who chatted with a human also reported more homophily with and liking of their chat partner and that their partner was more responsive. Meanwhile, participants had fewest conversational concerns with the chatbot. These findings have implications for future computer-mediated interaction studies: conversations with chatbots appear to have different affordances and effects on chatter enjoyment and conversational concerns in getting-acquainted contexts. These results may help designers improve reception and marketability for chatbots in consumer markets."

            "abstract": "The past four decades have seen enormous efforts placed on a search for molecular markers of schizophrenia using positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this narrative review, we cast a broad net to define and summarize what researchers have learned about schizophrenia from molecular imaging studies. Some PET studies of brain energy metabolism with the glucose analogue FDGhave have shown a hypofrontality defect in patients with schizophrenia, but more generally indicate a loss of metabolic coherence between different brain regions. An early finding of significantly increased striatal trapping of the dopamine synthesis tracer FDOPA has survived a meta-analysis of many replications, but the increase is not pathognomonic of the disorder, since one half of patients have entirely normal dopamine synthesis capacity. Similarly, competition SPECT studies show greater basal and amphetamine-evoked dopamine occupancy at post-synaptic dopamine D2/3 receptors in patients with schizophrenia, but the difference is likewise not pathognomonic. We thus propose that molecular imaging studies of brain dopamine indicate neurochemical heterogeneity within the diagnostic entity of schizophrenia. Occupancy studies have established the relevant target engagement by antipsychotic medications at dopamine D2/3 receptors in living brain. There is evidence for elevated frontal cortical dopamine D1 receptors, especially in relation to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. There is a general lack of consistent findings of abnormalities in serotonin markers, but some evidence for decreased levels of nicotinic receptors in patients. There are sparse and somewhat inconsistent findings of reduced binding of muscarinic, glutamate, and opioid receptors ligands, inconsistent findings of microglial activation, and very recently, evidence of globally reduced levels of synaptic proteins in brain of patients. One study reports a decline in histone acetylase binding that is confined to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In most contexts, the phase of the disease and effects of past or present medication can obscure or confound PET and SPECT findings in schizophrenia."

They were also interviewed at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks after using standardized symptom measures. Sixteen patients (61.5%) completed at least one-third of the entries, with a compliance rate of 70.7%. Responses to the ESM items were internally consistent. At baseline, ESM and clinical ratings converged on suspiciousness and images, but not on voices and most of the delusion dimensions.

Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies."

            "abstract": "Although hallucinations are important and frequent symptoms in major psychiatric and neurological diseases, little is known about their brain mechanisms. Hallucinations are unpredictable and private experiences, making their investigation, quantification and assessment highly challenging. A major shortcoming in hallucination research is the absence of methods able to induce specific and short-lasting hallucinations, which resemble clinical hallucinations, can be elicited repeatedly and vary across experimental conditions. By integrating clinical observations and recent advances in cognitive neuroscience with robotics, we have designed a novel device and sensorimotor method able to repeatedly induce a specific, clinically relevant hallucination: presence hallucination. Presence hallucinations are induced by applying specific conflicting (spatiotemporal) sensorimotor stimulation including an upper extremity and the torso of the participant. Another, MRI-compatible, robotic device using similar sensorimotor stimulation permitted the identification of the brain mechanisms of these hallucinations. Enabling the identification of behavioral and a frontotemporal neural biomarkers of hallucinations, under fully controlled experimental conditions and in real-time, this method can be applied in healthy participants as well as patients with schizophrenia, neurodegenerative disease or other hallucinations. The execution of these protocols requires intermediate-level skills in cognitive neuroscience and MRI processing, as well as minimal coding experience to control the robotic device.

Sixteen (16) healthy females (38 +/- 8 years old) were assigned at random to three treatments applied by a robotic oil-dripping system: plain sesame oil (plain Shirodhara), medicated sesame oil with a 0.3 volume % of lavender essential oil (lavender Shirodhara), or the control supine position. Psychophysiologic parameters including the heart rate, skin temperature of the dorsum of hands and feet, as well as anxiety and ASC were monitored, and the rates of change of these items were calculated to assess the psychophysiologic changes brought about by Shirodhara. Lavender Shirodhara showed potent anxiolytic and ASC-inducing or promoting effects, and induced the largest increase in foot skin temperature. The correlation between anxiolysis and ASC, as well as the correlation between these psychologic effects and the elevated foot skin temperature were larger in the lavender Shirodhara than in the other two conditions. It was speculated that the psycho-physiologic effects of lavender Shirodhara would be brought about by three mechanisms: (1) the well-known relaxing action of essential oils from L. angustifolia mediated by olfactory nerves, (2) the pharmacologic action of substances absorbed through the skin or mucosa in the sesame oil or lavender essential oil, and (3) the physiologic effect of sesame oil dripped on the forehead induced by the somato-autonomic reflex through thermosensors or pressure sensors in the skin or hair follicles via the trigeminal cranial nerve.

Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell, Sullivan, Prevost, & Churchill, 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck & Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al. 2009; 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition."

In this paper, a memristive circuit of emotional generation and evolution based on skin-like sensory processor is proposed. The circuit includes: first, memristive skin-like sensory processor module; second, emotional generation and evolution module; and third, emotional expression module. The first module consists of four single-memristor skin-like sensory processors, which correspond to process sensations of pain, cold, warm, and tactile. It will automatically return to its initial state if sensory signals disappear. But if sensory signals are much strong, it will not automatically return to initial state unless applied \"restoring signal\" just like a surgical operation. The second module realizes a conversion mechanism from sensations to emotions using memristor as emotional synapse. Given signals from skin-like sensory processor, the memristance will decrease, which means the extent of emotion will increase, such as more happy. This is the emotional generation. The extent of emotion will be changed if the same sensation is applied to skin-like sensory processor repeatedly, which is the emotional evolution. The third module can show the generated emotions visually. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the proposed circuit can generate and evolve emotions like human beings after processing sensory signals from skin. The proposed circuit can be applied in a perceptual robot platform to realize the conversion from sensations to emotions, enabling the robot to have the ability to sense and process information."

            "abstract": "Jealousy as a psychopathological symptom has long been neglected by psychiatric research. Despite the obvious difficulty to prove or exclude the infidelity of a spouse, delusional jealousy can clearly be considered as pathological, but the evaluation and classification of non-psychotic jealousy remains a challenge. Typical psychopathological symptoms which usually accompany pathological jealousy and the prevalence of delusional jealousy in different psychiatric disorders are described. In delusional jealousy neuroleptic treatment is necessary. Positive results have been reported especially with pimozide. For non-psychotic jealousy various forms of psychotherapy have been advocated to improve self-esteem or to treat other psychological disorders. Other possible interventions are alcohol therapy or family counselling. Many studies show that jealousy is a frequent motive in homicide with the spouse being nearly exclusively the victim. Finally some forensic aspects of jealousy are discussed."

            "abstract": "Severe, debilitating fatigue is common in cancer patients. For many, it is the symptom that interferes most with normal routines. Virtually every modality used to treat cancer may cause fatigue, as can complications of the disease such as sleep disturbances, infections, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and anemia. There is a significant overlap between depression and fatigue in many patients. Given the high prevalence of cancer-related fatigue, frequent assessment of patients is essential. The evaluation should include an attempt to identify reversible causes of fatigue, and screening for depression. However, many cancer patients suffer from fatigue even in the absence of any identifiable, reversible cause. For these patients, consideration can be given to suitable exercise programs, educational support and counseling, and energy conservation strategies. A trial of a stimulant medication is also reasonable. Given the heterogeneity of patients, individualized approaches are needed. For anemic patients undergoing chemotherapy, erythropoietic agents can increase hemoglobin levels. The impact of these drugs on fatigue and quality of life is uncertain. Recent reports of increased mortality and thrombotic events in cancer patients treated with epoetin require further investigation."

Prior work has focused on the impacts of the robot seal Paro on older adult well-being, but recent studies have suggested the good acceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs).\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to address the limited effectiveness research on JfA devices.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Over 4 months, 4 care homes each received 2 JfA devices (1 cat and 1 dog; intervention group), and 4 homes received care as usual (control group). Psychometrics were collected before and after the intervention to compare the change from baseline to follow-up between the groups. In the final 4 months, all 8 care homes received devices, but only qualitative data were collected owing to COVID-19 and reduced capacity. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] Nursing Home version). Care provider burden was a secondary outcome (occupational disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside the Challenging Behavior scale, the Holden communication scale, the Campaign to End Loneliness questionnaire, and medication use. Qualitative data were collected through care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews to understand use, experience, and impact. We also collected demographic data and assessed dementia severity. In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a significant difference in the total change from baseline to follow-up between the intervention and control groups for NPI (P<.001) and occupational disruptiveness (P=.03). Neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the control group and decreased in the intervention group. No significant difference was seen for communication issues or challenging behavior. For NPI subdomains, there were significant differences from baseline to follow-up in delusions (P=.03), depression (P=.01), anxiety (P=.001), elation (P=.02), and apathy (P=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased slightly in the control group. The summative impact results suggested that most residents (46/54, 85%) who interacted with robots experienced a positive impact. Those who interacted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (P=.001). The qualitative results suggested good adoption, acceptability, and suitability for subjectively lonely individuals and lack of a novelty effect through sustained use, and demonstrated that the reasons for use were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness.

Medication is the most frequent cause of acquired chorea. When dealing with a case of hemichorea, it is essential to rule out structural insult of the basal ganglia or their connections. Treatment of choreas must be aimed at correcting their cause if it is reversible, although the patient must always be given symptomatic treatment if the intensity and functional repercussions of the chorea require it. In cases of hereditary choreas, prevention could involve genetic counselling aimed at affected patients and their relatives."

Women of childbearing potential who are prescribed these drugs should be informed of their teratogenic potential and advised of the need for adequate contraception and the protective role of folate. We reviewed the clinical records of all women of childbearing age in long-term contact with one specialist mental health Trust providing services for a total population of 750,000. One hundred and thirty eight (16%) of 837 women of childbearing age were prescribed one or more of these drugs. There was documented evidence that 29 (21%) of these women had been informed about teratogenicity and that 33 (24%) had been advised about contraception. Fourteen women (10%) had a confirmed pregnancy while taking lithium, carbamazepine or valproate; eight had a complication of pregnancy. If prescribing practice in this large mental health Trust were typical of the UK, between 7000 and 11 000 women of childbearing potential would be prescribed lithium, carbamazepine or valproate by psychiatrists without documented discussion of the risks."

            "abstract": "Only a small percentage of smokers who state they want to stop smoking in the next half year, succeed in doing so. This is not only due to the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, but also because of psychological and social factors. Approximately 80% of the people who have used nicotine-replacement therapy return to smoking after some time. Therefore, the interest in non-nicotine pharmacotherapy has increased considerably in recent years. The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline are, compared to a placebo, particularly effective smoking cessation aids (relative risk (RR)nortriptyline: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3; RRbupropion: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). A combined strategy of nicotine-replacement therapy with counselling or antidepressants (bupropion or nortriptyline) with counselling, in which the physiological as well as the psychological aspects of smoking cessation are treated, seems to be the most effective. Although smoking cessation is seen as the single most important way of preventing a further deterioration of the lung function at all stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), little research has been conducted amongst COPD patients. Especially the use of the antidepressants bupropion or nortriptyline seems particularly interesting for the treatment of patients with COPD. This is not only because smoking cigarettes is the major risk factor for the development of the disease, but also because COPD patients have a higher than normal prevalence of depression. Furthermore, an association has been found between smoking cigarettes and depression, and the presence of depression or depressive symptoms appears to be an important cause of relapse."

            "abstract": "Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) contributes to the development of drug resistance. HIV-infected children, especially those 5 years and under, are dependent on a caregiver to adhere to ART. However, characteristics of the caregiver, child, regimen, clinic and social context affect clinic attendance and medication-taking, both of which constitute adherent behaviour. We conducted nine interviews and three focus groups to determine how doctors, nurses, counsellors, traditional healers and caregivers understood the barriers and facilitators to ART adherence among children residing in rural South Africa. The data were transcribed, translated into English from isiZulu where necessary, and coded using Atlas.ti version 7. Results were interpreted through the lens of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory. We found that at the micro-level, palatability of medication and large volumes of medication were problematic for young children. Characteristics of the caregiver including absent mothers, grandmothers as caregivers and denial of HIV amongst fathers were themes related to the micro-system. Language barriers and inconsistent attendance of caregivers to monthly clinic visits were factors affecting adherence in the meso-system. Adherence counselling and training were the most problematic features in the exo-system. In the macro-system, the effects of food insecurity and the controversy surrounding the use of traditional medicines were most salient. Increased supervision and regular training amongst lay adherence counsellors are needed, as well as regular monitoring of the persons attending the clinic on the child's behalf."

            "abstract": "Theorists have long postulated that facial properties such as emotion and sex are potent social stimuli that influence how individuals act. Yet extant scientific findings were mainly derived from investigations on the prompt motor response upon the presentation of affective stimuli, which were mostly delivered by means of pictures, videos, or text. A theoretical question remains unaddressed concerning how the perception of emotion and sex would modulate the dynamics of a continuous coordinated behaviour. Conceived in the framework of dynamical approach to interpersonal motor coordination, the present study aimed to address this question by adopting the coupled-oscillators paradigm. Twenty-one participants performed in-phase and anti-phase coordination with two avatars (male and female) displaying three emotional expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) at different frequencies (100% and 150% of the participant's preferred frequency) by executing horizontal rhythmic left-right oscillatory movements. Time to initiate movement (TIM), mean relative phase error (MnRP), and standard deviation of relative phase (SDRP) were calculated as indices of reaction time, deviation from the intended pattern of coordination, and coordination stability, respectively. Results showed that in anti-phase condition at 150% frequency, MnRP was lower with the angry and the female avatar. In addition, coordination was found to be more stable with the male avatar than the female one when both displaying neutral emotion. But the happy female avatar was found to elicit more stable coordination than the neutral female avatar. These results implied that individuals are more relaxed to coordinate with the female than the male, and the sensorimotor system becomes more flexible to coordinate with an angry person. It is also suggested social roles influence how people coordinate, and individuals attend more to interact with a happy female. In sum, the present study evidenced that social perception is embodied in the interactive behaviour during social interaction."

Previous studies have employed diverse populations to explore these actions, with little research considering the significance of occupation on moral decision-making. For the first time, in this study we have investigated simulated moral actions in virtual reality made by professionally trained paramedics and fire service incident commanders who are frequently faced with and must respond to moral dilemmas. We found that specially trained individuals showed distinct empathic and related personality trait scores and that these declined with years of experience working in the profession. Supporting the theory that these professionals develop resilience in moral conflict, reduced emotional arousal was observed during virtual simulations of a distressing dilemma. Furthermore, trained professionals demonstrated less regret following the execution of a moral action in virtual reality when compared to untrained control populations. We showed that, contrary to previous research, trained individuals made the same moral judgements and moral actions as untrained individuals, though showing less arousal and regret. In the face of increasing concerns regarding empathy decline in health care professionals, we suggest that the nature of this decline is complex and likely reflects the development of a necessary emotional resilience to distressing events."

Neurocognitive deficits and difficulties in social behavior were found in schizophrenia patients, not only in abstract tasks but also using naturalistic virtual environments that are more relevant to daily life, such as a city or encounters with avatars. VR treatments are conceivable for most dimensions of psychotic disorders. There is a small but expanding literature on interventions for delusions, hallucinations, neurocognition, social cognition, and social skills; preliminary results are promising.

            "abstract": "Ischaemic colitis is a rare side effect of antipsychotics, especially phenothiazines and atypical antipsychotics. The colitis may be precipitated secondary to the anticholinergic effects of such medication rather than a direct cytotoxic effect of the drugs themselves. A 32-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia was admitted to the hospital with a history of diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. His bloods showed leucocytosis. Sigmoidoscopy demonstrated rectal sparing acute colitis, confirmed on biopsy findings. A CT scan also showed similar findings. After careful drug review, it was decided that clozapine was the cause of colitis and promptly stopped. The patient was managed conservatively on intravenous fluids and antibiotics and made a full recovery. Any patient starting antipsychotics should be counselled on their anticholinergic side effects. Drugs should always be considered as a cause of ischaemic colitis; although an uncommon complication of antipsychotics, it can have a potentially fatal outcome."

            "abstract": "In social interactions, valence-based judgments are an important component of interpersonal distances regulation. Within the framework of the Range-Frequency model, we tested whether temporal presentation of an emotional context, known to produce a contrast effect on valence ratings, also influences the regulation of interpersonal distances. Two groups of participants were shown virtual characters with either a neutral facial expression (target stimuli) or an emotional facial expression (contextual stimuli) in two successive sessions (angry then happy emotional context, or vice-versa). Participants rated the valence of the characters and judged the appropriateness of various interpersonal distances. The results showed a contrast effect of the emotional context on the valence rating of neutral characters, which extended to preferred interpersonal distance, although sparingly. The findings revealed thus that the emotional context alters more perceptual-related valence-based judgments than action-related interpersonal distance judgments."

(ii) Is there evidence that the treatment is superior to or non-inferior to (i.e., as good as) active controls? (iii) What is the quality of evidence for the treatment? Pre-specified inclusion criteria identified high quality systematic reviews (2000-2015) reporting treatment effects on anxiety diagnosis and symptom severity. Evidence quality (EQ) was rated using Oxford evidence levels [EQ1 (highest); EQ5 (lowest)]. Twenty-two of 39 eligible reviews were high quality (AMSTAR score≥3/5). CBT (individual or group, with or without parents) was more effective than passive controls (EQ1). CBT effects compared to active controls were mixed (EQ1). SSRI/SNRI were more effective than placebo (EQ1) but comparative effectiveness remains uncertain. EQ for combination therapy could not be determined. RCTs of web/computer-based interventions showed mixed results (EQ1). CBM/ABM was not more efficacious than active controls (EQ1). No other interventions could be rated. High quality RCTs support treatment with CBT and medication. Findings for combination and web/computer-based treatment are encouraging but further RCTs are required.

            "abstract": "A case-control study was conducted to describe the frequency with which structural- and individual-level barriers to adherence are experienced by people receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and to determine predictors of non-adherence. Three hundred adherent and 300 non-adherent patients from 6 clinics in Cape Town completed the LifeWindows Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ART Adherence Questionnaire, the Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Symptoms Screener and the Structural Barriers to Clinic Attendance (SBCA) and Medication-taking (SBMT) scales. Overall, information-related barriers were reported most frequently followed by motivation and behaviour skill defects. Structural barriers were reported least frequently. Logistic regression analyses revealed that gender, behaviour skill deficit scores, SBCA scores and SBMT scores predicted non-adherence. Despite the experience of structural barriers being reported least frequently, structural barriers to medication-taking had the greatest impact on adherence (OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.73 to 3.12), followed by structural barriers to clinic attendance (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.58 to 2.69) and behaviour skill deficits (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.71). Our data indicate the need for policy directed at the creation of a health-enabling environment that would enhance the likelihood of adherence among antiretroviral therapy users. Specifically, patient empowerment strategies aimed at increasing treatment literacy and management skills should be strengthened. Attempts to reduce structural barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence should be expanded to include increased access to mental health care services and nutrition support."

However, there is limited understanding of what factors affect presence in virtual environments. This study uses a qualitative methodology, specifically thematic analysis, to investigate factors affecting sense of presence in a VR social environment that has been designed for psychological assessment. After experiencing a virtual bar-room that contained interactions with multiple avatars, participants (n = 76) took part in a semistructured interview. Eight key themes and associated subthemes were identified: emotions about self (anxiety, paranoid ideation, and detachment), emotions about others (loneliness, retrospective emotions, and recognition of self), thoughts about self (memories and social judgment), thoughts about others (paranoid ideation and narrative), physiological reactions (anxiety and cybersickness), behavior of avatars (narrative, duration of interaction, and characteristics), interactivity with environment (movement and familiarity), and environmental characteristics (restrictions). Sense of presence was facilitated when the VR elicited genuine cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, and when participants created their own narrative about events. Presence decreased when participants experienced diminished agency and experienced physical impediments, such as cybersickness and awareness of apparatus and body movement. Strengths of the study include rich data generated by the qualitative approach and the large sample size. Limitations include lack of follow-up measuring longer-term effects."

            "abstract": "First opened in 1964 in London, the Brook Advisory Centres (BAC) were the first centres to provide contraceptive advice and sexual counselling to unmarried people in postwar Britain. Drawing on archival materials, medical articles published by BAC members and oral history interviews with former counsellors, this paper looks at tensions present in sexual health counselling work between progressive views on young people's sexuality and moral conservatism. In so doing, this paper makes two inter-related arguments. First, I argue that BAC doctors, counsellors and social workers simultaneously tried to adopt a non-judgmental listening approach to young people's sexual needs and encouraged a model of heteronormative sexual behaviours that was class-based and racialised. Second, I argue that emotional labour was central in BAC staff's attempt to navigate and smooth these tensions. This emotional labour and the tensions within it is best illustrated by BAC's pyschosexual counselling services, which on the one hand tried to encourage youth sexual pleasure and on the other taught distinctive gendered sexual roles that contributed to pathologising teenage sexual behaviours and desire.In all, I contend that, in resorting to an emotionally orientated counselling, BAC members reconfigured for the young the new form of sexual subjectivity that had been in the making since the interwar years, that is, the fact that individuals regarded themselves as sexual beings and expressed feelings and anxieties about sex. BAC's counselling work was as much a rupture with the interwar contraceptive counselling tradition-since it operated in a new climate, stressed a non-judgmental listening approach and catered for the young-as it was a continuity of some of the values of the earlier movement."

Current techniques to assess muscle soreness are either time consuming, invasive or subjective. Infrared thermography has been identified as a quick, non-invasive, portable and athlete friendly method of assessing skin temperature. This study assessed the capability of thermal infrared imaging to detect skin temperature changes that may accompany the inflammatory response associated with delayed onset muscular soreness (DOMS). Eight recreationally trained participants (age 25 ± 3 years, mass 74.9 ± 13.6 kg, training minutes 296 ± 175 min·wk-1) completed 6 sets of 25 maximal concentric/eccentric contractions of the right knee flexors/extensors on a dynamometer to induce muscle damage and DOMS. The left knee extensors acted as a non-exercise control. Neuromuscular performance, subjective pain assessment and infrared thermography were undertaken at baseline, 24 and 48 hr post the DOMS-inducing exercise protocol. Data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression and Cohen's d was also calculated. Maximal voluntary contraction torque was statistically lower at 24 hr (d = -0.70) and 48 hr (d = -0.52) compared to baseline, after the DOMS-inducing exercise protocol. These neuromuscular impairments coincided with statistically higher ratings of muscle soreness at 24 hr (d = 0.96) and 48 hr (d = 0.48). After adjusting for ambient temperature, anterior thigh skin temperature was statistically elevated at 24 hr, but not 48 hr, compared with baseline, in both the exercised and non-exercised leg. Thigh temperature was not different statistically between legs at these time points. Infrared imaging was able to detect elevations in skin temperature, at 24 hrs after the DOMS inducing exercise protocol, in both the exercised and non-exercised thigh. Elevations in the skin temperature of both thighs, potentially identifies a systemic inflammatory response occurring at 24 hr after the DOMS-inducing exercise protocol."

A total of 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched healthy controls completed an interactive computer game with an on-screen avatar that participants believed was controlled by an off-screen partner. On social trials, participants were required to achieve joint attention by correctly interpreting and responding to gaze cues. Participants also completed non-social trials in which they responded to an arrow cue within the same task context. While patients and controls took equivalent time to process communicative intent from gaze shifts, patients made significantly more errors than controls when responding to the directional information conveyed by gaze, but not arrow, cues. Despite no differences in response times to gaze cues between groups, patients were significantly slower than controls when responding to arrow cues. This is the opposite pattern of results previously observed in autistic adults using the same task and suggests that, despite general impairments in attention orienting or oculomotor control, patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a facilitation effect when responding to communicative gaze cues. Findings indicate a hyper-responsivity to gaze cues of communicative intent in schizophrenia. The possible effects of self-referential biases when evaluating gaze direction are discussed, as are clinical implications."

Quality of life information using validated measures for different myomectomy routes, especially hysteroscopic myomectomy, is limited.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To compare women's perception of their short-term health-related quality of life measures and reported time to return to usual activities and return to work for different routes of myomectomy.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Comparing Options for Management: Patient-centered Results for Uterine Fibroids (COMPARE-UF) is a prospective nationwide fibroid registry that enrolled premenopausal women seeking treatment for uterine fibroids at 8 clinical sites. For this analysis, we included women undergoing hysteroscopic, abdominal, or laparoscopic myomectomy who completed the postprocedure questionnaire scheduled between 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Health-related quality of life outcomes, such as pain, anxiety, and return to usual activitie, were assessed for each route. The hysteroscopic myomectomy group had large differences in demographics, fibroid number, and uterine size compared to the other groups; thus, a direct comparison of quality of life measures was performed only for abdominal and laparoscopic approaches after propensity weighting. Propensity weighting was done using 24 variables that included demographics, quality of life baseline measures, and fibroid and uterine measurements.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1206 women from 8 COMPARE-UF sites underwent myomectomy (338 hysteroscopic, 519 laparoscopic, and 349 abdominal). All women had substantial improvement in short-term health-related quality of life and symptom severity scores, which was not different among groups. Average symptom severity scores decreased about 30 points in each group. Return to usual activities averaged 0 days (interquartile range, 0-14 days) for hysteroscopic myomectomy, 21 days (interquartile range, 14-28 days) for laparoscopic myomectomy, and 28 days (interquartile range, 14-35 days) for abdominal myomectomy. After propensity adjustment, quality of life outcomes in the laparoscopic and abdominal myomectomy groups were similar except for more anxiety in the laparoscopic myomectomy group and slightly more pain in the abdominal myomectomy group. After propensity weighting, return to usual activities favored laparoscopic compared to abdominal procedures; median time was the same at 21 days, but the highest quartile of women in the abdominal group needed an additional week of recovery (interquartile range,14.0-28.0 for laparoscopic versus 14.0-35.0 for abdominal, P < .01).

            "abstract": "Do people want autonomous machines making moral decisions? Nine studies suggest that that the answer is 'no'-in part because machines lack a complete mind. Studies 1-6 find that people are averse to machines making morally-relevant driving, legal, medical, and military decisions, and that this aversion is mediated by the perception that machines can neither fully think nor feel. Studies 5-6 find that this aversion exists even when moral decisions have positive outcomes. Studies 7-9 briefly investigate three potential routes to increasing the acceptability of machine moral decision-making: limiting the machine to an advisory role (Study 7), increasing machines' perceived experience (Study 8), and increasing machines' perceived expertise (Study 9). Although some of these routes show promise, the aversion to machine moral decision-making is difficult to eliminate. This aversion may prove challenging for the integration of autonomous technology in moral domains including medicine, the law, the military, and self-driving vehicles."

To date, little is known regarding continuous effects of real-world stress on physiological sleep characteristics and potential effects on stress-related psychopathology. We examined effects of stress on heart rate (HR) during sleep and total sleep time (TST) during prolonged real-world stress exposure in medical interns. Moreover, we investigated the influence of previous stress and childhood trauma exposure on HR during sleep, TST, and its interaction in predicting anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We examined a sample of 50 medical students prior to and during their first internship, a well described real-world stressor.

This study explored the effect of anthropomorphism on counseling satisfaction and reuse intention for chatbot-led mental health counseling and the mediating role of social rapport in the relationship. This study also examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and social anxiety on counseling satisfaction and reuse intention. A total of 374 U.S. adults were recruited from an online crowdsourcing company to simulate user-chatbot interactions in the context of mental health counseling. Two chatbots either with a high anthropomorphic design (i.e., human face) or low anthropomorphic design (i.e., robot face) were developed through Dialogflow-a natural language processing engine-to examine the hypotheses. The results revealed that the high anthropomorphic design produced higher counseling satisfaction and reuse intention than the low anthropomorphic design, while this relationship is mediated by the perceived social rapport between chatbot counselors and users. The results further revealed a significant interaction effect of anthropomorphism and social anxiety on counseling satisfaction and reuse intention. The findings of this study are expected to (a) enhance the understanding of the effect of anthropomorphic chatbots on counseling satisfaction and reuse intention, (b) clarify moderating effects of social rapport and social anxiety, and (c) help mental health practitioners and chatbot designers by providing a psychological mechanism of how anthropomorphism functions in the context of human-chatbot interaction."

A 2-D emotional model is proposed to combine robot emotion, mood, and personality in order to generate emotional expressions. In this design, the robot personality is programmed by adjusting the factors of the five factor model proposed by psychologists. From Big Five personality traits, the influence factors of robot mood transition are determined. Furthermore, a method to fuse basic robotic emotional behaviors is proposed in order to manifest robotic emotional states via continuous facial expressions. An artificial face on a screen is a way to provide a robot with a humanlike appearance, which might be useful for human-robot interaction. An artificial face simulator has been implemented to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Questionnaire surveys have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by observing robotic responses to a user's emotional expressions. Preliminary experimental results on a robotic head show that the proposed mood state transition scheme appropriately responds to a user's emotional changes in a continuous manner."

This document focuses on unique aspects of secondary stroke prevention in a woman with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack who is, or is planning to become, pregnant. Although stroke is relatively rare in this cohort, several aspects of pregnancy can increase stroke risk during or immediately after pregnancy. The rationale for the development of this consensus statement is based on the premise that stroke in this group requires a specifically-tailored management approach. No other broad-based, stroke-specific guidelines or consensus statements exist currently. Underpinning the development of this document was the concept that maternal health is vital for fetal wellbeing; therefore, management decisions should be based on the confluence of two clinical considerations: (a) decisions that would be made if the patient was not pregnant and (b) decisions that would be made if the patient had not had a stroke. While empirical research in this area is limited, this consensus document is based on the best available literature and guided by expert consensus. Issues addressed in this document include general management considerations for secondary stroke prevention, the use of antithrombotics, blood pressure management, lipid management, diabetes care, and management for specific ischemic stroke etiologies in pregnancy. The focus is on maternal and fetal health while minimizing risks of a recurrent stroke, through counseling, monitoring, and the safety of select pharmacotherapy. These statements are appropriate for health care professionals across all disciplines."

            "abstract": "Sensorimotor conflicts are known to alter the perception of accompanying sensory signals, and deficits in sensory attenuation have been observed in schizophrenia. In the auditory domain, self-generated tones or voices (compared to tones or voices presented passively or with temporal delays) have been associated with changes in loudness perception and attenuated neural responses. It has been argued that for sensory signals to be attenuated, predicted and sensory consequences must have a consistent spatiotemporal relationship, between button presses and reafferent signals, via predictive sensory signaling, a process altered in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated auditory sensory attenuation for a series of morphed voices while healthy participants applied sensorimotor stimulations that had no spatiotemporal relationship to the voice stimuli and that have been shown to induce mild psychosis-like phenomena. In two independent groups of participants, we report a loudening of silent voices and found this effect only during maximal sensorimotor conflicts (versus several control conditions). Importantly, conflicting sensorimotor stimulation also induced a mild psychosis-like state in the form of somatic passivity and participants who experienced stronger passivity lacked the sensorimotor loudening effect. We argue that this conflict-related sensorimotor loudness amplification may represent a reduction of auditory self-attenuation that is lacking in participants experiencing a concomitant mild psychosis-like state. We interpret our results within the framework of the comparator model of sensorimotor control, and discuss the implications of our findings regarding passivity experiences and hallucinations in schizophrenia."

To this end, we investigated brain oscillatory EEG activity during caresslike, affective haptic elicitation conveyed on the forearm at two force (strength of the caress) and three velocity (velocity of the caress) levels. Thirty-two healthy subjects (16 female) were asked to assess each haptic stimulus in terms of arousal (i.e., intensity of emotional perception) and valence (i.e., pleasantness/unpleasantness of emotional perception) scores, according to the circumplex model of affect. Changes in brain oscillations were quantified through spectral and functional connectivity analyses. EEG power spectra were estimated through the individual α frequency peak. Results, expressed in terms of p-value topographic maps, revealed a suppression of α, β, and γ oscillations over the contralateral somatosensory cortex during unpleasant caresses performed with the lowest force (2 N) and the highest velocity (65 mm/s). Conversely, pleasant caresses at the highest force were associated with a significant decrease of EEG oscillatory activity over the midfrontal region, at frequency bands including α, β, and γ. A correlation analysis showed that EEG γ power from the somatosensory area was linked to caressing force. The more unpleasant the affective cutaneous stimuli, the more the brain dynamics decrease in activity all over the scalp, primarily showing a suppression of α power over the midfrontal cortex. These results also pave the way for the design of haptic systems eliciting a given emotional state."

In Experiment 1, vocalists were recorded with motion capture while speaking and singing each statement with different emotional intentions (very happy, happy, neutral, sad, very sad). Functional data analyses showed that head movements differed in translational and rotational displacement across emotional intentions, yet were similar across speech and song, transcending differences in F0 (varied freely in speech, fixed in song) and lexical variability. Head motion specific to emotional state occurred before and after vocalizations, as well as during sound production, confirming that some aspects of movement were not simply a by-product of sound production. In Experiment 2, observers accurately identified vocalists' intended emotion on the basis of silent, face-occluded videos of head movements during speech and song. These results provide the first evidence that head movements encode a vocalist's emotional intent and that observers decode emotional information from these movements.

They indicated that they would recommend counseling twice as many depressed patients as they would recommend medicating or referring. Over 30% of the variance in self-reported preferences to recommend particular treatments for depression was accounted for by physician characteristics. Prior experience with a treatment strategy was a significant factor in predicting a recommendation for future use of a treatment independent of other considerations such as endorsement of positive attitudes about the efficacy or benefits of a treatment. Prior experience was also more important than physician sociodemographics as a predictive variable. The clinical and educational implications of these findings for psychiatrists and primary care physicians are discussed."

            "abstract": "In this work, we created an end-to-end autonomous robotic platform to give emotional support to children in long-term, multi-session interactions. Using a mood estimation algorithm based on visual cues of the user’s behaviors through their facial expressions and body posture, a multi-dimensional model predicts a qualitative measure of the subject’s affective state. Using a novel Interactive Reinforcement Learning algorithm, the robot is able to learn over several sessions the social profile of the user, adjusting its behavior to match their preferences. Although the robot is completely autonomous, a third party can optionally provide feedback to the robot through an additional UI to accelerate its learning of the user’s preferences. To validate the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children in a long-term, multi-session interaction setting. Our findings show that using this methodology, the robot is able to learn the social profile of the users over a number of sessions, either with or without external feedback as well as maintain the user in a positive mood, as shown by the consistently positive rewards received by the robot using our proposed learning algorithm."

            "abstract": "The frequency of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other components of metabolic syndrome appear to be significantly elevated in some psychiatric patients. This is a notable example of genetic/environment interaction. Considering the genetic contribution, evidence of insulin resistance in persons with schizophrenia was reported in the pre-pharmacological era. High insulin, glucose, and cortisol levels are observed in first episode psychosis. The frequency of type 2 diabetes mellitus is significantly increased in persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and in their first-degree relatives. Finally, a link exists between schizophrenia and enzymes involved in glycolysis and between antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain and serotonin receptor polymorphism. Important environmental factors are poor dietary habits, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and drug treatment, mostly with antipsychotic drugs (APDs) and perhaps with mood stabilizers. The APDs probably induce metabolic dysfunction by producing sudden appetite increase and weight gain in predisposed subjects. However, direct drug effects on glucose and lipid metabolism independent from body weight change have been proposed. Excessive weight gain is mainly observed with clozapine, olanzapine, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine and is less consistently noted with risperidone or quetiapine. Two recently introduced APDs, ziprasidone and aripiprazole, display a neutral effect on weight and metabolism. Subjects at high risk must be identified early during APD treatment so that provide lifestyle counseling and pharmacological assistance can be provided. The immediate research agenda for the APDs is to improve the animal models of drug-induced metabolic dysfunction; to clarify mechanisms other than weight gain and appetite stimulation; and to test pharmacological agents in randomized, double-blind studies to prevent or reverse metabolic syndrome in selected patients."

However, because previous studies have mostly reported on psychological problems and their influencing factors in the first years after transplantation, less is known about their prevalence and influence in the long run. The aims of this study were to examine point-prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) at different time periods after transplantation and to examine the transplant-related variables associated with these problems. A cross-sectional survey was performed among 373 liver transplant recipients who received transplants between 1979 and 2009 at our center. Five clinically relevant time periods were identified: 0.5 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <10 years, 10 to <15 years, and ≥15 years after transplantation. The response rate was 75% (n=281). Overall, 33.4% of the respondents experienced clinically relevant symptom levels of anxiety (28.7%), depression (16.5%), or PTS (10.0%). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were more prevalent in the first 2 years and in the long term after transplantation. PTS symptoms were more prevalent in the first 5 years after transplantation. However, the prevalence rates did not differ significantly between time periods. Viral hepatitis and the number of side effects of the immunosuppressive (IS) medication were found to be associated with all psychological problems. Alcoholic liver disease was associated with anxiety and depression in the short term after transplantation. In conclusion, a significant subset of transplant recipients experience psychological problems, both shortly after transplantation and in the long run. These problems are often associated with side effects from the IS medication. Therefore, the monitoring of psychological problems, the offering of psychological counseling, and the management of the medication's side effects should be part of the routine care of transplant recipients."

            "abstract": "While many psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk for suicidal behaviors (SB) in children and adolescents, a few studies have explored the role of clinical symptoms based on a dimensional approach. Irritability is seen as a marker, a general psychopathology, and a symptom of both externalizing and internalizing disorders. In this review, we are interested in determining whether and how irritability can predict SB in youth. First, we reviewed consistencies and variation in the literature linking irritability to suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA). Second, based on the available models, we proposed specific mechanistic pathways, whereby irritability may modulate the risk for SB. Irritability has been found associated with SB both in cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies. The relation is consistent in different settings (i.e., general population and clinical settings) and across psychiatric disorders. The association is reduced but persists after adjusting for psychiatric disorder, including depression. On one hand, irritability constitutes a risk factor for SI via the onset of internalized disorder. On the other hand, irritable youth may be more prone to attempt suicide when experiencing SI. The measures for irritability were heterogeneous. A limited number of studies were designed to explore the role of mediators and/or moderators. Recognizing irritability in children and adolescents is a key issue with regards to suicide prevention."

            "abstract": "These guidelines propose a treatment algorithm in which patients are evaluated regularly for fatigue using a brief screening instrument, and are treated as indicated by their fatigue level. The algorithm's goal is to identify and treat all patients with fatigue that causes distress or interferes with their daily activities or functioning. Management of fatigue begins with primary oncology team members who perform the initial screening and either provide basic education and counseling or expand the initial screening to a more focused evaluation for moderate or higher levels of fatigue. At this point the patient is assessed for current disease and treatment status, a review of body systems, and an in-depth fatigue evaluation. In addition, the patient is assessed for the presence of seven treatable factors known to contribute to fatigue: pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, anemia, alterations in nutrition, deconditioning, and comorbidities. If any of these conditions are present, they should be treated according to practice guidelines, with referral to other care professionals as appropriate, and the patient's fatigue should be reevaluated regularly. If none of the seven factors are present or the fatigue is unresolved, selection of appropriate fatigue management and treatment strategies is considered within the context of the patient's clinical status: receiving active cancer treatment, receiving disease-free long-term follow-up, or receiving care at the end of life. Management of fatigue is cause-specific when conditions known to cause fatigue can be identified and treated. When specific causes, such as infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction, cannot be identified and corrected, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of the fatigue should be considered. Nonpharmacologic interventions may include a moderate exercise program to improve functional capacity and activity tolerance, psychosocial programs to manage stress and increase support, restorative therapies to decrease cognitive alterations and improve mood state, and nutritional and sleep interventions for patients with disturbances in eating or sleeping. Pharmacologic therapy may include drugs, such as antidepressants for depression or erythropoietin for anemia. A few clinical reports of the use of psychostimulants suggest the need for further research on these agents as potential treatment modalities in managing fatigue. Effective management of cancer-related fatigue involves an informed and supportive oncology care team that assesses patients' fatigue levels regularly and systematically, educates and counsels patients regarding strategies for coping with fatigue, and uses institutional fatigue management experts for referral of patients with unresolved fatigue."

Treatment readiness was lower among individuals who did not think they would test HIV-positive (aOR 0.26, p < 0.05) and among individuals who reported being in good health (aOR 0.44, p < 0.1). In contrast, higher readiness was associated with better ART knowledge (aOR 4.31, p < 0.05) and knowing someone who had experienced positive health effects from ART (aOR 2.65, p < 0.05).

Research in the 21st century has drawn attention to the role of women in culture, society, and technology, and female gaming is one of the growing phenomena not to have been researched in depth. The aim of the present paper was to review female gaming (i.e., the role of females within video game culture) and identify any associated psychopathological symptomatology. The review adapted the Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research (SPIDER) model in conducting a narrative literature review. A search of three scientific electronic databases yielded 49 papers for further evaluation. From a methodological perspective, studies had to fulfill the following criteria to be included: i) published between the years 2000 and 2018; ii) assessed female gaming or the female position within gaming culture, iii) contained quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches to produce empirical data or discuss theoretical implications through reviews, iv) be retrievable as a full-text peer-reviewed journal paper, and v) published in English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or French. Four categories emerged from the papers: i) the benefits of female gaming, ii) why women might play video games less than men, iii) perceptions and realities of female characters within video games, and iv) women's position in gaming culture. The main findings showed playing video games has benefits for women in terms of enhancing cognitive, social, and physical abilities. However, they are less encouraged to play video games due to negative expectations based on gender and/or experiences during game play. Video games are associated with stereotypical male characteristics, such as being overly aggressive, and frequently contain sexualized content. Female gamers appear to require coping strategies to handle online harassment. Females look for different things in video games, which are not often included in game designs thereby limiting their abilities. For instance, female avatar representation-which is exaggerated and hypersexualized-can prompt social comparisons and lead to feelings of decreased self-esteem, depression, and other impacts on well-being. Overall, there are still obstacles for women playing video games even though they comprise half of the gaming population."

Setting Respiratory disease clinics in Nicosia and Famagusta state hospitals and community pharmacies in North Cyprus. Method A cross-sectional multicentered observational study was carried out in respiratory disease clinics and community pharmacies. Patients' knowledge and healthcare providers' perceptions of their roles were evaluated using \"The satisfaction with information about medicines scale\". Evaluation of patient's inhalation techniques was performed using a validated checklist. Main outcome measure (a) Patients' knowledge of their medication and satisfaction with the information provided by health care professionals, (b) the prevalence of critical inhalation mistakes, (c) health care professionals' perceptions of their patient counseling practice. Results A total of 110 patients were evaluated, and 6 physicians and 76 pharmacists were recruited for the interview.

Participants viewed animated virtual characters varying in terms of gender, gaze interaction, and facial expression. We recorded facial EMG, fixation duration, pupil size, and subjective experience. Subject's rapid facial reactions (RFRs) differentiated more clearly between the character's happy and angry expression in the condition of mutual eye-to-eye contact. This finding provides evidence for the idea that RFRs are not simply motor responses, but part of an emotional reaction. Eye movement data showed that fixations were longer in response to both angry and neutral faces than to happy faces, thereby suggesting that attention is preferentially allocated to cues indicating potential threat during social interaction."

            "abstract": "Authoritative information on occupational reproductive hazards is scarce and complex because exposure levels vary, multiple exposures may be present, and the reproductive toxicity of many agents remains unknown. For these reasons, women's health providers may find it challenging to effectively address workplace reproductive health issues with their patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or considering pregnancy. Reproductive epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health answered >200 public requests for occupational reproductive health information during 2009 through 2013. The most frequent occupations represented were health care (41%) and laboratory work (18%). The most common requests for exposure information concerned solvents (14%), anesthetic gases (10%), formaldehyde (7%), infectious agents in laboratories (7%) or health care settings (7%), and physical agents (14%), including ionizing radiation (6%). Information for developing workplace policies or guidelines was sought by 12% of the requestors. Occupational exposure effects on breast-feeding were an increasing concern among working women. Based on information developed in response to these requestors, information is provided for discussing workplace exposures with patients, assessing potential workplace reproductive hazards, and helping patients determine the best options for safe work in pregnancy. Appendices provide resources to address specific occupational exposures, employee groups, personal protective equipment, breast-feeding, and workplace regulations regarding work and pregnancy. These tools can help identify those most at risk of occupational reproductive hazards and improve workers' reproductive health. The information can also be used to inform research priorities and assist the development of workplace reproductive health policies."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nSymptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs, standard orthopedic treatment is less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of standard orthopedic treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study's primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention.\n## METHODS\nIn this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score ≥55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately after the participant's encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activation-based features specifically developed for users with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split.\n## RESULTS\nThe recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference -4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDelivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants' engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot study followed by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04640090; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04640090.\n"

Using a sample of 202 female college students, we examined the changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and general psychological symptomatology among groups of trauma-exposed and non-trauma-exposed women randomly assigned to complete 30 days of daily monitoring of traumatic symptoms and substance use behaviors using personal digital assistants (PDAs). These two groups were compared with a trauma-exposed sample of women who did not complete daily monitoring assessments and only completed pre- and post-monitoring online assessments. While trauma-exposed participants in the monitoring group reported more distress from the daily assessments than those in the monitoring group with no history of trauma, this distress level was relatively low. Online surveys delivered pre- and post-monitoring showed a similar pattern. Trauma-exposed participants in monitoring and no-monitoring groups reported a decrease in general psychological symptoms over the 30 days; however, monitoring participants reported increased levels of PTSD severity over time. Closer examination revealed the observed changes were relatively moderate. Participants expressed benefits and risks regarding study participation supporting the findings that repeated assessments of traumatic symptoms using personal handheld devices may lead to small increases in distress and PTSD symptoms, but that these approaches may be generally well tolerated."

HDL2 cannot be differentiated from Huntington disease clinically. Neurologic abnormalities include chorea, hypokinesia (rigidity, bradykinesia), dysarthria, and hyperreflexia in the later stages of the disease. There is a strong correlation between the duration of the disease and the progression of the motor and cognitive disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      The diagnosis of HDL2 rests on positive family history, characteristic clinical findings, and the detection of an expansion of 40 or more CTG trinucleotide repeats in JPH3.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nTreatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and is presumably similar to that for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders – although this must be considered speculative pending objective data. Pharmacologic agents that may suppress abnormal movements include tetrabenazine and its derivatives, low-dose neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine and haloperidol. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine), and occasionally stimulants may improve psychiatric manifestations. Education about the course of disease and environmental interventions (regular schedules, use of lists to assist memory). Remove loose rugs and clutter from the individual's home and minimize or eliminate the need for stairs to help prevent falls and other injuries; driving may need to be curtailed or limited to prevent risk of accidents; food should be prepared in such a manner as to prevent choking.\n    \n\nSurveillance: Monitor: nutrition and swallowing in order to implement feeding changes when necessary to minimize risk of aspiration; gait and use appropriate strategies or devices to minimize falls; driving to assure that affected individuals do not present a danger to themselves or others; mood and irritability, such that measures to decrease the risk of suicide, other behavioral abnormalities, and distress may be implemented.\n    \n\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Any agents that increase ataxia should be used with caution; avoid polypharmacy, which may exacerbate delirium.\n    \n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      HDL2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. HDL2 resulting from a de novo pathogenic variant has not been reported but is theoretically possible. Offspring of an individual with HDL2 have a 50% chance of inheriting the HDL2-causing allele. Predictive testing in asymptomatic adults at risk is available but requires careful thought (including pre- and post-test genetic counseling) as there is currently no cure for the disorder. Predictive testing is not considered appropriate for asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once an HDL2-causing expansion has been identified in an affected family member."

            "abstract": "The Uncanny Valley Hypothesis (UVH) predicts that greater difficulty perceptually discriminating between categorically ambiguous human and humanlike characters (e.g., highly realistic robot) evokes negatively valenced (i.e., uncanny) affect. An ABX perceptual discrimination task and signal detection analysis was used to examine the profile of perceptual discrimination (PD) difficulty along the UVH' dimension of human likeness (DHL). This was represented using avatar-to-human morph continua. Rejecting the implicitly assumed profile of PD difficulty underlying the UVH' prediction, Experiment 1 showed that PD difficulty was reduced for categorically ambiguous faces but, notably, enhanced for human faces. Rejecting the UVH' predicted relationship between PD difficulty and negative affect (assessed in terms of the UVH' familiarity dimension), Experiment 2 demonstrated that greater PD difficulty correlates with more positively valenced affect. Critically, this effect was strongest for the ambiguous faces, suggesting a correlative relationship between PD difficulty and feelings of familiarity more consistent with the metaphor happy valley. This relationship is also consistent with a fluency amplification instead of the hitherto proposed hedonic fluency account of affect along the DHL. Experiment 3 found no evidence that the asymmetry in the profile of PD along the DHL is attributable to a differential processing bias (cf. other-race effect), i.e., processing avatars at a category level but human faces at an individual level. In conclusion, the present data for static faces show clear effects that, however, strongly challenge the UVH' implicitly assumed profile of PD difficulty along the DHL and the predicted relationship between this and feelings of familiarity."

Sample characteristics were compared to population data, and linear regression analyses were used to examine which risk factors and stressors were associated with current symptom levels.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Seeking for help for COVID-19 related psychological distress was characterized by female gender, younger age, and better education compared to the general population. The majority reported mental health problems already before the pandemic. 74.5% of this help-seeking sample also exceeded clinical thresholds for depression, anxiety, or somatization. Higher individual symptom levels were associated with higher overall levels of pandemic stress, younger age, and pre-existing mental health problems, but were buffered by functional emotion regulation strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results suggest a considerable increase in demand for mental-healthcare in the pandemic aftermath. Comparisons with the general population indicate diverging patterns in help-seeking behavior: while some individuals seek help themselves, others should be addressed directly. Individuals that are young, have pre-existing mental health problems and experience a high level of pandemic stress are particularly at-risk for considerable symptom load. Mental-healthcare providers should use these results to prepare for the significant increase in demand during the broader aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as allocate limited resources more effectively."

            "title": "Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Adolescents With Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility and Acceptability Study.",
            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nSymptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic.\n## OBJECTIVE\nIn this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability.\n## METHODS\nThis small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety.\n## RESULTS\nThe pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04603053; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04603053.\n"
