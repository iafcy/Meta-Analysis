### Abstract

**Background:** Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers
to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial
intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot
alleviated depressive symptoms.
**Objective:** This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.
**Methods:** American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications
were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign,
all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational
lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples
t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures
of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain.
**Results:** The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female,
78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD
14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational
lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting
cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better
retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges
to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions
(mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3,
SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item
(mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale
(68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend
(39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs
(22/51, 43%).

**Conclusions:** W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in
substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in
a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

### Introduction

Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to
society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing
care. Globally, 3.5 million people die from alcohol and illicit
drug use each year [1]. The disease burden of alcohol and illicit
drug addiction is the highest in the United States [2]. Over 20
million Americans (aged 12 years and older) had a substance
use disorder (SUD) in 2018, 73% had an alcohol use disorder,
40% had an illicit drug use disorder, and 13% had both alcohol
and illicit drug use disorders [3]. Approximately half (47%) of
Americans with an SUD had a co-occurring mental illness.
Treatment of depression and anxiety, the most common
psychiatric comorbidities among patients with SUDs, may
reduce craving and substance use and enhance overall outcomes

[4].

In 2018, less than 1 in 5 individuals with a SUD received
addiction treatment [3]. Alcohol and illicit drug misuse and
addiction cost the United States over US $440 billion annually
in lost workplace productivity, health care expenses, and
crime-related costs [5]. Potential effects on individuals include
an array of physical and mental health problems, overdose,
trauma, and violence [5].

Web-based interventions and digital health apps may reduce or
eliminate common, significant barriers to traditional SUD
treatment (eg, stigma; financial, time, and transportation
constraints; lack of access to qualified providers; challenges
navigating complex treatment systems; and low perceived
utility) [6]. Preliminary evidence suggests that digital SUD
interventions affect substance use behavior [6,7] and have the
potential to reduce the population burden of SUDs. To date,
most digital SUD interventions have been delivered on a web
platform, rather than via mobile apps. The widespread use of
smartphones makes app-based intervention delivery a viable
and scalable medium. In 2019, about 8 out of 10 White, Black,
and Latinx adults owned a smartphone [8]. Although
lower-income adults were less likely to own a smartphone than
higher-income adults, they were more likely to rely on
smartphones for internet access [9]. In a 2015 survey, 58% of
mobile phone owners reported downloading a health app [10].
Texting is the most widely and frequently used app on a
smartphone, with 97% of Americans texting at least once a day

[11].

Automated conversational agents can deliver a coach-like or
sponsor-like experience and yet do not require human
implementation assistance for in-the-moment treatment delivery.


As recent meta-analytic work suggests, conversational text-based
agents may increase engagement and enjoyment in digitized
mental health care [12], whereas most general mental health
care apps face difficulty sustaining engagement with high
dropout [13,14]. Conversational agents can provide real-time
support to address substance use urges, unlike traditional
in-person frameworks of weekly visits. The scale potential of
conversational agents is unconstrained, immediate, and available
to users in an instant [12]. Being nonhuman based also reduces
perceived stigma. A study found that people were significantly
more likely to disclose personal information to artificial
intelligence when they believed it was computer- rather than
human-monitored [15]. Users can develop a strong therapeutic
alliance in the absence of face-to-face contact [16], even with
a nonhuman app [17]. Digital environments can promote honest
disclosure due to greater ease of processing thoughts [16] and
reduced risk of embarrassment [17]. Finally, although
conversational agents can present in different modalities,
including text, verbal [18,19], and animation [20-25],
preliminary research on modality for psychoeducation delivery
specifically found that text-based presentation resulted in higher
program adherence than verbal presentation [26].

Evidence for conversational agent interventions for addressing
mental health problems is growing quickly and appears
promising with regard to acceptability and efficacy [27].
Developed as a mental health digital app, Woebot is a text-based
conversational agent available to check in with users whenever
they have smartphone access. Using conversational tones,
Woebot is designed to encourage mood tracking and to deliver
general psychoeducation as well as tailored empathy, cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT)–based behavior change tools, and
behavioral pattern insight. Among a sample of adults (N=70)
randomly assigned to Woebot or an information only control
group, Woebot users had statistically and clinically significant
reductions in depressive symptoms (F1,48=6.03; P=.02) after 2
weeks of use, whereas those in the control group did not.
Engagement with the app was high (averaging 12 interactions
within 14 days) [18].

However, the efficacy of conversational agents for treating
SUDs remains unknown. Woebot’s app-based platform and
user-centered design philosophy make it a promising modality
for SUD treatment delivery; it offers immediate, evidence-based
tailored support in the peak moment of craving. An informal
poll of Woebot users (in July 2018) indicated that 63% had
interest in content addressing SUDs; 22% of surveyed users
reported having 5 or more alcoholic drinks in a row within a

couple of hours (ie, binge use) [28], and 5% endorsed using
nonprescription drugs.

Although the efficacy of automated conversational agent digital
therapeutics for SUDs is still untested, such products are
commercially available, and few consumers are aware that the
products lack evidence [29]. This study aims to adapt the
original Woebot for the treatment of SUDs (W-SUDs), and test
the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a
single-group pre-/posttreatment design.

### Methods

##### Study Design

In a single-group design, we examined within-subject changes
in self-reported substance use behavior, cravings, confidence
to resist urges to use substances, mood symptoms (depression,
anxiety), and pain from pre- to posttreatment. Intervention
engagement data were collected from the Woebot app during
the 8-week treatment period. Acceptability ratings were
collected within the app and within the posttreatment survey.
The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Stanford Medicine.

##### Sample Recruitment

Participants were recruited via the Woebot app, social media
(eg, Facebook and Nextdoor), Craigslist, and Stanford staff and
student wellness listservs. In addition, study flyers were posted
in the San Francisco Bay Area, and email invitations were sent
to participants from previous studies. Recruitment materials
included the URL on a webpage describing the study for people
with substance use concerns. Informed consent was required to
screen for eligibility. Those who screened as eligible were asked
to provide informed consent for participation in the study.


Inclusion criteria were all genders, aged 18 years to 65 years,
residing in the United States, screening positive on the 4-item
Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener-Adapted to Include
Drugs (CAGE-AID) [30] (ie, score of 2 or higher), owning a
smartphone for accessing Woebot, available for the 8-week
study, willing to provide an email address, and English literate.
The CAGE-AID has demonstrated validity, with high internal
consistency in screening for problematic drug and alcohol use;
a cutoff point of 2+ on the CAGE-AID has a sensitivity of 70%
and specificity of 85% for identifying individuals with SUDs

[30]. Study exclusion criteria were current pregnancy, history
of severe alcohol or drug-related medical problems (eg, delirium
tremens, seizure, liver disease, and hallucinations), opioid
overdose requiring Narcan (naloxone), current opioid misuse
without medication-assisted treatment, or attempted suicide
within the past year.

For this study, the target sample size was 50 participants;
however, due to a high level of response and efficiency,
enrollment was more than double our recruitment goal. Between
March 27, 2020 and May 6, 2020, 3597 individuals were
screened for study participation, with 3422 ineligible and 175
eligible individuals. Figure 1 shows the reasons for study
exclusion, most frequently residing outside of the United States
(2566/3433, 74.75%) and endorsing fewer than 2 criteria on the
CAGE-AID (1397/3433, 40.69%). Of the 175 eligible
participants, 141 provided informed consent to participate in
the study, of whom 128 completed the baseline survey. The
analytic sample consisted of 101 participants who ultimately
registered with W-SUDs and initiated use. Among the 101
participants enrolled, 11 (10.9%) reported previous use of the
Woebot app.

##### Procedures

Those who provided informed consent and enrolled were asked
to use W-SUDs for 8 weeks. Assessments were administered
via Qualtrics at the beginning and end of the 8-week treatment
period. Participants received a US $25 Amazon gift card at the
end of the study for completing the posttreatment assessment.

##### W-SUDs Intervention

Described in detail previously [18], Woebot is an automated
conversational agent that delivers CBT in the format of brief,
daily text-based conversations. The Woebot program is deployed
through its own native apps on both iPhone and Android
smartphones or devices. The app onboarding process introduces
the automated conversational agent, explains the intended use
of the device, how data are treated, and the limitations of the
service (eg, it is not a crisis service). The user experience is
centered around mood tracking and goal-oriented, tailored
conversations that can, depending on user input and choice,
focus on CBT psychoeducation, application of psychotherapeutic
skills for change (eg, thought-challenging), mindfulness


exercises, gratitude journaling, and/or reflecting upon patterns
and lessons already covered. Each interaction begins with a
general inquiry about context (eg, “What’s going on in your
world right now?”) and mood (eg, “How are you feeling?”) to
ascertain affect in the moment. Additional therapeutic
process-oriented features of Woebot include delivery of
empathic responses with tailoring to users’stated mood(s), goal
setting with regular check-ins for maintaining accountability,
a focus on motivation and engagement, and individualized
weekly reports to foster reflection. Users become familiar with
Woebot, which is a friendly, helpful character that is explicitly
not a human or a therapist but rather a guided self-help coach.
Daily push notifications prompt users to check in.

We adapted W-SUDs, drawing upon motivational interviewing
principles, mindfulness training, dialectical behavior therapy,
and CBT for relapse prevention. Sample screenshots from the
W-SUDs app are shown in Figure 2. In total, the W-SUDs
intervention was developed as an 8-week program with tracking
of mood, substance use craving, and pain, with over 50
psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic skills.


**Figure 2.** Sample screenshots of the Woebot for substance use disorders app: a psychoeducational lesson called Misinformation, the core conversational
panel (featuring the Lesson Misinformation), and psychotherapeutic skills for behavior change and mood tracking.


CBT evidence-based, guided self-help treatments have ranged
in length from 2 to 12 weeks [31-34], and the National Institutes
for Clinical Excellence describes guided self-help as including
6 to 8 face-to-face sessions [35]. Early responsiveness to SUD
treatment is predictive of long-term outcomes [36], and brief
addiction treatments are efficacious [37]. Brief intervention can
minimize potential dropout, a problem common to SUD
treatment; [38] therefore, we designed W-SUDs as an 8-week
treatment.

Woebot is not designed to address active suicidal ideation or
overdose, and this was stated in the study informed consent. In
addition, Woebot conversationally informs first-time users that
it is not a crisis service. Woebot also has safety net detection
that uses natural language processing algorithms to detect and
flag several hundred possible harm-to-self phrases (including


some misspellings and slang phrases) with 98% accuracy
(sensitivity=97 and specificity=99; Woebot Health, unpublished
data, September 2020). Woebot detects crisis language (eg,
“want to cut myself”) and asks to confirm it with the user. If
the user confirms, Woebot offers resources (eg, 9-1-1, suicide
crisis hotlines), carefully curated with expert consultation.
Woebot data indicate that users do not use Woebot for crisis
management; approximately 6.3% trigger the safety net protocol,
with 27% of those confirming that it is indeed a crisis when
Woebot asks to confirm (ie, the true positive rate).

##### Assessments

Demographic items were assessed at pretreatment; substance
use, mental health, and pain measures were administered at preand posttreatment; serious adverse events and W-SUDs
feasibility and acceptability were assessed at posttreatment; and


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Prochaska et al


W-SUDs use data were collected via the Woebot app over the
8-week intervention. Demographic items included self-reported
sex, race and ethnicity, age, marital status, employment status,
residential zip code, and sheltering-in-place status given the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise
(AUDIT-C), a widely used 3-item self-report measure based on
the 10-item original AUDIT [39], assessed hazardous or harmful
alcohol consumption in the past 3 months. A score of 4+ for
men and 3+ for women indicated significant problems with
alcohol consumption. The AUDIT-C has been found to be a
valid screening test for heavy drinking and/or active alcohol
abuse or dependence [39]. The Drug Abuse Screening Test-10
(DAST-10), a 10-item self-report measure adapted from the
28-item DAST [40], assessed consequences related to drug
abuse, excluding alcohol and tobacco in the past 3 months. The
last item of the DAST-10 regarding medical problems resulting
from drug use was not reassessed because it was an exclusion
criterion in the study screener; hence, the total possible range
for the sample was 0-9, not 0-10. Total scores of 3+ indicated
significant problems related to drug abuse. The DAST-10 has
moderate test-retest reliability, sensitivity, and specificity [40].
For the AUDIT-C and DAST-10 measures at posttreatment, the
reference period was the past 2 months, to reflect the period of
intervention. Craving was assessed with a single item asking,
“In the past 7 days, how much were you bothered by cravings
or urges to drink alcohol or use drugs?”, with response options
of not at all (0), a little bit (1), moderately (2), quite a bit (3),
and extremely (4). The Brief Situational Confidence
Questionnaire [41], a state-dependent measure, assessed
self-confidence to resist the urge “right now” to drink heavily
(self-defined) or use drugs in different situations reported on
visual analog scales (100 mm lines) anchored from 0% “not at
all confident” to 100% “totally confident.”

The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (PHQ-8), an 8-item
scale, assessed depressive symptoms [42], and the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), a 7-item scale, assessed
symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder [43]. Both the PHQ-8
and GAD-7 have good internal consistency and demonstrated
convergent validity with measures of depression, stress, and
anxiety. A total of 2 items assessed the history of therapy (ever
and current) for mental health or substance use concerns.
Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using 10 items
plus a write-in option for others. A single item assessed currently
taking prescribed medications for a psychiatric diagnosis.

The treatment feasibility and acceptability of W-SUDs were
assessed posttreatment using the Usage Rating
Profile-Intervention (URP-I) Feasibility (6 items) and
Acceptability (6 items) scales [44], the 8-item Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire-8 questions (CSQ-8) [45], and the 12-item
Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) [46].
The URP-I item response options ranged from strongly disagree
to strongly agree; the items were summed for a total score within
each scale, with one feasibility item reverse coded. The CSQ-8
items have 4-point rating scales with response descriptors that
vary. Internal consistency exceeds 0.90, and the total sum score
ranges from 8 to 32, with higher total scores indicating higher
satisfaction. The WAI-SR has three 4-item subscales, with


5-point rating scales, that reflect development of an affective
bond in treatment and level of agreement with treatment goals
and treatment tasks. Serious adverse events occurring in the 8
weeks after the start of the study were assessed for
hospitalization related to substance use, suicide attempt, alcohol
or drug overdose, and severe withdrawal (eg, delirium tremens).
Positive endorsements were followed up with questions about
the timing, diagnosis, and resolution. If additional details were
needed to determine whether the event was study related, a team
member reached out to the participant. Serious adverse events
were reported to the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board
(DSMB) within 72 hours of the team learning of the event.

Participants’ W-SUDs app use, including days of app use,
number of check-ins, and number of messages sent, was
collected via the Woebot app, as were module completion rates,
lesson acceptability ratings indicated on a binary scale (ie, a
thumbs up or thumbs down emoticon), and mood impact after
tools utilization (ie, feeling same, better, or worse after
completion). In addition, on a daily basis, the W-SUDs app
assessed mood, cravings or urges to use, and pain.
In-the-moment emotional state was reported through emoji
selection with a default menu of 19 total moods, including
options for negative (angry, sad, and anxious), positive (happy
and content), and average mood (okay), with an additional
ability to type in free text emotion words and/or self-selected
emoji expressions. Cravings were assessed as not at all (0), a
little bit (1), moderately (2), quite a bit (3), or extremely (4).
Physical pain was rated on a scale of 0 to 10.

##### Data Analyses

Descriptive statistics (means and frequencies) were used to
describe the sample and examine the ratings of program
feasibility and acceptability. Paired samples t tests and McNemar
nonparametric tests examined within-subject changes from preto posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence,
cravings, mood, and pain. Change scores were calculated (preminus posttreatment), and bivariate correlations were used to
examine associations between changes in AUDIT-C and
DAST-10 scores and changes in use occasions, confidence, and
depression and anxiety scores. t tests were conducted to examine
changes from pre- to posttreatment in substance use, confidence,
mood, and pain by whether participants were currently in
therapy or taking psychiatric medications. Posttreatment survey
completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among
those with a higher CAGE-AID score at screening (γ=0.37;
_P=.02). Retention was lowest among those with a CAGE-AID_
score of 2 (7/26, 27%) and higher for those scoring 3 (22/38,
58%) or 4 (22/37, 59%). Retention was unrelated to participant
demographic characteristics, previous use of Woebot, psychiatric
diagnoses, primary problematic substance, depressive symptoms,
pain, cravings, confidence, substance use occasions, AUDIT-C
scores, or DAST-10 scores (all P values>.102). Missing data
on individual survey items was minimal. In a single instance,
a participant’s average score values were imputed when missing
1 item on the PHQ-8. Participants were prompted to report
craving and pain ratings within the W-SUDs app on a daily
basis. The data were aggregated so that if participants provided
multiple ratings within a day, the scores were averaged. To
examine changes over time, generalized estimating equation

linear models were run with week entered as a factor, setting
week 1 as the reference category.

### Results

##### Sample Characteristics

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the participants.
According to zip code, the sample was drawn from 31 US states,


and at baseline, nearly all participants (99/101, 98.0%) reported
sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most
(73/101, 72.3%) reported a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, most
commonly generalized anxiety disorder (49/101, 48.5%) and
unipolar depression (45/101, 44.6%), with 47.5% (48/101)
reporting multiple lifetime psychiatric diagnoses; few (6/101,
5.9%) reported a SUD diagnosis, 43.6% (44/101) were currently
taking psychiatric medication, and 25.7% (26/101) were
currently in therapy.

cValues presented are percentages.


##### Substance Use at Pretreatment

Self-identified primary problematic substances were alcohol
(69/101, 68.3%), cannabis (20/101, 19.8%), stimulants or
cocaine (7/101, 6.9%), and other (5/101, 4.9%). Over a third
(37/101, 36.6%) indicated problems with multiple substances.
Most (88/101, 87.1%) reported use of alcohol in the past month;
among past month drinkers, alcohol use averaged 19.4 of the
past 30 days. About half (50/101, 49.5%) reported use of
cannabis in the past month, among users averaging 19.4 of the
past 30 days. Less common was use of sedatives (19/101,
18.8%), hallucinogens (10/101, 9.9%), and prescription
stimulants (10/101, 9.9%) in the past month. None of the
participants reported use of street opioids in the past month.
Combining reported days of use across substances, the number
of use occasions in the past 30 days averaged 31.8 (SD 17.7)
with a wide range of 0-76. At baseline, AUDIT-C scores
averaged 5.5 (SD 3.1) for the overall sample, with 72% (18/25)
of men and 78% (59/76) of women scoring in the clinical range.
DAST-10 scores averaged 3.0 (SD 2.6), with 55.4% (56/101)
scoring in the clinical range. Nearly two-thirds (63/101, 62.4%)
of the sample reported being bothered in the past 7 days by
moderate-to-extreme cravings or urges to drink alcohol or use
drugs. Participants’ confidence in 8 domains to resist urges to
use substances ranged from an average of 60.5% (SD 31.7) for
positive emotional states to 38.5% (SD 30.1) for negative
emotional states, with an overall average of 48.1% (SD 22.1)
and a wide range of 1%-100%.

##### W-SUDs Use and Within-App User Feedback

Among the full sample (N=101), for the 8-week treatment
period, participants’ use of W-SUDs averaged 15.7 days (SD
14.2; median 10; IQR 20) or 2.0 times per week, with an average
of 600.7 user sent messages (SD 556.5; median 360; IQR 763)
or 75.1 messages per week and engagement on average with
12.1 modules (SD 8.3; median 9; IQR 12.5), which consist of
psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools for mood
and behavior change. An indicator of intervention engagement
over time, Multimedia Appendix 1 shows the percentage of


participants actively sending messages by treatment week and,
among those participating each week, their average number of
messages. The types of conversations vary in length; therefore,
the total number of messages sent does not necessarily reflect
the richness of content reviewed. In addition, the individuals in
each week are not necessarily the same across weeks. For
example, someone could have sent messages in weeks 2 to 4
and 6 to 7 but not in weeks 5 or 8. The sample completed an
average of 7.9 psychoeducational lessons (SD 7.6; median 4;
IQR 12). Lesson completion rates were highest (>50%) for
content concerning COVID-19, urge surfing, and SUD labels
and lowest (<5%) for content concerning sleep and grief. Lesson
acceptability ratings were high across the board, with 94.0%
(562/598) of completed lessons receiving thumbs up.
Participants used an average of 4.3 tools (SD 1.4; median 4;
IQR 1). Mood impact after tool utilization, denoting in-vivo
mood modulation, was predominately positive (better=70%,
same=24%, and worse=6%). In total, 14 of the 101 users
(13.9%) completed all of the psychoeducational lessons in
W-SUDs before the end of the 8-week intervention period.

##### W-SUDs Mood, Craving, and Pain Ratings

A total of 1571 mood ratings were entered into the W-SUDs
app by 90 of the 101 (89.1%) participants, with each participant
entering on average 17.5 mood ratings (SD 16.1; median 10;
IQR 25.3) or 2.2 per week. A total of 1399 craving and 1403
pain ratings were entered into the W-SUDs app by 87 of the
101 participants (86.1%), with each participant providing an
average of 16.1 ratings (SD 14.8; median 9; IQR 21) for cravings
and 16.1 ratings (SD 14.9; median 9; IQR 21) for pain. Table
2 shows the number of participants providing craving ratings
for each week and summarizes the generalized estimating
equation model analyzing craving ratings over time. Compared
with week 1, craving ratings were significantly lower at weeks
4 through 9. By weeks 8 and 9, craving ratings were reduced
by approximately half of the sample’s mean rating at week 1.
In contrast, pain ratings did not differ significantly by week and
over the 9 weeks averaged 2.3 (SD 2.1), on a scale of 0 to 10.

##### Changes Pre- to Posttreatment

Table 3 shows scores for the participants who completed
assessments at both pre- and posttreatment. In paired sample t
tests, confidence scores overall and in all 8 domains significantly
increased from pre- to posttreatment (all _P values<.05). In_
addition, significant reductions were observed from pre- to
posttreatment in past month substance use occasions, AUDIT-C
and DAST-10 scores (overall and among those in the clinical
range at pretreatment), and PHQ-8 depression and GAD-7
anxiety scores (all P values<.05). A McNemar test indicated
significant reductions in cravings, with more participants
reporting little to no cravings and fewer reporting
moderate-to-extreme cravings from pre- to posttreatment
(P<.001). Reports of pain intensity and pain interference with
work did not change significantly from pre- to posttreatment.


A greater decline in the AUDIT-C score was associated with
greater reductions in use occasions (r=0.48), PHQ-8 depression
(r=0.36), and GAD-7 anxiety (r=0.34) scores and with increases
in confidence (r=−0.39; all P values<.02). A greater decline in
the DAST-10 score was associated with greater reductions in
PHQ-8 depression (r=0.40; P<.01) but not with the number of
use occasions (r=0.10), confidence (r=−0.12), or GAD-7 anxiety
(r=0.21).

Of the 14 t tests, only 1 was statistically significant as to whether
participants currently in therapy or taking psychiatric
medications showed greater pre- to posttreatment changes in
substance use (use occasions, AUDIT-C, and DAST-10),
confidence, mood (PHQ-8 and GAD-7), or pain. The finding
was that participants currently in therapy reported greater
reductions from pre- to posttreatment in depressive symptoms
(n=16; mean change −4.7, SD 4.5) than those not currently in
therapy (n=35; mean change −0.9, SD 5.1; t49=2.55; P=.01).

##### Serious Adverse Events

Among the 51 participants who completed the posttreatment
assessment, 1 reported a serious adverse event. An individual
reported hospitalization for treatment of sepsis secondary to
switching from smoking to injecting illicit drugs, shortly before
or at the start of study participation, and was deemed by the
DSMB to be unrelated to study involvement.

##### Feasibility and Acceptability Ratings

Table 4 shows the mean scores and ranges of the 4 feasibility
and acceptability measures completed posttreatment. On the
individual CSQ-8 items, the majority (35/51, 69%) indicated
that they would return to the program, reported that interactions


with W-SUDs helped them deal more effectively with their
problems (35/51, 69%), were mostly or very satisfied overall
(36/51, 71%), were satisfied with the amount of help received
(37/51, 73%), rated the quality of interaction on W-SUDs as
good or excellent (39/51, 76%), would recommend W-SUDs
to a friend (39/51, 76%), and received the kind of service they
wanted (41/51, 80%). A lower percentage of participants stated
that W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). Scores
for the 3 WAI-SR subscales, with identical response options,
differed significantly from each other in pairwise _t test_
comparisons (all _P values<.05), with the highest ratings on_
development of an affective bond to Woebot, followed by
agreement on the tasks of treatment and then agreement on the
goals of treatment.

CSQ-8 satisfaction scores did not differ by any measured
participant characteristics, including sex, race or ethnicity,
marital and employment status, age, primary substance of abuse,
or history of a psychiatric diagnosis. CSQ-8 satisfaction scores
also did not differ by baseline measures of depression, anxiety,
pain, craving, confidence, substance use occasions, AUDIT-C,
or DAST-10 scores. Non-Hispanic White participants had higher
URP-I-Acceptability ratings (F1,50=8.32; _P=.006) and higher_
WAI-SR scores (F1,50=5.08; P=.03) than participants from other
racial or ethnic groups. In addition, URP-I-Acceptability ratings
were higher among participants who reported
moderate-to-extreme craving at baseline (F1,50=5.21; _P=.03)._
Finally, older age (r=0.36; _P=.01) and reporting of_
moderate-to-extreme impairment due to pain at baseline
(F1,50=4.36; _P=.04)_ were associated with higher
URP-I-Feasibility ratings.

A greater reduction in substance use occasions from pre- to
posttreatment was significantly associated with higher WAI-SR
(r=−0.37; P=.008) and URP-I-Acceptability (r=−0.30; P=.03)
scores. An increase in confidence to resist urges to use
substances was also associated with higher scores on the
WAI-SR (r=0.30; P=.03), URP-I-Acceptability (r=0.33; P=.02),
and CSQ-8 (r=0.28; P=.045). Changes in AUDIT-C, DAST-10,
depression, and anxiety measures were not associated with
acceptability and feasibility ratings.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

W-SUDs, an automated conversational agent, was feasible to
deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with
significant improvements pre- to posttreatment in self-reported
measures of substance use, confidence, craving, depression, and
anxiety and in-app measures of craving. The W-SUDs app
registration rate among those who completed the baseline survey
was 78.9% (101/128), comparable with other successful mobile
health interventions [47]. As expected, the use of the W-SUDs
app was highest early in treatment and declined over the 8
weeks. Study of engagement with digital health apps has been
growing, with no consensus yet on ideal construct definitions

[48-50]. Simply reporting the number of messages or minutes
spent on an app over time may undermine clarity and genuine
understanding of the type and manifestation of app utilization


related to clinical outcomes of interest [51]. Further research in
this area is warranted.

The observed reductions from pre- to posttreatment measures
of depression and anxiety symptoms were consistent with a
previous evaluation of Woebot conducted with college students
self-identified as having symptoms of anxiety and depression

[18]. Furthermore, in this study, treatment-related reductions
in depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with
declines in problematic substance use. Declines in depressive
symptoms observed from pre- to posttreatment were greater
among the participants in therapy.

This study also examined working alliance, proposed to mediate
clinical outcomes in traditional therapeutic settings [52].
Traditionally, working alliance has been characterized as the
cooperation and collaboration in the therapeutic relationship
between the patient and the therapist [53-55]. The role of
working alliance in relationally based systems and digital
therapeutics has been previously considered [16,17,56]; the
potential of alliance to mediate outcomes in Woebot should be
further validated in future studies adequately powered to
examine mediators of change.

Measures of physical pain did not change with the use of
W-SUDs as reported in pre- and posttreatment measures or
within the app; however, the sample’s baseline ratings of pain
intensity and pain interference were low. Although not a direct
intervention target, pain was measured due to the potential for
use of substances to self-treat physical pain and the possibility
that pain may worsen if substance use was reduced, which was
not observed here.

Within-app lesson completion and content acceptability were
high for the overall sample, although there was a wide range of
use patterns. Most participants used all facets of the W-SUDs
app: tracked their mood, cravings, and pain; completed on
average over 7 psychoeducational lessons; and used tools in the
W-SUDs app. Only about half of the sample completed the
posttreatment assessment, with better retention among those
screening higher on the CAGE-AID. That is, those with more
severe substance use problems at the start of the study, and
hence in greater need of the intervention, were more likely to
complete the posttreatment evaluation. None of the other
measured variables distinguished those who did and did not
complete the posttreatment evaluation. This level of attrition is


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Prochaska et al


commensurate with other digital mental health solution trial
attrition rates [47,57].

##### Comparison With Previous Work

By addressing problematic substance use, including but not
limited to alcohol, the W-SUDs intervention supports and
extends a growing body of literature on the use of automated
conversational agents (or chatbots) and other mobile apps to
support behavioral health. A systematic review of mobile and
web-based interventions targeting the reduction of problematic
substance use found that most web-based interventions produced
significant short-term improvements in at least one measure of
problematic substance use [6]. Mobile apps were less common
than web-based interventions, with weaker evidence of efficacy
and some indication of causing harm (ie, inadvertently helping
users increase, rather than decrease, their blood alcohol level
while partying). However, mobile interventions can be
efficacious. Electronic screening and brief intervention
programs, which use mobile tools to screen for excessive alcohol
use and deliver personalized feedback, have been found to
effectively reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol-related
problems [58]. However, rigorous evaluation trials of digital
interventions targeting nonalcohol substance use are limited

[7]. Furthermore, although a systematic review concluded that
conversational agents showed preliminary efficacy in reducing
psychological distress among adults with mental health concerns
compared with inactive control conditions [27], this is the first
published study of a conversational agent adapted for substance
use.

##### Study Strengths

Study strengths include study enrollment being double the initial
recruitment goal, reflecting interest in W-SUDs. Most
participants reported lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, and
approximately half of the participants endorsed current
moderate-to-severe levels of depression or anxiety. W-SUDs
was used on average twice per week during the 8-week program.
From pre- to posttreatment with W-SUDs, participants reported
significant improvements in multiple measures of substance
use and mood. The delivery modality of W-SUDs offered easy,
immediate, and stigma-free access to emotional support and
substance use recovery information, particularly relevant during
a time of global physical distancing and sheltering in place.
More time spent at home, coupled with reduced access to
in-person mental health care, may have increased enrollment
and engagement with the app. Although further data on
recruitment and enrollment are warranted, these early findings
suggest that individuals with SUDs are indeed interested in
obtaining support for this condition from a fully digitalized
conversational agent.

##### Limitations and Future Directions

This study had a single-group design, and the outcomes were
short term and limited to posttreatment, thus limiting the strength

##### Acknowledgments


of inferences that can be drawn. The sample was predominately
female and identified as non-Hispanic White, and the majority
were employed full-time. Non-Hispanic White participants
reported higher program acceptability on 2 of the 4 measures
compared with participants from other racial or ethnic groups.
Future research on W-SUDs will use a randomized design, with
longer follow-up, and focus on recruitment of a more diverse
population to better inform racial or ethnic cultural
programmatic tailoring, using quotas to ensure racial or ethnic
diversity in sampling. Notably, although recruited from across
the United States, nearly all participants (99/101, 98.0%) were
sheltering in place at the time of study enrollment due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected substance use
patterns and mood as well as interest in a digital health
intervention. Notably, however, alcohol sales in the United
States increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [59]. The
primary outcomes of substance use, cravings, confidence, mood,
and program acceptability were standard measures with
demonstrated validity and reliability. The limitations were that
all were self-reported, and acceptability measures were not
open-ended or qualitative. Few participants were misusing
opioids, likely due to study exclusion designed to mitigate risk,
namely, the requirement of engagement with medication-assisted
treatment and no history of opioid overdose requiring Narcan
(naloxone). Notably, nearly 1400 people with interest in a
program for those with substance use concerns were excluded
due to low severity on the CAGE-AID screener. Worth testing
is the utility of digital health programs for early intervention on
substance misuse that is subsyndromal.

Building upon the findings of this study, future research will
evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more
racially or ethnically diverse sample, balanced on sex and
primary problematic substance of use; will employ greater
strategies for study retention (eg, increased incentives, obtaining
phone contact details, and sending more outreach reminders);
and will be conducted during a period with less restrictions on
social contacts and physical mobility. Randomized controlled
evaluations of conversational agent interventions relative to
other treatment modalities are required [27,60].

##### Conclusions

This study is the first empirical evaluation of an SUD-focused
digital therapeutic delivered via a fully automated conversational
agent. The therapeutic approach is acceptable, feasible, and
safe. The study observed significant reductions in substance
use and cravings in the context of population-level shifts in the
pattern of substance use during a global pandemic. The
scalability and accessibility of an automated program coupled
with the growing problem of substance use suggest the potential
for an engaging and effective therapeutic to reduce the burden
of SUDs. Further research is needed to quantify the adoption
potential and population impacts of an efficacious digital
therapeutic conversational agent for SUD treatment.
