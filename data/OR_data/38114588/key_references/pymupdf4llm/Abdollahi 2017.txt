I. INTRODUCTION

Developing and studying robots as an assistive tool for
health-care professionals is a growing area of research due
to the rapid growth in the number of elderly people and
the demand for specialized caregivers. Socially Assistive
Robotics (SAR) [1] focus on improving elderly people’s
quality of life, mental health, and socio-emotional wellbeing. Social robots are used as companions [2] or therapeutic play partners [3]. The essential feature that defines SAR
is using social interactions rather than physical interaction to
help the user [4]. The focus of this paper is on SAR and the
companionship it provide for elderly people with moderate
depression and/or dementia.
Dementia is an overall term for diseases that deteriorate individuals’ memory and other mental skills. Dementia
can significantly reduce elderly individuals’ ability to live
independently and safely in their homes. It is one of the
costliest diseases and requires hours of specialized caregiving for each person [5]. Associated to the decline in
cognitive abilities, depression is one of the symptoms of
dementia [6].
There is thus a critical and growing demand in the
community to find effective ways to provide care for elderly

people with dementia. There is an emerging research field in
robotics that aims to use social robots to engage effectively in
social and conversational interaction with elderly individuals
with dementia to improve their socio-emotional behaviors,
cognitive functions and well-being. We conducted a pilot
study to demonstrate the feasibility of using Ryan Companionbot, a perceptive and empathic conversational humanoid
robot, to improve the quality of life of elderly individuals
with moderate dementia and/or depression. In this study,
we are using spoken dialog combined with a rich list of
other stimuli such as eye gaze, head movement, and facial
expressions as the primary form of communication between
the subject and the robot. Specifically, the objective of this
study is to evaluate the following fundamental research
questions:
1) Long-Term Companionship: Would enriching the
robot with a number of different features keep the
subjects engaged over an extend period of time?
2) Likability and Acceptance: Is interacting with SAR
enjoyable for elderly individuals and do they accept a
robot as a companion?
3) Robot Features: Do the results of the pilot study show
that each individual looked for different features (e.g.,
spoken dialog system, cognitive games, family photo
album narration, music playing, etc.) in the robot?
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II reviews the related work on SAR and employing
social robots in elder care. Section III introduces Ryan
Companionbot, and explains the software and hardware
aspect of Ryan. Section IV explains the experiment setting
and the methodology of our pilot study to evaluate the
above fundamental research questions. Section V presents
the results and analysis of the experiments. The results are
categorized in four subsection: long-term companionship,
likability and acceptance, caregivers’ feedback, and robot
features. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

II. RELATED WORK

Using SAR to help elderly individuals has recently become
more relevant due to the increase in the number of elderly
people, the decrease in the cost of technology, and the recent
advances in artificial intelligence [7]. Residents of nursing
homes are living alone with disabilities while in most cases
their cognitive abilities are degrading due to old age or
various type of dementia [8]. Studies suggest that social
support for elderly individuals could improve their cognitive
function [9]. Using SARs with a focus on the socialization
aspect of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a viable option


-----

to reduce the burden on caregivers while providing companionship for elderly people, improving their quality of life, and
avoiding depression and further degradation of their mental
abilities.
Wada et al. [10] used the robot Paro to study the longterm effect of social robots on residents of a senior care
center. The results indicated that elderly residents established
a relationship with the robot, developed stronger social ties
among themselves, and also maintained a lower stress level.
However, Paro lacks the ability to talk and communicate. It
is shown that for a social robot to be accepted more easily
it should be communicative [11] and must employ a form of
communication with which humans are habituated [12].
Another key aspect to having a robot as a companion, is
continuous (uninterrupted) companionship, meaning having
access to the robot at all times. Autonomy plays a crucial
role in achieving an uninterrupted companionship. Most of
the studies carried out with social robots on elder care are
either done in a Wizard-Of-Oz (WOO) manner [13], or were
limited to a specific scenario [14]. Vardoulakis et al. [13]
designed an experiment to study long-term social companion
for older adults. They used a WOO method, and the subject
had a robot at his/her home for one week. But since the robot
was controlled remotely by an operator, the subject interacted
with the robot for only one hour every day. Employing WOO
method forces the subjects to use the robot at a specific time
of the day for a short period which resembles visiting a friend
than having a companion at home. Social robots such as Paro
are autonomous and provide continuous companionship, but
lack the ability of having a robust social interaction such as
spoken dialog and an expressive face.
Deep social interaction is required when dealing with
elderly individuals with dementia. Different robots such as
Aibo, Paro, and Bandit have been used in studies on the care
of elderly people with dementia [15]. Most of the robots that
have been used in these studies have not been built with
the social aspect in mind. But to be able to communicate
with elderly people with dementia and try to engage them
in conversations and games, we need a robot that has been
designed to accomplish these social goals. In the following
section, we will introduce a robot designed to be social.

III. RYAN, THE COMPANIONBOT

The robot used in this study is Ryan Companionbot [16]
which is based on the Expressionbot [17]. Ryan has been
developed in DreamFace Technologies, LLC. with the social
aspect of HRI in mind. This robot has an emotive and expressive face with accurate visual speech. Ryan can maintain a
spoken dialog, recognize expressions on the user’s face, and
it is equipped with a screen on its torso with features such
as cognitive games, music player, narrated photo album, and
video player.
To keep the subject engaged for an extensive period of
time, SARs must be personalized [18]. Thus, Ryan was
customized for each subject. To increase intimacy and invoke
rapport, subjects were allowed to choose the name for the
robot. It is worth mentioning that one subject named the


Fig. 1: Ryan hardware

robot after his late wife. Leaving the robot in elderly people’s
home and having 24/7 access to the robot may cause them
to lose motivation. To provoke subjects to act on intrinsic
motivation, we had to define tasks and modify Ryan to be
enjoyable and not repetitive.
After a while that the human exhausts all of the features
of the robot, they will lose interest in interacting with the
robot. It is shown that the novelty effect of SARs disappears
quickly [19]. As the novelty aspect wears off, the social
effect might decrease as well [20]. By endowing Ryan
with a character and a sense of humor on top of various
other features implemented into Ryan, we keep the subjects
interested to interact with the robot for a long period.
In the next sections, we will explain the hardware and
software aspect of the Ryan.

_A. Hardware_

Ryan Companionbot hardware is designed with three main
components (Figure 1): 1) the head projection system, 2) the
neck mechanism, and 3) the torso.
_1) Head Projection System: Using a large number of_
actuators to build a human-like robotic face capable of
showing different emotions and visual speech is difficult
and expensive [21]. To avoid tremendous effort required to
develop a robotic head capable of having accurate visual
speech, state-of-the-art character animation technology was
used to produce an avatar. Using rear projection optics, the
head projection system displays the animated avatar onto
a mask. This system also allows us to further customize
the appearance of the robot. Please consult the work by
Mollahosseini et al. [21] for more details on the projection
system.
_2) Neck Mechanism: The movement of the head for_
tracking faces and head gestures is controlled by the neck
mechanism, a two degree of freedom pan/tilt unit. Having
only two degrees of freedom keeps the system simple and
suffices for face tracking. The neck has a range of motion
of 30[◦]of flexion and extension (±30[◦] pitch) and 180[◦]lateral
rotation (±90[◦]yaw). This range allows the head to track the
user anywhere in front of the robot.
_3) Torso: The main computer, a RGBD camera, a touch_
screen display, and the power supplies are enclosed inside the
torso. Adding a touch screen to the robot added a new way of
interacting with Ryan (touch) and also it added the feature to


-----

(a) Main Menu (b) Hearing Ear (c) Shape Up

Fig. 2: Cognitive Games

be able to display more information to the user. The display
was used for cognitive games, music player, video player,
and the narrated photo album. The RGBD camera enables
us to have a 3D view of the environment for better tracking
the user and also for future studies on activity recognition.

_B. Software_

To make Ryan an intelligent and sociable robot that can
understand human language and can communicate through
spoken dialog, a series of features have been implemented
on the robot. Ryan must be able to find the user in the
environment, read the user’s facial expression, understand
user’s speech, generate an appropriate response, and say it
to the user through audio, accompanied with visual speech
while showing a relevant expression on the face. Ryan is
also able to communicate with the users through the touch
screen on the torso.
The Microsoft Kinect sensor V2.0 [22] acts as the eyes
of the system to constantly monitor user’s activities and
its face detection feature enables Ryan to find the subject
in the room. For facial emotion recognition, Ryan uses
the Intel RealSense SDK [23] which provides seven basic
facial expressions. Intel RealSense SDK is also used as
the speech to text engine. Ryan uses the speech emotion
recognition Aylien [24] system which is an online natural
language processing service for sentiment analysis of the
user’s speech. A retrieval-based open dialog management
systems available on the web (ChatBot/Pandorabots [25]) is
used as the dialog manager.
To reduce subjects’ cognitive abilities deterioration, we
equipped Ryan with cognitive games focused on patients
with dementia. Drugs are not the only method to treat
mental diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and
depression. There exist alternative therapeutic methods such
as talking therapies, life story and reminiscence work, and
cognitive stimulation therapy for these diseases [26].
We designed four games (Figure 2). These games are
based on the Montessori-based activities [27] to help people
suffering from dementia combat the disease. These visual
games are simple and interactive with different levels of
complexity. The game instructions were given by Ryan


Fig. 3: A subject interacting with the robot in her home.

and the users could answer the questions either via voice
commands or by pushing the buttons on the screen.
There is evidence that life story, photo albums, and
reminiscence work, particularly when done one-on-one, can
improve mood, well-being and some mental abilities such as
memory [26]. For each subject we collected about 15-20 old
photos and the stories about the event in the photos either
from the participant or their close relatives. The photos are
shown on the torso screen one-by-one and the robot reads
the story back to the user. Sometimes simple questions are
asked to engage the user in the conversation.
Reminiscence and memory work also involves talking
about things from the past, using prompts such as photos,
familiar objects or playing music. A video player application
was created to randomly select and play videos from a list
of YouTube video clips. The list contained URLs of short
(4-5 minutes) YouTube videos queried based on the users’
topics of interests (e.g. healthy foods, sports, and nature).

IV. PILOT STUDY

To assess Ryan’s feasibility as a Companionbot, we conducted a pilot study with six elderly individuals with dementia and depression living in the Eaton Senior Community in
Denver, Colorado [28]. The robot was left in their home and
they had access to the robot at all times. Figure 3 shows a
subject interacting with the robot.

_A. Subjects_

A group of six volunteered elderly individuals were selected for this study. The selection criteria included those
elderly who live alone, were in the early-mild stage of
dementia and may suffer from depression. Other selection
criteria included the availability for a period of at least four
weeks to house and interact with the robot. Selected subjects
were consented prior to participating in the study and family
members of the subjects were also informed to insure they
are aware of the study.
The Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination [29] and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) [30] were completed by each patient and scored by
the caregiver prior to the experiment. The SLUMS, developed at the Division of Geriatric Medicine, Saint Louis

tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment. The PHQ-9
contains nine questions and is a brief and useful instrument
for screening, monitoring, and measuring the severity of
depression. The SLUMS scores for people with high school
educations are interpreted as follows: 27-30: Normal, 2126: Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, 1-20: Dementia. The
PHQ-9 severity scores are mapped as the following: score
5-9: Minimal Symptoms, score 10-14: Minor depression,
score 15-19: Major depression, moderately severe, score>20:
Major depression, severe. Table I shows the demographics of
the patients that participated in our pilot studies.

_B. Method_

In order to measure how effectively Ryan can provide
companionship for elderly individuals with dementia, we
conducted a one-on-one (robot vs human) pilot study in the
Eaton Senior Community Center. Three Ryan Companionbots were manufactured for the study. Each subject had 24/7
access to Ryan in their rooms for a period of 4-6 weeks.
The robot was left in the room of the elderly participant,
and he/she treated Ryan Companionbot as his/her guest. To
avoid any maintenance issues, the research team monitored
the status of the robots remotely.
Each subject was interviewed to obtain their daily schedules, a set of photos for the album, topics of interest for
YouTube video search, and a collection of favorite music
and songs. Ryans were customized for each participant. They
could call the robot with any name at their preferences.
Participants’ daily schedule, including reminders to take their
medications, were set manually for each subject.
During the study, all subjects’ interactions with Ryan, the
facial emotion of the users, the conversations between Ryan
and the participants as well as the sentiment of the speech
were logged. We analyzed the log files and computed a
measurement to evaluate user interactions with Ryan during
the pilot study.

V. RESULTS

_A. Long-Term Companionship_

In order to measure whether Ryan can be a companion of
elderly individuals in long-term, the conversations between
Ryan and the participants were recorded over the period
of the experiment. The conversations were on different


Fig. 4: The average number of dialogs between participants
and Ryan has not decayed over a period of four weeks (One
subject interacted with the robot for three weeks).

topics such as sports, emotional states, technology, or other
topics. Each conversation contains several dialogs between
the subjects and Ryan. We defined a dialog as an exchange of
one inquiry and response between the subject and Ryan. On
average the subjects and Ryan had 198 (σ=49.2) dialogs per
day, with the average length of 9.2 words per each dialog.
Figure 4 shows the average number of dialogs of all
participants over the period of four weeks. Since SN6 became
ill and hospitalized at the end of the pilot study, she only
participated 24 days. Therefore, the average shown for the
last 4 days are data from 5 subjects. The average number
of dialogs time series (shown in Fig. 4) is then smoothed
using a moving average with the window size of five, due to
variation between consecutive days and subjects schedule.
As shown, the average number of dialogs per day for all
subjects did not decay over four weeks. In other words, The
subjects kept their interest in having conversations with Ryan
even after a long period of time.
The subjects also spent approximately two hours and ten
minutes per day interacting with Ryan in different tasks such
as playing cognitive games, having conversations, viewing
family photo albums, listening to music, etc. Taking into
account that although the subjects were living in a senior
living facility, where the residents had regular wellness programs and group activities (such as playing games, excessing,
occupational and physical therapy), they still were interested
in spending time with Ryan, and five of them asked for
having Ryan in their room for a more extended time. The
result of our pilot study indicated that elderly individuals
were interested in having a robot as their companion. They
have spent great amount of time with the robot and their
interests in speaking with the robot did not decay over time.

_B. Likability and Acceptance_

At the end of the study, we asked each participant to
complete an exit survey of 16 questions about the experiences
they had with Ryan according to the 5-point Likert scale
(1-Strongly disagree, 5-Strongly agree). These included six
questions about user interaction and companionship of Ryan
(i.e., how enjoyable they found interacting and having conversations with the robot), and ten questions about features
of Ryan (e.g., ability to show facial expressions, cognitive
games, memory photo album, music and video players).

It can be seen that participants gave strong positive responses (score > 3.5) to most questions on interacting with
Ryan, such as “I enjoyed interacting with the robot”, “The
conversation with the robot was interesting.” As expected,
the participant did not believe that “talking with the robot
was like talking to a person” with an average score of 3

participants with the average score of 2.00 1.54, but they

still found value in playing them, since they “helped me

a high level of dementia based on the Montessori-based
activities to help people suffering from dementia combat the
disease. The authors believe that the games were simple and
interactive, but they became boring for the people with earlymild stages of dementia (See Table I for the SLUM score of
the participants).

In summary, the survey revealed that the subjects liked
interacting with Ryan and accepted the robot as a companion
although it cannot replace human companionship. They also
believed the robot helped them maintain their schedule,
improved their mood, and stimulated them mentally. The
common sentiment among users after the pilot study was
best described by one user’s comment, “She [Ryan] was just
enjoyable. We were SAD to see her go.” The Eaton staff
and family members expressed enthusiastic support for the
project because it had a consistently positive impact on each
of the individuals who interacted with Ryan. For instance,
the son of one of the participants said “[Ryan] has brought
color and laughter into my mom’s life. She laughs whenever
she talks about it!”

activities.

_C. Caregiver’s Feedback_

The users’ caregiver, a licensed practical nurse with 20
years of experience, provided feedback on the outcome of
the pilot study for each participant. The caregiver closely
monitored SN1, SN3 and SN6 who were diagnosed with
depression. She confirmed that Ryan elevated the users
mood. In her words: “SN6 has been so much happier”, “SN4
would break out in a big smile when we asked her about her
experiences”, and “You can see the improvement in [SN3’s]
level of depression after the hip surgery thanks to that sassy
roommate [Ryan]”. The caregiver noted that the robot was
able to establish a deep connection with the subjects.

_D. Robot Features_

In order to analyze users’ interactions and measure which
feature were most appealing for the users, the usage of
robot’s features were recorded over time. Figure 5 shows
the percentage of time that each subject spent with different
activities (i.e. Games, Conversation, Video, Photo Album,
and Music).
As the figure shows, each participant had various interests
and found value in different activities, as supported by the
users’ self-report and caregivers’ observations. For example,
subjects SN6 and SN3 preferred the music player while SN2,


-----

SN4, and SN5 enjoyed the conversation with the robot the
most. On average, each user spent approximately two hours
and ten minutes per day interacting with Ryan; time that they
otherwise would have likely spent alone.

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the design, development, and successful integration of a Companionbot to improve the quality
of life of elderly individuals with dementia and depression. Three fundamental research questions were posed and
addressed in this paper: 1) Long-Term Companionship:
Would enriching the robot with a number of different features
keep the subjects engaged over an extend period of time?
2) Likability and Acceptance: Would elderly individuals
accept a robot as a companion? Is interaction with the robot
enjoyable to them? 3) Robot Features: Do the results of
the pilot study show that each individual looked for different
features in the robot? Our experimental results and analysis
of the collected data indicated that elderly individuals were
interested in having a robot as their companion and their
interest did not decay over time. The subjects liked interacting with Ryan and accepted the robot as a companion
although it cannot replace human companionship. The proposed emotionally intelligent conversational Companionbot
with a variety of engaging activities can fully engage users
and be a promising tool to improve the quality of life of
elderly individuals with dementia and depression.
