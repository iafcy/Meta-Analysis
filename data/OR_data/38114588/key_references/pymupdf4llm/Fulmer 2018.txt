### Abstract

**Background:** Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies
show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a
less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective
treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative
psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure
support grows.
**Objective:** This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce
self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.
**Methods:** In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All
participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups
consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks
(n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental
Health’s (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the
study.
**Results:** A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from
the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly
Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group
2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with
an electronic link to the NIMH’s eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for
all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group
1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control
group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms
of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of
anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control
group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.

**Conclusions:** This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not
designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering
support.

### Introduction

##### Background

Approximately 20 million college students suffer from mental
illness in the United States alone [1]. More than 50% of college
students report experiencing symptoms of depression and
anxiety that impact daily functioning within the last year [2].
Despite a clear need for clinical services, up to 75% of college
students do not access adequate mental health care [3]. With a
growing desire for on-demand services that engage students
and reduce stigma, Web- and mobile-based mental health
interventions offer a scalable solution.

Mental health care solutions such as computer-assisted therapy
(CAT) have been shown to be a less-intensive and more
cost-effective method to deliver empirically validated treatments
for depression and anxiety [4,5]. Although traditional in-person
treatment remains the standard of care for those with clinical
levels of depression, preliminary studies suggest that self-help
computer-based cognitive and behavioral interventions produce
similar outcomes [6] and are efficacious in the treatment of
subthreshold mood disorders.

Moreover, 1 study revealed that nearly 70% of patients
expressed interest in using mobile health (mHealth) apps to
self-monitor and self-manage their mental health [7]. Early
evidence suggests that patients open up more while using an
mHealth app than during face-to-face therapy [8]. With 1 app
for patients suffering from suicidal thoughts, more subjects
reported suicidal ideation using the app than they did on the
traditionally administered Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)

[9]. Psychological artificial intelligence (AI) delivering cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be a feasible,
engaging, and effective solution for reducing symptoms of
depression and anxiety in college students [10-12]. However,
the efficacy of using psychological AI to deliver integrative
mental health care, including CBT, requires further exploration.
Although CBT is one of the most effective methods for treating
anxiety and depression, evidence shows that alternative forms
of therapy lead to equally successful outcomes [13]. Applying
an integrative approach to therapy for treating patients with
depression has been linked to similar levels of posttreatment
improvement as those receiving cognitive therapy [14].

##### Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of using
the integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce symptoms of
depression and anxiety in an engaging way. Tess was designed


to deliver personalized conversations based on the expressed
emotions and mental health concerns of participants, not to
replace trained therapists. Tess focuses on language as the most
explicit form of communication, with the proposition that
communication between people reveals individual
conceptualizations of specific emotions (unpublished data [15])

[16].

This study compared outcomes from 2 to 4 weeks of using
integrative psychological AI (Tess) with an information control
group (National Institute of Mental Health’s [NIMH] eBook)
in a nonclinical college population. It was hypothesized that
engaging in conversations with Tess would lead to greater
improvement in symptoms relative to the information control
group. In addition, we predicted that the duration of time in
which participants interacted with Tess would impact the level
of symptom reduction. To assess this, participants in the test
group were randomly selected to participate in 1 of the 2 groups,
which received either 2 or 4 weeks of unlimited access to Tess.

### Methods

##### Recruitment

Participants were recruited using a flyer (Multimedia Appendix
1) distributed to professors and alumni via email and posted
through social media outlets such as Facebook and university
community channels targeting students across 15 universities
across the United States. Inclusion criteria included current
enrollment at a university in the United States, aged 18 years
and older (screened at the first level via checkbox confirmation),
and able to read English (implied). To guard against
compromise, for example, from malicious bots, all potential
participants were sent an email requesting that they respond
using their university email denoting their confirmation.

Confirmed participants were randomized via a computer
algorithm that automatically generated a number between 0 and
2 (Figure 1). All participants completed the baseline
questionnaires. Participants with number 0 were sent a link to
NIMH’s eBook [17] on depression among college students.
Participants with numbers 1 and 2 were allocated to receive a
direct link to begin chatting with Tess via an instant messenger
app. To assess the impact on duration of access on symptom
reduction, group 1 participants were granted unlimited access
to Tess for 2 weeks and group 2 participants for 4 weeks.
Because the randomization allocation occurred algorithmically,
allocation concealment was in place. However, the condition
to which each participant was allocated was not masked for the
service providers (Tess). After approximately 2 weeks (group

to complete a second set of questionnaires online. Participants both assessments.

##### Ethics and Informed Consent

This study was retrospectively registered under the trial number
of ISRCTN61214172, and involved a nonclinical population
of college students. Refer to the Multimedia Appendix 2 for
this study’s Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-eHealth
checklist [18].

Participants indicated their consent to the study’s terms via a
checkbox (e-signature) on a closed form (Multimedia Appendix
3) sent via email. The consent informed participants about the
study criteria, intervention details, confidentiality, incentives,
participant rights, and whom to contact for questions or request
to withdraw. Participants who expressed suicidal ideation or
self-harm were provided with numbers to a crisis helpline and
suicide prevention text line. A total of 75 participants signed
the informed consent, and 74 of those completed this study with
0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from
the control group (1/24).

The third author of this paper served as an external
representative to support data collection and analysis, which
was provided by X2AI Inc. All data, including usage, was
deidentified so as to protect the privacy of participants and was
reported in aggregate only.


##### Interventions

 Tess

Tess is a psychological AI chatbot designed by X2AI Inc to
deliver brief conversations in the form of integrative mental
health support, psychoeducation, and reminders. Tess serves as
a therapeutic tool or resource that can be used as an adjunct to
therapy that supports an integrative approach and is not intended
to replace the role of a therapist.

Tess was inspired by the first conversational AI, ELIZA, which
examined natural language communication between people and
machines in the 1960s [19]. Where ELIZA was limited, Tess
has excelled with the rapid advancement of technology and
machine learning strategies that help improve AI memory and
emotion identification.

The novelty of Tess is that it is a customizable platform, which
allows for content to be tailored aligning with a specific form
of treatment or user demographics, for example, 1 large health
system in the United States customized Tess to deliver
interventions based on motivational interviewing and behavioral
activation to help reinforce weight management goals in a group
of adolescents suffering from prediabetes symptoms
(unpublished data [20]). To prevent misuse of the system,
organizations are educated on Tess’ ethical AI code, which
includes principles from the 2018 Lords Report [21] and the
American Psychological Association Code of Conduct [22].

**Technical Overview**
Tess is maintained using a combination of technologies, emotion
algorithms, and machine learning techniques to support a variety
of features. Collaboration with mental health and emotion
experts is a critical element of Tess’ capacity for success. All
content is developed, screened, and matched to specific user
inputs (ie, emotions and topics) by experienced professionals.
The partnership required between humans and technology to
create and maintain the chatbot is made possible through an
administration panel that may be integrated with existing
electronic health record systems. Each organization or clinician
is provided a log-in with restricted access to manage their clients
(Tess users) and content. For this study, the principal
investigator and authors were provided with unique log-ins to
a restricted view of participant interactions with Tess. Personally
identifiable information was removed from all transcripts.
Processing and storage are done on secure servers that meet
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant
regulations. Data are stored within the country of residence for
all participants given access.

Tess can be configured to deliver services through existing
communication channels such as Facebook messenger, Slack,
and short messaging service text messaging, without requiring
users to download an app. Users can access Tess using a mobile
phone number or through their personal accounts associated
with a specific communication channel. Tess is capable of
interpreting free text messages; alternatively, users can opt for
preselected responses similar to existing chatbots. This enhances
Tess’ capacity to deliver more personalized and integrative
interventions.

**Customization**
Content was specially selected, expanded upon, and tested by
mental health professionals for the purpose of this study.
Furthermore, 30 min to 1-hour interviews were conducted with
students, professors, and university counselors to support content
development. User acceptance testing was conducted with a
small group of students, which provided feedback to enhance
the quality and reliability of interventions and scripts. A modest
amount of emojis were included in the conversations to increase
user engagement.

To support the evaluation of duration and frequency of automatic
messages from Tess, the test groups were assigned to 1 of the
2 experiments. Group 1 received daily messages from Tess over
a 2-week period, introducing new topics or following up on
previously discussed concerns. Group 2 received the same
content and option for follow-up messages from Tess, but with
biweekly messages over a 4-week period. It is of note that Tess
was disguised as _Zara for this study to prevent bias in the_
unlikely chance that participants had been exposed to Tess
through another initiative.

Although Tess is capable of connecting users with a counselor
in case of crisis, this study limited crisis support to match the
methodology of a previous study [10]. If users reported suicidal
or homicidal ideation or indicated a crisis, Tess provided
numbers to the national suicide prevention hotline, crisis text
line, and 911 and encouraged the user to end the chat and reach
out for professional help.


**Integrative Support Approach**
Tess delivers mental health interventions that have repeatedly
been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety,
such as CBT [23], which maintains a strong evidence base [24].
In addition to CBT, Tess can also deliver a variety of similar,
clinically proven therapies, dependent on both the emotions
reported by the individual and the nature of their concern. These
include interventions based on the transtheoretical model [25],
emotionally focused therapy [26,27], solution-focused brief
therapy [28], motivational interviewing [29], and more. By
interacting with Tess, users experience the benefits of journaling,
which has been shown to increase the positive perception of
experiences [30] and significantly improve self-efficacy [31].

During the study, Tess delivered interventions rooted in a variety
of psychological modalities such as CBT, mindfulness-based
therapy, emotionally focused therapy, acceptance and
commitment therapy, motivational interviewing,
self-compassion therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy. For
example, journaling and relaxation strategies are used across
multiple modalities, although the strategy and language used
to deliver these interventions vary. Tess is structured to reply
with prescripted statements, reviewed by mental health
professionals, to replicate an empathic response that is
appropriate to the participants’ inputted emotion or concern

[32]. For example, in response to endorsed loneliness, Tess
replied “I’m so sorry you’re feeling lonely. I guess we all feel
a little lonely sometimes,” or Tess showed excitement by
replying, “Yay, always good to hear that!.” Specific
interventions are delivered based on the users’ reported mood.
For example, a participant indicating that he or she feels anxious
may be offered a relaxation strategy to cope in the moment.

Just as therapists adjust their style to accommodate a client’s
therapeutic preference over time, Tess gathers feedback to
deliver interventions that best meet a user’s needs. After every
intervention, Tess asks a simple question such as “was that
helpful?,” to which user replies are coded as either positive,
negative, or neutral. For example, if a user responds positively
(ie, yes, thank you) to a CBT-based intervention and negatively
(ie, no, not really) to self-compassion therapy, Tess will deliver
more interventions rooted in CBT. For users who respond
negatively or neutrally, Tess will continue to offer alternative
interventions until the user responds positively or voluntarily
ends the conversation.

##### Information Control Condition

Participants in the information-only control group were provided
with an electronic link to the NIMH’s eBook on depression
among college students [33]. The eBook is free for the public
and provides evidence-based information and resources to help
students identify, and seek treatment for, symptoms of
depression. It also recommends additional literature and provides
helpline numbers. Although participants in this group were not
granted access to Tess during the course of the study, they were
provided access on completion as an additional source of
support.

##### Measures

Participants were invited to take the following assessments via
a closed email survey so that only those who were invited could
gain access. All assessments were delivered through Google
Forms.

##### The Patient Health Questionnaire-9

The PHQ-9 [34] is a 9-item, self-report questionnaire that
evaluates the frequency and severity of symptoms of depression
within the previous 2 weeks. Each of the 9 items is based on
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-4) criteria for major depressive disorder and can be scored
on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. The PHQ-9 is
one of the most widely used, reliable, and validated measures
of depressive symptoms. If a participant scores between 0 and
5, this indicates they do not experience symptoms of depression.
Scores of 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 20, and >20 indicate mild,
moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression,
respectively.

##### Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) [35]
is a valid, brief self-report tool to assess the frequency and
severity of anxious thoughts and behaviors over the past 2
weeks. On the basis of the DSM-4 diagnostic criteria for GAD-7,
the scores of all 7 items range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day). If a participant scores less than 10, it indicates
moderate anxiety. A score greater than 15 indicates severe
anxiety.

##### Positive and Negative Affect Schedule

The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [36] is a
20-item self-report measure of current positive and negative
affect. Half of the items represent positive affect (ie, interested,
excited, and determined), whereas the other half are indicative
of negative affect (ie, hostile, scared, and ashamed). Items are
scored on a 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale,
with higher scores representing higher affect. Scores range from
10 to 50, and positive and negative affect are summed
independent of each other.

##### User Satisfaction and Engagement

A user satisfaction survey was created, tested for usability and
technical functionality, and delivered to all participants at the
end of the study to gather qualitative results. The survey
included 9 questions, with 4 scaled questions, such as: “How
satisfied were you overall?” and “How satisfied were you with
the content?” as well as 2 open-ended questions, such as “What
was the best thing about using the chatbot?” The remaining 3
questions were forced choice with response options of yes or
no, such as “Did you learn anything new?.” Finally, for test
group participants only, we measured engagement based on the
number of messages exchanged between Tess and the
participants per group and in total.

##### Statistical Analysis

Analyses were conducted using SPSS. A multivariate analysis
of covariance (MANOVA) was used to compare the anxiety
(GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and PANAS scale means of


male and female students for the 3 groups, namely, control,
group 1 (Tess for 2 weeks), and group 2 (Tess for 4 weeks).
The multivariate analysis showed significance between the
control group and group 1, F3=3.146, P=.3. The univariate F
tests for anxiety and depression were significant across all
scales, between control and group 1, _F2=3.491,_ _P=.3 for_
PANAS, F2=4.037, P=.02 for PHQ, and F2=4.497, P=.01 for
GAD-7. Thus, anxiety and depression were significantly
decreased through students’ use of Tess.

A post hoc analysis showed a significant difference was found
with the Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference Test
(Multimedia Appendix 4) on the PANAS between the control
and group 1. A statistically significant difference was found on
the PHQ-9 between the control and group 1 at an alpha level of
.05. For multivariate tests, the tests of between-subject effects,
and intervention sample GIF, see Multimedia Appendix
5,Multimedia Appendix 6, and Multimedia Appendix 7,
respectively. This finding confirms Tess was helpful in
decreasing depressive symptoms. A statistically significant
difference was found on the GAD-7 between the control group
and both groups 1 and 2, at an alpha level of .05. This finding
supports the hypothesis that Tess would be helpful in decreasing
anxiety symptoms. Due to attrition, 1 control group participant
was dropped out and not included in the total N for the control
group.

### Results

##### Participant Demographics

Table 1 shows the demographic information and baseline scores
on clinical variables for those with data from the entire sample
(N=74). Participants were aged on an average 22.9 years and
over two-thirds were female. The majority of participants were
Asian (37/74, 51%) and white (32/74, 41%).

In the control group, 67% (16/24) of participants were females,
29% (7/24) were males, and 4% (1/24) identified as
nonconforming. The average age for the control group was 22.5
years. The majority of the control group participants were white
(11/24, 46%). The remainder of the control group participants
were Asian (8/24, 33%), other (3/24, 13%), and African
American (2/24, 8%).

Group 1 consisted of 17 (17/24, 71%) females and 7 (7/24, 29%)
males out of 24 participants. The average age for group 1 was
24.1 years. This group consisted of mostly white (13/24, 54%)
and Asian (11/24, 46%) participants.

Group 2 consisted of 19 (19/26, 73%) females and 7 (7/26, 27%)
males out of 26 participants. The average age for group 2 was
22.2 years. This group had mostly Asian participants (18/26,
69%), with 31% (8/26) being white.

##### Participants’ Clinical Variables

Table 1 shows the scores for the 2 scales and for the subscales
of the PANAS. In the control group, the average PHQ-9 score
was 8.17, for group 1 it was 6.67, and for group 2 it was 7.04.
The GAD-7 had an average score of 9.46 for the control group,
6.71 for group 1, and 7.5 for group 2. The average positive affect

##### Analysis

Statistical power calculations using MANOVA revealed a
moderate to large effect size (Cohen _d=0.68) for depression,_
with an alpha at 5%.

##### The Patient Health Questionnaire-9

A statistically significant difference was found between the
control group and group 1, which had unlimited access to Tess
with daily check-ins for 2 weeks (P=.02) as measured by the


PHQ-9. Figure 2 shows that MANOVA revealed a significant
group difference on depression such that for the test group
participants, symptoms of depression over the study period were
significantly reduced, whereas for the information control group,
their symptoms of depression were increased. Although the
increase found in the control group is probably because of the
inability to adjust for potential confounding variables,
participants in this group may have experienced a slight increase
in symptoms over time. Overall, these findings suggest that
Tess was helpful in decreasing depressive symptoms.

##### Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7

A statistically significant difference was found between the
control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of
anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group
2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of
anxiety, whereas the control group did not.

A statistically significant difference was found on the GAD-7
between the control group and both groups 1 and 2. For group
1, the P value of .045 was statistically significant at an alpha
level of .05. For group 2, the P value of .02 was statistically
significant at an alpha level of .05. Figure 3 shows that
MANOVA revealed a significant group difference on anxiety
such that those in the test group experienced significantly
reduced symptoms of anxiety over the study period as measured
by the GAD-7, whereas those in the information control group
experienced increased symptoms of anxiety. This increase might
be explained similarly to the aforementioned depressive
scores—inability to adjust for potential confounding variables,
or simply that, participants may have experienced a slight
increase in symptoms over time. These findings support the
hypothesis that Tess would be helpful in decreasing anxiety
symptoms.


##### Positive and Negative Affect Schedule

A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS
between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests
that Tess did impact the scores.

##### User Satisfaction and Engagement

Table 2 shows the difference between the information control
group and the test group based on answers for the user
satisfaction survey to gather qualitative results. This table shows
a significant difference between both groups. For example, 86%
(43/50) participants were overall satisfied with Tess and only
60% (14/24) with the eBook. Moreover, 80% (40/50) learned
something new from Tess, and 43% (10/24) learned something
new from the eBook.

Figure 4 shows a thematic map of participants’responses to the
question “What was the best thing about your experience using
Tess?” Two major themes emerged in respect to this question:
process and content. In the process theme, the subthemes that
emerged were accountability from accessibility (noted by 15/50
participants); the empathy that the bot showed (6/50
participants); and the learning that the bot facilitated (11/50
participants), which in turn was divided into further subthemes
of emotions and general insights.

Figure 5 illustrates a thematic map of participants’ responses
to the question, “What was the worst thing about your
experience with Tess?” Two themes emerged: process (31/50
participants) and problems with content (19/50). The most
common subtheme to emerge among the process violations
related to the limitations in natural conversation (12/50) and
the bot not being able to understand some responses or getting
confused when unexpected answers were provided by
participants (11/50). Problems with content were described by
20% (10/50) of participants, most of which related to not enough
interactivity (7/50, 14%).

A total of 48 open comments were received as feedback from
50 participants. Overall, 2 participants appeared to find their
interaction with Tess to be particularly meaningful:

_Based on our interactions I do somewhat feel like I’m_
_talking to a real person and I do enjoy the tips you’ve_
_given. In that sense, you’re better than my therapist_


_in that she doesn’t necessarily provide specific ways_
_I can better myself and problems._
_I’ve been learning new things and I have some ideas_
_on ways I can make small changes that could help_
_me!._
Engagement was measured based on the number of messages
exchanged between Tess and the participants. The X2AI Inc
administration panel was used to calculate engagement metrics
reported in this section. Participants from both test groups
exchanged a total of 14,238 messages with Tess. Group 1
exchanged an average of 283 messages with daily pings and
unlimited access to Tess for 2 weeks (SD 147.6; median 278;
range 72-755). Group 2 exchanged an average of 286 messages
with biweekly pings and unlimited access to Tess for 4 weeks
(SD 104.6; median 288; range 133-535). Although we were
unable to measure engagement of the NIMH eBook as it was
not possible to track page views or URL click rates, 15 (15/24,
63%) control group participants reported that they were satisfied
with the content supplied.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and
efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI to reduce
self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college
students. The methodology and results aligned with those from
a previous randomized trial, which examined the potential for
a chatbot to deliver CBT-based interventions to college students



[10]. Our hypotheses were that students would experience a
greater reduction in symptoms of (1) depression and (2) anxiety
after interacting with the integrative psychological AI for a
period of 2 or 4 weeks when compared with participants in the
information-only control group. Furthermore, we predicted that
the test groups would report a more engaging and convenient
experience than participants from the control group.

Results revealed that both test groups 1 and 2 experienced a
significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety with unlimited

access to Tess over the course of 2 or 4 weeks. Furthermore,
the test group that received daily check-ins from Tess over 2
weeks experienced a significant reduction in symptoms of
depression. Participants who interacted with Tess displayed
higher levels of engagement and overall satisfaction than those
from the control group. Test group participants indicated that
the content was more relevant to their everyday life and made
them more comfortable with the therapeutic experience.

##### Limitations

Although this study included participants across 15 universities
across the United States, the generalizability of results is limited,
particularly as socioeconomic status was not formally assessed.
The recruitment method further limits generalizability as we
are unable to evaluate differences between the participants in
this study who were recruited via social media and individuals
who may use Tess but are not active on social media. The
methodology called for 2 test groups and 1 control group,
making the number of participants per group more limited. In
addition, this study did not collect follow-up data to assess if
benefits were sustained over time. Alternative to previous
studies, the control group experienced a slight increase in
symptoms of anxiety and depression, suggesting that the eBook
was not a sufficient form of mental health support. One possible
explanation for this outcome is that the eBook may have
increased awareness of symptoms without providing ongoing
treatment, leading to an increase over time. One study revealed
that consumers of self-help books are more sensitive to stress
and show higher depressive symptomatology [37]. Due to
recruiting participants from a nonclinical sample, baseline
depression (measured by PHQ-9) and anxiety (measured by
GAD-7) scores were low. Therefore, additional research needs
to be done to assess the feasibility of Tess in supporting
individuals with clinical levels of depression and anxiety. Future
studies should include control conditions that allow for a more
direct comparison between delivery of services such as
traditional therapy, as well as tech-based solutions, including
teletherapy, interactive Web-based courses, and virtual reality.

Traditional therapeutic methods allow for emotional assessment
on many different levels, including facial expressions, body
cues, tone of voice, and language. The psychological AI used
in this study delivered interventions via conversation, and
therefore emotion identification was limited to language. It is
unclear how much this limited the psychological AI’s
assessment of emotion, as language is the most readily available
nonphenomenal access people have to emotions. Assessing
emotion through facial expressions [38,39] appears unreliable
because of the overlap of expressive characteristics among
seemingly basic emotions, resulting in the taxonomy of facial
expressions not adequately describing the taxonomy of emotions

[15].

Finally, the system errors, as expressed during qualitative
feedback, are explained by the research team’s limited resources
and attempt to keep all content approved by experts intact.
During the study, changes to the system were restricted, and so
the research team was unable to report errors related to natural
language processing or emotion mismatch until the completion
of the study.


##### Comparison With Prior Work

Aligned with results from a previous study, using Tess was
associated with a significant reduction in depression and anxiety
as measured by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. The effect
size (Cohen d=0.68) for depression was moderate and greater
than previously published studies [10,40-42] that measured the
efficacy of using alternative mobile app interventions to relieve
symptoms of depression. This study included 2 test groups to
evaluate differences in symptom reduction based on 2- to 4-week
intervention periods. The effect size for reduction of symptoms
is aligned with that found by a previous study when delivering
a CBT-based chatbot to college students in the United States

[10]. Although speculative, the greater effect size found in this
study may be due, in part, to the integrative mental health
approach applied to deliver more personalized interventions. In
addition, the content used to create Tess conversations was
derived from written transcripts that allowed participants to
respond with free text, versus predominantly using buttons to
receive videos and other resources on a timely basis as the
chatbot in a previous study did [10].

With a growing demand for scalable solutions that deliver more
cost-effective mental health support, it has been shown that
CAT is capable of delivering empirically validated treatments
for depression and anxiety [26]. Preliminary studies suggest
that self-help computer-based cognitive and behavioral
interventions produce similar outcomes to in-person treatment

[27]. Clinical treatment outcomes have been higher for patients
prescribed to use psychotherapeutic computer programs
compared with programs that are delivered in a self-help format
with no clinician involvement [38].

Previous studies suggest that individuals are more willing to
disclose personal information to a psychological AI than to a
_virtual therapist purportedly operated by a human [9,10,43]._
This was supported by feedback given by student participants
who engaged on a more personal level with Tess for this study.
Students reported:

_I do somewhat feel like I’m talking to a real person._
_...you’re better than my therapist [who] doesn’t_
_necessarily provide specific ways I can better myself.”_
And that Tess was able to:

_coach [the participant] through a difficulty._
These comments reinforce the potential for psychological AI
to remove barriers and stigma and operate as an adjunct to
traditional therapeutic methods.

##### Conclusions

This study reveals that AI offers a cost-effective and accessible
mental health solution and may serve as a scalable tool to
complement traditional treatment methods. Although integrative
psychological AI is not designed or intended to replace the role
of a trained therapist, Tess emerges as a feasible option for
delivering emotional support. The results support and expand
on findings from a previous randomized controlled trial [10]
and demonstrate that psychological AI has the potential to
reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety by delivering
CBT-based interventions in the form of conversations.
