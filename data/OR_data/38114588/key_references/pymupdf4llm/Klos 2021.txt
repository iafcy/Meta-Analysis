### Abstract

**Background:** Artificial intelligence–based chatbots are emerging as instruments of psychological intervention; however, no
relevant studies have been reported in Latin America.
**Objective:** The objective of the present study was to evaluate the viability, acceptability, and potential impact of using Tess, a
chatbot, for examining symptoms of depression and anxiety in university students.
**Methods:** This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. The experimental condition used Tess for 8 weeks, and the control
condition was assigned to a psychoeducation book on depression. Comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U and
Wilcoxon tests for depressive symptoms, and independent and paired sample t tests to analyze anxiety symptoms.
**Results:** The initial sample consisted of 181 Argentinian college students (158, 87.2% female) aged 18 to 33. Data at week 8
were provided by 39 out of the 99 (39%) participants in the experimental condition and 34 out of the 82 (41%) in the control
group. On an average, 472 (SD 249.52) messages were exchanged, with 116 (SD 73.87) of the messages sent from the users in
response to Tess. A higher number of messages exchanged with Tess was associated with positive feedback (F2,36=4.37; P=.02).
No significant differences between the experimental and control groups were found from the baseline to week 8 for depressive
and anxiety symptoms. However, significant intragroup differences demonstrated that the experimental group showed a significant
decrease in anxiety symptoms; no such differences were observed for the control group. Further, no significant intragroup
differences were found for depressive symptoms.
**Conclusions:** The students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging messages with Tess and positive feedback was
associated with a higher number of messages exchanged. The initial results show promising evidence for the usability and
acceptability of Tess in the Argentinian population. Research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and further research is needed.

### Introduction

The most prevalent disorders in Argentina are anxiety (16.4%)
and mood (12.3%) disorders. The average age for the onset of
these conditions is 20 years [1]. The Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) and the Argentinian Ministry of Health
have highlighted the importance of optimizing health care
services for individuals who are not receiving any form of
psychological care [2]. Furthermore, the epidemiological data
collected in Argentina emphasizes the need for strategies that
prevent delays to treatment access [1]. Behavioral intervention
technologies (BITs) are a novel and effective delivery format
that can expand the mental health services offered and facilitate
early access to those in need [3]. Chatbots are examples of BITs
that represent an opportunity for addressing delays associated
with access to treatment for depression and anxiety [4].
However, no studies on the use of chatbots for analyzing
depression and anxiety have been conducted in Argentina.

Chatbots developed using artificial intelligence (AI) are
emerging in the field of psychology [5]. Currently, there are
two chatbots that have addressed anxiety and depressive
symptoms, Woebot [6] and Tess [7]. Woebot is a chatbot based
on the cognitive behavioral approach with evidence for the
reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms in students during
a follow-up after 2 weeks. Fulmer et al [7] reported a reduction
in depressive and anxiety symptoms in college students using
Tess, a chatbot that provides support and psychoeducation
through an integrative approach. Although the research
completed by Fulmer et al [7] and Fitzpatrick et al [6] reported
decreased depressive and anxiety symptoms in college students,
these studies were performed in the United States. To the best
of our knowledge, there are no studies on chatbots used for
addressing mental health disorders in Spanish-speaking
populations. Other examples of chatbots with empirical support
are Manage Your Life Online (MYLO) that focuses on problem
solving [8]; Shim, for well-being based on the cognitive
behavioral approach and elements of positive psychology [9];
Tess for pediatric obesity and prediabetes treatment [10]; and
Wysa, a chatbot that uses cognitive behavioral therapy,
behavioral reinforcement, and mindfulness techniques to support
patients with depression [11]. Research studies on chatbots for
mental health have several limitations such as small sample
sizes and short-term follow-ups [6,7]. Additionally, current
chatbots for mental health promotion present several problems,
such as the lack of recognition of the emotional tone of users,
crisis identification and management, as well as the need for
strategies to reduce the frustration arising from feelings of
incomprehension by users when the chatbot does not respond
accurately.

The present study aims to assess the viability and acceptability
of psychological interventions delivered through Tess to college
students in Argentina. The objectives of this study were as
follows: (1) identify participant flow from recruitment to
follow-up; (2) understand aspects related to the usage patterns
of Tess, such as the number of messages sent and exchanged;
(3) examine the relationship between the feedback provided by
the participants and the number of messages exchanged with
Tess; and (4) compare the outcomes on depression and anxiety


between and within groups among the college students who
completed the study. Although the focus of this research was
not the effectiveness of the chatbot, comparisons were made
between the experimental and control groups to obtain
preliminary data for future randomized controlled trials given
the importance of obtaining preliminary information about the
viability and acceptability of Tess as a means of psychological
intervention for college students in Argentina.

### Methods

##### Trial Design

This was a pilot randomized controlled parallel-group trial. The
experimental group had access to Tess for 8 weeks and the
control group to a psychoeducation electronic book.

##### Participants

The participants were college students in Entre Ríos, Argentina.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: being a resident of
Argentina, 18 years or older, and a college student, as well as
providing informed consent. Recruitment was conducted through
presentations in different university courses. Participants who
provided consent were assigned to the experimental or control
group by simple randomization conducted through a Python
algorithm.

##### Intervention

 Experimental Group

The experimental group utilized Tess, an AI-based chatbot that
delivers brief text conversations as comprehensive support for
mental health. Tess sends reminders, psychoeducational content,
and emotional support responses based on what the users
express. Tess combines words and emojis in the messages for
providing a more user-friendly experience. Tess responds with
prescribed statements to replicate empathetic answers that are
appropriate for the emotion or concern expressed by the
participants. For example, a participant expressing anxious
feelings would be offered a relaxation strategy. The
conversations offered by Tess were based on the cognitive
behavioral model [12], emotion-focused therapy [13],
solution-focused brief therapy [14], and motivational
interviewing [15]. Such conversations were developed by mental
health experts. After each conversation, Tess asked, “Was our
conversation helpful?” If a user responded positively (eg, “yes,
thank you”) to an intervention based on cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) and negatively (eg, “no, not really”) to
emotion-focused therapy, Tess would then offer more
CBT-based interventions. For users who answered in a negative
or neutral manner, Tess would offer alternative interventions.

In the present study, customized conversations for university
students in Argentina were elaborated, revised, and tested within
the framework of a previous study developed in the United
States [7]. During the 8-week intervention for this test, Tess
initiated contact asking about the emotions and moods of the
participants once a day during the initial weeks and every other
day in the following weeks. All the conversations with Tess
occurred through Facebook messenger.

##### Control Group

An electronic psychoeducation book focusing on affective
symptoms was provided to the participants in the control group

[16]. The provided evidence-based information and resources
helped students identify and seek treatment for depressive
symptoms.

##### Engagement and Feedback

Engagement was measured using the number of messages
exchanged with Tess. In addition, the dropout rates in the
experimental and control groups were analyzed. The perceived
feedback of the participants was collected after each
conversation with Tess through the following question: “Was
our conversation helpful?” The answers from the users were
coded as positive, negative, or ambivalent and assigned values
of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For instance, if a user responded
saying “yes, thank you,” then that response was coded as
positive.

##### Measures

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [17] is a
self-reporting questionnaire comprising 9 items that evaluate
the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms during the
last 2 weeks. Each of the 9 items is based on the Diagnostic
_and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV)_
criteria, which are scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every
day). The PHQ-9 is one of the most used measures to assess
depressive symptoms and has been validated in Argentina with
adequate psychometric properties (Cronbach α=.87) [18]. The
first 2 items are considered screening criteria (PHQ-2); if these
are scored with 0 or 1, then an absence of symptoms is assumed.
Scores ranging from 5 to 9 are interpreted as mild, from 10 to
14 as moderate, from 15 to 20 as moderately severe, and over
20 as severe.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) [19] is a
7-item self-reporting scale that evaluates the frequency and
severity of anxious thoughts and behaviors during the last 2
weeks. Items are based on the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV
and scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Rodríguez
de Behrends and Brenlla [20] reported an adequate reliability
level (Cronbach α=.74) for the Argentinian population.

##### Ethical Aspects

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Health Sciences (FCS) of the Universidad
Adventista del Plata (UAP), National Registry of Health
Research (RENIS, reference number: CE000237), and
Ministerial Resolution of the Ministry of Health of the Province
of Entre Ríos (reference number: 3999). This resolution is
recorded in ACT 1-2019 of the registration of this committee.
Participants expressed their consent in a form according to the
personal data protection law (Argentine National Law 25.326)
through checkbox selection (electronic signature) on a closed
form.

Data were collected through Tess. All personally identifiable
information was eliminated in the transcriptions downloaded
from Tess. The downloaded data were processed and stored
using secure servers and were compliant with the Health


Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Upon completion
of the study, the control group obtained access to Tess for 8
weeks and both groups were granted free access to Tess for a
year. If a participant expressed suicidal ideations, Tess was
programmed to provide the National Line of Suicide Prevention
numbers, the crisis text line, and 911, and encourage seeking
professional help.

##### Data Analysis

The data collected was entered and analyzed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (Version 20.0; IBM
Corporation) [21]. The number of messages exchanged was
considered to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Tess.
Additionally, the participants' qualitative feedback was analyzed
by two researchers (CK and ME) and coded into three
categories: positive, negative, and ambivalent. A data analysis
protocol was carried out. The treatment of missing data through
multiple imputation or plausibility analysis techniques was not
possible owing to the high percentage of participants who
dropped out of the intervention [22].

A one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to
determine if feedback (positive, negative, or ambivalent)
impacted the number of interactions that users had with Tess.
To examine the baseline characteristics between samples, a t
test was performed for independent samples to compare anxiety
levels. The Mann-Whitney U statistic (respecting the ordinal
nature of the variables; namely, if the first 2 items were scored
0 or 1, the system did not ask the subsequent items) was used
to compare depressive symptoms.

To evaluate the effects between conditions, a _t test was_
performed for the independent samples to assess the anxiety
symptoms and the Mann-Whitney _U statistic was used to_
compare the mean ranges of depression. To assess the
longitudinal effects from the baseline to week 8 within
conditions, a t test was performed for related samples assess
the anxiety symptoms and the Wilcoxon test was performed to
compare the mean ranges of depression. To complement the
significance test, the effect sizes in the intragroup and intergroup
tests were calculated. For the _t tests, the effect size was_
calculated using Cohen d; measures between 0.2 and 0.3 were
labeled “small effect,” around 0.5 as “moderate effect,” and
above 0.8 as “large effect” [23]. For the Mann-Whitney U and
Wilcoxon tests, the _r formula was calculated based on the_ _z_
scores. The measures between 0.1 and 0.3 were labeled “small
effect,” between 0.3 and 0.5 as “moderate effect,” and above
0.5 as large effect” [23,24].

### Results

##### Initial Observations

The initial sample consisted of 181 college students in
Argentina, aged 18 to 33, with 158 (87.2%) identifying as
female. Among the 181 students, 99 (55%) were randomized
to the experimental condition and 82 (45%) to the control
condition. Data at week 8 were provided by 39 out of the 99
(39%) participants in the experimental condition and 34 out of
the 82 (41%) in the control group. Regarding data on the
depressive symptoms, 33 (33%) participants in the experimental

condition and 30 (37%) in the control condition provided data participants in the experimental condition and 23 (28%) in the
at week 8. Regarding data on anxiety symptoms, 27 (27%) control condition provided data at week 8 (see Figure 1).

**Figure 1.** CONSORT flow diagram. GAD-7: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9.


##### Messages Exchanged

Regarding the participants’engagement with Tess (39/99), after
8 weeks, there was an average of 472 exchanged messages (SD
249.52), where the minimum interaction level involved 162
messages and the maximum involved 1290. More specifically,
an average of 116 (SD 73.87) of the exchanged messages were
sent from the user to Tess.

##### Feedback

Feedback from most participants (25/39) at week 8 was coded
as positive (ie, Yes, you really understand me, Tess. Thanks for
_talking to me. My anxiety has decreased and I can confidently_
_go outside again.). A minor number of participants (7/39)_
provided ambivalent (ie, Not much, but it’s ok, I am capable)

or negative (ie, Sometimes I ask you something and you don’t
_specifically respond to what I asked.). A one-factor ANOVA_
was applied to determine if feedback (positive, negative, or
ambivalent) impacted the number of interactions that users had
with Tess. Results showed that feedback from users was
associated with the number of messages exchanged with Tess
(F2,36=4.37; _P=.02). Post hoc contrasts resulting from the_
Scheffé test showed statistically significant differences between
those participants providing positive feedback and those
providing negative feedback (P=.04); nevertheless, a higher
number of messages exchanged with Tess was associated with
positive feedback. No differences were observed between the
participants providing ambivalent and positive feedback or
ambivalent and negative feedback (See Table 1).

 Baseline Characteristics


There were no statistically significant differences at the baseline
in the anxiety (t48=.16; P=.9) and depression scores (U=451.50;
_P=.5) between the experimental and the control groups (See_
Table 2).

##### Between-Group Differences

No statistically significant differences were observed between
the experimental and the control groups in the average scores
for anxiety (t48= 1.74; _P=.09) or in the average ranges for_
depression (U=448.00; _P=.48) at week 8 (See_ Table 2).
Regarding the effect sizes, the mean scores for anxiety in the
experimental group were lower than for the control group after
8 weeks and the effect size of the intervention was moderate
(d=.5; 95% CI [-6.96 to.51]). For depressive symptoms, the
experimental group reported a lower mean score than the control


group and the effect size of the intervention was nonexistent
(r=.09).

##### Within-Group Differences

Within the experimental condition, a statistically significant
decrease in the symptoms was observed from the baseline to
week 8 for the anxiety scores (t26=2.15; _P=.04); the control_
condition did not demonstrate any significant changes (t22=1.00;
_P=.33). Regarding depressive symptoms, no significant_
differences were found either in the experimental condition
(Z=1.76; P=.08) or in the control condition (Z=.00; P>.99) (See
Table 3).

### Discussion

##### Important Findings

The use of chatbots (ie, conversational agents) to address mental
health conditions may contribute to the treatment of large
populations and attend to the needs of those who do not have
access to treatment. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
studies on the use of chatbots for mental health in Latin
America. This trial was intended to evaluate an AI-based chatbot
(Tess) in a sample comprising Argentinian college students.
The specific objectives were as follows: (1) understand the
participant flow from recruitment to follow-up; (2) report aspects
related to the usage patterns of Tess, such as the number of


messages sent and exchanged; (3) examine participant feedback;
and (4) compare the preliminary measures of depression and
anxiety.

Regarding the usage patterns of Tess, there are three findings
that support a satisfactory level of engagement. First, a
considerable number of participants in the experimental (39/99,
39%) and control (34/82, 41%) conditions remained in the study
throughout the 8-week study period. The completion rates found
in the current study are better than that observed in most unpaid
and unsupported Internet-based interventions for depression
and anxiety, where 90% of the users withdraw after the first
two sessions [25]. Furthermore, in studies using mobile apps,
the follow-up completion rates were comparable (53%); the
mean percentage of complete “adherers” was 36% for depression


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Klos et al


and 41% for anxiety [26]. When compared to a chatbot study
for US college students, a lower attrition rate was reported (31%
and 9% in the control and experimental conditions, respectively);
however, this study compensated participants and the follow-up
was at 2 weeks, making it difficult to compare the outcomes

[6].

Second, participants in the experimental condition had
exchanged a considerable number of messages with Tess (M
472; SD 249.52), and the mean number of messages sent from
the user to Tess was 116 (SD 73.87). A previous study on the
usage patterns of the depression modules of Tess showed a
much lower average number (17.57) of messages sent to Tess
by adult users [27]. It is possible that college, younger, and
Latinx students are more willing to engage in conversations
with chatbots than older populations in the United States. Two
previous studies involving college students in the United States
did not report the number of messages sent by the user to Tess

[6,7]. Regarding the messages exchanged, Fulmer et al [7]
reported a comparable number of total messages exchanged
during a period of 4 weeks (M 286; SD 104.6), whereas the
total number of messages exchanged in the current study was
during a period of 8 weeks.

Third, feedback provided by those in the experimental condition
was mostly positive (eg, Yes, you really understand me, Tess.
_Thanks for talking to me.). Among the participants offering_
negative feedback, there was a predominant dissatisfaction
regarding the accuracy of some interventions ( eg, Sometimes
_I ask you something and you don’t specifically respond to what_
_I asked.). Feedback is a key component for AI-based chatbots_
as it allows systems to tailor the dialogues to the user.
Interestingly, the positive and negative feedbacks were
associated with the number of messages exchanged. Users who
reported higher satisfaction had the highest number of
exchanged messages; it is possible that providing positive
feedback could lead to better customization the intervention
messages. This finding is relevant as it supports the need to
collect user feedback for achieving optimal levels of
customization and increasing engagement that could lead to
higher intervention doses.

Regarding the impact of Tess on anxiety and depressive
symptoms, no statistically significant differences were found
between groups. Interestingly, when comparing within-group
scores, the experimental group showed a significant decrease
in anxiety symptoms after 8 weeks of intervention and a
near-significant trend (P=0.07) for depressive symptoms.
Analyzing the effect sizes showed that Tess had a moderate
effect on anxiety and no effect on depression in the experimental
group. These outcomes were unexpected given that previous
studies using Tess [7] and another conversational agent called
Woebot [6] reported significant reductions in anxiety and
depressive symptoms; both studies used a similar control group
(a psychoeducation book). Moreover, in the current study,
depression was measured using PHQ-9 as a categorical and
ordinal variable, whereas Fulmmer et al [7] and Fitzpatrick et
al [6] used it as a continuous measure.

The lack of between-group differences could be explained by
several factors. First, the current study was underpowered.


Second, although the findings of the current study were not
statistically significant, the direction of the change observed for
anxiety and depression was as expected; therefore, it is possible
that low-intensity interventions delivered via chatbots may
require a higher dose to yield a between-group effect when
delivered to Argentinian students. Third, Tess provides many
conversations based on different theoretical approaches, and
this may have resulted in less therapeutic power. However,
Fulmer et al [7] observed significant effect using similar
conversations. Fourth, it is possible that during adaptation of
the dialogues from English to Spanish, the quality of the
intervention may have been reduced.

##### Limitations and Future Directions

This pilot study has several limitations. First, the current analysis
was conducted with intervention completers; therefore, future
studies with larger samples (including completer and
intent-to-treat analyses) are needed. Second, only college
students from a specific region in Argentina were included in
this study, and the socioeconomic aspects of the sample were
not assessed; thus, the inclusion of a more diversified sample
is suggested. Third, there was a high dropout rate throughout
the 8-week period. This is congruent with the findings reported
by most studies that use technology-based intervention (see
“The Law of Attrition”) [28]. A high dropout rate may be due
to the limited capacity of most digital interventions to capture
the attention and motivation of users. Additionally, high dropout
rates in studies with digital interventions were linked to the fact
that as access is easy, a lower level of commitment is required
from the user to enroll in the study compared to traditional
face-to-face interventions. Fourth, as most participants who
remained until completion of the study were female, male
participation was scarce. Fifth, the control group had access to
a psychoeducation book, and there was no information on
whether they read it. As chatbot research is in its initial stages,
further studies could benefit from offering waitlists rather than
self-help books. Although offering a waitlist could present an
ethical dilemma, this would mitigate the potential effects of not
having an intervention if short-term studies are conducted.

Future chatbot studies may benefit from designing chatbots with
more conversations based on a specific therapeutic approach
rather than using a few conversations from several approaches.
Additionally, analyzing the impact of chatbots as adjuncts to
face-to-face psychotherapy and comparing these interventions
with face-to-face psychotherapy alone would yield important
insights regarding the advancement of research on chatbots for
mental health. Finally, simple randomization was used in this
study; future studies may consider using unequal randomization
(2:1) so that more participants enter the experimental group or
a stratified randomization procedure so that participants with
similar characteristics can be assigned equally to the
experimental and control groups.

##### Conclusions

Students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging
messages with Tess and positive feedback was associated with
higher numbers of messages exchanges. The initial results
showed preliminary evidence regarding the effectiveness of
Tess in addressing anxiety symptoms, but there was no

significant effect on depressive symptoms in Argentinian college
students. Given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression
in Argentinian college students [1] and the need to expand
mental health care access, developing affordable strategies such
as chatbots may become effective tools to address these needs.
AI-based chatbots have the ability to reach higher levels of
customization and may thus be of service to educational and
mental health care centers aiming to deliver interventions to

targeted users that are accessible at any time without
geographical restrictions. Additionally, chatbots may be used
as standalone resources for those who have no access to
treatment or as a complement to traditional treatments. Although
the initial evidence on the efficacy of chatbots is promising,
research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and presents
several limitations. Thus, more robust evidence is needed.
