**Abstract**
**Background The high levels of unmet needs in relation to provision of self-care information reported by women**
living with breast cancer suggests that pre-chemotherapy education is suboptimal. Chatbots are emerging as a
promising platform to provide education to patients helping them self-manage their symptoms at home. However,
evidence from empirical studies on the effect of chatbots education on women living with breast cancer self-care
behaviors and symptoms management are scarce.
**Methods This three-arm randomized controlled trial was performed in a chemotherapy day care center within an**
oncology center in Egypt. A total of 150 women living with breast cancer were randomly selected and randomized
into three groups: the ChemoFreeBot group (n = 50), the nurse-led education group (n = 50), and the routine care
group (n = 50). In the ChemoFreeBot group, women were given a link to interact with ChemoFreeBot and ask
questions about their symptoms and self-care interventions by typing questions or keywords at any time. On the
same day as their first day of chemotherapy, the nurse-led education group received face to face teaching sessions
from the researcher (nurse) about side effects and self-care interventions. The routine care group received general
knowledge during their chemotherapy session about self-care interventions. The self-care behaviors effectiveness and
the frequency, severity and distress of chemotherapy side effects were measured at baseline and postintervention for
the three groups. The ChemoFreeBot’s usability was assessed.
**Results The mixed design repeated measures ANOVA analyses revealed a statistically significant both group effect**
and interaction effect of group*time, indicating a significant difference between the three groups in terms of
the physical symptoms frequency (F = 76.075, p < .001, F = 147, p < .001, respectively), severity (F = 96.440, p < .001,
F = 220.462, p < .001), and distress (F = 77.171, p < .001, F = 189.680, p < .001); the psychological symptoms frequency
(F = 63.198, p < .001, F = 137.908, p < .001), severity (F = 62.137, p < .001), (F = 136.740, p < .001), and distress (F = 43.003,

p < .001, F = 168.057, p < .001), and the effectiveness of self-care behaviors (F = 20.134, p < .001, F = 24.252, p < .001,
respectively). The Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment in showed that women in the ChemoFreeBot group
experienced a statistically significant less frequent, less severe and less distressing physical and psychological
symptoms and higher effective self-care behaviors than those in the nurse-led education and routine care groups
(p > .001).
**Conclusion ChemoFreeBot was a useful and cost-effective tool to improve increase self-care behavior and reduce**
chemotherapy side effects in women living with breast cancer through the provision of personalized education and
the improvement of the accessibility to real-time and high-quality information compared to “one size fits all” approach
used by nurses to provide the information. ChemoFreeBot can be an empowering tool to assist nurses to educate
women with breast cancer and allow women to take an active role in managing their symptom.

**Background**
In 2020, breast cancer in women was the leading cause
of global cancer incidence, with around 2.3 million new
cases accounting for one in every four cancer occur­
rences, representing about 11.7% of all cancer cases [1]. It
was the leading cause of cancer-related death in women.
An estimated 684,996 women died from breast cancer,
with low-resource countries hosting a disproportionately
high number of these deaths [2]. Likewise, breast can­
cer is the most frequent cancer among Egyptian women,
accounting for 38.8% of all female cancer cases and more
than 22,700 new cases in 2020. Breast cancer has a mor­
tality rate of approximately 11%, making it the second
leading cause of cancer-related death after liver cancer

[3].

Breast cancer inevitably requires intense treatment
with combined modalities. Chemotherapy is one method
of treating cancer, with clear evidence of the beneficial
effects of this treatment in improving both survival and
cancer-related symptoms [4]. However, organ toxicity is
a serious problem with chemotherapy, and may result in
numerous immediate, short- and long-term side-effects
for patients [5]. The severity, frequency, duration, and
distress of this toxicity should be evaluated, taking into
account both objective and subjective factors [6]. Addi­
tionally, the adverse side effects of chemotherapy can
negatively impact physical and mental well-being, leading
to poor adherence, poor quality of life, morbidity, or even
death [7].

Most patients undergoing chemotherapy show signs of
suffering from chemotherapy related side effects. How­
ever, these side effects are influenced by a number of fac­
tors, including the type and amount of chemotherapeutic
therapy, the patient’s health, and the stage of cancer [8].
Most cancer patients (60 to 90%) expressed moderate to
severe fatigue, 41 to 70% reported disrupted sleep, and
38% indicated significant distress.[9–11] Also, according


to a study by Aslam et al. (2014), [8] the most common
adverse effects of chemotherapy included weakness
(95%), fatigue (90%), nausea (77%), hair loss (76%) and
vomiting (75%). Each of these side effects was experi­
enced by more than 70% of the patients. Moreover, the
incidence of depression varies between 8% and 36%
depending on the site of cancer and diagnostic criteria

[12].

Because breast cancer treatment is usually adminis­
tered in an outpatient setting, more women are manag­
ing their condition and treatment at home. Those women
must engage in self-care behaviors to control their side
effects, lessen their physical and psychological symp­
tom distress, improve their functional status, and main­
tain their quality of life [13]. Nevertheless, women have
reported several barriers and burdens to self-care includ­
ing lack of time and convenience, high cost, lack of results

[14]. and a feeling of powerlessness, which can impede
their recovery and ability to resume normal life as they
lose control over their health and life, [15, 16] Empow­
ering these women through education about self-care
behaviors to relieve the side effects of chemotherapy is
imperative. Encouraging them to engage in effective selfcare management can help them take an active and posi­
tive approach to their cancer experience [17]. Shin and
Park’s (2017) [18] study confirmed the moderating effect
of participation in self-care behaviors for women living
with breast cancer regarding the relationship between
their empowerment levels and quality of life.

Education on chemotherapy side effects might reduce
health-related suffering by encouraging self-care treat­
ment of such side effects [19]. To educate women living
with breast cancer effectively, healthcare practitioners
must be knowledgeable about state-of-the-art techniques
and interventions [20]. Kessels’ (2003) [21] study showed
that 40–80% of cancer sufferers immediately forget the
medical information provided by healthcare specialists.


-----

Kessels (2003) [21] justified this in terms of the usage
of difficult medical terminology, patient-related charac­
teristics including low education levels, and the method
of presentation [20]. Nonetheless, the high incidence of
patient physical, psychological distress and the need for
self-care information suggests that current prechemo­
therapy preparation is suboptimal, while many studies
indicate that patients report high levels of unmet needs
in relation to the provision of self-care information.
However, many studies have only examined the modifica­
tions in patient education that have alleviated particular
side- effects, such as oral mucositis, or fatigue [22].

Empowerment education is a new and effective health
education model, which can enhance people’s belief to
change their unhealthy life behavior [23]. This model is
“centered on self-health management, which aims to
control disease by stimulating patients’ internal motiva­
tion and making them pay more attention to their own
health [24]. There is adequate evidence on the advantages
of empowerment education, but no agreement about the
best way to provide chemotherapy education to women
living with breast cancer allowing them to recall the most
information. A variety of strategies and techniques can
be used to provide adequate empowerment education,
which can be offered in a group or individually; face-to
face or at distance; led by people with special professional
training; and depending on the curriculum. Neverthe­
less, educational programs may demonstrate different
results in clinical and cost-effectiveness [16]. However, a
recent review examined the effects of several approaches
on the knowledge retention of cancer sufferers. Studies
have examined the impact of multifaceted nursing inter­
ventions, for instance: face-to-face education sessions, a
handbook, an audiotape, and telephone follow-up ses­
sions dramatically decreased symptom intensity and
increased self-efficacy in colorectal cancer patients [25].

Nurses have a pivotal role in assisting women in man­
aging the side effects of chemotherapy. They can deliver
evidence-based teaching tactics with a patient-centered
focus, empowering self-care behaviors and coordinating
their care while in treatment. Nevertheless, it can be dif­
ficult for nurses to provide women and their families with
the overwhelming amount of basic chemotherapy infor­
mation over a short period of time. Therefore, nurses
must discuss strategic solutions for the development
of learning types through integration of advanced tech­
nologies in various forms of education and conduct more
studies to compare the effect of nurse-led education and
chat- based education on women’s self-care behaviors for
managing chemotherapy - related side effects [26].

Technology-based interventions for the manage­
ment of cancer are becoming more popular. The utiliza­
tion of mobile technology and internet-based education
for patients have received particular attention in recent


years [27, 28]. Information dissemination could become
more efficient and timely with the help of technologies
like “chatbots.“ A chatbot is an automated text-messag­
ing technology providing patients with information in
response to their inquiries [28]. Unlike conventional
paper-based discharge instructions, the chatbot’s inter­
face enables providers to give a lot of specific information
quickly and on-demand [29, 30]. Studies show that there
are positive results for support-chatbots for patients
with breast cancer, with an overall satisfaction of 93.95%.
Chatbots can be used as virtual assistants, helping their
users by playing many different roles, for example symp­
tom checkers, medication reminders or personal data
gatherers [31, 32].

Physicians and healthcare professionals appear to be
comfortable with using chatbots with most of the auto­
matic simple logistical tasks but find it difficult to accept
that they are advanced enough to do complex tasks [31,
33]. However, their usability is limited by the algorithms
behind them, their ability to share data, their scalability
and the sense of security and privacy they can imple­
ment and transmit to their users [32]. To the best of our
knowledge, there is limited evidence on the added value
of using new technological approaches such as chatbots
as a method of educating women living with breast can­
cer with regard to their self-care behaviors and the man­
agement of chemotherapy -related side effects. For this
purpose, we created a chatbot, named ChemoFreeBot,
as a tool for educating women with breast cancer using
the The Microsoft Azure portal. We aimed to examine
its effects compared to nurse-led education on the effec­
tiveness of self-care behaviors and the frequency, severity
and distress of chemotherapy side effects in among these
women. Therefore, we hypothesized that:

(1) Women who used ChemoFreeBot would have

more effective self-care behaviors and less frequent,
severe and distressing physical and psychological
chemotherapy side effects than those who received
the nurse-led education.
(2) Women who used Chemofreebot would have more

effective self-care behaviors and less frequent,
severe and distressing physical and psychological
chemotherapy side effects than those who received
the routine care.

**Methods**
**Study design and setting**
This study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial
and was conducted from December 2020 to November
2021 at a chemotherapy day care center within oncol­
ogy center in El Beheira Governorate, Egypt. It is the only
center for oncology patients in this governorate. There­
fore, it is characterized by a high flow rate for patients
with all types of cancer including breast cancer, lung


-----

cancer, head and neck cancer, gastro-intestinal cancer,
blood cancer, and cervical cancer. Patients with breast
cancer after confirmed diagnosis came to the center to
receive either adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy
which was divided into 6 cycles; there was a 21 day rest
period between each cycle.

**Participants**
The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows:
aged 20 years or older, able to read & write, newly diag­
nosed with breast cancer, and scheduled for their first
or second chemotherapy session, non-metastatic cancer
stage 0-III, owns a smartphone (personal or shared with
their family members) and not receiving any concurrent
therapy for any chronic diseases. The study considered
including both male and female patients, however, only
women did meet the above inclusion criteria at the time
of the study.

**Sample size calculation**
We calculated post-hoc power of the study based on a
mixed design repeated measures ANOVA test comparing
average total symptoms frequency and severity scores pre
and post intervention with comparison between three
programs. We concluded 90% and 92% power for aver­
age total symptoms frequency and severity change scores
from baseline respectively. We calculated based on effect
sizes of 0.25 and 0.35 as well as Pearson’s correlation
between repeated measures of 0.119 and 0.079 for the
two outcomes respectively at .05 significance level. Power
calculation was performed using R software [34].

**Randomization and allocation**
Potential participants were selected randomly from a list
of women living with breast cancer who are prepared to
receive the chemotherapy in the center. Women were
assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS)
to evaluate their functional abilities on an 11-point rat­
ing scale ranging from normal functioning (100) to death
(0). Those women whose KPS score was higher than 70%,
were asked questions regarding demographic and clini­
cal characteristics data as name, age, education, marital
status, occupation, residence, income level, discovery of
disease, and stage of disease.

Cluster by time random sampling technique through­
out over months was adopted to allocate the participants
either for intervention or control group, one month for
each group (Fig. 1). Randomization was performed before
baseline assessment. Two independent researchers were
responsible for women’s recruitment and random alloca­
tion; they were blinded to group allocation. They selected
a non-transparent envelope, which contained months’
names and the name of the group either ChemoFreeBot,


nurse – led education as intervention groups, or routine
care as a control group.

**Intervention**
**_The routine care group_**
The participants in this group received routine nursing
care in which the nurse discussed general knowledge of
self-care behaviors regarding the management of chemo­
therapy related side effects to women living with breast
cancer. This knowledge varied in depth according to vari­
ous factors such as nurse workload, teaching ability and
the women’s ability to explain their problems and clarify
their doubts. Data were collected from this group (over a
period of 4 months) from 1/12/2020 until 31/3/2021.

**_The study groups_**
An empowerment-based intervention in terms of an edu­
cational program regarding the management of chemo­
therapy related side effects to was developed to empower
women living with breast cancer. The program was devel­
oped to help these women to identify goals and values,
understand how their behaviors influenced their health,
develop knowledge, skills, and confidence to make deci­
sions about their health enabling them to best achieve
their goals, and control chemotherapy related side
effects. The intervention was developed and provided
for both the nurse-led education and the ChemoFreeBot
groups, but in different formats.
The nurse-led education group Three consecutive face
to face teaching sessions about self-care behaviors to
manage chemotherapy related side effects were deliv­
ered to the women by the researcher on the same day as
their first day of chemotherapy treatment. The 1st ses­
sion included information about the definition of cancer,
chemotherapy treatment, and the side effects of chemo­
therapy. The 2nd session included information about
self- care behaviors to alleviate such side effects. The
3rd session was a revision of the content delivered in the
previous sessions and to answer women’s questions if
any. Each session lasted 45 min, separated by a 30-min­
utes rest break. Each session ranged from 30 to 40 min
according to the women’s response. The minimum num­
ber of women for each session was 7–10. The research­
ers used simple clarified media such as PowerPoint to
present the educational contents. Each woman received
an illustrated color printed brochure developed by the
researcher. Data were collected from this group from the
period of 1/4/2021 until 31/7/2021.
The ChemoFreeBot group A fully functional and userfriendly chatbot, named ChemoFreeBot, was designed
by a team from Microsoft. Microsoft Bot Framework and
Azure Bot Service were used to create ChemofreeBot.
The chatbot retrieval-based model in a single turn sce­
nario, which only considers the last input message, was

used. The researchers developed a Knowledge Base (KB)
to respond to queries in natural language. The Knowl­
edge Base was prepared based on the most commonly
asked questions, and American cancer society guidelines,
2020. The questions were collected and then divided into


categories depending on their type. To add a conversa­
tional layer, the developers used the cloud-based API
service known as QnA Maker (Cognitive Services QnA
Maker). This enabled them to extract Question-Answer
(QA) pairs from the data entered into the KB and acquire


-----

all the necessary NLP tools for responding to user inqui­
ries. To increase the likelihood of a successful match with
a user inquiry, alternative questions were provided. For
the users, the chatbot was easy to use; it was a classic
chat window where they could type their questions and
receive answers in simple language. ChemoFreeBot was
designed to be relevant to Android applications because
of the widespread popularity and availability of the
Android platform on a wide range of devices and operat­
ing systems.

Before beginning the RCT, we put ChemoFreeBot
through rigorous testing with a pilot of ten women living
with breast cancer to assess its effectiveness and enhance
its performance. We asked the women to make use of the
chatbot in order to evaluate if it could understand their
inquiries and address them promptly and correctly, along
with reporting any issues that arose so that develop­
ers would be able to settle them. This process took five
months before it was considered suitable for use in the
trial. We wanted to ensure that it operated correctly and
accurately before commencing the trial.

Women in the ChemoFreeBot group were taught about
the Chatbot and its objectives and explicitly told that
they would be chatting to an automated system, not a
person. After Chemotherapy, the women received a wel­
come message through the WhatsApp application and a
link to click and begin a dialogue with ChemoFreeBot.
They could select from a list of commonly experienced
chemotherapy related side effects and the chatbot then
provided a detailed answer. Women could interact with
ChemoFreeBot at any time. Data were collected from this
group from the period of 1/8/2021 until 30/11/2021.

**Outcome measures**
**Primary outcomes measures**
**_The frequency, severity, and distress of physical and_**
**_psychological chemotherapy-related side effects_**
The Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale (MSAS) was
adapted to assess and quantify a large range of physi­
cal and psychological symptoms in cancer patients. The
MSAS was originally developed by Portenoy et al. (1994)

[35] and was utilized to assess the multidimensional
experience of symptoms: frequency, severity, and distress
of 32 symptoms usually correlated with cancer and its
treatment. Patients were asked to demonstrate whether
they had encountered each symptom within the previous
week. “Frequency” of symptoms was rated as occurring
using a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 1 = rarely, 2 = occasion­
ally, 3 = frequently, and 4 = almost constantly. In addition,
“Severity” of symptoms was rated using a 4-point Lik­
ert scale (i.e., 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very
severe). “Distress” of symptoms was also rated using a
5-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = not at all, 1 = mild, 2 = mod­
erate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe). The frequency, severity


and distress of chemotherapy side effects were measured
at baseline and postintervention for the three groups.

The scoring for the MSAS subsumes several subscale
scores: average of frequency, severity, and distress of
most the prevalent and perceived physical symptoms
(lack of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, mouth sores,
nausea, vomiting, change in the way food tastes, changes
in skin, dizziness) and was calculated giving the physical
symptom subscale score (MSAS- PHYS). The psycho­
logical symptom subscale score (MSAS-PSYCH) was
calculated from the average of the most prevalent and
perceived psychological symptoms within “frequency,
severity and distress”: such as worrying, feeling sad,
feeling nervous, difficulty sleeping, and feeling irritable.
The Total MSAS Score (TMSAS) was the average of the
symptom scores of all the most reported symptoms in
the MSAS instrument. The score for each symptom was
an average of its dimensions. Internal consistency of the
PHYS and PSYCH subscale were 0.88 and 0.83, respec­
tively with Cronback alpha coefficients [35].

**_Effectiveness of self-care behaviors_**
The effectiveness of self- care behaviors for chemother­
apy side effects among women living with breast cancer
was measured using the Modified Self- Care Behaviors
Diary (SCBD). The **SCBD was originally developed by**
(Nail et al., 1991) [36]. It is a self-report of the use and
effectiveness of self-care behaviors. It contained a check­
list of 12 side effects commonly experienced by women
receiving parenteral chemotherapy for breast cancer and
a list of self-care behaviors aimed at managing these side
effects. Content validity of the SCBD was established by
Nail et al. and was 0.80 [37]. For the current study, the
SCBD was modified by reducing the number of side
effects studied to 10. These 10 side effects were the most
frequent side effects experienced by women in this study:
difficulty sleeping, lack of appetite, constipation, diar­
rhea, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, changes in the
way food tastes, changes in skin, dizziness, and anxiety
and the effectiveness of self-care behaviors for these side
effects. Nausea and vomiting self-care measures were
grouped together because their self-care behaviors were
identical. Also, psychological symptoms (worrying, feel­
ing nervous, feeling sad, and feeling irritable) self-care
measures were grouped together for the same reason.
The number of self-care behaviors listed ranged from 3
to 17. Because there were variations in the number of
self-care behaviors listed for different side effects. The
researchers examined the self-care behaviors performed
for each side effect as well as the total score for the total
number of self-care behaviors. An average score for the
number of self-care behaviors used for each side effect
was obtained by summing the number of self-care behav­
iors used and dividing by the number of experienced side


-----

effects. The self-care behaviors were measured at baseline
and postintervention for the three groups.

**Secondary outcome measure**
**_Usability of the chatbot_**
The Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) was used to
measure the usability of using chatbots [38]. This scale
was composed of 16 validated items aimed to assess the
personality, onboarding, navigation, understanding,
responses, error handling and intelligence of a chatbot.
Women’s levels of agreement with sixteen statements
relating to positive and negative aspects of the chatbot,
were ranked out of five, from “Strongly Disagree”, to
“Strongly Agree”. Final scores were calculated out of 100.

The CUQ is a chatbot-specific usability questionnaire
that is equivalent to the Systems Usability Scale (SUS)
which is a common instrument used for evaluating sys­
tems usability and has a benchmark score of 68 out of a
total of 100. The 16 CUQ items were ranked out of five
while the scores were calculated out of 80 and then nor­
malized to 100 by dividing the total score of the items by
64 and multiplying the answer by 100. This gave a CUQ
score out of 100.

**Data analysis**
The quantitative data were described using range (mini­
mum and maximum), mean, standard deviation and
median. Calculation of Standard deviation is based on
data scattering around the mean and one important mea­
sure of dispersion is standard deviation. It is defined as
a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset rela­
tive to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the
variance.

P value was calculated according to each statistical test
selected after fulfilling certain assumptions. For example,
Chi-Square test was selected to study the association
between two categorical variables. One Way ANOVA
test was performed to study significant difference in aver­
age age between different groups etc. Then p value was
set at .05 as a significance level. We added level of signifi­
cance of .05 at the statistical methods. A level of signifi­
cance of .05 at the statistical methods was added. Mixed


design repeated measures ANOVA test was conducted to
study if statistically significant main effect of time, main
effect of program whether Chatbot education, Nurse –
led education or Routine care and if interaction is pres­
ent in form of change pattern of different outcome scores
along different time between the three groups [39]. All
statistical tests were conducted using IBM SPSS statistics
program version 28. and R software packages at .05 sig­
nificance level [34, 40].

**Results**
**Baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics**
The three groups included 150 women with 50 women
in each group. Their socio-demographic and clinical
characteristics are shown in Table 1. No statistically sig­
nificant differences were found in the participants’ age,
education, marital status, occupation, residence, income
level, onset of disease, and the stage of disease (P > .05).
The three groups were homogeneous in terms of these
variables.

**Comparisons of symptom’s frequency, severity, and**
**distress within, among and between groups**
The mixed design repeated measures ANOVA analyses
revealed a statistically significant time effect, indicat­
ing a significant change (a significant difference in time)
between the baseline and post-intervention means of
the frequency, severity, and distress of both the physi­
cal symptoms (F = 147, p < .001, F = 749.679, p < .001,
F = 209.281, p < .001, respectively) and psychological
symptoms (F = 443.192,p < .001, F = 451.251, p < .001,
F = 106.564, p < .001, respectively) across the three groups
(Table 2).

Overall, the frequency and severity of the physical and
psychological symptoms decreased in the three groups.
With regards to the distress of the physical symptoms,
it significantly decreased in the ChemofreeBot and the
nurse-led education groups but increased in the routine
care group. Likewise, the distress of the psychological
symptoms decreased in ChemofreeBot and the routine
care groups but increased in the nurse-led education
group (Table 2).

Table 2 also shows a statistically significant both group
effect and interaction effect of group*time, indicating a
significant difference between the three groups in terms
of the physical symptoms frequency (F = 76.075, p < .001,
F = 147, p < .001, respectively), severity (F = 96.440,
p < .001, F = 220.462, p < .001), and distress (F = 77.171,
p < .001, F = 189.680, p < .001); and the psychological
symptoms frequency (F = 63.198, p < .001, F = 137.908,
p < .001), severity (F = 62.137, p < .001, F = 136.740,
p < .001), and distress (F = 43.003, p < .001, F = 168.057,
p < .001).

The Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment in
Table 2 showed that women in the ChemoFreeBot group
experienced a statistically significant less frequent, less
severe and less distressing physical and psychological
symptoms than those in the nurse-led education and rou­
tine care groups (p < .001). Similarly, women in the nurseled education group reported a statistically significant
less frequent and less severe physical and psychological


symptoms than those in the routine care group (p < .001).
However, both groups did not differ significantly in terms
of the physical and psychological symptoms distress level
(p = 1).

**Comparisons of self-care behaviors within, among and**
**between groups**
The mixed design repeated measures ANOVA analyses
revealed a statistically significant time effect, indicat­
ing a significant change (a significant difference in time)
between the baseline and post-intervention means of the
effectiveness of the self-care behaviors that women used
to relieve their symptoms (F = 181.752, p < .001) across
the three groups. The three groups experienced a statisti­
cally significant increase in the effectiveness of the selfcare behaviors (Table 3).

Table 3 also shows a statistically significant both group
effect and interaction effect of group*time, indicating
a significant difference between the three groups with
regards to the effectiveness of the self-care behaviors
(F = 20.134, p < .001, F = 24.252, p < .001, respectively). The


Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment showed
that women in the ChemoFreeBot group reported the
highest effectiveness of self-care behaviors among the
other groups at postintervention (p < .001) while the
nurse-led education and the routine care group did not
differ significantly (p = .118).

**Usability of ChemFreeBot**
Table 4 reveals that the majority of women in the Chemo­
FreeBot group reported that the chatbot was easy to use
(94% agreed and strongly agreed) and its responses were
useful, appropriate and informative (94%). Most also
reported that the chatbot understood them well (72%)
and was welcoming during the initial setup (88%). More­
over, 70% of the women thought the chatbot was easy to
navigate and explained its scope and purpose well. Most


-----

of them found that the chatbot’s personality was realistic
and engaging (72%) and it coped well with any errors or
mistakes they made (76%).

**Discussion**
To the best of our knowledge, there is limited evidence
on comparing the effect of chatbots versus nurses as a
means of educating women living with breast cancer on
the effectiveness of self-care behaviors and chemotherapy
side effects. Our multi-arm randomized controlled trial
should contribute to closing this gap, with promising
results.

The most obvious finding was that ChemoFreeBot had
the largest effect on self-care behaviors and the chemo­
therapy related side effects experienced by women in
this study, followed by nurse-led education, whereas rou­
tine care had the smallest effect. Women who engaged
with the ChemoFreeBot had the most effective self-care
behaviors and the lowest physical and psychological
symptom frequency, severity and distress at postinterven­
tion. This finding suggests that the education provided by
ChemofreeBot appears to be more effective in improving
these outcomes compared with the education provided
by the nurses in the other groups. Although, this finding
differs from that of Miles et al. (2021) and Nadarzynski et
al. (2021) [41]. that showed that healthcare professionals
were perceived as the most suitable and desired source of
health-related information, and that chatbots could offer
acceptable intervention for less severe conditions and
sensitive health issues,it is broadly consistent with oth­
ers that show the superior effect of chatbots [42]. or its
non-inferiority in providing high quality information to
patients compared to healthcare professionals [43].

In the current study, the comparison between Che­
moFreeBot and nurses is indeed a comparison between
two approaches of educating women living with breast
cancer about managing chemotherapy side effects. Che­
moFreeBot seems to have allowed for a more personal­
ized approach to education that catered for women’s
needs, whereas nurses used a “one size fits all” approach
whereby women received a uniformly designed gen­
eral education which may or may not have addressed
women’s needs and concerns. Previous literature suggest
that cancer patients appear to want the information pro­
vided to them to be more thorough and specifically per­
sonalized and tailored to their needs [44]. Chatbots are
thought to offer information and advice to many people
at once, whilst giving the feeling of personalized interac­
tion [45, 46]. The findings of the current study support
this idea as ChemoFreeBot appears to have acted as a
personal virtual assistant with which the women could
personally converse and receive an individually designed
information based on their questions. This information
was customized and tailored to the women’s individual


enquiries with regard to chemotherapy side effects and
self-care behaviors. In the usability questionnaire, women
reported that ChemoFreeBot understood their enquiries
well and the responses they received from it were rele­
vant to what they were asking about. Conversely, women
in the other two groups received some general informa­
tion from the nurse in a single day which was the same
day as their chemotherapy treatment, either in the gen­
eral content-heavy nurse-led education sessions or dur­
ing the random questions and answers within the routine
care in order to manage their symptoms at home.

It has been found that people are more likely to read,
process and remember information that is perceived to be
personally relevant and tailored to their needs compared
to general untailored information [47, 48]. Therefore, it is
possible to argue that the individualized education that
was provided by ChemoFreebot may have been more
effective in allowing the women to focus on and learn
better about the symptoms they were experiencing and
the self-care intervention that would help to alleviate
them. They had an opportunity to read and reread such
information at their own pace and as many times as they
desired until they fully digested it. Having such person­
alized learning may have contributed in improving their
self-care behaviors and alleviating their symptoms. This
is supported by a previous study by Błajda et al. (2022)

[49] which also found that personalized education pro­
vided through a mobile medical application significantly
increased women’s skills and abilities in performing the
breast self-examination technique compared to the con­
trol group who received general standard education.

Similar to all cancer patients [17, 50, 51], women in the
current study experienced chemotherapy side effects at
home in the absence of professional support and advice
from the nurses or any other healthcare professionals in
between their chemotherapy visits. Therefore, in order to
be able to manage these side effects when they occurred,
it was significant for these women to have the needed
information at hand. Research has shown that having
access to a reliable source of appropriate and high-qual­
ity information at the appropriate time may improve the
self-care capacity of women with breast cancer [15, 52].
ChemoFreeBot offered the women unlimited and around
the clock access to a high-quality information about
chemotherapy side effects and self-care interventions.
They were able to directly converse with Chemofreebot
when they experienced side effects at home and instantly
receive real-time responses to their questions. Women
reported that these responses were useful, appropriate
and informative. They had instant access, through Che­
moFreeBot, to a wide variety of effective, evidence-based
self-care interventions from which they could indepen­
dently select and test until they found which interven­
tions worked for them, hence optimize their self-care


-----

behaviors. This may partly explain why women in the
ChemoFreeBot group had the highest levels of effective
self-care behaviors among the groups. This finding seems
to broadly support those of Chaix et al. (2019) [46] who
found that the chatbot improved the medication adher­
ence rate of women living with breast cancer by allowing
them to access copious information at any time about
how to take medications properly, side effects and how to
deal with it, as reported by women.

On the other hand, women who were in the nurse lededucation and routine care groups had no remote sup­
port or follow up phone calls from the nurses or any other
healthcare professionals in between their chemotherapy
visits. They may have had almost no access to a reliable
and valuable source of information when they experi­
enced chemotherapy side effects at home. Consequently,
these women may have either relied heavily on their abil­
ity to retrieve the general information they received from
the nurse on the day of chemotherapy or sought informa­
tion from other sources such as internet, fellow patients,
family, relatives, or friends. Unfortunately, there was no
qualitative data in the current study to confirm whether
these women used either of these strategies. However,
both strategies may be ineffective, and even sometimes
counterproductive. For instance, health care profession­
als expressed concern regarding the validity and reli­
ability of information on the internet or provided by
lay people and warned from the negative consequences
of misinformation [52–54]. Moreover, relying on the
patient’s ability to recall is problematic [55]. Research has
shown that patients forget about 50–80% of health infor­
mation provided to them by health care professionals in
healthcare settings as soon as they reach home. Further­
more, about half of what patients remember from this
information is incorrect [56]. Thus, it seems possible that
these women may have not benefited fully from the infor­
mation they received from the nurse in day of their che­
motherapy treatment.

Having a full access to sufficient, reliable and valuable
source information was found to increase women’s living
with breast cancer feeling of empowerment and respon­
sibility in managing their symptoms and promoting their
own health [15]. Earlier studies show that being better
informed about self-care behaviors can reduce chemo­
therapy-related side effects and the distress caused by
them [13, 57, 58]. This also accords with the finding of the
current study which showed that women who had instant
and full access, through ChemoFreeBot, to evidencebased information about self-care intervention, had the
highest effectiveness of self-care behaviors and lowest
frequent, severe and distressing physical and psychologi­
cal symptoms compared to those who did not have such
access to information in the other groups. This finding is
consistent with the previous studies which reported that


having access to evidence-based management strategies
of side effects through chatbots caused an improvement
in patients’ side effects compared to standard care [22,
59, 60]. For instance, Aranda et al. (2012[) [22]] reported that
those who engaged with the ChemoEd chatbot reported
a statistically significant reduction in the prevalence and
severity of and bother caused by vomiting, and Greer et
al. (2019) [59] reported that participants who used the
chatbot experienced a reduction in anxiety after cancer
treatment compared to the control group. On other hand,
it came as no surprise the findings revealed the distress
of the psychological symptoms increased in women who
received nurse-led education and the distress of physi­
cal symptoms increased in women who received routine
care compared to baseline. This finding may suggest that
these women may have had difficulty coping with the
occurrence of chemotherapy side effects whilst at home.
It is possible that these women needed psychological and
professional support and desired to feel connected with
their nurses and receive reliable information in between
chemotherapy visits to help them cope better with their
symptoms. A previous study suggested that empower­
ing women living with breast cancer with knowledge and
strategies to effectively manage their symptoms would
reduce symptoms distress [61].

For many women in this study, visiting the chemo­
therapy center to seek information or professional help
in managing their symptoms from nurses or physicians
could be challenging. The commute to the chemotherapy
center would take a considerable amount of time and cre­
ate a physical and financial burden on them, as nearly half
of them resides in rural or remote areas far from the che­
motherapy center. Based on the findings of the current
study, Chemofreebot showed a promise to act as a freeto use information resource that could save these women
from visiting healthcare professionals if they had minor
side effects that could be managed at home. It could also
reduce the need to have a helpline or follow up phone
calls that may require large number of staff dedicated
to provide consultations to patients. Thus, having a tool
such as ChemoFreeBot could contribute to the reduction
of financial burden associated with seeking medical care
and having in-person consultation, while improving the
accessibility to a reliable information that could help alle­
viating their suffering from chemotherapy side effects.

However, it worth noting that if women’s questions
could not be answered by ChemoFreeBot or they expe­
rienced complex side effects, women would still need to
consult their nurses or physician. Previous studies argued
that while chatbots can be an effective tool for provid­
ing basic information and answering simple questions of
patients, they are still unable to deal with complex prob­
lems or understand the complexity of human emotions,
and they are unlikely can replace human interaction [41].


-----

This means that ChemoFreeBot cannot replace nurses
but rather assist them in supporting and educating
women living with breast cancer on the management of
side effects after receiving chemotherapy.

**Limitations**
This study has a number of limitations that should be
noted. First, the study was conducted at a single special­
ist chemotherapy daycare centre of an oncology centre
and only a small number of patients were studied. More
research is needed to determine whether this approach
can be successfully applied to people with other cancer
types and those not treated at specialist centers. Simi­
larly, patients who had previously received chemotherapy
were not evaluated in the study. Only patients who had
access to the internet and a smart phone could access
ChemoFreeBot. Another limitation to be taken into con­
sideration is that there was no mechanism in place to
track patient’s use of recommended self-care information
at home. Moreover, there was no way to determine how
many patients engaged in the suggested self-care activi­
ties. Another limitation is that the study lacked some
qualitative data about women’ experience of using Che­
moFreeBot and the challenges they may have encoun­
tered when using it. Future studies should consider using
a mixed research design.

**Conclusion**
ChemoFreeBot was a useful and cost-effective tool that
enabled women living with breast cancer to increase
the effectiveness of their self-care behavior and reduce
chemotherapy side effects through the provision of per­
sonalized education and the improvement of the acces­
sibility to real-time and high-quality information. The
“one size fits all” approach used by nurses to provide the
information to these was not as effective as the personcentered approach used by ChemoFreeBot. ChemoFree­
Bot has the potential to be an empowering tool that can
be used to assist nurses to educate women with breast
cancer and allow women to take an active role in manag­
ing their symptom and not remain a passive recipient of
information.
