### Abstract

**Background:** Research and dissemination of smartphone apps to deliver coaching and psychological driven intervention had
seen a great surge in recent years. Notably, Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) protocols were shown to be uniquely
effective in treating symptoms for both depression and anxiety when delivered through smartphone apps. The aim of this study
is to expand on that work and test the suitability of artificial intelligence–driven interventions delivered directly through popular
texting apps.
**Objective:** This study evaluated our hypothesis that using Kai.ai will result in improved well-being.
**Methods:** We performed a pragmatic retrospective analysis of 2909 users who used Kai.ai on one of the top messaging apps
(iMessage, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, etc). Users’ well-being levels were tracked using the World Health Organization-Five
Well-Being Index throughout the engagement with service. A 1-tailed paired samples t test was used to assess well-being levels
before and after usage, and hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the change in symptoms over time.
**Results:** The median well-being score at the last measurement was higher (median 52) than that at the start of the intervention
(median 40), indicating a significant improvement (W=2682927; P<.001). Furthermore, HLM results showed that the improvement
in well-being was linearly related to the number of daily messages a user sent (β=.029; t81.36=4; P<.001), as well as the interaction
between the number of messages and unique number of days (β=–.0003; t81.36=–2.2; P=.03).

**Conclusions:** Mobile-based ACT interventions are effective means to improve individuals’ well-being. Our findings further
demonstrate Kai.ai’s great promise in helping individuals improve and maintain high levels of well-being and thus improve their
daily lives.

### Introduction

Psychological distress, which can be broadly understood as an
emotional state of suffering from mood- and anxiety-related
symptoms [1], is among the leading causes of disability in the
world [2]. It has become highly prevalent; it was recently
estimated that up to 50% of the world's population experiences


symptoms of psychological distress [3]. Knowing how
widespread mental health issues are, it is not surprising that
they were found to be a central cause for the global burden of
diseases worldwide, accounting for some 56.7% of
disability-adjusted life years [2]. Furthermore, a recent report
estimated that in 2010, poor mental health resulted in a US
$2-$5 trillion annual loss worldwide owing to poor health and


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Naor et al


reduced productivity. This loss was only projected to increase,
expected to approach US $6 trillion by 2030 [4].

While the COVID-19 pandemic imposed numerous hardships
on the world, the increase in prevalence and severity of mental
distress symptoms reached a level where worldwide
organizations declared it a global crisis that needed immediate
attention [4,5]. While the number of individuals with mental
illnesses has been documented in the second decade of the 21st
century, there was no comparable increase in the numbers of
individuals receiving treatment for these symptoms over the
same period. This highlights the unmet needs for more treatment
possibilities [6]. Furthermore, it was recently claimed that
despite the substantial investment in the development of new
medications and therapeutic protocols, they are only expected
to have a limited impact over the long term. In contrast, it is
argued that greater attention should be given to the development
of prevention strategies and tools [7].

Recently, mobile apps and computer-based applications have
become increasingly useful tools for creating and disseminating
mental health prevention and treatment programs [8-10]. Mobile
interventions introduce a fresh variety of possibilities, including
the provision for unlimited interactions and psychological
interventions. This creates opportunities to reach patients
anytime and anywhere. Furthermore, this kind of platform also
has the possibility to enhance efficiency by increasing the
treatment intensity and integrating therapeutic strategies into
daily life [11].

The use of mobile-based innervations was found to be
particularly effective when it was used to deliver Acceptance
Commitment Therapy (ACT) protocols [12-15]. Since ACT
protocols allow for a low-intensity or high-frequency approach

[12], they are a highly effective method to facilitate changes in
the flexibility of the thinking process, which is one of ACT’s
central features [16]. ACT is a form of psychotherapy positioned
within the third wave of behavioral therapies. It focuses on
teaching patients how to deal with challenging experiences by
reflecting on their values [16]. ACT works to develop
psychological flexibility, which entails having the ability to stay
in contact with the present regardless of any unpleasant thoughts,
feelings, or bodily sensations. Recently, ACT was shown to be
effective in treating symptoms of both depression [14] and
anxiety [13].

In this pragmatic retrospective study, we report the test results
of a mobile platform called Kai.ai. Kai.ai is a platform designed
to provide ACT-based, artificial intelligence–driven
conversational coaching that helps users build habits for healthy
living and resilience. It integrates seamlessly with all the top
messaging apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, etc)
allowing for ecological momentary assessment and ecological
momentary interventions. The platform checks in with users
throughout the day and leverages users’responses and journaling
exercises to deliver tailored ACT skilled coaching. In this study,
the platform was evaluated using both a pre-post and
longitudinal design to assess changes in measures of well-being
among users. Our hypothesis being that using Kai.ai will result
in improved well-being.


### Methods

##### Study Design

A pragmatic retrospective design was used for this study, using
data collected as part of users’ engagement with Kai.ai’s
services. All participants were located in the United States and
had free access to the service, which is seamlessly integrated
with all the top messaging apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Discord,
Telegram, etc). This retrospective study included data from
2909 Kai.ai users, 85% of whom were recruited from major
social networks such as TikTok, and they are presented with an
advertisement inviting them to test how happy they are. Clicking
the advertisement would direct users to a landing page (How
happy are you? - Kai), where they can complete the World
Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Upon
completing the questionnaire, users were asked whether they
would like to continue and engage with Kai.ai in the future.

During the first engagement, users were asked to complete an
electronically secured version of the WHO-5. The survey was
completely optional, and users could opt to not take part in the
assessment phase. As users continued using Kai.ai, they were
prompted once every 6 weeks to complete an additional WHO-5
assessment.

##### Participants

Participants completed the WHO-5 at least twice, with the
highest number of completed WHO-5 measurements being 9.
All participants in this study were from the United States, but
since the data set used in this study was completely anonymized
before it was given to the authors, no gender- or age-related
information was available.

##### Ethical Considerations

This report is based on a postfactum analysis, which used
anonymized data gathered during users’ engagement with
Kai.ai’s services. As such, it was determined as not being a
study involving human subjects by WCG IRB (1-1504102-1).

##### WHO-5

The WHO-5 is a short self-report to measure well-being [17,18].
Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale, where participants are
asked to rate their experiences in the past 2 weeks from 5=all
of the time to 0=at no time. Raw scores are then multiplied by
4 to transform the scale to a percentage-based scale, ranging
from 0% to 100%. A transferred score of below 50% reflects
poor well-being, and a 10-point change in the translated score
is seen as clinically relevant [17]. Owing to its ease of use and
high validity, the WHO-5 has been extensively used in mental
health– and physical health–related mobile apps [19-23].

##### Intervention

 Overview

Users can choose to interact with Kai.ai through common
messaging apps. Each user’s first interaction starts with an
onboarding process where the WHO-5 is administered. Based
on the users’responses, Kai.ai builds 3 routines for the morning,
noon, and evening. Each routine includes one or more of the


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Naor et al


service’s main blocks: (1) Reflections and Journaling and (2)
_Exercises._

##### Reflections and Journaling

For Reflections and Journaling, users are invited to think and
write about their experiences. To maintain structure and help
guide users, Kai.ai uses three kinds of journaling cues: gratitude,
learning, and one good thing that happened.

During the gratitude exercise, users are encouraged to identify
things for which they are grateful and to list them in writing,
where they can easily review this list daily—this gives room to
develop flexible thinking patterns. In the learning exercise, users
are asked to focus on the lessons they can learn from their
experiences and, lastly, in one good thing that Exercises users
learn to reduce stress and anxiety by focusing on a single task
rather than a long to-do list and spreading themselves too thin.
Adopting a routine reflection and journaling process is meant
to help users achieve a more centered, grounded, joyous, and
purposeful state of mind.

##### Exercises

Two main types of exercises are offered to users: breathing
exercises and ACT training. The breathing exercises focus on
teaching users how to breathe in a constructive manner;
breathing through their noses, using their diaphragm, and noting
their posture. These are all meant to ensure a better flow of
oxygen to the body, allowing for a reduction in stress and
anxiety through the operation of the parasympathetic nervous
system [24].

The used ACT training is based on the mindfulness approach
aimed at increasing psychological flexibility, and treating pain
and discomfort as facts of life can be used for personal growth
through a process of acceptance and validation [16].


##### User Interaction

Users have 2 main ways to interact with Kai.ai: passive and
active. In the passive way, the service checks in on the user at
least once and not more than 3 times a day, depending on the
routine created during onboarding. The check-in prompts can
include either Reflection and Journaling open-ended questions
or closed questions where users are asked to indicate how happy
they are. In addition to the passive check-ins, users can actively
reach out to Kai.ai by simply texting it whenever they feel the
need to.

##### Data Analyses

To test Kai.ai’s impact on participants’ well-being, 2 analytical
methods were used. First, a paired samples t test was performed
to compare participants’ baseline WHO-5 scores, which were
collected just before the initiation of use, and the last WHO-5
score recorded for each participant. Following the initial
analysis, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to
examine the change in the users’ well-being over time. HLM
was chosen over other repeated measures models, such as
repeated measures ANOVA, owing to its unique ability to model
incomplete or imbalanced data sets. In the first level, the HLM
was modeled to estimate the individual linear slopes and
intercepts, and in the second level, the sample’s average slope
and intercept were estimated.

### Results

##### Paired Samples t Tests

Users' scores on the WHO-5 were compared from the first and
last measurement of each user. On average, users’ last
measurement score was better (median 52) than their first
(median 40). A Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated that this
difference was significant (W=2682927; _P<.001)._ Figure 1
shows a box plot of the median (IQR) values of change in
WHO-5 scores.

##### HLMs

In addition to the paired samples t test that was used to compare
users first and last measurement scores, an HLM was used since
it is best suited to deal with incomplete data sets while still
accounting for the data set’s repeated measures nature [25].
This unique strength of the HLM analysis was this analysis
because the number of measurements among users varied
between 2 and 9. Some users used the app for only 2 months,
others used it for well over a year.

Consequently, our model tested whether differences in users’
WHO-5 score between any 2 consecutive measurements could
be predicted by the level of engagement during the time frame.


As such, we used 2 variables as indications of engagement: the
number of unique days during which the user had active
interactions with Kai.ai during the specified time frame and the
number of daily messages the user sent during that time. Using
the R nlme package [26], the effect of the engagement variables
on the difference in WHO-5 scores was first tested separately
for each measurement time point (second to ninth) and then
aggregated over all time points. Our results show that the
difference in WHO-5 scores was linearly related to the number
of daily messages a user sent (β=.029; t81.36=4; P<.001) and the
interaction between the number of messages and unique number
of days (β=–.0003; t81.36=–2.2; P=.03), but not to the unique
number of days on its own (Table 1)

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

In this paper, we report the results of a pragmatic retrospective
study aiming to test the effectiveness of a mobile
phone–delivered, ACT-based, artificial intelligence–delivered
conversational coaching platform. In the onboarding
measurement, half of all participants reported a WHO-5 score
of 40 or less, which is well below the cut-off point of 50, and
an indicator of poor well-being. However, on the last
measurement recorded for each user, half of all participants
indicated a score of 52 and above, indicating a change for the
better and an overall good well-being. These results highlight
the great potential ACT-based mobile apps can have for
improving users’ daily well-being.

##### Limitations

This paper describes the use of a novel platform and treatment
protocol using mobile messaging apps to deploy ACT-based
treatment to improve the well-being of users. Our results, while
highlighting Kai.ai’s great potential as reflected by the pre-post
results, also hints at the wealth of possibilities still left to
discover. The results of our HLM model, especially those of
the negative interaction between the engagement variables,
indicates that further research is needed to fully understand and
describe Kai.ai’s potential and fit. An example of such an area,

##### Conflicts of Interest


which future research should expand on, is Kai.ai’s suitability
to different genders and age groups. A recent study found
differences among these groups in the adaptability of
mobile-based coaching tools, as females and younger age groups
(18-25 years) showed higher adaptability than males and older
ones, respectively [27]. To overcome these adaptability
challenges, a number of key features are introduced, which are
directly aimed at improving users’ engagement, leveraging the
motivations of choice and progression. As such, an emphasis
was placed on greater choice, as users are given the option of
choosing tracks that focus on different central core ideas, such
as relationships, mood, and life habits. Furthermore, over time,
the daily routines and exercises offered to the user are selected
on the basis of past preferences. Lastly, by allowing users to
review their progress, allowing users the ability to view their
progress time.

##### Conclusions

The findings reported in this paper show Kai.ai’s great promise
in helping individuals improve and maintain high levels of
well-being and thus improve their daily life. These findings are
further emphasized by the great need for mental health
interventions, while the availability of and accessibility to
treatment remains limited. It seems that the use of such
technology, which is found to improve mental well-being per
the findings of the WHO-5, is essential, especially nowadays.
