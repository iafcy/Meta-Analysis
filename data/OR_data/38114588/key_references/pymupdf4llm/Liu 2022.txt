_Background: Depression impacts the lives of a large number of university students. Mobile-based therapy chatbots_
are increasingly being used to help young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short
follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still in lack.
_Objective: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-_
useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effec­
tiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression.
_Methods: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants_
were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered
intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of
questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period
of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale
(GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and
the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic
alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were
also collected.
_Results: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n =_
52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/
83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at
baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in
the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; _P_ _< 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F_ = 5.37; _P_ = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of
completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in
the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed
that process factors were more influential than the content factors.
_Conclusions: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal_
level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with
participants.

**1. Introduction**

Mental health is an essential component of human well-being.
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses around the
world. As off 2015 (World Health Organization, 2017), approximately
322 million people were suffering from depression worldwide, ac­
counting for 4.4% of the global population. Evidence suggests that
depression is extremely dangerous because it is linked to suicide at­
tempts (Hawton et al., 2013). Depression is prevalent among university
students (Guo et al., 2020; Sheldon et al., 2021), where it leads to poor
academic performance (Andrews and Wilding, 2004; Hysenbegasi et al.,
2005), unhealthy interpersonal relationships (Lee et al., 2021), and low
quality of life (Zhong et al., 2019). Despite the fact that most universities
offer free therapy for students, many students refuse to seek help when
they are suffering from mental health issues due to the reason of low
perceived need (Andrade et al., 2014), attitude barriers (Andrade et al.,
2014; Neathery et al., 2020), and the lack of mental health education
(Neathery et al., 2020). Scholars have proposed numerous solutions to
the aforementioned problems, including IPI.[1 ] IPI (Andersson, 2016;
Wang et al., 2018) has been shown to be effective because clients can
have private, self-helping interventions whenever and wherever they
want. IPI can help to reduce the stigma associated with seeing a thera­
pist, but it struggles to establish a therapeutic alliance with the clients
(Donkin et al., 2013) and have a relatively poor adherence rate, which
was reported in (Kaiser et al., 2021) to have a positive impact on user
acceptance and adherence.
The great leap of AI[2 ]technology over the last decade has resulted in a
growing body of literature recognizing the significance of AI in the
domain of IPI. Recent evidence indicated that AI chatbots are a potential
effective mediator for fully automatic IPI (Gratzer and Goldbloom, 2020;
Vaidyam et al., 2019) because they can better mirror human therapists.
An early study (Bickmore et al., 2005) created an embodied anthro­
popathic chatbot intended to increase exercise, demonstrating that a
therapeutic alliance can be established between a client and an
embodied chatbot. Previous randomized controlled trials (Burton et al.,
2016; Shinichiro et al., 2018) validated the efficacy of psychological
treatments delivered by embodied agents. However, most chatbots for
customer use are not embodied. Instead, a review about synchronous
text-based dialogue systems in mental health (Hoermann et al., 2017)
recognized the significance of text-based therapy chatbots. In recent
years, a substantial body of literature has accumulated on the topic of
delivering therapy through chatbots on mobile devices. Therapy chat­
bots have been shown to have a considerably higher adherence rate
(Vaidyam et al., 2019) than the previous IPI. In addition, a study (Lee
et al., 2020) documented an increase in the level of client self-disclosure
after using a chatbot for therapy. Researchers have so far endeavored to
deploy mobile-based therapy chatbots for college students (Dekker
et al., 2020), teenagers (Huang et al., 2015), the elderly (Ryu et al.,
2020), patients (Greer et al., 2019), and so on. As documented in a re­
view (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2019), the most hotly discussed topics of
chatbot-delivered therapy are depression and autism. Although a
growing number of controlled studies are in favor of the use of chatbots
in depression interventions, the current study about this topic is still at a
preliminary level and requires further research (Abd-Alrazaq et al.,
2020; Vaidyam et al., 2019). To the best of our knowledge, previous
randomized controlled trials of chatbot-delivered self-help depression
intervention were all conducted in a relatively short period of time
(mostly 4 weeks) and failed to reveal the pragmatic effectiveness of the
depression therapy chatbot because the disease course of depression can
usually last for three to four months.
The objectives of this study were to examine the superiority of a
newly developed chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention to

a minimal level of bibliotherapy regarding (1) efficacy on depression
symptoms reduction, (2) adherence, and (3) therapeutic alliance. We
had three hypotheses: compared to the bibliotherapy, the chatbot
intervention would (1) reduce self-reported depression symptoms more
significantly over the 16-week follow-up period, (2) maintain a higher
adherence rate in the 16-week follow-up period and (3) achieve a better
therapeutic alliance with the participants.
In this study, a therapy chatbot called XiaoNan was developed. A 16week randomized controlled trial of effectiveness was conducted with
83 Chinese university students. This study evaluated the potential of
chatbot-delivered therapy as an effective, convenient, and scalable so­
lution for self-help depression treatments.

**2. Methods**

_2.1. Participants and sample size_

Participants were recruited using an online poster from three
different universities in China, respectively in the city of Harbin, Wuhan,
and Guangzhou. The acceptable level of significance was set at P = 0.05,
with an expected power of the study 1 − β = 80%. The expected efficacy
obtained from previous studies was a reduction of depression as
measured by PHQ-9[3 ](Kroenke et al., 2001) score of 3.6, and a standard
deviation = 5. Accordingly, the expected sample size was calculated to
be n = 31 in each group. Since there was an attrition rate of 15% in
previous studies, the expected number of participants recruited to each
group was 37.
The PHQ-9, which is a commonly used measure in psychological
depression trials (von Glischinski et al., 2021), was used to select par­
ticipants. Individuals who met the following criteria were included in
the trial: aged 18 years or older, being full-time university students, able
to communicate in Chinese without difficulty, have skillful use of
smartphones, have a PHQ-9 score of nine or higher, not currently un­
dergoing any form of mental health intervention. The eligibility crite­
rion of PHQ-9 score equal to or greater than nine was decided according
to the average inclusion PHQ-9 score in previous depression trials (von
Glischinski et al., 2021). All participants had confirmed their consent to
participation and were provided with the phone number of the local free
Mental Assistance Hotline in consideration of safety reasons. Procedures
of this trial were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of
South China University of Technology.

_2.2. Interventions_

_2.2.1. Chatbot-delivered intervention_
A therapy chatbot named XiaoNan was developed for the trial. The
chatbot was deployed through the “WeChat Official Accounts Platform”.
Users can use the smartphone app “WeChat” to access the chatbot,
which is available on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.
XiaoNan is a pipeline-based chatbot powered by the open-source
conversational AI “RASA”. The text contents of the chatbot were based
on CBT[4 ]principles, which were reviewed and approved by professional
therapists. The overall workflow of XiaoNan is illustrated in Fig. 1(A),
and the structure of XiaoNan is presented in Fig. 1(B). Input messages
can be either text or voice messages. When a voice message is received,
it's first transferred to text via a natural speech recognition service that is
provided by “IFLYTEK Open Platform”. Next, the text is sent to XiaoNan
for natural language understanding. The language understanding mod­
ule included three machine learning models: natural language process­
ing, intention classification, and emotion recognition. The natural
language processing model is responsible for collecting necessary in­
formation from the users to support the conversation by handling

“entities”, “slots”, and “forms”. The intention classification and emotion
recognition models were able to label the input text with pre-defined
intention and emotion tags. Finally, the output text message will be
decided by the dialogue management module using a template referred
to as “domain” and generated in the natural language generation mod­
ule based on a response database. The “domain” included a pre-defined
set of “entities”, “slots”, “forms”, “rules” and “stories”. “Entities”, “slots”,
and “forms” were used to contain dynamic information needed in the
responses. The “rules” and “stories” were based on machine learning
models provided by “RASA”. The “rules” specify commands that are
enforced, for the intention “goodbye”, for example, a “rule” will force
the chatbot to generate a respond to end the conversation. “Stories”, on
the other hand, are a general guide to responding, with logical con­
nections between the elements, which were created according to the
principles of CBT. All machine learning models were trained to meet a
minimal classification accuracy requirement of 90%. Fig. 2 depicts ex­
amples of interacting with XiaoNan. The chatbot was trained to alleviate
depression. It will estimate the degree of depression in the input and
then illustrate CBT to the user using a pre-written template. The chatbot
can help the user to separate their emotions, thoughts, reactions, and
behavior and to establish new automatic thoughts, as if in a CBT session.
Users may also use XiaoNan to keep track of their daily emotions or have


random conversations, the chatbot will respond empathetically.

_2.2.2. Bibliotherapy intervention_
Bibliotherapy is one of the most significant forms of self-help ther­
apy. It refers to the treatment method that uses literature to alleviate a
patient's problems. In bibliotherapy, patients receive psychological
intervention by reading literature following the advice of professionals.
Evidence from previous studies shows that bibliotherapy is effective for
the treatment of moderate depression. The long-term effects of biblio­
therapy were also verified in randomized clinical trials as documented in
a systematic review (Gualano et al., 2017). It's reported that adult pa­
tients who received cognitive bibliotherapy can maintain a good level of
improvement in a 3-month follow-up period (Floyd et al., 2004; Jamison
and Scogin, 1995). And the effects of bibliotherapy are especially
noticeable in the change of automatic thoughts (Moldovan et al., 2013).

_2.2.3. Participants administration_
The participants were randomly allocated to either a chatbot test
group or a bibliotherapy control group. Participants who were assigned
to the chatbot test group were provided with a link to the therapy
chatbot XiaoNan. They were asked to use the chatbot for 16 weeks.
Meanwhile, participants in the bibliotherapy control group received a

minimal level of bibliotherapy intervention: they were asked to read the
book Change Your Thinking-Positive and practical ways to overcome stress
_negative emotions and self-defeating behavior using CBT (Edelman, 2007), a_
book intended to help people with common mental health issues
including depression using CBT principles, in a self-help manner during
the 16 weeks.
Participants were instructed not to seek any other treatment other
than the intervention they were offered during the trial. For consider­
ation of safety, professionals will intervene by telephone (Mental
Assistance Hotline) when the participants report that they need emer­
gency psychological assistance. The professional will remain in contact
with the patient until the patient is ensured to be safe. However, in such
cases, the data of the involved patient will be excluded from the statis­
tical analysis.

_2.3. Measures_

The primary outcome was the reduction of depression, anxiety,
positive and negative affect symptoms. Whereas user satisfaction, ther­
apeutic alliance, and adherence were considered as the secondary
outcome. Key measures used in the trial was the PHQ-9, GAD-7[5 ](Spitzer
et al., 2006), PANAS[6 ] (Watson et al., 1988). Other measures included
CSQ-8[7 ] (Kelly et al., 2018), WAI-SR[8 ] (Munder et al., 2010), and selfreported adherence as measured by a 4-point Likert scale (not used =
1; several days = 2; over half the days = 3; nearly every day = 4).

6 The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule.
7 The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8.
8 The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised.


Two open-ended questions were asked at the end of the intervention
in the chatbot group to gain feedback on the chatbot. The questions were
about their experience of using the chatbot. The first question was “What
was the best thing about using XiaoNan?”, the other was “What was the
worst thing about using XiaoNan?”

_2.4. Randomization_

Blinding was not applicable because chatbot interventions and
bibliotherapy interventions are delivered in different ways, which was
apparent to participants. The participants were given a random number
0 < n ≤ 1, which was generated with the random number generator in
_Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) v.26 (IBM Corp., Armonk,_
NY). Those who received a number 0 < n ≤ 0.5 were assigned to the
chatbot test group while others were allocated to the control group.

_2.5. Statistical methods_

SPSS v.26 was used to evaluate the results, with the significance level
set at 0.05. ANOVA[9 ]and chi-square analysis was used on baseline var­
iables (age, gender, education, baseline clinical variables) to see
whether there were any major discrepancies between groups. For pri­
mary outcomes, an univariable ANCOVA[10 ]was used in ITT[11 ]analysis to
evaluate the univariate impact of group membership on the results after
corrected for baseline clinical variables. Missing data, which was
assumed to be missing at random, was handled using the multiple

imputation procedure in SPSS. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated.
Independent _t-tests were conducted on the CSQ-8 scores, the WAI-SR_
scores, and self-reported adherence. Lastly, answers to the two openended questions were collected and a word frequency analysis was
conducted.

**3. Results**

_3.1. Participant flow_

The recruitment started on February 11th and finished on April 15th,
2021. A total number of 187 responses were received, among which 83
participants (46 females) were considered eligible for the trial. All of the
participants were university students (undergraduate students (n = 31)
or postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years
old (mean = 23.08, SD[12]=1.76). All of them were native Chinese
speakers. The trial started on April 17th, 2021, and lasted for 16 weeks,
during which period participants were required to provide follow-up
data every four weeks (baseline = T1, 4 weeks = T2, 8 weeks = T3,
12 weeks = T4, 16 weeks = T5). At T5, client satisfaction and working
alliance were evaluated with CSQ-8 and WAI-SR.
Twenty participants were lost to follow-up. The overall flow of the
participants is shown in Fig. 3. There was an overall attrition rate of
24.10% (20/83). No evidence of significant differences at baseline were
detected by independent t-tests and Chi-square analyses between those
who completed the study versus those who dropped out on group
membership (χ[2 ]= 0.93; P = 0.34); gender (χ[2 ]= 0.22; P = 0.64); age (t =
0.53; P = 0.60); education (t = 0.44; P = 0.66); PHQ-9 (t = 0.28; P =
0.78); GAD-7 (t = 1.70; P = 0.09); PANAS positive (t = 0.08; P = 0.93)
and negative (t = 0.55; P = 0.58) affect scores.

_3.2. Baseline data_

As illustrated in Table 1, ANOVA and Chi-square analyses detected
no significant difference between groups at baseline (T1) in terms of age,
gender, education, and clinical variables as measured by scales.

_3.3. ITT analysis_

The primary outcome variables measured at T5 were used for the ITT
analysis. As is presented in Table 2, univariate ANCOVA revealed that
chatbot-enhanced self-help intervention showed a significant advantage
to bibliotherapy in terms of the reduction of depression with a high ef­
fect size (d = 0.83) and anxiety with a low effect size (d = 0.30) as
measured by the PHQ-9 (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 (F = 5.37;
_P = 0.02) in the 16-week period. The trends of the significantly changed_
variables (PHQ-9 score and GAD-7 score) are illustrated in Fig. 4. The
reduction effect of depression (P < 0.01) and anxiety (P = 0.046) was
robust after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. No signif­
icant between-group difference was observed on positive and negative
affect.

_3.4. Ancillary analyses_

Multivariable ANOVA was implemented among those who
completed the trial to detect if any main effect existed. Results showed
that group membership (F = 37.77; P < 0.01) and time (F = 8.40; P <
0.01) both had significant influences on the PHQ-9 scores; Group
membership had a main effect on the GAD-7 scores (F = 15.89; _P_ _<_
0.01). Following univariable ANOVAs between different-time variables
showed that a main effect of time in the first 4 weeks (T1 and T2) (F =
0.50; P = 0.48), indicating that the group membership difference was
made in the first 4 weeks. No other main effect was found.

12 Standard Deviation.


Independent _t-tests were conducted on completers at T5, showing_
that the therapeutic alliance as measured by the WAI-SR in the chatbot
tests group was significantly better than in the bibliotherapy control
group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01) with a high effect size d = 1.85. Whereas no
evidence of differences was found on the CSQ-8 scores (t = 0.88; P =
0.38).
The self-reported adherence rates of the chatbot test group and
bibliotherapy group were 1.96 (SD = 0.70) and 1.97(0.62), respectively.
Independent t-test detected no significant difference between the
adherence rates of the two groups (t = 0.68; P = 0.50). However, as is
shown in Fig. 5. During the period, the adherence rate of chatbot group
participants witnessed a downward trend, whereas that of the biblio­
therapy maintained a slight increase in the first 8 weeks. No adverse
events were observed in the trial.

Table 3 illustrates the keywords of the answers to “What was the best
thing about using XiaoNan?” and “What was the worst thing about using
XiaoNan?”. A word frequency analysis showed two major themes: pro­
cess and content. In addition, it is worth notiong that one participant
said that XiaoNan had increased her willingness to seek help from pro­
fessional therapists. The feedback showed that process factors are
slightly more important than content factors.

**4. Discussion**

The results showed that chatbots are an effective medium for selfhelp depression treatment in pragmatic conditions. The therapy chat­
bot reduced depression as measured by the PHQ-9 significantly in a 16
weeks period and reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 slightly in
the first 4 weeks. The effectiveness of the chatbot intervention was su­
perior to that of the bibliotherapy. The client satisfaction and selfreported adherence were similar in the two groups. However, a
decreasing trend was found in the chatbot adherence rate, this might
have been resulted from the technical and content defects of the chatbot.
The WAI-SR scores of the chatbot users were higher in the chatbot users,
showing that the use of conversational AI can help build a therapeutic
alliance. The results were consistent with some of the previous studies
(Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Fulmer et al., 2018), in which there were
shorter intervention periods of 2 and 4 weeks. A previous study (Lee
et al., 2020) has reported an increase in self-disclosure, this phenome­
non was also observed in user feedback where expressions of higher selfdisclosure were found. In addition, feedback on XiaoNan showed that
process factors are more influential than the content.
Several limitations can be found in this study. Firstly, the content of
the chatbot was limited as we aimed to make sure all the contents were
approved by professionals. An expansion of topics and contents could
reduce the repetitiveness of the conversation and thus bring potential
improvements. Future work could analyze the content of repetitive
conversations generated by the chatbot and add more clinically robust
content to the chatbot accordingly. From the technical perspective, the
future version of the chatbot could include DST[13 ]and DPO[14 ]modules to
reduce repetitive and improve personalization. During a conversation,
the DST module is responsible for handling the start, pause, and end of
the conversation. It will also match the input text with previous context
to find connections and keep a short memory to support the conversa­
tion. The DPO module will analyze the successfulness of each inter­
vention after a conversation (Meinlschmidt et al., 2020) and keep a longterm memory to tag and file all conversations. Key information identi­
fied during conversations such as patient complaints and severe symp­
toms will be recorded in the long-term memory and discussed with the
user in further sessions. In addition, the conversations will be compared
regularly to keep track of the symptoms and requirements of the patient
so that a personalized treatment plan could be decided for further

treatments. For instance, if insomnia is detected in a conversation, the
DPO module will keep track of this symptom. In future conversations,
the DPO module will compare the description of insomnia to previous
records and provide necessary guidance for the user. Next, the therapy
target of XiaoNan in this trial was restricted to depression. However, the
symptoms of clients are often a mixture of two or more issues. Given the
fact that chatbot-delivered therapy for other targets, such as panic dis­
order (Oh et al., 2020), substance addiction (Barnett et al., 2020), and
attention deficit (Jang et al., 2021), have already been under evaluation.
A combination of two or more topics might be beneficial to the effec­
tiveness. Moreover, this study has recruited a participant sample that
lacks variety. In future work, this randomized controlled trial should be
repeated within different demographics to increase the generalizability
of the results. Lastly, a longitude study as was implemented in (Bendig
