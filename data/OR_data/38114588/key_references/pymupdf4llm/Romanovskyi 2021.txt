**Abstract**
The article is presenting results of controlled study of effectiveness of Elomia chatbot in
reducing tendency to depression, anxiety and negative emotional effects. Elomia was
developed using artificial intelligence technologies. In the process of developing a chatbot
following technologies were used: RoBERTa(NER) for identification names and locations;
COSMIC for identification of human emotions; DIALOGPT for answers generation;
DistilBERT (SQuAD) for pointing the most relevant information in the script; GECToR for
spelling check. Elomia is able to identify the main psychological problems of the client and
offer him the most suitable support option using first aid techniques and cognitive-behavioral
psychotherapy. To check the effectiveness of the chatbot it was conducted a study that
included three stages: 1) the formation of experimental and control samples; 2) baseline
testing; 3) final testing. The study used psychological research methods: 1) Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to diagnose a tendency to depression; 2) General Anxiety Disorder7 (GAD-7) to diagnose a tendency to generalized anxiety disorder; 3) Positive and Negative
Affect Schedule (PANAS) to diagnose of prevailing (positive / negative) emotional affects.
412 volunteers (202 women, 210 men, ages 19 to 23 years old) who identified their tendency
to depression, anxiety and low mood were selected in students social networks groups of
Kharkiv region as participants of research. It was found that regular usage of Elomia
contributes to a significant reduction in the high tendency to depression (up to 28%), anxiety
(up to 31%), and negative affects (up to 15%).

## 1. Introduction

Depression and anxiety are the two most common disorders that seriously affect the quality of life
of people of different age and social groups. The prevalence of anxiety and depression problems is
evidenced by WHO data, as well as an increasing number of studies on this issue [1]. In recent years,
scientists have revised the tools for diagnosing anxiety and depression [2, 3, 4], and ways to prevent
and treat them [5, 6, 7], the influence of anxiety and depression on the quality of life of individual age
and social groups [2, 8].

The consequences of depressive and anxious conditions are particularly painful for people who are
going through age-related crises and experience reassessment of their own values and changes in selfimage.

Depressive and anxiety disorders spectrum include: F31 Bipolar disorder, F32 Major depressive
disorder, F33 Recurrent depressive disorder, F41.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder, F41.2 Mixed
anxiety-depressive disorder and other anxiety disorders. All of these diagnoses can only be made by a
psychiatrist and can be treated using a combination of psychotherapy and medication. According to

## 1. Introduction

Depression and anxiety are the two most common disorders that seriously affect the quality of life
of people of different age and social groups. The prevalence of anxiety and depression problems is
evidenced by WHO data, as well as an increasing number of studies on this issue [1]. In recent years,

and social groups [2, 8].

The consequences of depressive and anxious conditions are particularly painful for people who are

image.

the WHO, about 16% of all mental illnesses on the planet are caused by disorders of the anxietydepressive spectrum.

Moreover, hundreds of thousands of people around the world suffer from the so-called
“precursors” of such disorders: increased levels of situational anxiety, low mood, anhedonia, feelings
of loneliness, acute dissatisfaction with interpersonal relationships. People who suffer with these
issues rarely seek help from psychotherapists, psychologists and counselors. They even tend to hide
their emotional struggling from loved ones. Long-term attempts to cope with such experiences
without outside help often have negative consequences for mental health, which results in the
occurrence of disorders of the anxiety-depressive spectrum.

People of the described group need additional support, which can be provided by “conversational”
services based on artificial intelligence and psychology techniques.

## 2. Elomia

In recent years, more and more psychological services aimed at providing psychological assistance
online have occurred (Betterhelp, Helppoint, Talkspace, Youtalk, etc.). These services can be divided
into 2 groups:

  - “chatbots” which are based on active listening techniques

  - online psychologists.
Each of these groups has its advantages and disadvantages. So, the work of "chatbots" often does
not imply an individual approach to the needs of the client and allows you to simply talk. Online
psychologists, by contrast, provide expert assistance, but their work is quite expensive, which is an
obstacle to the continued use of such a service for large group of potential clients.

Awareness of the shortcomings of the existing models of online psychological assistance led to the
creation of Elomia chatbot, in which the developers tried to combine the advantages of psychological
online services: cheapness, round-the-clock availability and an individual approach to solving client
problems.

Elomia was developed using artificial intelligence technologies. In the process of developing a
chatbot following technologies were used:

1. RoBERTa(NER) for identification names and locations;
2. COSMIC for identification of human emotions;
3. DIALOGPT for answers generation.
4. DistilBERT (SQuAD) for pointing the most relevant information in the script;
5. GECToR for spelling check.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is widely used in medicine: 1) in the diagnosis of cancer through
the analysis of MRI and ultrasound images; 2) to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease; 3) to
find the optimal way of surgical intervention; 4) to build a course of treatment. This is just a short list
of the areas in which the use of artificial intelligence can save lives today.Elomia is able to identify
the main psychological problems of the client and offer him the most suitable support option using
first aid techniques and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy.

Elomia's arsenal includes:

  - exercises for calming;

  - exercises for falling asleep;

  - grounding technique;

  - exercises to reduce anxiety;

  - breathing exercises;

  - exercises to improve self-esteem.
The algorithm determines the user's need for one or another help while communicating with the
chatbot and suggests an exercise to ease his emotional state.

The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of Elomia chatbot in reducing the tendency to
anxiety, depression and experiencing negative emotional states.

## 3. Research design

The study consisted of three stages:
1. The formation of experimental and control samples;
2. Baseline testing;
3. Final testing.
The study used psychological research methods: 1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to
diagnose a tendency to depression; 2) General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to diagnose a tendency to
generalized anxiety disorder; 3) Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to diagnose of
prevailing (positive / negative) emotional affects.

The PHQ-9 questionnaire reveals a tendency to depression at 5 levels: minimal depression (1-4
points), mild depression (5-9 points), moderate depression (10-14 points), moderately severe
depression (15-19 points), severe depression (20-27 points) [9].

The GAD-7 questionnaire allows you to diagnose one of four levels of anxiety: minimal (0-4
points), mild (5-9 points), moderate (10-14 points), severe (15-21 points) [10].

The PANAS questionnaire allows to evaluate the tendency to positive and negative affects in the
range from 10 to 50 points [11].

For statistical processing of the results methods of descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test for
paired and unpaired samples were used.

The research sample was formed in several steps. At the first step 412 volunteers (202 women, 210
men, ages 19 to 23 years old) who identified their tendency to depression, anxiety and low mood were
selected in students social networks groups of Kharkiv region. Another criterion for including
respondents in the testing group was English proficiency at a B2 level (Upper Intermediate) and
higher. After preliminary testing, 320 respondents (162 men and 158 women) who really showed a
tendency to anxiety and depression according to testing were selected. At the second step, a group of
82 respondents (39 women and 43 men) was randomly selected from 320 respondents. At the third
step, the respondents were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental (42 people) and control (40
people). To check the distributions equality of respondents in groups by age and gender a chi square
test was used (table 1).

Statistical analysis with usage of chi-square criterion confirmed the equality of the subjects
distributions by age and gender (no significant differences in the distribution of data were found).

Among selected participants there were: 13,41% with tendency to mild, 47,56% with tendency to
moderate, 18,29% with tendency to moderate severe and 20,73% with tendency to severe depression;
18,29% with tendency to moderate and 81,7% with tendency to severe anxiety.

The obtained groups were once again checked for compliance with the selection criteria of
respondents (table 2).

The data in the table clearly show that the average indicator of depression in the experimental and
control group corresponds to the indicators of tendency to moderate (10-14 points) depression; the
average anxiety score corresponds to a tendency to a severe (15-21 points) level of anxiety; the
average indicator of tendency to negative affects corresponds to a moderate level (20-40 points); the
average indicator of the tendency to positive affects corresponds to a moderate level (20-40 points).

A comparison was also made of the average indicators of the respondents of the two groups using
the T-test for independent samples on the level of tendency to anxiety, depression and emotional
affects (table 3).

The obtained results of the T-test indicate the absence of significant differences in the level of the
studied characteristics at the first stage of the study.

After the completion of baseline testing, the respondents of the experimental group were given
unlimited access to Elomia chatbot for 4 weeks. Respondents were instructed that they can use Elomia


-----

at any time of the day to the extent that they need. Thus, each participant in the study had the
opportunity to control the amount of communication with Elomia, depending on their needs.

Respondents in the control group were asked to use the Depression self-help guide developed by
The National Health Service of the United Kingdom to correct negative emotional states [12]. This
guide also contains a set of cognitive-behavioral techniques that help to deal with non-adaptive
thoughts and to reduce anxiety and depression. Respondents were instructed that they can contact the
guide at any time when they feel the need for it without restrictions.

## 4. Research results


As a result of a survey after 4 weeks of the study it was revealed that the respondents of the
experimental group used chatbot with different frequencies and intensities (Figure 1).

T-test showed significant differences in all study indicators. This means that users of Elomia after
4 weeks of its usage noted a significant decrease in the symptom of anxiety, depression and negative
affects. Moreover, there is an increase in positive affects, which manifests itself in a more calm,
balanced state, high self-esteem, confidence in the future.

The participants in the experimental group noted that after using Elomia, they became calmer,
more self-confident. Many noted that they have become less likely to experience aggression towards
others, fear, sense of hopelessness. More than 70% of the participants noted that they returned to
using the chatbot in moments of increased anxiety, panic attack, self-doubt, loneliness.

A similar comparison made in the control group did not detect significant statistical shifts, which
indicates the inefficiency of introspection methods in dealing with signs of depression, anxiety and
negative affects compared to using Elomia chatbot.


**Figure 2: Comparison of means in depression level in experimental and control group**


-----

Comparison of the average indicators of depression tendency in the experimental and control
groups allows us to evaluate the effect of the work of respondents with Elomia chatbot. So, after 4
weeks of using the chatbot the average indicator of depression tendency moved from the “Moderate
Depression” zone to the “Mild Depression” zone, while in the control group it remained at the same
level.

The main reason for such results is that Elomia does not immerse the client in dull and lonely
thoughts. On the contrary, it creates the conditions for self-disclosure of the person, gives the
opportunity to speak out. In addition, the techniques presented in the application allow a person with
depressive tendencies to reduce stress levels and feel a positive attitude towards themselves.

**Figure 3: Comparison of means in anxiety level in experimental and control group**

The average indicator of tendency to anxiety in the experimental group moved from a zone of
severe to a zone of moderate anxiety. In the control group the anxiety rate remained as high as during
the baseline testing.

These results are associated with the systematic use of grounding techniques that AI offers to
anxious clients. While in a state of anxiety, a person often becomes obsessed with unproductive
experiences and thoughts that prevent him from finding contact with a calming reality. Grounding
techniques allow a person to return to reality through simple, repetitive actions (drawing, creating
shapes with simple objects). Elomia allows clients to use these techniques on their own in times of
anxiety or fear.

The tendency to negative affects in the experimental group decreased, while in the control group

The participants in the experimental group, after using the chatbot, stopped experiencing fear,
nervousness, shame and distress as the leading emotions. In addition, there was a decrease in
emotions such as irritability, guilt and hostility. Respondents noted that a decrease in negative
experiences led to better relationships with family and friends, which in turn created an additional
circle of psychological support around them. Thus, the use of the chatbot contributed not only to the
reduction of negative feelings directed by a person towards himself, but also the manifestation of
negative emotions directed to others.

During the final interview, the respondents who used the chatbot noted that during communication
they became more self-confident, started to understand life problems differently, began to think about
how they live, felt “the ground under their feet”.

As the most significant change, participants noted the change in the outlook on the world around
them as more positive, friendly and filled with resources. Having received support from the chatbot,
the participants realized that it was not a shame to ask for help and it was absolutely normal, which
took their thinking out of a dead corner.

Respondents in the control group also noted the usefulness of the depression self-help guide. But
they also pointed out that in the process of reading the manual they had questions and ideas that they
had no one to discuss with, and attempts to introduce changes into their lives without outside support
came up against resistance from relatives. The inability to bring changes to life reduced the
motivation to re-visit the guide and increased the overall level of frustration and self-discontent.

## 5. Conclusions

Regular usage of Elomia contributes to a significant reduction in the high tendency to depression
(up to 28%), anxiety (up to 31%), and negative affects (up to 15%). This reduction is achieved
through the use of "conversational therapy" with elements of cognitive-behavioral techniques. At the
same time usage of such techniques without a conversational elements does not lead to significant
changes in the emotional state of clients within the indicated time frames.

Elomia is a powerful tool for providing first aid to people suffering from anxiety and depression.
Its systematic use can reduce the level of negative affects. It is important to note that it cannot act as a
full-fledged substitute for psychotherapy or medical treatment for depression. Rather, it reduces the
chances of the person using it to experience serious mental illness.
