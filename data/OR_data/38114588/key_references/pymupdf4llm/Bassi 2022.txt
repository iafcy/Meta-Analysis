### Abstract

**Background:** Motivation is a core component of diabetes self-management because it allows adults with diabetes mellitus (DM)
to adhere to clinical recommendations. In this context, virtual coaches (VCs) have assumed a central role in supporting and
treating common barriers related to adherence. However, most of them are mainly focused on medical and physical purposes,
such as the monitoring of blood glucose levels or following a healthy diet.
**Objective:** This proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a VC intervention for psychosocial support
before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The intent of this VC is to motivate adults with type 1 DM and type 2 DM to
adopt and cultivate healthy coping strategies to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and diabetes-related
emotional distress, while also improving their well-being.
**Methods:** A total of 13 Italian adults with DM (18-51 years) interacted with a VC, called Motibot (motivational bot) using the
Telegram messaging app. The interaction covered 12 sessions, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes, during which the user could dialogue
with the VC by inputting text or tapping an option on their smartphone screen. Motibot is developed within the transtheoretical
model of change to deliver the most appropriate psychoeducational intervention based on the user’s motivation to change.
**Results:** Results showed that over the 12 sessions, there were no significant changes before and after the intervention and at
follow-up regarding psychosocial factors. However, most users showed a downward trend over the 3 time periods in depression
and anxiety symptoms, thereby presenting good psychological well-being and no diabetes-related emotional distress. In addition,
users felt motivated, involved, encouraged, emotionally understood, and stimulated by Motibot during the interaction. Indeed,
the analyses of semistructured interviews, using a text mining approach, showed that most users reported a perceived reduction
in anxiety, depression, and/or stress symptoms. Moreover, users indicated the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating
them to find a mindful moment for themselves and to reflect on their own emotions.
**Conclusions:** Motibot was well accepted by users, particularly because of the inclusion of mindfulness practices, which motivated
them to adopt healthy coping skills. To this extent, Motibot provided psychosocial support for adults with DM, particularly for
those with mild and moderate symptoms, whereas those with severe symptoms may benefit more from face-to-face psychotherapy.

### Introduction

##### Background

Physical, medical, and psychosocial factors significantly
contribute to adherence rates to the clinical recommendations
in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) by promoting or hindering
optimal diabetes self-management. Appropriate diabetes
self-management is central to long-term diabetes care, and it
includes several healthy behaviors, such as monitoring of
glycemic levels, physical exercise, healthy eating, taking
prescribed medication and/or insulin injections, which in turn
have an impact on the general well-being of people with DM.
However, these healthy behaviors are difficult to maintain.
Indeed, studies have shown that high levels of
diabetes-emotional distress are associated with a worsening of
self-care behaviors as well as glycemic levels [1].
Diabetes-emotional distress is also a risk factor for stress,
anxiety, and depression symptoms. Indeed, the prevalence rates
of depression are much higher in people with DM than in the
general population, in which they are estimated to be 17% [1].
With regard to anxiety symptoms, studies have found that 14%
of adults with DM show generalized anxiety disorder, a
prevalence much higher than the 3% to 4% rate identified in a
community sample [2-4]. Anxiety is related to unhealthy
lifestyle choices, such as augmented smoking prevalence,
assumption of food high in cholesterol, and a sedentary lifestyle,
which can all lead to poor disease management [5]. In addition,
higher levels of anxiety hinder cognitive capacity, which in turn
influences diabetes management and thus the ability to fully
follow clinical recommendations [1,5]. Similarly, feeling
stressed determines the release of stress hormones, such as
cortisol and adrenaline, which prevent insulin from working
properly (ie, insulin resistance) and thus increases glycemic
levels [6]. Depression, anxiety, and stress are associated with
the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and the presence
of DM further increases this risk [1,5,6]. All together, these
factors provoke lower adherence rates and impairment in the
well-being of people with DM, leading to poor disease outcomes

[7]. Therefore, one can assume the presence of a complex
interplay between psychosocial factors and diabetes
management, meaning that they influence one another. Thus,
the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE)
guidelines introduced a healthy coping construct to identify
healthy coping strategies to reduce these symptoms and improve
the general well-being of adults with DM [8]. In particular,
AADE suggests strategies to cope with life stresses and the
challenges of managing DM, such as meditating [8]. Indeed,
several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mindfulness
practices in emphasizing self-acceptance in the general
population [9] and treating depressive symptoms in people with
DM [10,11]. In this context, motivation is a core component in
adherence to the diabetes regimen as it is specifically
conceptualized for its process rather than for a specific goal

[12]. Indeed, the transtheoretical model of change (TTMC) [13]
defines motivation as a continuum rather than as an
all-or-nothing construct, in which the individual can move across
5 stages (ie, precontemplation, contemplation, preparation,
action, and maintenance), thus moving forward or backward.


In this regard, digital health technologies play a central role in
promoting health care, especially in chronic diseases. For
instance, TTMC has been widely used in digital solutions to
predict or evaluate behavioral changes in physical activity [14],
diet [15], and glycemic control [16] and to ameliorate adherence
to medications in adults with risk factors for the onset of
cardiovascular diseases [17,18].

##### Virtual Coaches: User Engagement and User Experience

The increasing rates of diabetes worldwide are a problem for
the diabetologists treating diabetes, who already, as things stand,
do not have enough time to assist every patient with physical,
medical, and psychosocial issues. In this regard, virtual coaches
(VCs) have become an increasingly relevant resource for the
management of chronic diseases and for promoting behavioral
changes in the self-management of individuals. Indeed, they
aim to provide personalized guidance and improve intervention
outcomes by mimicking human beings [19]. Indeed, VC in the
health care field is mainly aimed at developing personalized
user-system interactions and supporting individuals in their
behavioral changes [20,21]. This is important for improving
user engagement (UE) and compliance, both of which are crucial
for achieving long-term behavioral changes and adjustment
toward a healthier lifestyle [22]. UE is a multifaceted construct
that refers to the quality of the user experience (UX), including
the individual’s time, cognitive, affective, and behavioral
investment during the interaction with a digital solution [23].
The UE construct goes beyond user satisfaction: indeed, the
literature suggests that the capacity to engage and maintain
engagement in the interaction with a digital solution seems to
show positive results in eHealth, e-learning, and web searching

[23]. Indeed, prolonged engagement has been shown to be
promising in a diabetes prevention program with the use of VC

[24], engaging 69% of adults for the whole study and resulting
in 8.98% weight loss [24]. In addition, in 2 other recent studies,
adults with type 2 DM (T2DM) [25] and young adults with type
1 DM (T1DM) [26] reported feeling engaged and satisfied with
a VC embedded in an application. In other studies, people with
DM reported an increased level of satisfaction with the
interaction with the VC [27,28]. Indeed, VCs for people with
DM seem to favor self-care behaviors and behavioral changes
as well as support them at follow-up. For instance, a recent
review reported that VCs for people with DM represent effective
interventions for fostering their glycemic control, in combination
with standard care [29]. Therefore, VCs seem to be capable of
overcoming common barriers related to adherence by delivering
data-driven personalized support in real time and being available
at any time during the day [30], thus allowing scalability. In
this regard, UX is a crucial element that intersects the UE.
Taking into consideration the definition proposed by the
International Organization for Standardization [31], UX includes
users’ engagement, pleasure, desirability, values, emotions,
beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological
responses, behaviors, and accomplishments, which occur before,
during, and after the use of a digital solution. The International
Organization for Standardization also lists 3 factors that
influence UX: the user’s current state and previous experience,
system properties, and use context [31]. Therefore,


-----

JMIR HUMAN FACTORS Bassi et al


understanding users’ needs, their working environments,
interactions, and emotional reactions can help design VCs from
the UX point of view [31]. Thus, the user becomes an active
contributor to this process [31]. Studies have shown that higher
levels of UX have been associated with an increased
effectiveness of digital health interventions targeting
improvements in T2DM self-management [25], physical activity

[32], and diet [33]. However, there is a lack of evidence
regarding UE and UX as constructs that interplay in the
development, evaluation, and implementation of VCs for
psychosocial support of adults with DM.

##### Comparison With Previous Work

To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement VC for
psychosocial support in adults with T1DM and T2DM.
Notwithstanding the originality of this work, in previous studies,
VCs have been deployed to improve healthy coping strategies
in college students, showing their beneficial effect in reducing
symptoms of distress [34,35]. With regard to the development
of VCs in the field of diabetes, studies have designed a
conversational agent [36] and an interactive diary [37,38]. These
digital interventions were both embedded in a smartphone app
to improve health-related quality of life among adults with
T2DM [35] and T1DM [37,38]. Health-related quality of life
is an important and well-known construct that underlies the
concept of general well-being. However, it should also be noted
that anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms interplay with
diabetes management. This means that these outcomes can
hinder an individual’s ability to manage diabetes and maintain
effective glycemic control. Hence, it is important to include
these variables when developing programs and interventions
for adults with DM.

##### Objectives

Bearing all these aspects in mind, this VC (Motivational
bot—Motibot) aims to support and motivate adults with T1DM
and T2DM to adopt healthy coping strategies. In turn, these
healthy coping strategies should reduce depression, anxiety,
perceived stress symptoms, and diabetes-related emotional
distress and improve well-being. Therefore, the aim of this
proof-of-concept study was threefold:

1. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the VC intervention
before and after the intervention and at follow-up in
reducing the abovementioned psychosocial symptoms while
also improving the well-being of adults.
2. To investigate UX and UE with the VC for psychosocial
support accessed through personal smartphones within the
Telegram messaging app.
3. To evaluate semistructured interviews on both UX and how
users felt during their interaction with the VC.

### Methods

##### Participants and Recruitment

The study involved 18 voluntary adults with T1DM and T2DM
recruited in Italy via social network sites (ie, Facebook groups)
using snowball sampling. Five adults dropped out of the study
for personal and medical reasons. Therefore, the final sample
included 13 adults aged between 18 and 51 years (mean 30.08,


SD 10.61 years), 77% (10/13) of which were women; 62%
(8/13) of adults had T1DM and 39% (5/13) had T2DM, with
an overall mean diabetes duration of 10 (SD 8.49) years. One
participant did not complete the psychological measures after
the intervention and was therefore excluded from the analyses
of the psychosocial variables. The inclusion criteria for
participating in this study were as follows: (1) having T1DM
or T2DM and (2) owning a smartphone and a Telegram account.
The decision to include both types of DM was guided by the
notion that there are similarities between the lifestyle guidelines
for adults with T1DM and T2DM, as emerged from the results
of a recent meta-analysis [39]. Participants were excluded if
they had gestational diabetes or prediabetes.

##### Procedure and Ethics

This work is a proof-of-concept study for adults with T1DM
and T2DM, conducted following the Obesity-Related Behavioral
Intervention Trials (ORBIT) framework [40]. The ORBIT model
supported guidance throughout the whole process as it
emphasizes the importance of adopting a data-driven iterative
approach to optimize subsequent iterations of the intervention

[40]. In particular, this model places the user at the center of
the design process. The study was conducted in compliance
with the Declaration of Helsinki (Italian law 196/2003, European
Union General Data Protection Regulation 679/2016). The
Interdepartmental Ethical Committee of Psychology of the
University of Padova (Italy) approved the project (approval
number: 3968; February 3, 2021), stating that there were no
critical ethical issues. The participants signed a written informed
consent sent via mail, agreeing to participate in the study and
semistructured interviews 1 month after the end of the study.
They were informed that their data would be confidential, that
they could omit any information they did not wish to give, and
that they could withdraw from the study at any moment without
having to provide any explanation.

##### Intervention Description: Motibot Design

_Motibot (Figure 1) is a VC designed to provide psychosocial_
support by motivating adults with DM to adopt and cultivate
healthy coping strategies, which, according to the AADE
guidelines, should be flexible and adaptable to the users’ needs

[8]. These coping strategies, in turn, should foster adults’
well-being by reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress
symptoms and diabetes-related emotional distress. Motibot was
developed by the Digital Health Lab at Fondazione Bruno
Kessler Research Center for Digital Health and Wellbeing using
Rasa [41], an open-source platform designed for the
development and training of VCs. It was then deployed through
the Telegram messaging app. The environment provided by
Rasa exploits machine learning (ML) libraries and pretrained
embeddings from language models, thus allowing the
construction of a VC for a specific language by combining ML
approaches and handcrafted rules. Motibot relies on natural
language understanding (NLU) [42], which is an ML technique
that enables the VC to interpret user messages. NLU, together
with the conversational history and a set of predefined variables,
determines the transition from one turn of the dialogue to
another. In this study, the NLU system was trained by feeding
it with a data set comprising 6899 examples of user utterances


-----

JMIR HUMAN FACTORS Bassi et al


categorized by intent and annotated with entities. Examples of
intents are to affirm, deny, say your name, say what you feel,
_schedule the next meeting, and xpress the level of motivatione._
Examples of entities are the user’s name, the emotion felt, the
_date, time of the next meeting, and level of motivation. NLU_
was used to interpret the intents and entities. In this study, we
defined 54 intents and 6 entities. During interactions between
Motibot and users, intents and entities were extracted from
users’ messages and classified using a trained multitask
transformer architecture. Motibot was designed to last for 12
sessions of 10-20 minutes each, during which Motibot interacted
with the user according to the scripts previously defined as
shown in Figure 2. Because of the flexibility of this VC,
specifically designed to be as adaptable as possible to the users’
daily life, every session was initiated following a scheduled
plan decided by the users themselves to best suit their needs.
Users were able to respond to Motibot by inputting text or
tapping an option on their smartphone screen. The interaction
between Motibot and users is designed considering
evidence-based approaches related to counseling and
psychoeducation as displayed in Figure 2. In particular, these
approaches are linked to the healthy coping construct [8] and
to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [43] to support and
motivate the development and/or enhancement of coping
strategies. For these reasons, the whole conversational protocol
was developed referring to TTMC [13], which allows the VC
to understand what motivational state the user is in and

**Figure 1.** Motibot: the virtual coach.


consequently deliver the most appropriate psychoeducation
intervention, which is based on the user’s motivation to change.
At the beginning of the first session, Motibot asks the users to
present themselves by telling they are. Subsequently, Motibot
delivers a video presentation of itself, its functionality, and its
main features to involve the user in the interaction. Thereupon,
Motibot delivers 3 different questionnaires to assess the levels
of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) [44],
anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) [45], and
perceived stress symptoms (Perceived Stress Scale-10 [PSS-10])

[46]. These 3 questionnaires were also sent after the intervention
and at follow-up. In this last case, 2 psychosocial scales were
added to assess diabetes-related emotional distress (Problem
Areas in Diabetes Scale–Short Form-5 [PAID-5]) [47] and
general well-being (World Health Organization-5 Well-Being
Index [WHO-5]) [48]. PAID-5 and WHO-5 were evaluated only
at follow-up, that is, 2 months after the end of the study. The
latter 2 scales were included to verify whether coping strategies
had been internalized, thus leading to greater well-being. Indeed,
diabetes self-management is well known to be influenced by
these outcomes. In addition, Motibot sent 2 other questionnaires
to assess UX during the whole interaction and UE only at the
end of the intervention to comprehend the users’ overall and
final involvement. One month after the end of the study,
semistructured interviews were conducted to understand both
UX and how users felt during their interaction with Motibot.

Each day, Motibot asks the users what emotion they are feeling
at that precise moment as well as its intensity, to support them
in becoming more aware of their own emotions and
self-reflecting on them. After this question, according to TTMC
and following the state of change ruler (ie, precontemplation
state, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance) [13],
Motibot asks users “How much do you want to improve your


well-being on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much)?” to
understand their motivation to maintain diabetes under control.
When users are considered in the _precontemplation state,_
Motibot tries to investigate why they feel this way and then
attempts to increase emotional awareness by helping them to
self-reflect on their emotions and on the importance of taking
care of both their body and mind. When users are considered


-----

JMIR HUMAN FACTORS Bassi et al


in the _contemplation state, Motibot provides motivational_
interventions, which focus the attention on the costs and benefits
of adopting a healthier behavior to favor psychosocial
well-being. Finally, when users are in the action state, Motibot
provides behavioral interventions by sending audio tracks related
to mindfulness practices.

The PHQ-9 [44] is a brief self-reported unidimensional measure
developed to assess and monitor the severity of depression
symptoms in the previous 2 weeks. The questionnaire includes
9 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 never to 3 almost
_every day). The PHQ-9, which incorporates the Diagnostic and_
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text
revision criteria, has a total score ranging from 0 to 27, with a
score of 10 representing the optimal cutoff to detect clinically
relevant depression. The PHQ-9 comprises five categories of
severity: (1) absent (scores 0-4), (2) subthreshold depression
(scores 5-9), (3) mild depression (scores 10-14), (4) moderate
depression (scores 15-19), and (5) major depression (scores
20-27). An example of an item is the following: “During the
last two weeks, on how many days did you feel little interest or
pleasure in doing things?” (item 1). The PHQ-9 has shown good
psychometric properties [44]. The _GAD-7 [45] is a brief_
self-reported unidimensional measure aimed at screening
probable cases of GAD and assessing the severity of symptoms
in the previous 2 weeks. The questionnaire comprises 7 items
based on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 never to 3 almost every
_day). The GAD-7 incorporates the Diagnostic and Statistical_
Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision criteria


##### Data Collection

As reported in Textbox 1, the psychosocial questionnaires were
administered before and after the intervention and at follow-up.
Moreover, semistructured interviews were conducted 1 month
after the end of the study.

and has a total score ranging from 0 to 21, with a score of 10
as the cutoff for GAD. The questionnaire included three
categories of severity: (1) mild anxiety symptoms (score ≥5),
(2) moderate anxiety symptoms (score ≥10), and (3) severe
anxiety symptoms (score ≥15). An example of an item is the
following: “In the last two weeks, how often did each of the
following problems bother you? Feeling nervous, anxious, or
tense” (item 1). The GAD-7 has demonstrated good validity
and reliability [45]. The _PSS-10 [46] is a brief self-reported_
unidimensional measure that assesses an individual’s perception
of stress in the previous month. The PSS is a measure of the
degree to which each situation in one’s life is perceived as
stressful; indeed, the items are designed to evaluate the degree
to which individuals find their lives unpredictable,
uncontrollable, or overloaded. The scale also contains a series
of direct questions about the current levels of perceived stress.
The PSS consists of 10 items based on a 4-point Likert scale
(from 0 never to 5 very often). The total PSS score ranges from
0 to 40, with high scores indicating a high level of perceived
stress. PSS includes three categories of severity: (1) low
perception of stress (scores 0-13), (2) moderate perception of
stress (scores 14-26), and (3) high perception of stress (scores

27-40). An example of an item is the following: “In the last
month, how often have you felt out of sorts because something
unexpected happened?” (item 1). The PSS-10 has demonstrated
good psychometric properties regarding reliability and validity

[46]. The _PAID-SF-5 [47] is a self-reported unidimensional_
measure aimed at assessing diabetes-related emotional distress.
The questionnaire comprises 5 items based on a 5-point Likert
scale (from 0 not a problem to 4 serious problem). Total scores
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores (ie, ≥40) indicating
greater diabetes-related emotional distress. The PAID-SF-5 has
demonstrated good psychometric properties [47]. The WHO-5

[48] is a self-reported unidimensional measure that evaluates
psychological well-being, a core dimension of quality of life.
The questionnaire comprises 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert
scale (from 0 never to 5 always). The total score was rescaled
to range between 0 and 100, with a score ≤50 suggesting poor
psychological well-being and a score ≤28, indicating depression,
showing good psychometric properties [48]. The _User_
_Engagement Scale–Short Form (UES-SF) [49] is a brief_
self-report questionnaire aimed at assessing user engagement
with a digital solution. The UES-SF includes 12 items based
on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly
_agree). The UES-SF comprises 4 factors: (1) focused attention,_


which indicates the feeling of being immersed in the interaction
(eg, “I lost myself in this experience”); (2) perceived usability,
which is the negative affect experienced owing to the interaction
and the effort spent (eg, “I felt frustrating while using
Motibot”)—this factor is the only one in which the scores were
reversed; (3) aesthetic appeal, which represents the graphical
and visual appeal related to the digital solution (eg, “Motibot
was aesthetically appealing”); and (4) the reward factor (eg,
“Using Motibot was worthwhile”). The latter is a single set of
3 factors related to the original UES questionnaire [49,50], such
as the endurability, which evaluates the overall success of the
interaction; the novelty, which examines the overall interest
related to the interaction with a digital solution; and finally, the
felt involvement factor, which evaluates the overall fun
interaction. The overall scale was found to be reliable [49]. The
_User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) used in this study is an_
adapted version of the original UEQ [51], modified ad hoc to
make the bipolar adjectives more appropriate to the aims of this
study. In particular, the questionnaire included 28 adjectives,
either positive or negative, designed to assess the experience of
interacting with the VC. Each item was scored on a 5-point
Likert scale (from 1 _strongly disagree to 5_ _strongly agree)._
Textbox 2 shows the selection of items for this study.

_Semistructured interviews were conducted by GB with all_
participants who concluded the interaction with Motibot. The
interviews were based on 11 ad hoc questions administered 1
month after the end of the study and lasted approximately 10
minutes. Each interview started with asking the motivation for
participating in this study and concluded with a question in
which the participant should explain whether they would suggest


Motibot to other people with the same chronic illness, explaining
the reason. The other 9 questions were divided into 2 sections
as reported in Textbox 3. The first included 5 questions related
to the experience that users had with Motibot; therefore, the
goal was to assess the UX. On the other hand, the second section
included 4 questions related to how users felt during the
interaction with Motibot from a psychological perspective.

##### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 4.0.0 (The
R Foundation for Statistical Computing) [52], and SPSS
Statistics, version 24.0 (IBM Corp) [53]. The Shapiro-Wilk test
was performed to evaluate the normality of the sample
distributions of the variables investigated in this study.
Descriptive analysis was carried out on psychological
dimensions, namely depression, anxiety, and perceived stress,
before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The same
analysis was performed on diabetes-related emotional distress
and well-being, although only at follow-up. All data are shown
as plots. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to
evaluate differences in depression, anxiety, and stress among
participants. A post hoc Wilcoxon nonparametric test was
performed to compare the differences in the aforementioned
outcomes before and after the intervention and at follow-up to
understand whether the psychoeducational intervention had
been effective. Means and SDs were computed for UX, which
was evaluated at the 4th, 8th, and 12th sessions and for UE,
which was evaluated at the end of the study. The data regarding
UX are displayed as plots. A text mining approach [54,55] was
followed to extract information from the semistructured
interviews on UX and on how users felt during the interaction
with Motibot. This analysis was implemented by relying on the
_Quanteda R package [56] and on custom shell scripting code_
under a Linux environment. The analysis was carried out on
the written interview transcripts (in Italian) as follows: first,
they were cleaned by replacing uppercase letters and removing
numbers, punctuation, and stopwords. Thereupon, user’s
answers were divided into groups, each containing all answers
to one of the interview questions. Two analyses steps were
implemented: (1) extraction, from some of the questions in the
semistructured interviews, of 3 sets of responses (ie,
yes/no/maybe) and (2) extraction, from the remaining questions,
of recurrent concepts (ie, word stems) and their relations in
terms of digrams (ie, pairs of word stems). A word stem was


deemed to be recurrent if it appeared at least three times across
interviews, whereas digrams were considered recurrent if they
appeared at least two times. The criterion of 3 occurrences as
the threshold for including a stem was chosen according to the
following rule of thumb. We assume stems to be significant if
they belong to the 5% most recurrent ones. However, because
occurrence is quantified by an integer number, this percentile
threshold can be enforced only approximately. Setting the
criterion of minimum occurrences to 3 yielded the extraction,
for the different questions, between 3.8% and 7.9% most
recurrent stems (average 6.2%), in reasonable compliance with
the 5% threshold assumed above. In addition, the average
occurrence of stems for a given question was 1.35; a threshold
of 3 occurrences was equivalent to the requirement of a stem
recurring more than twice as frequently as the average.

### Results

##### Preliminary Analysis

The variables investigated in this study showed a nonnormal
distribution. No missing data were identified, and each
participant answered all the questions administered. As
mentioned in the Participant section, only one participant did
not answer the entire questionnaire sent after the intervention
and thus was excluded from the analyses regarding the
psychosocial variables.

##### Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Symptoms

Overall, as displayed in Figure 3, all participants showed
moderate symptoms concerning perceived stress (assessed using
the PSS-10). Participant 6 was the only participant showing a
high perception of stress after the intervention; however, the
level of perceived stress diminished at follow-up. Data
concerning anxiety and depression symptoms (assessed
respectively through the GAD-7 and PHQ-9) seem to increase
after the intervention and decrease at follow-up, except for
participant 5, who presented severe symptoms at both time

points, thereby resulting in an outlier. The presence of an outliers did not affect the overall trend of data regarding these outcomes.

**Figure 3.** Plots of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, assessed through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively, before and after intervention and at follow-up (N=12).


##### Well-being and Diabetes-Related Emotional Distress

As shown in Figure 4, when considering the presence of an
outlier, participants ranged between poor and good
psychological well-being (assessed through the WHO-5), with
an overall mean of 50.00 (SD 17.18), which indicates an overall
poor psychological well-being. However, if the outlier is
excluded, the overall mean is 51.64 (SD 17.01), which


corresponds to an overall good psychological well-being. With
regard to diabetes-related emotional distress (assessed through
the PAID-5), most participants did not present diabetes-related
emotional distress; indeed, the overall mean was 35.67 (SD
21.20). If the approach described above is applied and therefore
if the outlier is excluded, the overall mean is 32.73 (SD 19.50),
which, being an even smaller value, suggests low levels of
diabetes-related emotional distress.

and Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale-5 (PAID-5), respectively, at follow-up (N=12).


##### Kruskal-Wallis Test for Psychosocial Outcomes

The Kruskal-Wallis test, carried out to assess the differences
among depression, anxiety, and perceived stress symptoms, did
not yield any significant results when considering the
intervention period. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 3, a
downward trend can be identified over the 3 time periods (ie,
before the intervention, after the intervention, and during
follow-up).

##### User Experience

Analyses regarding the positive items (assessed through UEQ)
reported a mean >3 on a 5-point Likert scale (mean 4.04, SD


0.22). In particular, the items _comprehensible language,_
_empathetic, motivating, encouraging, and interesting increased_
from the 2nd to the 12th session, whereas the item supportive
tended to decrease from the 2nd to the 12th session as displayed
in Figure 5. The specific means and SDs are reported in the
Multimedia Appendix 1 (Table S1).

Analyses of the negative items (evaluated using UEQ), shown
in Figure 6, reported a mean <2 on a 5-point Likert scale (mean
1.86, SD 0.30), thereby attesting that users disagreed with the
overall items. In particular, the items _not stimulating,_ _not_
_engaging, and rigid decreased from the 2nd to the 12th session._
The specific means and SDs are reported in the Multimedia
Appendix 1 (Table S2).

##### User Engagement

Overall, the data on UE show that participants were engaged
with Motibot, as reported in Table 1. The reward factor, which
refers to the worthwhile and absorbing experience of the user


with the digital solution, presents a maximum value of 5. The
same result also emerged for perceived usability and focused
attention. Notably, the perceived usability factor is the only
factor in which the items were reversed, indicating a good effect
experienced by the digital solution.

##### Minimum and Maximum Scores of Participants Based on the User Engagement Questionnaire’s Likert Scale

 Text Mining

Overall, the average duration of the 13 semistructured interviews
was 9.04 minutes. The transcripts of the interview answers
comprised 562 words on average. The results of text mining
applied to the answers of the semistructured interviews,
concerning UX and how users felt during the interaction with
Motibot, are graphically summarized in Figures 7 and 8,
respectively. In both figures, bar plots show the distribution of


3 types of answers (ie, yes/no/maybe), whereas scatter plots
highlight the most frequent concepts, namely word stems
appearing at least three times in the interviews. Within scatter
plots, arrows identify recurrent digrams, that is, sequences of
2-word stems appearing at least twice within the interviews. It
is worth mentioning that the apparently opposite ordering of
some digrams (eg, support→psychological) is because of the
analysis being carried out on texts in Italian, in which word
ordering is different from English. Stems were translated at the
end of the analysis, considering the abovementioned potential
nuances between the 2 languages. The radius of the circle is
proportional to the number of occurrences of each stem.

##### Text Mining: UX With Motibot

As shown in Figure 7, 85% (11/13) of the participants would
be interested in using a VC for psychosocial support and 92%
(12/13) would suggest VC to other people with the same chronic
disease. Overall, participants reported having a positive
experience with Motibot. As displayed in the upper-right panel,
where stems graphed in blue and red correspond to liked and
_disliked aspects, respectively, users largely reported positive_
aspects in the interaction with Motibot, except for some
technical problems. It should be mentioned that 3 participants
reported that there were no aspects that they disliked.

##### Text Mining: How Users Felt During the Interaction With Motibot?

As displayed in Figure 8, users reported mindfulness audio
tracks as a very good, positive, interesting, and new experience.
They further considered the voice of the audio tracks as a guide
to the mindfulness pathway. Indeed, 62% (8/13) of the
participants also listened to the mindfulness audio again after
the end of the study or planned to do so in the future, to grant
themselves a further mindful moment. Finally, 77% (10/13) of
the participants reported that Motibot helped them reduce the
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or stress.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

This proof-of-concept study evaluated the preliminary efficacy
of a VC intervention for psychosocial support. Motibot, indeed,
aims to support and motivate adults with T1DM and T2DM to
adopt healthy coping strategies. In turn, these healthy coping


strategies should reduce depression, anxiety, perceived stress
symptoms, and diabetes-related emotional distress and improve
well-being. This study further aims to evaluate UX and UE in
the interaction with a VC from both qualitative and quantitative
perspectives. Overall, preliminary evidence suggests that the
digital intervention led to improvements in symptoms of anxiety
and depression, as emerged from the downward trend of the
related factors detected over the 3 time periods (ie, before the
intervention, after the intervention, and during follow-up).
Notably, participants showed an increase in anxiety and
depression symptoms after the intervention and a subsequent
decrease during follow-up, showing good psychological
well-being, upon exclusion of an outlier, and no diabetes-related
emotional distress. These data highlight how the effects of the
psychoeducational intervention were maintained over time, thus
leading to the users’internalization of healthy coping strategies
and self-reflection of their own emotions. With regard to
perceived stress, users showed moderate symptoms, which
remained throughout the intervention, including follow-up.
However, users did not present any diabetes-related emotional
distress. These findings shed light on the possible stressful
events that underpin perceived stress, such as the impact of
contingent events; thus, the findings did not relate to the burden
of managing DM. It is worth mentioning that this study was
carried out in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had
a significant impact on psychological well-being among the
whole population [57]. Overall, the users perceived a decrease
in any symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or stress, reporting
the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating them
to find a mindful moment for themselves. The psychoeducational
intervention was well accepted by users, particularly in the
presence of a mindfulness _pathway. Indeed, users reported a_


-----

JMIR HUMAN FACTORS Bassi et al


_very good, positive, interesting, and new experience: most users_
listened to the audio tracks even at the end of the study to
achieve a mindful moment for themselves once again. Indeed,
mindfulness-based interventions have recently become more
relevant in the context of DM care, as they are associated with
a reduction of negative emotions and an enhancement of an
individual’s attitude and coping strategies [58]. Users had a
_positive and interesting experience with Motibot, particularly_
because it proposed audio tracks relating to meditation and
asked them what emotion they were feeling in that precise
moment. The purpose of asking users to express their emotions
is to motivate them to become more aware and reflect on them:
one might expect that the more one is aware of their own
emotions, the better they can regulate them. Motibot was
perceived as _empathetic and_ _stimulating in its dialogic_
interaction, even if it was slightly less supportive from the 2nd
to the 12th session. This last result might indicate that users
become familiar with Motibot throughout the sessions and thus
do not perceive any further support, albeit still feeling involved
and absorbed in the interaction. However, Motibot was also
perceived as _motivating and_ _encouraging in the adoption of_
healthy coping strategies: users appreciated that Motibot gave
them positive advice. Notwithstanding these promising results,
few users still reported a desire for human contact to receive
psychological support. These data emerged particularly for those
who presented with high levels of anxiety, depression, and/or
perceived stress symptoms. Therefore, we speculate that VCs
may be successfully used to support and motivate people with
mild and moderate psychological symptoms, whereas those
with more severe psychological symptoms may benefit more
from psychotherapy support in face-to-face spontaneous and
human settings. Furthermore, users encountered technical
problems when interacting with Motibot, particularly when
arranging the next session. However, this issue was addressed
in the study. Nonetheless, users felt involved and engaged with
Motibot, reporting a worthwhile and absorbing experience and
a positive perception of use, stating that Motibot was very easy
_to use._

##### Acknowledgments


##### Limitations and Future Work

This study has 2 main limitations. First, the small sample size,
which was chosen following the proof-of-concept phase related
to the ORBIT model, as it allows the inclusion of few
participants during the first phases of the design, evaluation,
and implementation process [40]. However, this choice does
not permit data generalization. Second, a more complex analysis
approach concerning text mining on the semistructured
interviews, such as supervised or unsupervised learning, could
not be implemented owing to the relatively small number of
participants and the limited length of the interviews (ie, between
approximately 200 and 1000 words each). Future studies should
integrate, in the development of a VC, medical factors such as
the glycemic levels alongside the main psychosocial aspects,
as they interplay with the management of DM and thus are
variables worth analyzing. Finally, our future goal is to test
Motibot with a larger sample size in a randomized controlled
trial to investigate the effectiveness of the psychoeducational
intervention in a systematic and controlled manner.

##### Conclusions

Motibot was developed through a combination of NLU and
handcrafted rules with the aim of delivering a psychoeducational
intervention for adults with T1DM and T2DM, which allows
them to interact by using both free text and structured dialogue
interaction. The results of this study showed positive user
experience and engagement. In addition, the findings highlighted
the usefulness of interacting with a VC to motivate adults with
DM to adopt healthy coping strategies. These coping strategies,
specifically related to mindfulness practices, allowed a reduction
in anxiety, depression, and diabetes-related emotional distress
symptoms, while also improving their well-being. This decrease
in psychosocial symptoms and increase in well-being was also
maintained at follow-up. VCs have the advantage of scalability,
which leads to greater user accessibility, and thus, it is available
at any time. Moreover, VCs are deployable to adults with DM
who show mild and moderate psychosocial symptoms. In
particular, VCs can provide them with valuable support, in
combination with a dedicated psychotherapist both in a
traditional face-to-face setting or in a digital solution referring
to the stepped care model [59].
