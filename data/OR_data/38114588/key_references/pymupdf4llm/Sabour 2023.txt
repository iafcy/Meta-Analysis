Introduction: The growing demand for mental health support has highlighted the
importance of conversational agents as human supporters worldwide and in
China. These agents could increase availability and reduce the relative costs of
mental health support. The provided support can be divided into two main
types: cognitive and emotional. Existing work on this topic mainly focuses on
constructing agents that adopt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles.
Such agents operate based on pre-defined templates and exercises to provide
cognitive support. However, research on emotional support using such agents is
limited. In addition, most of the constructed agents operate in English,
highlighting the importance of conducting such studies in China. To this end,
we introduce Emohaa, a conversational agent that provides cognitive support
through CBT-Bot exercises and guided conversations. It also emotionally
supports users through ES-Bot, enabling them to vent their emotional problems.
In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of Emohaa in reducing symptoms of
mental distress.
Methods and Results: Following the RCT design, the current study randomly
assigned participants into three groups: Emohaa (CBT-Bot), Emohaa (Full), and
control. With both Intention-To-Treat (N = 247) and PerProtocol (N = 134)
analyses, the results demonstrated that compared to the control group,
participants who used two types of Emohaa experienced considerably more
significant improvements in symptoms of mental distress, including depression
(F[2, 244] = 6.26, p = 0.002), negative affect (F[2, 244] = 6.09, p = 0.003), and
insomnia (F[2, 244] = 3.69, p = 0.026).
Discussion: Based on the obtained results and participants’ satisfaction with the
platform, we concluded that Emohaa is a practical and effective tool for
reducing mental distress.

## 1. Introduction

Concerns regarding mental health are prevalent in the modern world due to the
increasing morbidity of mental diseases (1). During the COVID-19 pandemic, depression,
anxiety, and other mental health issues have increased significantly (2). Specifically, a


-----

review by Lakhan et al. (2) highlighted a 20% and 35% rise in
depression and anxiety, respectively, for 113,285 individuals
across 16 studies. Additionally, an international study with a
sample of 22,330 adults showed that about 17.4% of the
participants met the criteria for a probable insomnia disorder
(3). These mental health issues impact people’s daily lives,
leading to social dysfunction and risks of self-harm and suicide
(4). Due to the rapidly increasing demands, mental health
services worldwide face challenges regarding the lack of
professional training and stigmatization of mental illness. These
challenges can lead to low diagnosis accuracy and patient
treatment delays (2).
Similarly, the prevalence of mental health diseases in China is
increasing (5–7). According to the epidemiological survey of
mental disorders in China (8), the lifetime prevalence rate of
mental disorders in adults, excluding senile dementia, is 16.57%.
Specifically, the prevalence of anxiety disorder was reported the
highest in China, with a 12-month prevalence rate of 4.98% (8).
While possessing one of the largest populations worldwide, the
number of licensed psychiatrists, though gradually increasing, is
extremely limited, with a recent estimate suggesting that China had
only 36,610 psychiatrists (2.6 per 100,000 population) in 2018
(9, 10). Similar to the limited number of mental health services in
China, the quality of such services is also inadequate (7, 8, 11).
Additionally, recent research has also shown that stigmas related to
mental health support in China and concerns regarding burdening
others also affect an individual’s willingness to seek support
(12, 13). Due to these challenges, only a limited number of
Chinese patients are receiving appropriate support and treatment.
Hence, the invention of high-technology tools or treatments in
China is essential as it can provide effective, available, and
affordable support for improving individuals’ mental health.
Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) have highlighted the
potential of machines to serve as anthropomorphic
conversational agents (11). One of the essential applications of
such agents is health care, mainly for providing mental health
support. Employing machines for such tasks increases availability
while reducing the costs of seeking support, as these agents could
be widely accessible and affordable through mobile devices (14).
Previous work has shown that individuals are willing to selfdisclose their emotional problems with machines (15–17), which
is significant as users’ self-disclosure is essential for providing
support. It demonstrates user rapport with these agents and
highlights their potential as practical and beneficial supporters
(18), thus serving as a strong motivation for this study.
Extensive research has been conducted on the effects of machinebased support. As proposed by Rimé (19), there are two main types of
support to reduce mental distress: cognitive and emotional. Cognitive
support enables individuals to reassess their situation from a different
perspective and realize a new way of thinking about their problem
(20, 21). In contrast, emotional support includes providing
validation and understanding to cause relief and improve emotional
distress (20, 22, 23). Recent work has mainly focused on delivering
cognitive support through conversational agents adopting Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and has demonstrated the


efficacy of such interventions in reducing users’ mental distress,
mainly depression and anxiety (14, 24–26). While most of the
existing research on this topic is in English (18, 27, 28), there have
been attempts to create Chinese chatbots for CBT (26, 29–31),
demonstrating the importance of employing such systems in China.
In addition, research on machine-based emotional support is
comparatively limited. Liu et al. (23) constructed a dataset of
emotional support conversations based on Hill’s (22) helping skills
and demonstrated the feasibility of machine-based emotional
support. Their work facilitated the research in this direction, and
several approaches have been proposed to improve machines’
emotional support ability (32–37). These approaches achieved
promising results on aspect-based human evaluation (e.g., fluency
and coherence). However, their corresponding studies did not
create prototype agents, nor did they conduct empirical studies of
their effectiveness in reducing users’ mental distress. In addition,
all of the mentioned work was implemented in English,
highlighting the lack of research and resources for Chinese
machine-based emotional support.
To the best of our knowledge, Pauw et al. (21) presented the first
and only study investigating the effects of different types of machinebased support, including emotional support. However, their
proposed prototypes only produced a set of pre-defined statements
(e.g., “I am sorry to hear that”) rather than generating responses
based on the users’ messages. Therefore, with mental health being
a rising issue in the Chinese community, existing high demands
for available and affordable support in China, and the limited
research in this area, we believe constructing and conducting a
study on a conversational agent for support in Chinese is crucial.
This study investigates the efficacy of conversational agents for
providing cognitive and emotional support. Specifically, it aims to
study the effectiveness of agents providing different types of support
in reducing mental distress and assess the acceptability and
practicality of such interventions for mental health support. We
introduce Emohaa, a hybrid system involving a platform based on
CBT principles and exercises for cognitive support and a
conversational platform for emotional support regarding various
topics. We recruit participants from mainland China and hypothesize
that using Emohaa, which includes completing daily exercises and
emotional venting, would improve their symptoms of mental distress,
specifically depression, anxiety, negative affect, and insomnia.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Emohaa

Our proposed conversational agent consists of two platforms.
First, a template-based platform that contains conversations with
pre-defined options and exercises that assist participants in
improving their mental distress based on CBT principles (CBTBot). Second, a generative dialogue platform that allows
conversations regarding various emotional issues in an open-ended
manner (i.e., without requiring the users to choose predefined
conversational options) and provides emotional support (ES-Bot).


-----

#### 2.1.1. Cognitive behavioral therapy chatbot (CBT-Bot)
Creating a platform based on CBT principles postulates a direct
and reciprocal interaction between thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors that helps illuminate understanding of one’s overall
emotional distress and situational responses while highlighting
areas for intervention (38). As a tool for cognitive support, we
integrated two different practices: automatic thoughts training
and guided expressive writing. Individuals have automatic
thoughts in response to a trigger, often outside of that one’s
conscious awareness. These thoughts could often be irrational
and harmful when associated with mental distress (39). As one
of the core elements of CBT (38, 40), automatic thoughts
training aims to identify and dismantle these thoughts (i.e.,
replace negative thoughts with rational perspectives), which could
reduce mental distress and improve one’s mood (38, 41). In
addition, previous studies have shown that writing about stressful
or emotional events improves physical and psychological health
in non-clinical and clinical populations (42, 43). Therefore, we
adopted over 20 guided expressive writing exercises that cover a
variety of topics and instruct users throughout each step of the
exercise via interactive conversations.


On this platform, participants are initially given a set of
conversational choices on this platform and are accordingly
introduced to CBT and how to use this platform (Figure 1A).
Accordingly, they are provided with two types of exercises:
guided expressive writing and automatic thinking. An example of
a guided writing exercise is shown in Figure 1B, where users are
asked to fill out parts of their diary about a given topic in several
steps. Automatic thinking exercises (Figure 2) present the user
with a hypothetical scenario and require them to take the
person’s perspective in that situation. Accordingly, they are asked
a question regarding the correct approach to take in that
person’s situation and report their confidence in their answer.
Lastly, they are shown the correct answer about how to approach
and gain a new perspective in such scenarios. To assess the
efficacy of the exercises, we require users to report their mood
after completing an exercise and describe their emotions using a
set of pre-defined keywords. This platform is publicly available
on WeChat, China’s most popular social media platform.

#### 2.1.2. Emotional support chatbot (ES-Bot)
Several studies have shown that emotional support is beneficial
for reducing mental and emotional distress (34, 44, 45). In


-----

addition, allowing users to discuss their desired topics freely is
crucial for creating anthropomorphic conversational agents.
Therefore, we aimed to construct an agent that could openly
converse with users about their emotional problems and generate
responses based on their situation. To this end, we found Liu
et al.’s (23) dataset of emotional support conversations (ESConv)
suitable for this study. This dataset was constructed based on the
Helping Skills Theory (22), in which trained human supporters
leverage appropriate support strategies (e.g., self-disclosure,
affirmation, and suggestions) to provide adequate emotional
support. As the original dataset was curated in English, the
conversations were manually translated into Chinese by trained
professionals for the purpose of this study. Back-translation
procedures (46) were followed to ensure the precision of the
items. Specifically, we asked an English major who also had a
psychology background to translate the English version into
Chinese. Then another student translated back the Chinese
version into English. Then we invited three professionals to
compare, revise and decide on the final translation.
For building the ES-Bot platform, a large-scale Chinese
dialogue model (47) was leveraged as the backbone to build a
strategy-controlled emotional support dialogue model.
Specifically, the model chooses an appropriate support strategy


given the conversation history. Accordingly, it generates
responses that are coherent with the user’s messages and
conform to the chosen strategy. Given the free-flow design of
this platform, as opposed to users choosing pre-defined options
for the conversation, an additional model (48) was trained to
classify whether users’ messages demonstrated signs of suicidal
thoughts to ensure users’ safety. As individuals with the risk of
suicide require immediate professional help, the platform
recommends contact information of relevant authorities when
corresponding signs are detected. Example conversations with
this platform are demonstrated in Figure 3. Similarly, this
platform is also publicly available on WeChat.

### 2.2. Measures

#### 2.2.1. PHQ-9
Participants’ depression was measured with the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (49), the most widely used measure in
psychological depression trials (14, 50). PHQ-9 is a 9-item selfreport questionnaire that measures the frequency and severity of
depressive symptoms over the last two weeks. Participants were
asked to score each item from 1 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every


-----

day). In this study, the internal reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s
alpha) in the pre-test and the post-test were 0.78 and 0.85.

#### 2.2.2. GAD-7
To measure participants’ anxiety, we adopted the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (51), a 7-item questionnaire
assessing the frequency and severity of symptoms, thoughts, and
related behaviors to anxiety within the last two weeks. Like
PHQ-9, participants were required to score each item from 1
(not at all) to 4 (nearly every day). The Cronbach’s alpha of this
scale in the pre-test and the post-test were both 0.84.

#### 2.2.3. PANAS
Participants’ affect was measured by Watson et al.’s (52) 20item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). In this
questionnaire, half of the items represent positive affect (e.g.,
active, enthusiastic, and proud), and the remaining half
corresponds to negative affect (e.g., upset, guilty, and irritable).
All items are scored on a 5-Likert scale, and higher scores
indicate higher levels of affect. The Cronbach’s alpha of the
positive affect dimension in the pre-test and the post-test were
0.88 and 0.82, and 0.85 and 0.82 for the negative affect
dimension at the two-time points.


#### 2.2.4. ISI
The 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; (53)) was used to
measure participants’ perceptions of their insomnia. This
questionnaire assesses the severity of sleep-onset and maintenance
difficulties, their interference with daily functioning, and the degree
of distress caused by sleep problems. Participants were asked to
score each item from 1 (none) to 4 (very severe). The Cronbach’s
alpha of the scale in the pre-test and the post-test were both 0.87.

### 2.3. Participants

Prior to the study, we used G*Power 3.1 to calculate the
required number of participants. We set the large effect size f to
be 0:40 while setting the power (1 � b error probability) and a
error probability to be 0:90 and 0:05, respectively. Thus, the
required number of participants was calculated as 102. An online
poster was made to recruit participants. We asked colleagues and
friends to help release the recruitment information on their
social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo. Participants
who were interested in the study could contact our team based
on the provided information in the advert. The following criteria
were used to recruit participants through online posters:
participants were required to be at least 18 years old, able to use


-----

a smartphone, not currently in therapy as it would interfere with
our study, and not suffering from physical issues such as physical
illness or not taking medicine as they might influence their
psychological state.
A total of 412 participants registered for the intervention,
and 301 met all the above criteria. A research assistant, who
was blinded to the purpose of the study, assigned a code based
on the order that the participants contacted them. Accordingly,
the participants were randomly assigned to three groups:
Emohaa (CBT-Bot), Emohaa (Full), and the control group.
Considering the relatively long waiting time and the potential
number loss in the control group, we randomly allocated 30
more participants to the control group, adopting an
approximate 3:3:4 allocation ratio for the 3 groups. The
current study used a blank control group in which participants
were asked to wait for a month before they would receive
mindfulness intervention.
After signing the consent form, participants were instructed
to take the pre-test (T1) questionnaires, including PHQ-9,
GAD-7, PANAS, and ISI (Section 2.2), and their demographic
information. Sixteen participants were excluded from the study
and referred to relative authorities for professional help as they
were at risk of suicide according to their scores on an item
from PHQ-9 (i.e., “how often have you been bothered by the
thoughts that you would be better off dead or thoughts of


hurting yourself in some way?”), and 38 participants were
excluded because they did not complete the pre-test survey.
Overall, 72 participants in the Emohaa (CBT-Bot) and 70
participants in the Emohaa (Full) completed the pre-test
questionnaires. 105 participants in the control group completed
pre-test questionnaires.
The entire intervention lasted for three consecutive weeks (i.e.,
21 days). Then, one day after the end of the intervention, all the
participants were asked to fill in the post-test (T2) questionnaire,
which included the same items as T1. Additionally, one month
after the end of the experiment, participants were invited to fill
in a follow-up questionnaire (T3) intervention to track the
lasting effect of the intervention. From the perspective of health
ethics and practical reasons, other forms of intervention could
have been provided to the control group after the intervention.
Hence, there were no valid data at T3 for the control group. The
above recruitment process is illustrated in Figure 4.
Of the randomized participants, 54.2% (134/247) went on to
provide partial or complete data at T2. Independent t-tests
analyses did not detect evidence of significant differences at T1
between those who dropped out of the study versus those who
did not on age (t ¼ 1:51; p ¼ 0:132); gender (t ¼ 0:37;
p ¼ 0:709); working tenure (t ¼ 0:92; p ¼ 0:357); PHQ-9
(t ¼ 0:95; p ¼ 0:342); GAD-7 (t ¼ 0:59; p ¼ 0:558); PANAS of
positive (t ¼ 1:02; p ¼ 0:145) and negative (t ¼ 1:21; p ¼ 0:227)


-----

affect scores; or on insomnia (t ¼ 1:17; p ¼ 0:244). Additionally,
we employed MCAR analyses (54) to test whether the data are
missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random
(MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR). The results showed
that Chi-Square ¼ 42.98 (p, 0:001), demonstrating the MCAR
pattern.

### 2.4. Data collection and privacy

#### 2.4.1. Experiment design
As mentioned, the ES-Bot platform allows users to send their
desired text messages and employs a generative model for
producing its responses, as opposed to the template-based
conversations (i.e., providing users with limited conversational
options and producing pre-defined answers) in the CBT-Bot
platform. Due to the existing limitations of generative models,
such as problems with response coherence and fluency, we
believed a direct comparison between the effectiveness of the two
platforms was inappropriate. Therefore, we required participants
in the Emohaa (Full) group to use both platforms and aimed to
study the complementary effect of the ES-Bot platform rather
than analyzing its respective efficacy.
Accordingly, a research assistant informed the participants of
our code of conduct and asked for consent through WeChat.
Participants were assured that their participation was voluntary
and anonymous. All participants were required to complete the
mental distress questionnaires (Section 2.2) at T1 and T2.
Excluding the control group, all participants were instructed to
use the CBT-Bot platform daily, which required completing at
least one automatic thinking exercise and writing a guided
expressive diary. However, participants were encouraged to
complete more exercises for better outcomes. In addition,
participants from the Emohaa (Full) group were tasked to
converse with the ES-Bot platform at least once daily. Each
conversation session was required to last for 5–10 conversational
turns. Participants were encouraged to continue chatting with
the platform if they felt engaged in the conversation. Although
there were no limitations on the conversational topics,
participants were encouraged to talk about two main types of
emotional experiences and problems: Event-based (e.g., breaking
up with a partner, problems with work/study, and nuisance
complaints); Emotion-based (i.e., topics that cause anger,
sadness, anxiety).

#### 2.4.2. Quality control
Participants’ usage of the platform was manually checked
every three days. Those who failed to conform to the
guidelines were notified and required to complete the relative
tasks to ensure high adherence. In addition, conversations with
the ES-Bot platform were analyzed to monitor the chatbot’s
performance and the reliability of the conversations. For
instance, during the first check of this intervention, it was
found that 3/34 participants sent the same message multiple
times to meet the requirements. These participants were


contacted and asked to repeat these conversations to ensure the
experiment’s integrity.

### 2.5. Privacy and ethics statement

Regarding the conversations with Emohaa, participants were
instructed not to share any personal information (e.g., name,
address, and date of birth) that could be used to identify them.
The data collected during the experiment are anonymized, stored
securely, and will be available for research purposes through a
request to the corresponding author. The studies involving
human participants were reviewed and approved by Beijing
Normal University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB Number:
202209150101). Written informed consent to participate in this
study was provided by the participants.

## 3. Results

We used two strategies for analyzing our results. In the main
context, we followed the Intention-To-Treat analysis (ITT)
principle (55) by including all the participants who initially
participated in the research. In the supplemental analyses, we
used completer cases by excluding participants who dropped out
during the intervention period.

### 3.1. User demographics

Demographic information of our studied sample (n ¼ 247) is
provided in Table 1. Overall, the majority of participants were female
(107/134, 79.85%). The average age of the studied sample was 30.90
years old (SD ¼ 7:92). Participants had worked for an average of 7.87
years (SD ¼ 8:45) prior to the experiment. All of the participants were
from Mainland China. As the baseline for participants’ mental distress,
on average, the samples showed moderate ranges of depression
(Mean ¼ 16:43, SD ¼ 5:01), moderate anxiety (Mean ¼ 16:23,
SD ¼ 4:37), and moderate insomnia (Mean ¼ 16:45, SD ¼ 5:38). In
regards to PANAS, participants, on average, demonstrated moderate
levels of positive (Mean ¼ 24:76, SD ¼ 7:20) and negative affect
(Mean ¼ 22:34, SD ¼ 6:35).
We employed ANOVA and chi-squared test to see whether
there were significant differences in baseline variables (age,
gender, education, PHQ-9, GAD-7, PA, NA, Insomnia) among

the three groups. The results showed that the three groups were not
different in terms of baseline demographics of age (F ¼ 2:17,
p ¼ 0:117) and gender (x[2] ¼ 3:56, p ¼ 0:173). Additionally, the
baseline variables of PHQ-9 (F ¼ 2:45, p ¼ 0:088), GAD-7
(F ¼ 0:93, p ¼ 0:396), PA (F ¼ 0:83, p ¼ 0:438), NA (F ¼ 2:82,
p ¼ 0:061), and Insomnia (F ¼ 2:76, p ¼ 0:065) showed no
significant differences among the three groups.

### 3.2. Effects of Emohaa intervention

We used the last observation forward (LOCF) method to
conduct ITT analyses. Previous systematic reviews have shown
that LOCF is one of the most commonly used and relatively
conservative strategies in ITT analysis (56, 57). To investigate
whether the effects of interventions were different from each
other and from that of the control group, we conducted a oneway repeated measures MANOVA with time (two levels: pre-test
and post-test) and group type (three levels: Emohaa (CBT-Bot)
vs. Emohaa (Full) vs. Control) as the independent variables and
the five mental health indicators as the dependent variables.
First, as presented in Table 2, there were significant Group �
Time interaction effects on depression, F[2, 244] ¼ 6:26,
p ¼ 0:002, h[2] ¼ 0:050, indicating a significant difference in
participants’ depression changes among the three groups, and

TABLE 2 Analyses results of variance in mental health outcomes.


such difference had a relatively small effect size that is smaller
than 0.06 (58). Specifically, as Figure 5A shows, the intervention
effects on depression stemmed from decreases in both Emohaa
(CBT-Bot) (t ¼ �2:25, p ¼ 0:027) and Emohaa (Full) group
(t ¼ �2:09, p ¼ 0:040) from pre-test to post-test, but there was
an increase of depression in the control group (t ¼ 2:04,
p ¼ 0:044) from pre-test to post-test. Moreover, we did not find
significant differences between the two types of interventions
(F[1, 140] ¼ 0:76, p ¼ 0:386).
Similarly, we conducted the same MANOVA analyses to test
whether participants’ anxiety changed differently over the
intervention period. The results revealed a main effect of time on
anxiety, F[1, 244] ¼ 27:66, p, 0:001, h[2] ¼ 0:102, indicating
participants’ anxiety decreased over time. As Table 2 shows, the
interaction effect of Group � Time was not significant on
anxiety F[2, 224] ¼ 0:60, p ¼ 0:556, h[2] ¼ 0:006. No significant
differences were found in the effects of the two types of
interventions (F[1, 140] ¼ 0:38, p ¼ 0:538).
Additionally, the results showed that there was no main effect of
time on positive affect (F[1, 244] ¼ 2:39, p ¼ 0:123, h[2] ¼ 0:010)
nor on negative affect (F ¼ 2:88, p ¼ 0:091, h[2] ¼ 0:012), meaning
that participants’ positive affect increased and negative affect did
not change over time. We did not find a significant interaction
effect of Group � Time on positive affect (F[2, 244] ¼ 1:58,
p ¼ 1:208, h[2] ¼ 0:013). The interaction effect of Group � Time

The F-test tests the Condition � Time interaction effect to detect a significant difference among the conditions in the rate of change across time.


-----

was significant on negative affect (F[2, 244] ¼ 6:09, p ¼ 0:003,
h[2] ¼ 0:048). Specifically, as shown in Figure 5B, participants’
negative affect decreased significantly in both Emohaa (CBT-Bot)
(t ¼ �2:20, p ¼ 0:031) and Emohaa (Full) (t ¼ �2:04, p ¼ 0:045)
groups from pre-test to post-test, but their negative affect
significantly increased in the control group (t ¼ 2:11, p ¼ 0:037).
The post-hoc results showed that there were no significantly
different effects of PA (F[1, 140] ¼ 0:01, p ¼ 0:943) and NA
(F[1, 140] ¼ 0:01, p ¼ 0:955) between types of interventions.
Finally, the MANOVA results demonstrated a main effect of time
on participants’ insomnia (F[1, 244] ¼ 4:49, p ¼ 0:035,
h[2] ¼ 0:018), indicating that participants’ insomnia decreased
during the period of intervention. Besides, the results showed a
significant interaction effect of Group � Time on insomnia
(F[2, 244] ¼ 3:69, p ¼ 0:026, h[2] ¼ 0:024), but the differences had
a relatively small effect size that is slightly larger than the small
effect size of.01 (58). Specifically, as Figure 5C reveals, the effects
stemmed from a significant insomnia decrease in the Emohaa
(CBT-Bot) group (t ¼ �2:28, p ¼ 0:026), no significant change of
insomnia in Emohaa (Full) group (t ¼ �2:03, p ¼ 0:055), and no
difference in the control group between the pre-test and post-test
(t ¼ 0:88, p ¼ 0:379). We did not find significantly different effects
of the two types of interventions (F[1, 140] ¼ 0:02, p ¼ 0:936).

#### 3.2.1. Supplemental analyses
We additionally conducted a completer analysis with 134 cases.
Specifically, the results of one-way repeated measures MANOVAs
showed that there were significant Time * Group interaction
effect on depression (F[2, 131] ¼ 19:11, p, 0:001, h[2] ¼ 0:230).
Participants’ depression decreased significantly in both Emohaa
(CBT-Bot) (t ¼ �4:19, p, 0:001) and Emohaa (Full)
(t ¼ �4:05, p, 0:001) groups from pre-test to post-test, but
their depression increased in the control group (t ¼ 2:54,
p ¼ 0:013).
Additionally, the results showed that there was a significant
interaction effect of Time * Group on anxiety (F[2, 131] ¼ 45:04,
p, 0:001, h[2] ¼ 0:260). Participants’ anxiety decreased
significantly in both Emohaa (CBT-Bot) (t ¼ �5:69, p, 0:001)
and Emohaa (Full) (t ¼ �4:53, p, 0:001) groups from pre-test
to post-test, but participants’ anxiety remained unchanged in the
control group (t ¼ �0:39, p ¼ 0:397).
The results showed no interaction effect of Time * Group on
PA (F[2, 131] ¼ 1:85, p ¼ 0:162, h[2] ¼ 0:031), but such effect
existed on NA (F[2, 131] ¼ 12:11, p, 0:001, h[2] ¼ 0:160).
Participants’ NA decreased significantly in both Emohaa (CBTBot) (t ¼ �7:47, p, 0:001) and Emohaa (Full) (t ¼ �2:14,
p ¼ 0:040) groups from pre-test to post-test, but remained
unchanged in the control group (t ¼ 0:26, p ¼ 0:795).
Finally, the results showed that there was a significant
interaction effect of Time and Group on insomnia
(F[2, 131] ¼ 3:52, p ¼ 0:031, h[2] ¼ 0:005). The differences
stemmed from a significant decrease in insomnia for the Emohaa
(CBT-Bot) group (t ¼ �3:84, p, 0:001). Participants’ insomnia
in the Emohaa (Full) group slightly decreased (t ¼ �2:01,
p ¼ 0:053). Participants’ insomnia in the control group did not
change (t ¼ 0:19, p ¼ 0:869).


To conclude, the intervention effects robustly existed in
depression, NA, and insomnia. However, the intervention effects
on anxiety were not significant using the ITT analysis strategy.
The different results on Anxiety may be that the main effect of
time on Anxiety is strong, which means that anxiety declined in
all three groups, and with a stricter analysis strategy of ITT, the
differences among the three groups become less salient. The
intervention effect did not exist on PA, regardless of which
analysis strategy we adopted.
Furthermore, We collected participants’ data on the mental
health indicators (Section 2.2) three weeks after the post-test.
Due to practical reasons that participants in the control group
received other forms of interventions after the post-test, we only
collected two intervention groups’ data. 16 participants in the
Emohaa (CBT-Bot) group and 27 in the Emohaa (Full) group
returned the questionnaires.
To compare the effects between the two intervention groups, we
conducted MANOVA with time (three levels: pre-test, post-test, and
three weeks after post-test) and group type (two levels: CBT-Bot
Emohaa vs. full Emohaa) as the independent variables and the five
mental health indicators as the dependent variables. We also
adopted ITT analysis in comparing the results of the two groups.
Results showed that there were no significant interaction effects of
Time � Group on depression (F[2, 139] ¼ 0:16, p ¼ 0:853,
h[2] ¼ 0:002), anxiety (F[2, 139] ¼ 0:37, p ¼ 0:693, h[2] ¼ 0:003),
positive affect (F[2, 139] ¼ 2:03, p ¼ 0:133, h[2] ¼ 0:014) or
negative affect (F[2, 139] ¼ 1:04, p ¼ 0:354, h[2] ¼ 0:007),
indicating that the changes of participants’ four mental health
indicators did not vary from each other between the two groups.
However, such interaction effect was significant on insomnia
(F[2, 139] ¼ 3:18, p ¼ 0:043, h[2] ¼ 0:022). The difference
stemmed from that participants’ insomnia symptoms returned to
the pre-test level in the Emohaa (CBT-Bot) group. Still,
participants’ insomnia in the Emohaa (Full) group continued
improving after the intervention.

### 3.3. Conversation analysis

During the experiment, participants had 7 conversation sessions
with Emohaa on average (SD ¼ 6:62, Max ¼ 18, Min ¼ 4). These
sessions had a mean of 17 conversational turns (SD ¼ 10:68,
Max ¼ 87, Min ¼ 5). N-gram analysis was used to investigate the
characteristics of participants’ conversations with Emohaa. The
most discussed keywords were found to be 感觉 (feeling; 33%), 工
作 (work; 20%), 心情 (mood; 11%), 学习 (pressure; 10.5%), 朋友
(friends; 9.2%), and 孩子 (children; 7.7%). Percentages indicate
the proportion of conversations that included the keyword. The
main problems that participants wanted to talk about were 工作
环境 (Work environment), 工作压力 (Work pressure), 浪费时间
(Wasting Time), 集中注意力 (Keeping focus), 牺牲休息时
(Sacrificing leisure time), and 转移注意力 (Diverted attention). In
general, participants were mainly interested in 正念冥想 (Mindful
meditation), 早点休息 (Resting early), 身体健康 (Being healthy),
and 提供情绪价值 (Providing emotional value).


-----

### 3.4. Acceptability and feasibility

After the end of the intervention, participants who had used
Emohaa during the experiment were instructed to complete an
additional survey to evaluate the agent’s performance. Most
participants (60/69, 86.9%) reported that they had never received
psychological counseling before the experiment, and only two
had taken psychotropic medication.
Initially, participants were asked to rate the CBT-Bot platform’s
ease of use, provided content, and interface quality on a 10-point
Likert scale. Most participants reported moderate to high levels
of satisfaction (scores ranging from 7 to 10) with the platform’s
functionality (56/69, 81.16%) and the designed exercises (47/69,
68.12%). In addition, more than half of the participants (43/69,
62.32%) were satisfied with the interface design. Overall, the
majority (49/69, 71%) reported that they would recommend this
platform to others.
Similarly, participants who had used Emohaa’s ES-Bot
platform were instructed to rate its performance. This platform
was considered by most of the participants as an appropriate
chatting partner (24/31, 77.42%) and channel for emotional
venting (20/31, 64.5%), and more than half of the participants
(18/31, 58.1%) reported that chatting with this platform made
them feel heard. When asked about their expectations of the
platform, the majority believed it to be a suitable companion for
emotional companionship and support that can accurately
interpret their emotions and provide emotional counseling (21/
31, 67.74%). In addition, more than half of the participants were
satisfied with the interface (20/31, 64.5%) and reported that they
would recommend it to others (19/31, 61.3%). Independent ttests showed that there was no significant difference between
participants’ satisfaction with the Emohaa CBT-Bot platform and
ES-Bot platform (t ¼ 1:16; p ¼ 0:250).
Lastly, participants were asked to provide feedback on their
experience with Emohaa. Table 3 summarizes the most common
themes in the collected responses. The most frequently raised
concerns were technical issues, unclear instructions, and limited
content and choices. The reported technical issues were mainly
regarding the user interface (e.g., “Cannot click the next page” and
“Accidentally closing the app removed all my progress”). Many
participants were overwhelmed with the number of categories in
the guided writing exercises and felt some topics were illogical and
not applicable to real life. Participants also felt that the stories in

TABLE 3 Summary of participants’ feedback on Emohaa.


the automatic thinking exercises were excessive while there were
not enough options to describe their mood and emotions after
completing the exercise. Moreover, it was suggested that the
dialogue options in the platform’s template were inadequate.
Issues regarding the performance of the ES-Bot platform were
also raised. Several participants reported that the conversations
were rigid, and the system needed user guidance to continue the
conversation. In some instances, the generated responses were
reported as irrelevant or incoherent to the conversation.
Participants also highlighted the platform’s occasional inability to
remember what had been said in the early stages of the
conversation, initiate conversation topics, and understand various
input types (i.e., audio, video, and image).
In addition, participants were also asked to provide suggestions
on how to improve Emohaa. As concerns regarding lack of content
and options were mentioned, it was suggested that additional
scenarios, stories, instructions, and options be included in the
CBT-Bot platform. The importance of regularly updating the
platform and promptly fixing technical issues was also
highlighted. Regarding the ES-Bot platform, nearly half of the
participants (14/31, 45.1%) believed that improvements for
making the generated responses less rigid were necessary. It was
also suggested that support for different input types be added to
create a more interactive and engaging experience. Many also
believed that recommending mental health-related content
during conversations and taking the initiative in conversations
would benefit this platform.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1. Main findings

The obtained results demonstrated Emohaa’s efficacy as a
short-term intervention for depression, negative affect, and
insomnia. Based on the survey results, users experienced reduced
levels of mental distress in the measured categories after using
Emohaa. Compared to the control group, there was a significant
decrease in depression among the participants who used
Emohaa, as measured by the PHQ-9 questionnaire. Similarly, as
measured by the PANAS and the ISI questionnaires, their
negative affect and insomnia were also considerably reduced.
Therefore, as shown by the experimental results, Emohaa can be
seen as an effective tool for mental health support.
Regarding the difference in outcomes between the two groups
that used Emohaa, no significant differences were found in the
short term. Both interventions effectively relieved individuals’
mental health symptoms. However, as provided by the
supplemental analyses (Section 3.2.1), participants who used the
ES-Bot platform showed comparatively fewer indicators of
insomnia. This finding highlights a potential benefit of emotional
venting in improving problems regarding sleep in the long term.
Based on the obtained feedback, most participants were
satisfied with this agent and considered recommending it to
others. In line with previous research (16, 17), the results of the
conversation analysis indicated that participants were willing to

-----

self-disclose their emotional problems, as shown by their most
discussed keywords and topics. Moreover, most participants
considered Emohaa’s ES-Bot platform a chatting partner that can
effectively listen to their problems and provide a channel for
them to vent their emotions. Notably, the majority felt that this
platform could understand their emotions, an essential feature of
conversational agents for support and a crucial trait for
establishing a therapeutic connection (26). Therefore, our
findings suggest that Emohaa can also be seen as an acceptable
and feasible tool for support.
In addition to highlighting Emohaa’s effectiveness in mental
health support, this study demonstrated the potential of
generative conversational agents and combining emotional and
cognitive support to reduce mental distress symptoms. Our
findings suggest that allowing users to converse about their
desired topics with the agent freely has a complementary effect
when added to more common forms of machine-based support
(i.e., template-based conversations and exercises for cognitive
support through CBT).

### 4.2. Limitations and future work

This study had several limitations regarding its design and
methodology. The study duration was limited; thus, only two
assessments of participants’ mental distress were made. Although
a follow-up screening for participants that had used Emohaa
during the experiment was conducted, no data regarding the
control group’s participants were gathered as they might have
received other interventions after the initial two-week screening.
Furthermore, the number of remaining participants in the
follow-up survey is inadequate to draw a conclusion that the
conversational agent (ES-Bot) is better than the CBT-Bot. Future
studies would benefit from collecting more data from the three
groups in the follow-up surveys to support the complementary
effects of generative dialogue platforms for emotional support.
It is believed that the number of participants was sufficient to
demonstrate the preliminary effects of employing conversational
agents for mental health support in theory. However, the sample
size and the experiment duration are inadequate for generalizing
the obtained results of this study to the public. Future
experiments will include a larger sample size and longer study
duration to further ensure the generalizability of Emohaa’s
effectiveness in reducing mental distress. In addition, our
adopted method of advertisement for this study could have
introduced a bias in our recruitment process, in which
individuals who were in some way connected to our helping
colleagues and friends were more likely to participate in the
study. This could have also affected the male-to-female ratio
among the participants, leading to the over-representation of
female participants in our sample.
As mentioned, Emohaa’s several technical issues could
substantially impact the users’ perceived level of empathy and
support (14), so they should be resolved promptly. A
management system for addressing similar issues on time should
also be implemented in future work. Moreover, several


participants raised issues regarding Emohaa’s limited content
(i.e., exercises and options) and unclear instructions. Similar to
Liu et al. (26), a wider variety of psychological resources will be
consulted in future work to expand the provided content in the
CBT-Bot platform and revise the instructions to avoid user
misinterpretations or confusion. Lastly, although our
requirements regarding the daily usage of this platform could be
applicable in a trial, such constraints are not practical in real-life
applications. Hence, future work could further improve user
engagement within machine-based interventions.
Regarding the ES-Bot platform, several reported instances
suggested that Emohaa forgets the information in previous turns
and that the generated responses are irrelevant to the context,
which could impair user engagement and rapport. This is a wellknown issue in current language models (59), and the main
reason could be the limited number of words in the model’s
input (128 words for Emohaa). A feasible approach to address
this issue is to add a module that could summarize the essential
information of the previous turns in the conversation (60). In
addition, previous work has demonstrated the benefits of adding
persona (61–63) and commonsense knowledge (64, 65) for
improving user experience with generative conversational agents.
Future work could explore these additions to study their efficacy
and corresponding improvements in mental health support.

### 4.3. Conclusions

The present study introduced Emohaa, a Chinese
conversational agent for mental health support. Emohaa employs
CBT principles to provide cognitive support through templatebased guided conversations for expressive writing and automatic
thinking exercises. In addition, it includes a platform for
providing emotional support in which users can discuss their
desired emotional problems. This study examined the
effectiveness of Emohaa in reducing mental distress and
investigated its feasibility and acceptability as a tool for mental
health support in China. Our findings demonstrated that
participants experienced fewer symptoms of mental distress after
using Emohaa for the duration of the study. Hence, we believe
this agent could serve as a valuable tool for reducing users’
mental distress, namely depression, negative affect, and insomnia.
In addition, we found that there might be a complementary
effect on long-term insomnia when implementing the generative
dialogue platform for emotional support. This finding highlights
the potential of generative conversational agents for the future of
mental health support. In the future, we hope our work can
inspire other studies to expand upon our research, leverage
generative models for providing support, and investigate their
comparative efficacy.
