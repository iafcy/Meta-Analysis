### Abstract

**Background:** Depression and anxiety frequently coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain and can negatively impact patients’
responses to standard orthopedic treatments. Nevertheless, mental health is not routinely addressed in the orthopedic care setting.
If effective, a digital mental health intervention may be a feasible and scalable method of addressing mental health in an orthopedic
setting.
**Objective:** We aimed to compare 2-month changes in mental and physical health between orthopedic patients who received a
digital mental health intervention in addition to usual orthopedic care, those who received usual orthopedic care only (without a
specific mental health intervention), and those who received in-person care with a psychologist as part of their orthopedic treatment
plan.
**Methods:** In this single-center retrospective cohort study involving ancillary analysis of a pilot feasibility study, 2-month
self-reported health changes were compared between a cohort of orthopedic patients who received access to a digital mental
health intervention (Wysa) and 2 convenience sample comparison cohorts (patients who received usual orthopedic care without
a specific mental health intervention and patients who received in-person care with a psychologist as part of their orthopedic
treatment plan). All patients were 18 years or older and reported elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety at an orthopedic
clinic visit (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression or Anxiety score ≥55). The
digital intervention was a multi-component mobile app that used chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors
to provide cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features, with an emphasis on behavioral
activation and pain acceptance. Outcomes of interest were between-cohort differences in the 2-month longitudinal changes in
PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores (primary outcomes) and PROMIS Pain Interference and Physical Function scores
(secondary outcomes).
**Results:** Among 153 patients (mean age 55, SD 15 years; 128 [83.7%] female; 51 patients per cohort), patients who received
the digital mental health intervention showed clinically meaningful improvements at the 2-month follow-up for all PROMIS
measures (mean longitudinal improvement 2.8-3.7 points; _P≤.02). After controlling for age and BMI, the improvements in_

PROMIS Depression, Pain Interference, and Physical Function were meaningfully greater than longitudinal changes shown by
patients who received usual orthopedic care (mean between-group difference 2.6-4.8 points; P≤.04). Improvements in PROMIS
Physical Function were also meaningfully greater than longitudinal changes shown by patients who received in-person psychological
counseling (mean between-group difference 2.4 points; P=.04).
**Conclusions:** Patients who received a digital mental health intervention as part of orthopedic care reported greater 2-month
mean improvements in depression, pain interference, and physical function than patients who received usual orthopedic care.
They also reported a greater mean improvement in physical function and comparable improvements in depression, anxiety, and
pain interference compared with orthopedic patients who received in-person psychological counseling.

### Introduction

##### Background

Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with
chronic musculoskeletal pain. When this occurs, traditional
mental health treatments are less effective in reducing
psychological impairment, and traditional musculoskeletal
treatments are less effective in addressing physical symptoms

[1-5]. Specifically within the field of orthopedic care,
pre-existing symptoms of depression or anxiety are associated
with poor outcomes, such as worse postintervention physical
functioning, increased postoperative opioid use, and reduced
return-to-work rates [6-8]. Awareness of this phenomenon is
growing, but mental health screening and intervention is still
not considered a standard part of orthopedic care [9]. Barriers
include orthopedic providers’lack of time and available mental
health resources to offer; patients’ financial resources,
transportation, time, and stigma-related barriers to seeking
mental health care, especially in person; and a national shortage
of qualified mental health providers [9-11].

A digital mental health intervention is a promising tool to
improve access to mental health care because it is not affected
by many of the barriers that limit in-person care. That is,
providers can easily refer patients to a digital resource because
it is not limited by physical location or wait times, and patient
challenges related to transportation, time, and fear of stigma are
reduced and, in some cases, eliminated by enabling access to
care without requiring travel to an in-person provider [12,13].
Furthermore, in a single-arm prospective pilot study, we
demonstrated that delivery of a digital mental health intervention
(Wysa) within an outpatient orthopedic care setting is feasible
and preliminary effectiveness analyses are promising [14].

Outside the orthopedic setting, existing evidence supports the
effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, but the effect
size varies depending on the comparison arm, for instance, an
inactive “usual care” or waitlist control group, or an active “gold
standard” in-person counseling treatment group [15-17].
Therefore, the literature repeatedly calls for more comparison
between digital mental health interventions and real-world
treatment alternatives, both in the general population of people
with symptoms of depression and anxiety and in those with
coexisting symptoms of chronic pain [12,18-21]. To further
understand the potential for introducing a digital mental health


intervention within the context of orthopedic care, clinical
improvements observed in our pilot study need to be compared
to improvements made by comparable patients who received
usual orthopedic care (without a dedicated mental health
intervention) and by patients who received in-person mental
health care as part of their orthopedic treatment plan. This added
information would provide insight regarding whether a digital
mental health intervention provides added clinical benefit
compared with usual orthopedic care, and if so, whether that
benefit is less than, equivalent to, or even superior to in-person
mental health care that is offered in a similar setting.

##### Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare 2-month changes in
mental and physical health between orthopedic patients who
received a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in addition
to usual orthopedic care, those who received usual orthopedic
care only (without any specific mental health intervention), and
those who received in-person care with a psychologist as part
of their orthopedic treatment plan. We hypothesized that
compared with patients who received usual care, orthopedic
patients who were also provided a digital mental health
intervention would report greater improvements in mental and
physical health at a 2-month follow-up. Additionally, we
hypothesized that compared with orthopedic patients who
established in-person care with a psychologist, orthopedic
patients who were provided a digital mental health intervention
would report comparable improvements in mental and physical
health at a 2-month follow-up.

### Methods

##### Study Design

This was a retrospective study that involved ancillary analysis
of data collected from a single-arm pilot feasibility study and
other existing medical record data (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT04640090) [14]. All patients were evaluated within the
orthopedic department of a single tertiary care academic medical
center (Washington University) in the United States between
2017 and 2021.

##### Ethics Approval

Washington University institutional review board approval was
obtained prior to data collection (IRB #202005219).

##### Participants

 General Eligibility Criteria

All study participants were adults aged 18 years or older who
presented to a nonoperative subspecialty-trained orthopedic
provider for evaluation and management of musculoskeletal
pain. As part of usual care, all patients who present to the
orthopedic department of the study institution complete
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety measures prior to clinician
evaluation. Only patients who self-reported elevated symptoms
of depression or anxiety, as defined by scores of 55 or above
on either measure or both measures, were eligible.

##### Digital Mental Health Intervention (Wysa) Cohort

The primary cohort of interest included patients who enrolled
in a single-arm, prospective cohort, pilot feasibility study in
which they received 2 months of complimentary access to a
digital mental health intervention (Wysa), in addition to their
usual orthopedic care. The intervention and this cohort have
previously been described [14]. In brief, Wysa is a
multi-component mobile app based on the principles of cognitive
behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and motivational interviewing

[22-24]. It includes an artificial intelligence–based “chatbot”
conversational agent and text-based access to human “coach”
counselors who have master’s degrees in psychology. A
commercial version of the app exists, but for the pilot study,
additional novel features were incorporated to specifically tailor
the experience for people with chronic pain. Additional features
were based on the principles of behavioral activation and pain
acceptance [25-30]. These patients were recruited for the pilot
study between December 8, 2020, and July 14, 2021. Patients
who were planning to start in-person psychological treatment
were excluded from the pilot study, and only 51 of 61 (84%)
enrolled patients who completed 2-month PROMIS follow-up
assessments were eligible for this ancillary analysis. While the
majority of patients engaged with the intervention multiple
times during the study period [14], lack of engagement with the
intervention was not an exclusion criterion.

##### Usual Orthopedic Care Cohort

The Wysa cohort was compared to a “usual orthopedic care”
cohort, which was a convenience sample of patients who
presented to the same orthopedic clinics as those who enrolled
in the prospective Wysa study but on days during which
recruitment for the Wysa study was not occurring. In these
clinics, “usual orthopedic care” most commonly includes
physical therapy, medications (eg, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, oral steroids, and neuropathic pain
medications), and steroid injections, as appropriate. Other less
commonly recommended procedures include radiofrequency
ablation, manual massage, and acupuncture. These patients
could have been presenting for a new or follow-up evaluation
(just like in the Wysa cohort), but their orthopedic management
plan could not have included any dedicated mental health
management, such as counseling or a digital intervention.
Furthermore, follow-up PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores
had to be documented in the medical record between 1 and 3
months after the initial evaluation. If scores from multiple dates


were available, the scores closest to a 2-month follow-up
duration were selected for analysis. Patients who presented for
an acute injury or a procedure were excluded. Patients in this
cohort were identified consecutively via a reverse chronological
medical record review until a sample size of 51 patients
(matching the Wysa cohort) was reached. As a result, the
baseline clinic date for patients in this cohort spanned September
16, 2021, to December 10, 2021, with a mean follow-up time
of 56 (SD 9) days.

##### In-Person Psychological Counseling (“Gold Standard”) Cohort

The Wysa cohort was also compared to a “gold standard” cohort
that received in-person psychological counseling as part of the
orthopedic treatment plan. This was also a convenience sample
of patients who presented to the same orthopedic clinics as those
who enrolled in the prospective Wysa study. However, as part
of their orthopedic treatment plan, they initiated in-person
psychological counseling with a licensed clinical psychologist
having over 20 years of experience. The psychologist delivered
cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and
mindfulness and deep breathing training, as indicated, during
treatment sessions. This unique service was available through
a lifestyle medicine–based center within the study institution’s
orthopedic department [31]. The center’s purpose is to help
patients manage musculoskeletal conditions by addressing
underlying lifestyle habits and biopsychosocial comorbidities
that contribute to musculoskeletal pain. To be eligible for this
study, patients in this cohort had to have completed their
evaluation with the psychologist within 2 weeks of completing
baseline PROMIS Depression and Anxiety measures, and they
had to have completed at least one follow-up session with the
psychologist prior to the follow-up date designated for this
study. For patients with PROMIS scores at numerous time
points, scores obtained closest to the initial psychology
evaluation and to a 2-month follow-up duration were selected
for analysis. Patients were identified consecutively via a reverse
chronological medical record review until a sample size of 51
patients (matching the Wysa cohort) was reached. As a result,
the baseline clinic date for patients in this cohort spanned August
21, 2017, to September 20, 2021, with a mean follow-up time
point of 62 (SD 19) days later.

##### Variables

As previously described, PROMIS scores from the Wysa cohort
were collected prospectively during the pilot feasibility study.
The rest of the data from all 3 cohorts were obtained from a
medical record review of information collected as standard care
during patients’ clinical encounters. All data extraction from
patients’medical records was performed by a single study team
member (AJL). Patients’ self-reported mental and physical
health was measured using the PROMIS Computer Adaptive
Test (CAT) Adult Depression v1.0, Anxiety v1.0, Pain
Interference v1.1, and Physical Function v2.0 measures [32-36].
PROMIS scores were normalized to the general US population,
with a mean of 50 and SD of 10. Higher scores represent “more”
of the domain [37]. For example, high scores on PROMIS
Depression are unfavorable, but high scores on PROMIS
Physical Function are favorable. Descriptive variables collected


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Leo et al


included demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and Area
Deprivation Index [38,39]), BMI, pain location and duration,
and medical history (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease,
lung disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety).

##### Outcomes

The primary outcomes were the between-cohort differences in
2-month longitudinal change in PROMIS Depression and
Anxiety scores. The secondary outcomes were the
between-cohort differences in 2-month longitudinal change in
PROMIS Pain Interference and Physical Function scores.
Minimum clinically meaningful effect sizes were a priori set to
match thresholds used in the pilot feasibility study, which were
determined from previously published literature in
conservatively managed orthopedic patients with chronic
musculoskeletal pain. Minimum meaningful effect sizes were
defined as at least 3.2 points on PROMIS Depression, 3.0 points
on PROMIS Anxiety, 2.0 points on PROMIS Pain Interference,
and 2.2 points on PROMIS Physical Function [40-42].
Between-cohort differences in baseline descriptive variables
were examined, as well.

##### Statistical Analysis

Univariate descriptive statistics per cohort were calculated for
all baseline study variables. Differences between the “digital
mental health intervention” cohort and each of the 2 comparison
cohorts (“usual orthopedic care” and “in-person psychological
counseling”) were calculated as either mean differences via
Welch 2-sample t tests or percentage differences via 2-sample
_t tests for equality of proportions with Yates’ continuity_
correction. Average within-person changes in PROMIS scores
in each cohort were calculated using paired t tests. Comparisons
of the 2-month change in PROMIS scores between the “digital
mental health intervention” cohort and each of the 2 comparison
cohorts were assessed with linear mixed models. Mean
longitudinal changes in health were estimated via slope
coefficients, and comparisons of slopes were tested with time
by cohort interaction terms. Initially, age and BMI (as a marker
for metabolic health) were added to the models as covariates


because these baseline characteristics were different between
cohorts. However, these adjustments failed to alter the models
in a statistically or clinically meaningful way, so unadjusted
models are reported. Missing baseline descriptive data were
omitted from relevant analyses. One participant in the “in-person
psychological counseling” cohort was missing the follow-up
PROMIS Depression score. Median imputation was performed
for this single value. Significance was a priori set at P<.05. The
sample size for each cohort was set to match the available
sample size of the Wysa cohort. Data were collected using
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [43,44], and
statistical analyses were performed using R (v4.0.2, R Core
Team).

### Results

##### Patient Characteristics

Of the 153 patients included, the mean age was 55 (SD 15)
years (range 18-86 years), and 128 (83.7%) were female.
Compared with the cohort that received usual orthopedic care,
patients who received the digital mental health intervention
(Wysa) had a higher prevalence of sleep apnea (14/51, 27% vs
5/50, 10%; percent difference 18%, 95% CI 1%-34%; P=.05),
but otherwise, had similar demographic, musculoskeletal, and
medical characteristics (Table 1). Compared with the cohort
that received in-person counseling, patients who received the
digital mental health intervention were somewhat younger (mean
age 53.2 vs 59.5 years; mean difference −6.4 years, 95% CI
−12.0 to −0.4; P=.03), were less likely to have low back pain
(28/51, 55% vs 42/51, 82%; percent difference −28%, 95% CI
−47% to −8%; P=.006), had a lower BMI (indicative of obesity;
mean 29.1 kg/m[2] vs 38.1 kg/m[2]; mean difference −9.0, 95% CI
−12.1 to −6.0; _P<.001), and had a lower prevalence of both_
hypertension (21/50, 42% vs 36/47, 77%; percent difference
−35%, 95% CI −55% to −14%; P=.001) and sleep apnea (14/51,
27% vs 28/50, 56%; percent difference −29%, 95% CI −49%
to −8%; P=.007). There were no meaningful between-cohort
differences in the proportion of patients who had a documented
diagnosis of depression or anxiety.

##### Primary Outcomes: Mental Health

On average, patients who received the digital mental health
intervention showed clinically meaningful improvements in
PROMIS Depression (mean longitudinal change −3.5 points,
95% CI −5.9 to −1.1; P=.006) and Anxiety (−3.7 points, 95%
CI −5.9 to −1.4; _P=.002) scores at the 2-month follow-up,_
whereas patients who received usual orthopedic care did not
show clinically meaningful improvements in these measures,
and patients who received in-person psychological counseling
only showed meaningful improvements in PROMIS Depression
scores (−3.8 points, 95% CI −5.9 to −1.6; P=.001) (Table 2).


Furthermore, patients who received the digital mental health
intervention showed meaningfully greater mean improvements
in PROMIS Depression (but not Anxiety) scores than patients
who received usual orthopedic care (mean between-group
difference −4.8 points, 95% CI −7.6 to −1.9; P=.001), and there
were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful
between-group differences in longitudinal improvements in
PROMIS Depression or Anxiety scores between patients who
received the digital mental health intervention and those who
received in-person psychological counseling (Table 3; Figures
1 and 2). Adjusting for age and BMI did not have a statistically
or clinically meaningful effect on these results.

Interference, and 2.2 points for Physical Function [40-42].

##### Secondary Outcomes: Physical Health

On average, patients who received the digital mental health
intervention showed clinically meaningful improvements in
PROMIS Pain Interference (mean longitudinal change −2.8
points, 95% CI −5.2 to −0.4; P=.02) and Physical Function (3.3
points, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.4; _P=.002) scores at the 2-month_
follow-up, whereas patients who received usual orthopedic care
or in-person psychological counseling in conjunction with usual
orthopedic care did not show meaningful improvements in these
measures (Table 2). Furthermore, patients who received the


digital mental health intervention showed meaningfully greater
mean improvements in PROMIS Pain Interference scores than
patients who received usual orthopedic care (mean
between-group difference −2.6 points, 95% CI −5.1 to −0.2;
_P=.04), and they showed meaningfully greater mean_
improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores than
patients in either comparison cohort (mean between-group
differences 2.4-2.7 points; P=.02 to .04) (Table 3; Figures 3 and
4). Adjusting for age and BMI did not have a statistically or
clinically meaningful effect on these results.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

To understand the potential benefit of introducing a digital
mental health intervention in the context of orthopedic care for
patients with coexisting symptoms of depression or anxiety, it
is necessary to understand (1) the added clinical benefit of this
intervention compared with usual orthopedic care, and (2) the
clinical benefit of this intervention relative to the benefit
achieved via usual orthopedic care supplemented by in-person
counseling with a psychologist. In this retrospective cohort
study, compared with patients who received usual orthopedic
care, patients who also received a digital mental health
intervention reported meaningfully greater 2-month mean
improvements in depression (mean PROMIS between-group
difference −4.8 points, 95% CI −7.6 to −1.9; _P=.001), pain_
interference (−2.6 points, 95% CI −5.1 to −0.2; _P=.04), and_
physical function (2.7 points, 95% CI 0.5 to 5.0; _P=.02)._
Compared with patients who initiated in-person psychological
counseling as part of their orthopedic treatment plan, patients
who received a digital mental health intervention reported a
meaningfully greater mean improvement in physical function
(2.4 points, 95% CI 0.2 to 4.7; _P=.04) and comparable_
improvements in depression, anxiety, and pain interference.
These between-group differences were present even after
controlling for baseline between-group differences in age and
BMI.

##### Strengths and Limitations

This study adds clinical context to our previously reported
finding that it is feasible to deliver a digital mental health
intervention in the setting of orthopedic care [14]. In other
words, the primary strength of this study is the comparison of


outcomes between orthopedic patients who received a digital
mental health intervention, a “usual care” cohort, and a “gold
standard” in-person psychological counseling cohort, especially
because psychological counseling is still rarely prescribed in
the context of orthopedic care.

The primary study limitations relate to the retrospective design
and between-cohort baseline differences. Nonrandomized study
designs have inherent limitations that can affect results. These
include possible selection bias, differential attrition, regression
to the mean, effects by unmeasured confounding variables (eg,
concomitant orthopedic and mental health interventions),
potential undetected interaction effects, and temporal/historical
bias. Because patients who received the digital mental health
intervention were actively enrolled into the research study while
comparison cohorts were retrospectively selected as convenience
samples, the digital intervention cohort could have been subject
to healthy participant bias (in which increased activation in their
health care could have contributed to greater health-related
improvements). Furthermore, only 51 of 61 participants who
completed 2-month follow-up measures in the digital
intervention prospective study could be included in this
longitudinal analysis, which also could have contributed to
healthy participant bias. Additionally, the “usual orthopedic
care” cohort could have been biased toward patients who were
not showing satisfactory improvements and therefore returned
to the clinic for a follow-up visit to determine the next steps.
Similarly, it is possible that patients who received in-person
psychological counseling as part of their orthopedic treatment
plan had more “treatment-resistant” symptoms than patients in
the other cohorts because in our experience, patients who choose
this biopsychosocial lifestyle medicine approach to orthopedic
care report feeling “at the end of their rope” and have often
already tried many standard orthopedic treatments. A

difference-in-differences quasiexperimental design was adopted,
rather than propensity score matching, so that baseline
between-group differences could be explored and because the
number of potentially eligible patients for the in-person
psychological counseling cohort was limited. Nevertheless, the
vast majority of baseline characteristics were not significantly
different between the cohorts, and baseline PROMIS scores for
the digital intervention cohort were comparable (and at times
worse) than the comparison cohorts, which would suggest that
the digital intervention cohort was not experiencing less severe
symptoms at baseline. While worse baseline scores provide
more “room to improve,” the digital intervention cohort did not
have worse baseline scores for any of the between-group
differences that were found to be statistically significant.

Finally, generalizability is a limitation of this single-center study
conducted at a tertiary care center. In order for a digital mental
health intervention to be feasibly offered in an orthopedic
setting, clinical providers need to support the initiative, and
mental health screening needs to be a standard part of a patient’s
evaluation, as is the case at the study institution.

##### Comparison With Prior Work

Our findings are consistent with previous large randomized
controlled trials and meta-analyses that have demonstrated the
effectiveness of digital interventions for improving symptoms
of depression, anxiety, and even pain-related impairment in
people with chronic pain who have been recruited from pain
management clinics, primary care clinics, and
community/internet referral sources [20,21,45-47]. To our
knowledge, though, this is the first study to specifically evaluate
the effectiveness of a digital mental health intervention that was
introduced in the setting of an orthopedic clinic, which is not
typically a setting where mental health is a focus. We find it
encouraging that, similar to studies of participants among the
general population, orthopedic patients who received a digital
mental health intervention reported favorable mental and
physical health outcomes compared with those who received
no active mental health treatment and at least comparable
outcomes to those who initiated in-person care with a
psychologist [15-17,48]. Our results add to the body of literature
showing that the impact of pain on a person’s daily functioning
and quality of life (ie, pain interference) can be improved by
cognitive behavioral techniques, such as cognitive restructuring
and addressing maladaptive thought patterns, regardless of the
person’s level of physical function [49,50]. However, it was

##### Acknowledgments


somewhat surprising that patients in this study who received
usual orthopedic care did not make meaningful improvements
in physical health. This could be related to (1) the inherent
characteristics of nonoperative orthopedic patients who have
multiple orthopedic clinic visits within a span of 2 months (eg,
to address persistently bothersome symptoms), and (2) the
difficulty of treating chronic pain (many years), especially when
the interplay between mental health and chronic pain has not
been sufficiently addressed. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that
patients who received the digital mental health intervention
made physical, as well as mental, health improvements even
when the usual orthopedic care cohort did not.

##### Directions for Future Study

Further investigation regarding the effectiveness of incorporating
a digital mental health intervention into orthopedic care should
include (1) a longer follow-up duration because depression and
anxiety are chronic conditions; (2) dedicated evaluation of the
intervention’s impact on sleep because pain and insomnia
reciprocally affect each other and because digital cognitive
behavioral interventions can be effective for insomnia [51-53];
and (3) more detailed information regarding concomitant
orthopedic and mental health interventions, which are pursued
during the intervention period. To obtain further insight, a fully
powered, prospective, randomized controlled trial is needed.

##### Conclusions

Patients who received a digital mental health intervention as
part of their orthopedic care reported greater 2-month mean
improvements in depression, pain interference, and physical
function than patients who received usual orthopedic care
without any specific mental health intervention. They also
reported a greater mean improvement in physical function and
comparable improvements in depression, anxiety, and pain
interference compared with patients who initiated in-person
psychological counseling as part of their orthopedic treatment
plan. These differences met clinically meaningful thresholds
and suggest that when orthopedic patients endorse elevated
symptoms of depression or anxiety, incorporation of a digital
mental health intervention into orthopedic care may improve
patients’ physical and mental health outcomes relative to
standard orthopedic care. Furthermore, improvements may be
comparable to those achieved on incorporation of in-person
psychological counseling. These retrospective findings warrant
further investigation using a prospective randomized design.
